Given sex workers&#x02019; high mobile phone usage, repeated exposure to short messaging service (SMS) messages could address individual and interpersonal barriers to contraceptive uptake and better nutrition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this two-arm cluster randomised trial, each arm constitutes an equal-attention control group for the other. SMS messages were developed systematically, participatory and theory-driven and cover either sexual and reproductive health (WHISPER) or nutrition (SHOUT). Messages are sent to participants 2&#x02013;3 times/week for 12 months and include fact-based and motivational content as well as role model stories. Participants can send reply texts to obtain additional information. Sex work venues (clusters) in Mombasa, Kenya, were randomly sampled with a probability proportionate to venue size. Up to 10 women were recruited from each venue to enrol 860 women. FSWs aged 16&#x02013;35 years, who owned a mobile phone and were not pregnant at enrolment were eligible. Structured questionnaires, pregnancy tests, HIV and syphilis rapid tests and full blood counts were performed at enrolment, with subsequent visits at 6 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The primary outcomes of WHISPER and SHOUT are unintended pregnancy incidence and prevalence of anaemia at 12 months, respectively. Each will be compared between study groups using discrete-time survival analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential limitations</title><p>Contamination may occur if participants discuss their intervention with those in the other trial arm. This is mitigated by cluster recruitment and only sampling a small proportion of sex work venues from the sampling frame.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The design allows for the simultaneous testing of two independent mHealth interventions for which messaging frequency and study procedures are identical. This trial may guide future mHealth initiatives and provide methodological insights into use of reciprocal control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12616000852459; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Community Gynaecology</kwd><kwd>Anaemia</kwd><kwd>International Health Services</kwd><kwd>Public Health</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use of a cluster-RCT with reciprocal controls allows for the simultaneous testing of two mHealth interventions, for which message frequency and study processes are identical; only the content of the messages differs.&#x000a0;The design mitigates biases from unequal attention in trial groups, positive expectations and non-blinding. Moreover, the approach&#x000a0;is efficient, using considerably fewer resources than two independent trials.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contamination may occur if women receiving SRH messages share them or discuss their content with women in the nutrition arm, and vice versa. Contamination would diminish the ability to detect a difference in effectiveness between the two groups. Cluster-based intervention allocation could limit this, though FSWs often work from multiple venues. In addition, we recruited only a small proportion of sex workers across a large geographic area (up to 106 of 760 hot spots, and 860 of an estimated 8,516 FSWs), which diminishes the chances of interaction between trial arms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A further limitation of this design is that the outcomes of the interventions may interact. While the two health domains were chosen due to the minimal overlap between behaviours, there are some plausible points of influence between the arms. For example, higher rates of pregnancy in the nutrition arm may lower haemoglobin and iron levels in these women. More generally, those receiving messages on one aspect of health may improve their health behaviours across multiple health domains, potentially diluting the effect measures of the comparison between the study arms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The SRH intervention aims to increase demand for contraceptives, and translating demand into raised coverage may be limited by deficiencies in the health system (supply-side issues).

If found to be effective, mHealth for SRH could complement and increase the effectiveness of the current service packages provided for sex workers.</p><p>Similarly, the need to improve nutrition for women in poor and vulnerable settings, and the paucity of data on FSWs&#x02019; nutritional health, led to the development of the SMS intervention to improve nutritional Heath OUTcomes (SHOUT).

Participants are able to text assigned codes at any time during the study to access the pull messages, with SMS costs incurred by the study (no charge for participants). Content is only accessible to enrolled participants in the relevant intervention group, so that those in the nutrition arm cannot directly access SRH messages and vice versa.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> presents a summary of the structure of the interventions, showing that they are essentially equivalent in all structural components except the on-demand system. This discrepancy is due to additional pull messages in WHISPER that provide information about SRH services, allowing participants to link in with local sex worker-sensitive providers. This was deemed important on ethical grounds given the sensitive content of the WHISPER intervention and because promotion of contraception can only impact pregnancy rates if delivered alongside accessible services that provide the methods in question. In contrast, the promotion of healthy eating does not require an intermediate service utilisation step to result in improved nutritional outcomes. Furthermore, low-cost or free nutrition services are not widely available in Mombasa, and screening asymptomatic non-pregnant women for anaemia is rarely practised, so we were unable to reliably list relevant services for SHOUT.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number, length and timing of messages for each study arm</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Message type</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of messages</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Timing</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Push messages</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82 (both arms)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up to 160 characters (1 SMS &#x02018;screen&#x02019;)*</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Three per week (Monday, Wednesday and Saturday mornings) during months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13<sup>&#x02020;</sup>

The data analysis team will be blinded to the allocation of participants. Given the interval-censored nature of unintended pregnancy incidence, discrete-time survival models using generalised linear modelling will be used to compare unintended pregnancy incidence between the two trial arms.

Women aged 16 and 17 years are considered mature minors and able to consent without involving parents and guardians, due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter. Informed consent forms are available in both Kiswahili and English and describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed and the risks and benefits of participation. Most importantly, we are aware of the risk that others seeing the messages may infer that the participant is a sex worker. It is important to mitigate this risk of unintentional disclosure of sex work status and consequent stigma or other adverse events for participants.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> Participants have been counselled about the need for care to be taken to ensure that others do not have access to their phones. The study team also asks that participants report instances of unintentional disclosure. Such reporting allows us to provide support to the women concerned and, through understanding the events surrounding the case, try to find ways to avoid future occurrences.</p><p>Ethical approvals have been obtained for protocol version 1.2, dated 22 August 2016 from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC&#x02014;CF16/1552&#x02014;2016000812) and the Kenyatta National Hospital, University of Nairobi Ethics and Research Committee (KNH-UoN ERC&#x02014;KNH-ERC/RR/493).</p><p>Several dissemination activities are planned, including to health workers and the district office, Kenyan policymakers, at local and international conferences and in academic publications.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Potential impact and significance</title><p>The WHISPER study responds to the pressing need for effective and evidence-informed interventions to prevent unintended pregnancies among vulnerable women in resource-constrained settings. Persistent unmet need for family planning contributed to inadequate progress towards reducing child mortality and improving maternal health (Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5) and to the need for the 2010 Global Strategy for Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Health.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The ability to decide on the number and timing of children, free from coercion and violence, is a fundamental human right. During the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> the Kenyan Government committed to increasing funding and contraception coverage by 2015. Despite this supply-side commitment, questions remain about the optimum mechanism to increase demand, particularly among marginalised populations. The WHISPER trial will assess an innovative, sustainable and scalable approach to address some of these gaps.</p><p>Study outcomes will be used to inform future policies and public health interventions aimed at increasing uptake of family planning as well as other SRH services, among vulnerable populations in a range of similar settings, particularly in LMICs. The rigorous research design and extensive local experience of our team will support advocacy and guide mobile technology services for health promotion as outlined in the 2010 Kenyan Government&#x02019;s Family Planning Guidelines.<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> If found to be effective, this intervention could be sustainably scaled up across East Africa.</p><p>With regard to nutritional health, there are renewed efforts to design and implement action-oriented research, but the role of mHealth in these initiatives remains uncertain.<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> The SHOUT study will go some way towards clarifying whether SMS technology is a useful way of responding to a long-recognised, but poorly characterised and neglected problem. Indeed, if shown to be effective in this trial, mHealth could be incorporated into broader nutrition strategies for FSWs in Africa and elsewhere and has the potential to be scaled up for use with other women at a population level.</p><p>The design mitigates biases from unequal attention in trial groups, positive expectations and non-blinding.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> The innovative approach described herein has never been used to prevent unintended pregnancies or improve nutrition among key risk populations in LMICs. A similar methodology in which the effects of SRH text messages were compared with a control SMS intervention was adopted in Australia with a sun safety control group,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and in USA with a nutrition control group,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> although the latter did not measure nutrition outcomes, unlike our trial. This trial will thus set standards for the mHealth field in LMICs, for both interventions and trial methodology. Lessons learnt about optimising SMS technology for both WHISPER and SHOUT could have considerable impact in Kenya and similar countries, for a range of health priorities outside of those examined here.<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></p><p>In conclusion, FSWs constitute a large, vulnerable, hard-to-reach population that could be amenable to mHealth interventions given their high mobile phone coverage and utilisation. FSWs are at considerable risk of unintended pregnancies and could benefit markedly from interventions that increase uptake of contraception, with an emphasis on long-acting reversible technologies and dual method use. Similarly, the nutrition arm of the trial responds to the paucity of quality data on rates of malnutrition among sex workers and of effective interventions to improve their nutritional status and metabolic health.</p><p>A cluster RCT with an equal-attention control and objective biological primary endpoints (unintended pregnancy and anaemia) is the most robust study design to test the effectiveness of the planned interventions. It is anticipated that the trial will contribute important evidence to mHealth initiatives among vulnerable populations and provide useful methodological insights into the use of reciprocal control groups within such trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e388" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017388.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e389" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017388.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution to this work of funding from the Victorian Operational Infrastructure Support Programme received by the Burnet Institute.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The following authors were investigators on the trial from the outset: FHA, CM, PG, MSCL, MC, WJ, MT, ML, LC-T, MS, PAA, MH, KL SL.
