Peer support group as the informants of the disease can help in providing information to patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Peer group has an empirical knowledge about the disease and can make it available to patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although various studies confirm the effectiveness of this method in patients with chronic disorders in different aspects, some studies have reported an ineffectiveness of the peer support programs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nevertheless we did not find any studies regarding its impact on adherence to the treatment regimen of patients with high blood pressure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of peer support training program on patients suffering from hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a clinical trial study conducted at the Isfahan Hypertension Research Center in 2015. The inclusion criteria for the patients being included in the study were willingness to participate in the study, being literate and fluent in Persian, having a history of hypertension, being treated with at least one antihypertensive medication, and being more than 18 years old. In this study, (registration number: IRCT2015112125161 N), the sample size was achieved at a 95% confidence level and power factor of 80% for each of the groups of 32 individuals; 10% was added to the sample size to account for sample loss. Convenient random sampling method was used and participants were assigned in into two groups of intervention and control. First, the questionnaire of adherence to the treatment regimen of high blood pressure was filled using a questioning method by patients who were unfamiliar with the study. Three individuals who had higher scores and were better educated and were also interested in their leadership of the group[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and whose blood pressure was within normal limits over the past month were selected to take the lead of the group. The samples in the experimental group were divided in groups of 8&#x02013;11. Before holding the sessions for the samples, three successful peers who were chosen as the leaders of the group attended two 1.5-hour sessions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Six 60-minute sessions once a week were held for the members of the experimental group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, the phone numbers of peers were given to the members of the group. The researcher attended all the sessions as the observer. The control group participated in two 1-hour sessions held by the researcher. The sessions were about the general idea of hypertension disease, healthy nutrition, and the importance of exercise on health.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The questionnaire of adherence to the treatment regimen was filled immediately after the intervention and again 1 month later.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Instruments used were a two-part questionnaire that contained two parts &#x02013; the first part of which included demographic characteristics of patients and their disease information. The second part of the questionnaire of adherence to the treatment regimen was in three axes. The first axis which reviewed the patient's diet contained 30 questions regarding their food basket. The second axis included 10 questions about the adherence to the medication regimen, and the third axis had 14 questions to assess the level of adherence to the program. For scoring, each item was rated from 0&#x02013;100 (25, 50, 75, and 100). If the items selected by the samples were closer to health behaviors, the score will be higher; if the items were contrary to health behaviors, score will be lower.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Validity and reliability of the questionnaire were evaluated by Sanaee <italic>et al</italic>., and a test&#x02013;retest reliability of <italic>r</italic> = 0.83 was achieved for the instrument; moreover, content validity was used to determine the scientific validity of this instrument.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The statistical analysis of data was performed using independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Increase in scores of all aspects immediately and 1 month later was higher than that before the intervention.</p><p>In confirmation of the results of the present study, a study by Dehghani <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012 titled &#x0201c;The Effect of Peer Group Education on Anxiety of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis&#x0201d; in Isfahan showed that the mean change of depression score in the samples has been different before, immediately after, and 4 months after the intervention in the experimental group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); the depression score in the group that had used peer support program decreased compared to control group; whereas, the mean change of depression score in the samples before, immediately after, and 4 months after the intervention in the control group had no significant difference) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Sharif <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to evaluate the effect of peer support group on the quality of life in patients suffering from breast cancer after performing mastoidectomy surgery. Their study did not show differences in the quality of life dimensions before intervention in patients suffering from breast cancer after surgery (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); however, there was a difference immediately after the intervention in the life quality of patients in the experimental group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In line with the results of the present study, Baumann <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to evaluate the effect of peer group program on adult patients with type II diabetes in Angola. Their study showed that peer support group program had an effect on patients&#x02019; systolic blood pressure, patients following a diet, and HbA1c or glycated hemoglobin of samples (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, glycosylated hemoglobin decreased by 11.13% in the experimental group before the intervention and after the intervention of peer support group decreased by 2.83% and reached 8.30%, which represented a significant impact of peer support program.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Unlike the results of the present study, Mehr <italic>et al</italic>. study in California that aimed to determine the effects of phone calls program of peer group on the quality of life and the level of depression of patients with multiple sclerosis. In their study, there were significant differences in the quality of life of patients, for example, in the emotional, mental, physical aspects, and confidence level of the samples. Although this study was consistent with the study of Mehr <italic>et al</italic>. in terms of sample size, number, and duration of the sessions, holding meetings was not the same.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, the sessions were administered in person and in the form of questions and answers and discussion groups as well as demonstrations; later also, if necessary, the samples could call the peers between the sessions. Mehr <italic>et al</italic>., however, conducted the sessions by phone and the groups had a 1-hour phone call within a week.</p><p>From the researcher's perspective, it seems that the sociocultural differences of research population in the two studies and type of the disease can also lead to different results in the two studies. Tang <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) conducted a study to compare the effect of peer support program and community health workers calls on glycosylated hemoglobin level in patients with diabetes for a year. Results of the study showed the positive impact of both studies [community health workers calls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and peer group program (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001)] in control and experimental groups immediately after the intervention. Moreover, mean changes in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in these patients 12 months after the study (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and 6 months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) were significantly different.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Johansson <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) conducted a study in Austria to investigate the effect of peer support group on metabolic values in patients with diabetes. Unlike the results of the present study, their study showed that, after the 24-month follow-up period, there were no significant differences in glycosylated hemoglobin values, level of serum lipids, high density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and blood creatine (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In view of the researcher, the reason for the difference between the present study and the study conducted by Johansson <italic>et al</italic>. has been attributed to number of samples, longer follow-up time, and cultural differences of the populations studied. The present study was conducted among 64 samples in two groups for six 1-hour sessions and the questionnaires were completed immediately after and 1 month after intervention; the participants were suffering from hypertension and lived in Isfahan. While Johansson <italic>et al</italic>. study was conducted among 337 Austrian patients with diabetes with 12 months of intervention of monthly sessions of group discussion and weekly sports sessions and the results were evaluated 24 months later. It seems that time is an influencing factor on the results of the support program; perhaps in the present study if the questionnaires were filled later after the intervention, different results would have been noted.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Limitations of this study were to obtain information from other sources, and that information was gathered after a short-term period of 1 month after the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that peer support programs had a positive impact on adherence to the treatment regimen in patients with hypertension.
