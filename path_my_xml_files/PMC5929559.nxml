The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>All authors are employees of Hayashibara company.

Fat absorption kinetics appeared to be directly affected by IMD, without dependence on other factors such as fermentation.</p><p>In the human study, we examined the relationship of IMD (2.5 g) intake with postprandial TG in 40 healthy men and women who were given corn soup containing 40.0 g of fat. The efficacy of IMD was evaluated by measuring TG and RLP-cholesterol before and after a high fat load. In addition, we conducted a subgroup analysis in subjects who appeared to have a high risk of abnormal lipid metabolism. The subgroup analysis was performed, based on the C<sub>max</sub> of TG after receiving the placebo diet, using subjects with non-fasting TG levels &#x02265;200 mg/dL, who are regarded as being at a high risk for abnormal lipid metabolism by the American Heart Association [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We considered that a significantly lower level of the &#x00394;Cmax of TG with IMD diet in the subgroup analysis is particularly meaningful despite no significant differences in TG and RLP-cholesterol between diets in the overall analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196802.t002">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest that IMD inhibits postprandial TG increases in subjects who have a normal fasting TG range but a possible high risk of abnormal lipid metabolism.</p><p>The above results suggest that the subjects included in the subgroup analysis are suitable for evaluation of the suppressive effect of IMD on postprandial TG increase. In our further studies, the establishment of inclusion criteria based on the present results may help us to make a clear evaluation. Furthermore, since there were no adverse events attributable to the test diets, IMD can be considered to be safe at the dose used in the present study.</p><p>Based on the results of animal and human studies, we investigated the mechanism of the suppression of fat absorption after IMD intake. Reported mechanisms include destabilization of emulsification in pectin [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], inhibition of lipase activity in epigallocatechin gallate [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and stabilizing of micelles in RMD [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Among these mechanisms, IMD did not show destabilization of emulsification or inhibition of lipase activity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g006">6</xref>), which are mechanisms associated with non-starch polysaccharides. IMD is a dietary fiber made from starch, and this is probably the reason why IMD was not associated with these effects.</p><p>Among dietary fibers similar to IMD that are likewise derived from starch, RMD has been reported to inhibit fat absorption by delaying the release of fatty acids from micelles through stabilizing the micelle[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>By using the method of Kishimoto et al. [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we examined whether IMD has a similar action mechanism to that of RMD. We found that micelles combined with IMD were stabilized similarly to RMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In this method, the particle size of micelles was too large to pass through the mucin layer in the intestine[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196802.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is unclear how IMD exerts its effects with the micelle size permeable enough for reaching the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, we then made use of the fact that water-soluble polysaccharides, when dissolved in water, can acquire an electrical charge due to different degrees of ionization [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and investigated whether the surface electric charge of the micelles changed after combination with IMD. We found that the zeta potential of the micelles was significantly increased when they were combined with IMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Zeta potential is a value of the potential at a given distance from the particle surface, and this value is defined as being similar to the surface electric charge. Therefore, adhesion of IMD on the particle surface may have caused an increase in the surface potential, resulting in the observed increase in zeta potential [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Upon mixing with IMD, the particle size of large micelles did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g007">Fig 7</xref>), but the size of small micelles markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This action appears similar to hemagglutination, which occurs in macromolecular polysaccharides such as dextran. IMD has a structure containing many &#x003b1;-1,6-linkages, unlike other artificial water-soluble dietary fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196802.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and the terminal residues are similar to those of dextran [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Particle aggregation observed with dextran depends on the ratio of hydrodynamic radius to particle size, and it is known that particles aggregate at a large hydrodynamic radius and repulse each other at a small radius [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This appears to explain why IMD appeared to enlarge the small-size particles and appeared not to affect the large ones.</p><p>In the human body, ingested fat is thought to be emulsified with bile acid or phosphatide and broken down with digestive enzymes, and then delivered to and absorbed through the intestinal epithelium in the form of micro-micelles.</p><p>In this study, IMD has been shown to stabilize micron sized micelles in a manner similar to that of RMD, suggesting the inhibitory effects of IMD on the progression of micronization of micelles[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Micron sized particles have been reported to take longer time to pass through the mucin layer compared with nano sized particles[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, IMD could decrease the permeability of the mucin layer by micelles. The intestinal epithelium and mucin layer are negatively charged on the surface by acidic polysaccharide, specifically sialic acid, and surface charge can affect the permeation of anionic particles [<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The Polyethyleneglycol has been reported to increase the surface charge by covering the particle[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. From this, it is considered that the IMD increases the surface charge of the micelle by covering the micelle surface. As a result, IMD would be expected to increase the electrostatic repulsion between the micelles and the acidic polysaccharide and to reduce the absorption.</p><p>It is suggested that chitosan, a type of dietary fiber with basic polysaccharide property, covered the surface of micelles and inhibits the lipid absorption by changing the surface charge to the cation[<xref rid="pone.0196802.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196802.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, IMD, a type of dietary fiber with neutral polysaccharide property, could amplify the surface charge of micelles as the anion. We speculate that this mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption is also involved in the mechanism of conventional neutral dietary fiber.</p><p>Based on the above information, one of the mechanisms for the apparent inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may involve a physical property change of micelles caused by IMD localized on the micelle surface.</p><p>In this study, we focused only on TG kinetics in blood. However, this mechanism may also be applied to other lipids, and future studies of such phenomena are anticipated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196802.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Human study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196802.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196802.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0196802.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Dr. Kazuhiko Takano of the Medical Corporation Hokubu-kai Utsukushigaoka Hospital for assisted human data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0196802.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Collaboration</surname><given-names>NRF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Trends in adult body-mass index in 200 countries from 1975 to 2014: a pooled analysis of 1698 population-based measurement studies with 19&#x000b7; 2 million participants</article-title>. <source>The Lancet</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>387</volume>(<issue>10026</issue>):<fpage>1377</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>96</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0196802.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sasazuki</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tsuji</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sugawara</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tamakoshi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Matsuo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
