The present study was conducted to assess the effect of lifestyle modification family-based intervention in young Iranian children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This field trial study was conducted in 2011 among 156 obese children in Tehran, Iran. They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. At baseline, anthropometric measurements and biochemical analysis were performed. The second and third phases consisted of training sessions for parents of the intervention group. At the fourth phase, there was no training program. In all four phases, questionnaires on demographic characteristics, lifestyle and food frequency were completed by interviewing with mothers, and biochemical analysis was repeated at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>During the second and third phases of the study, weight and height increased significantly in both groups, although weight increased more slowly, and waist and hip circumferences was decreased in the intervention group.

In Asia, prevalence of overweight and obesity in preschool children was 4.9% in 2010.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Recent reports indicate that over 15% of children living in Iran and neighboring countries are overweight or obese.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] According to a national report, it was estimated that 4.4% of school children of Iran were obese.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Following this, the prevalence of obesity in preschool children was recorded as 4.8% in boys and 4.5% in girls in Tehran.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Childhood obesity increases the risk of adulthood obesity. It is reported that 80% of obese children become obese adults,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] which can bring about non-communicable diseases, academically unsuccessful, socially inept and behavioral problems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Hence, a valuable strategy to promote healthy lifestyle from early childhood is behavioral lifestyle modification, focused on dietary and activity habits by parental involvement as the primary agents. Thus, alarming and motivating them for stability of lifestyle changes is crucial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] As long as family bonding has a vital role in the child's behavioral modeling, and also school age is the most appropriate time for acquiring knowledge and habits, and because of there being limited research on obesity in preschool children, this study was the only one taken specifically on 7-year-old obese children to evaluate a family-based behavioral intervention to promote physical activity and healthy dietary habits in Tehran in 2011.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a field trial study conducted in a random sample of 7-year-old obese children (<italic>n</italic> = 156) who were selected from nine health centers of three districts in the north of Tehran. The Ethics Committee of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute approved the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Five hundred and fifty obese children were introduced by nine health centers based on study criteria (child age 7 years old, &#x02265;95<sup>th</sup> percentile of body mass index (BMI) for age and willing to participate). Afterwards, a trained member of the research team called them to describe the study and to confirm an initial screening for eligibility. Children got a code number and were randomly divided into two groups; intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 70) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 86). Then, based on timetable schedule, they were invited to fieldwork (National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute) for secondary screening.</p><p>Parents and children who expressed their interest were assigned and then they completed the consent form. Ultimately, based on exclusion criteria (mental retardation, psychiatric symptoms, current obesity treatment, chronic disease and use of medication), 156 obese children were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed in four phases as follows [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-4-358-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Phase 1 (Baseline)</title><p>In this phase, we measured anthropometric indices and completed socio-demographic and semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] For each subject, these evaluations were repeated at three phases later. In addition, biochemical analysis was only done at phases 1 and 4 because of ethical obligations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Weight, height and waist and hip circumference were measured by trained experts. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated and certified portable digital scale (Beurer, made in Germany) with lightly dressed, without shoes and empty pockets. Height was determined on a standing position, barefoot using a portable height gauge (Seca) with accuracy of 0.1 cm. Then, the BMI was calculated (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Children with BMI over the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age were identified as obese children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>The waist circumference was measured at the smallest area between the edge of the lower chest and iliac crest bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Hip circumference was measured at the maximum level over light clothing and at the widest girth of the hip using an unstretched tape meter without any pressure to the body surface. These measurements were recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Before the examination, the scale was calibrated and the mean of the two measurements was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>For blood sampling, subjects were asked to be 12 h overnight fasting and were invited to a health center near the fieldwork. Blood (5 cc) was taken from the cubical vein after confirming the 12-h fasting with parents. Also, parents were allowed to accompany their child during sampling. The fasting blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were analyzed on fresh blood (on the day it was collected) using a commercial kit based on the enzymatic method (Pars Azmoon, Iran) with an auto-analyzer (Selectra E, Vita lab, Netherlands). Validity and reliability of measurement instruments were evaluated. After collecting blood samples, the children were served a healthy breakfast and a gift.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>Questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics and FFQ were completed by interviewing with trained dieticians who are experienced in working with obese children. Socio-demographic questionnaire included family number, parents&#x02019; occupation and education, birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, gestational diabetes, history of obesity in family, walking to school, play with computer game and watching TV.</p><p>The validated FFQ was used to assess typical food intake over the previous year and, currently, included 168 items.

Sessions&#x02019; topics such as learning about the reasons of the childhood obesity, receiving nutritional information (e.g., food pyramid, food choices, food labels, food preparation and cooking, eating habits, regular meals, controlling environments that stimulate overeating, special dietary consideration during holidays, vacations and at the restaurants) and guidelines for physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors (e.g., reduce watching television and playing computer games, use stairs instead of elevators and play outside instead of inside).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Phase 4</title><p>According to the study design for this phase, the intervention group did not perform any type of training, educational and follow-up programs.

In this study, in phases 2 and 3, waist and hip circumferences decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group. However, at the end of the study, these indices and BMI increased. But, this increment was lower in the intervention group than in the control group, like Flodmark <italic>et al</italic>. study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Family-based studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] have also shown that the combination of exercise and behavioral modification can be effective for reducing waist circumference and BMI in the intervention group rather than in the control group. The reason of this success was educational program for parents and children with free sport classes and cooperation of school staff. Unlike our results, in another family-based study that was conducted for 2 years, BMI declined significantly in the intervention group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In this study, children's physical activity increased and sedentary behaviors were managed at close to the standard range.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Similarly, after family-based interventions in the Sacher,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Epstein,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Muller[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] and Robinson[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] studies, children's physical activity was increased and sedentary behaviors decreased by regulating the time of television viewing.</p><p>Because the school is the best place for providing an opportunity for education and increased physical activity, and children spend most of their time there, unfortunately, in our schools, the strategies to motivate and increase physical activity in children are powerless. Also, in the hours after school and on holidays, parents were unsupportive and did not have the ability to plan for promoting physical activity because of individual and environmental barriers such as urbanization, lack of safe and easy-access places, family funds, time (working mother, traffic) and pollution, and children had to choose the last option that is watching TV and playing on the computer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>]</p><p>It seems that a positive trend was observed toward the intervention group to improvement in blood levels of some biochemical parameters, similar to the Jiang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and Nemet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] studies that showed that total cholesterol and triglyceride were decreased in the intervention group.</p><p>In this study, the consumption of dairy products and fruits were increased significantly. In the Faghihi study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] the average consumption of milk and dairy group was significantly increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. Sugar and confectionery ingredients&#x02019; consumption also decreased relative to the baseline, which reflected the control and management of mothers, although the interaction between the two groups was not significant. Similar to the Epstein,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] Gortmaker[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] and Sahota[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] studies an improvement in children's dietary habits was shown with increased fruit and vegetable consumption and balancing the intake of foods that contain high sugar. Evaluation of the total consumption of oils and fats group of households showed that it was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, similar with Armitage,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] Himes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] and Caballero[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] studies, which could be representative of the skills and consumption management of mothers.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study; first is that the majority of children suffered from severe obesity and thus lifestyle modification could have been more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, parents of the control group were keen to know more about this matter, and we did not see a significant difference between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The family-based lifestyle program had limited effects on anthropometric and metabolic outcomes of obese children. We suggest that if interventions were performed in longer periods with a teamwork including a dietitian, psychologist, coach and all family members and school staff, weight control and lifestyle modification would have been more efficient. It is obvious that government policy and organization support are also effective ways to decrease childhood obesity and to have a healthy society in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Research Council of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Faculty of Nutrition Science and Food Technology and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences for financial support.
