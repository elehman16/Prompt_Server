Neurological deterioration and visual loss have been reported post-robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). However, in routine clinical management of patients, ICP monitoring is often excluded since the standard monitoring methods (ventriculostomy, dural bolt) are rather invasive. Contraindications like coagulopathy, high costs, additional patient risk, dedicated neurosurgeon and prolonged insertion time are also deterrents. Hence, the demand for more practical, alternative noninvasive methods for raised ICP detection. These include cranial computed tomography (time-consuming), ophthalmoscopic papilledema measurement, transcranial Doppler ultrasound and sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement.</p><p>The evaluation of the ONSD is a simple, quick, safe, readily available, reliable and noninvasive procedure,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which is a potential standard of care in the assessment and monitoring of patients undergoing robotic surgery in ST position. Neurosurgical patients develop raised ICP intraoperatively due to prolonged hours of steep head low position.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>A dilated optic nerve sheath is indicative of transmission of increased ICT to the perineural subarachnoid space. This is especially noteworthy because <italic>in vivo</italic> sonographic quantification of ONSD along with being noninvasive gives an impressive resolution of below 0.5 mm. Ours is the first instance reported of utilizing ONSD for ICP monitoring in patients undergoing robotic surgery in ST position.

The study is registered retrospectively with the CTRI (Registration No: CTRI/2014/08/004809 and the date of registration being 1/08/14). At the time of recruitment, ours being the first study comparing ONSD in supine and head low positions we did not have a reference study for sample size estimation. Our pilot study with 10 patients in each group gave significant results. To enhance the power (1-&#x003b2;) of the study keeping the &#x003b1; or type-1 error as 5%, we selected a sample size of 126 cases in each group. After requisite approval of the institutional ethics committee review board and written informed consent from all subjects, 252 American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients of either sex, aged between 25 and 70 years [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] were included in the study. Robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP-54 patients) robot assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH-68 patients) and robot assisted radical cystoprostatectomy (4 patients) with ileal conduit/neobladder were the urogynecological surgeries performed using the da Vinci robotic operating system (Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvale, CA, USA). One hundred and twenty-six patients undergoing robotic surgery in steep (45&#x000b0;) Trendelenburg position were included in Group-R while 126 patients who underwent open urogynecological surgeries in the supine position formed the control Group-O. Out of 270 patients enrolled, 18 patients were excluded from the study as per following exclusion criteria &#x02014; history of neurological disease, transient ischemic attack, carotid disease, raised ICP, cerebral edema, glaucoma, ocular surgery, difficult mechanical ventilation/decreased vital capacity, lower limb ischemia and docking interval &#x0003c;2 h or more than 3 h.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic Data in Robotic and Open Surgery Groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-239-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Optic nerve sheath diameter (both eyes), ETCO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured at following intervals of time in both the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Time points for serial ONSD measurement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-239-g002"/></table-wrap><p>We utilized a standardized anesthetic technique utilizing air-oxygen (40%), end tidal sevoflurane between 1% and 1.5% and a BIS-guided propofol infusion.

ONSD was measured 3 mm posterior to the posterior scleral margin using a 7.5 MHz linear ultrasound probe (Micromaxx Ultrasound System; SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). A hypoechoic linear zone stemming away from the hypoechoic eyeball posteriorly represents the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. As per the departmental protocol, three separate readings were taken for each optic nerve sheath utilizing the digital cursor and standardized adjustment of SonoSite software.(Micromaxx, Bothell, USA) The anesthetist recording the measurements was not blinded to the preliminary clinical diagnosis or the stage of surgery (time elapsed in ST position). Later the saved ultrasound images were independently reviewed by the chief investigator who calculated the mean ONSD. He was blinded to the clinical details including the timing of the ultrasonography (USG) scan whether pre-, intra- or post-operative. The trial was participant and outcome assessor blinded.

To preserve cerebrovascular homeostasis, normocarbia should be maintained. The Molloy study showed that even under anesthesia, cerebrovascular and ophthalmic circulatory autoregulation do not prevent complications such as increased intraocular pressure.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] As per Theelen <italic>et al</italic>., raised ICP leads to a rise in episcleral venous pressure, which in turn leads to an elevation in intraocular pressure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>B-scan (planar) ultrasound provides longitudinal cross-section images of the optic nerve and its sheath. The method has been successfully validated in several relatively large studies that included patients with severe head trauma[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] hydrocephalus,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] intracranial hemorrhage,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] stroke, acute application of subarachnoid pressure,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] liver failure[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and climbers with acute mountain sickness. ONSD can be used for identification of patients with intracranial hypertension that requires treatment. Ours is one of the first instances reported of quantitative noninvasive measurement of the increase in ICP with steep (45&#x000b0;) Trendelenburg position by serial measurement of binocular ONSD in patients undergoing robotic surgery. Using an ROC curve, Kimberly <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] systematically confirmed the commonly used threshold of ONSD &#x0003e;5 mm to detect ICP &#x0003e;20 mmHg. Their study directly correlates ventriculostomy measurements of ICP with US ONSD measurements.</p><p>The optic nerve, ontogenetically a part of the central nervous system, is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and duramater [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Appendix: CONSORT Checklist</xref>]. Owing to a connection with the intracranial subarachnoid space, CSF pressure variations influence the ONSD. Histological studies revealed a segment of the optic nerve in which maximal diameter fluctuations could be expected (bulging duramater region approximately 3 mm behind the papilla). After widening of the subarachnoid space with gelatine in cadavers, the mean diameter increased by 60% at 3 mm behind optic nerve head, but only by 35% at 10 mm distance. Independent measurements by two examiners correlated highly, which indicates excellent reproducibility of the USG measurements.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The optimal experimental scanning position was at right angle to the optic nerve (longitudinal section). Under clinical conditions, however, only axial sections can be obtained using anterior probe positions with transbulbar sound directions. ONSD changes almost concurrently with CSF pressure variations and have a good reproducibility.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Upper limit of normal for ONSD is 4.5-5.2 mm in patients over 1 year of age[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and 4 mm in children &#x0003c;1 year old as per the various studies conducted so far. A limitation of our trial could be that the absolute values for ONSD in the Indian subcontinental population may vary from those in other races across the globe. The trends in ONSD values can be generalized to the entire globe though. Our study demonstrates that ONSD (surrogate for ICP) rises steadily with pneumoperitoneum and hours in ST position during robotic surgery to dangerous levels that are well above the upper limit for normal. The values fail to return to baseline even 24 h after surgery. This may result in devastating complications that are preventable if detected early. The incidence of delayed awakening (8.7% in Group-R and 2.4% in Group-O), emergence delirium (21.4% in Group-R and 11.9% in Group-O) and postoperative nausea-vomiting (33.3% in Group-R and 20.6% in Group-O) were significantly higher in the robotic surgery group as per our study. Two cases of robotic radical cystectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion surgeries having neurological deterioration (stupor, incoherent talking, rapid shallow respiratory pattern, vomiting, hypertension and bradycardia) postextubation probably due to iatrogenic positional cerebral edema have been reported by Pandey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Postoperative visual loss due to posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after RALP[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has occurred. Lee <italic>et al</italic>. observed a significant decline in regional cerebral oxygen saturation as a result of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure consequent to raised ICP during ST position in 24 female patients undergoing robot assisted gynecological surgery.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] ONSD measurement can aid in screening and excluding patients with raised ICP and glaucoma for robotic surgery in ST position. A possible drawback of the study could be that the end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at the same levels in the supine and Trendelenburg positions. This probably means a greater minute ventilation in the head low group. This might be a variable via mean intrathoracic pressure on the ONSD results. But that mentioned, serial ONSD measurement in our view, is a potential standard of care for intraoperative monitoring and postoperative vigilance.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-239-g010"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, ST position results in increasing venous congestion within and outside the cranium leading to cerebral edema and raised ICP. US-ONSD should be used routinely as a screening test for raised ICP and glaucoma in patients scheduled for robotic surgery in ST position, and such patients declared unfit for robotic surgery and offered open surgery as an option. Serial ONSD monitoring intra- and post-operatively can also serve as a guide to decide whether the raised ICP merits any intervention (intravenous [IV] fluid restriction, IV dexamethasone, 20%mannitol, furosemide, reverse trendelenburg, break in surgery). Adverse neurological morbidity after robotic surgery could be due to raised ICP if the ONSD value is persistently more than 5 mm.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
