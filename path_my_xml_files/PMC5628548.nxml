In addition, the patients after thorough training on using the glucometer for self-monitoring of blood glucose were given a glucometer instruction sheet, glucometer, and glucometer strips to perform a 5-point home-based glucose monitoring once a week, on every Sunday. The patients were advised to measure blood glucose using glucometer whenever there were symptoms of fatigue/sweating/giddiness/blurred vision and were further advised to take 2 teaspoons of sugar if the glucose value was &#x0003c;70 mg/dL and were also advised to call the study coordinator immediately. After consultation with dietician, the patients were provided with a diet plan to follow till the next visit and were also instructed to follow physical activity as advised by the investigator. During the follow-up visit, the FPG and PPG were measured by collecting venous blood samples. The patient's vital parameters as well as weight were also recorded. In each follow-up visit, the patient diary was reviewed for occurrence of instances of symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia, study drug compliance, and results of the home blood glucose monitoring. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment, the patients were advised to attend a follow-up visit wherein the patient's FPG, PPG, HbA1c, hematology, clinical chemistry including renal function test, liver function test and lipid profile, urinalysis, pregnancy test for female patients, and vitals including height and weight were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline up to 12 weeks.

DPP4i are a well-established class of oral agents having moderate efficacy with a good overall safety profile including low risk of hypoglycemia and weight neutrality.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, sulfonylureas have been a part of the therapeutic armamentarium for T2DM since 1950 and are one of the most potent oral antidiabetic agents.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Due to good efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, sulfonylureas, especially modern ones like glimepiride, are the most preferred first add-on to metformin in Indian clinical settings.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Glimepiride has unique binding characteristics with the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) resulting in the fast association and dissociation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Due to its extrapancreatic activity, glimepiride reduces insulin resistance and improves glucose utilization through glucose transporter 4.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This dual mode of action of glimepiride results in a potent glycemic reduction with minimal risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It has a greater selectivity for &#x003b2;-cell SUR1 receptors and thereby does not impair the protective ischemic preconditioning.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized clinical trials confirmed that second- and third-generation sulfonylureas including glimepiride were not associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a meta-analysis comparing sulfonylurea with a nonsulfonylurea agent, glimepiride had the lowest all-cause mortality among all sulfonylureas.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies consensus statement also emphasized that modern sulfonylureas should be preferred over the older ones due to better cardiovascular outcomes, less hypoglycemia, and less weight gain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In our study, drug na&#x000ef;ve T2DM patients or T2DM patients uncontrolled on metformin monotherapy were randomized to receive an FDC of glimepiride 1 mg or 2 mg/sustained-release metformin 1000 mg once daily or sitagliptin 50 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily over 12 weeks. The glimepiride group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c as compared to sitagliptin group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). The reductions in FPG and PPG were also found to be significantly more in the glimepiride group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008). Sulfonylureas are always blamed for causing hypoglycemia in T2DM patients which is more evident in older sulfonylureas as compared to the modern ones like glimepiride.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, in our study, the incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar among the glimepiride and sitagliptin groups. Moreover, there was no evidence of severe hypoglycemic events in both the groups. Both therapies showed comparable safety profile and were generally well tolerated.</p><p>These results are consistent with prior studies comparing glimepiride and sitagliptin or other DPP4i as add on to metformin. In a study by Srivastava <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] there were greater glycemic benefits (HbA1c, FPG, and PPG) with glimepiride as compared to sitagliptin with 36% of patients in glimepiride group and 12% of patients in sitagliptin group achieving the target HbA1c. In a similar study, there were greater reductions in HbA1c among glimepiride group (0.44%) versus sitagliptin group (0.25%) with higher percentage of patients on glimepiride reaching the HbA1c target of &#x0003c;7% and statistically nonsignificant effects on weight with glimepiride.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing glimepiride/metformin versus any DPP4i/metformin combination, the glimepiride/metformin combination resulted in a 12% greater reduction in HbA1c, 0.21 mmol/L greater reduction in FPG with significantly fewer dropouts, and 20% reduced risk of requiring rescue treatment. There was a between group difference of 2.1 kg in weight, which was not considered as clinically relevant. This study suggested that there is greater effectiveness with the glimepiride/metformin combination with good safety profile, which makes it a preferential choice of treatment for many uncontrolled T2DM patients.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>A study comparing different classes of oral antidiabetic agents (sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione or DPP4i) as second-line therapies to metformin monotherapy among ~20,000 patients revealed that in routine clinical practice, adding a DPP4i to metformin resulted in an increased, earlier requirement for treatment intensification as compared to a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione over 5 years. Moreover, the addition of sulfonylurea resulted in 0.3%&#x02013;0.5% greater reduction in HbA1c with a slight reduction in body weight of 0.2 kg from baseline. The weight reduction seen with sulfonylurea was attributed to therapeutic patient education, lifestyle changes, and using it in combination with metformin.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Similar findings were seen in a 104 weeks study wherein glimepiride resulted in a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.36% versus linagliptin which resulted in a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.16% as add on to metformin.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Another observational cohort study (ZODIAC-39) involving ~3000 patients suggested that strict glycemic control can be maintained with a sulfonylurea/metformin combination without relevant changes in weight over 5 years. Out of the different sulfonylurea/metformin combinations studied, glimepiride/metformin combination resulted in 0.1 kg weight gain, gliclazide/metformin combination resulted in 3.9 kg weight gain, and glibenclamide/metformin combination resulted in 3.3 kg weight gain.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Low-dose glimepiride has also demonstrated effective plasma glucose reduction with no reports of hypoglycemia or weight gain.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Low-dose glimepiride, due to its peripheral insulin sensitizing effect, does not cause downregulation of the insulin receptors and thus may prevent unnecessary hyperinsulinemia and &#x003b2;-cell function failure.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Sulfonylureas as second-line agents have shown good glycemic control and better quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) comparable to other newer agents such as DPP4i and GLP-1 receptor agonists but at lower cost with the longest time to insulin dependence.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] All these studies, including the results of our study, suggest that modern sulfonylureas like glimepiride are an important strategic tool to manage T2DM. This study had several limitations. First the two doses of glimepiride 1 mg or 2 mg were used in FDC. The daily frequency of dose administration was different for both the groups. Lastly, the duration of treatment period was short.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In T2DM patients, glimepiride/metformin combination exhibited significant reduction in glycemic parameters as compared to sitagliptin/metformin combination. Both glimepiride and sitagliptin were well tolerated with no significant between group difference in weight and low propensity for hypoglycemia. Hence, given the good efficacy, safety profile, less hypoglycemic risk, weight neutrality, extrapancreatic effects and many pleiotropic benefits, glimepiride is still a rational choice as an add on to metformin in T2DM patients. Modern sulfonylureas like glimepiride thus are still an important second-line option after metformin in this era of newer antidiabetic agents.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was funded and supported by USV Private Limited.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the efforts of Dr. Mahesh Abhyankar and Dr. Vivek Kolapkar for medical writing support and Dr. Vasant Joshi and Dr. Gajanan Namjoshi for co-ordination and statistical guidance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>International Diabetes Federation.
