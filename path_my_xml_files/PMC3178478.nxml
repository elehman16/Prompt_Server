This novel approach of delivering outpatient care is now being compared with usual care during a randomized controlled trial with 300 patients and their partners. The focus in this trial is on health outcomes and costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Motive</title><p>Most neuromuscular diseases are chronic progressive diseases necessitating periodic specialized care. Because of the progressive nature of the disease, existing symptoms aggravate over time and new symptoms may develop over time, requiring adjustment of management, and giving rise to new questions on the part of the patient and his or her partner. In the absence of definitive cures for chronic neuromuscular diseases, the improvement of quality of life, patient- and partner satisfaction with care, self management and functional capacity become key objectives of care. Currently, these patients attend the out-patient clinic at regular intervals (usually annually), where they are seen in one-to-one patient- physician encounters. It is difficult, however, to fulfill the complex needs of neuromuscular patients in these brief, problem-focused out-patient visits which leave little time for the patient's psychosocial needs, patient education, and patient empowerment. The possible advantages of a shared medical appointment could be an answer to these questions. Our hypotheses are that shared medical appointments show 1) the same effect on the development of the disease as individual appointments 2) an improvement of self-efficacy as opposed to individual appointments, therefore resulting in an improved quality of life 3) better use of resource utilization and 4) a positive effect on self efficacy and quality of life of the partner as well as on the relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>What is a shared medical appointment?</title><p>During a shared medical appointment or group visit, 6-10 patients and their partners are seen simultaneously by a physician who is supported by a group mentor. Shared medical appointments are a series of one on one doctor-patient contacts, in presence of a group fellow patients. A group visit takes 1,5 - 2 hours and substitutes the annual control visit of the patients. The same items the neurologist attends to in a one to one appointment are addressed. The physician has more time to give information and patients and partners can ask questions to- and learn from their fellow patients. The group mentor facilitates the group process, fosters interaction between patients and manages time. Shared medical appointments should not be confused with group education or peer support groups. As opposed to a group visit, these meetings do not substitute for the periodic consultation with the clinician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Experience with shared medical appointments in patients with diabetes, heart failure, bone marrow transplantation and chronically ill older patients have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Evidence of group visits for neurological patients is at this moment at the level of a feasibility trial for patients with Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A randomized, prospective controlled study (RCT) with a follow up of 6 months will be conducted to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of shared medical appointments compared to usual care for neuromuscular patients.

The same neurologists execute the individual appointments and the shared medical appointments. As well as for the individual appointments, the shared medical appointments substitute for the annual control visit of the patients. The same items the neurologist attends to in a one on one control visit are attended to during the shared medical appointment. The neurologist is supported by a group mentor, who facilitates the group process, fosters interaction between patients and manages time.</p><p>The group mentor starts with a short introduction in which the process of the shared medical appointment is explained and confidentiality is emphasized. Patients and their partners are asked to fill out a privacy form, which is kept in the patient's records, in order to emphasize the confidentiality of the group visit. If physical examinations are deemed necessary, they are conducted in a private examination room close to the group visit room directly after the shared medical appointment. Necessary prescriptions, referrals, and chart notes are being taken care of during or directly after the shared medical appointment. The neurologists have received training in conducting shared medical appointments prior to the study. The process of the shared medical appointments is described in appendix 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance and attrition</title><p>When participants indicate that they wish to discontinue their participation in the study, reasons will be documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcome measures for patients are listed in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The primary outcome measure is quality of life (daily activity limitations, pain, mood, fatigue, social activities) as measured by the EQ-5D, SF-36 and the Individualized neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL). For the SF-36 and EQ 5 D, normative scores are available based on the Dutch population. For the INQoL, no Dutch version was available. With granted authorization from the authors, a translation into the Dutch language was made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Secondary outcome measures are (1) Use of health care resources (use of health care services, medication, compliance with medication, use of assistance with daily activities) Questions from the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) are used to record service utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. (2) Self efficacy (how much confidence one has in being able to execute specific behaviour), as measured by the Self Efficacy questionnaire from Schwarzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This is a 10-item psychometric scale that is designed to assess self-beliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. Also, a questionnaire to measure self efficacy of patients with neuromuscular disease was developed by the research group. (3) The need for social support was assessed by using the subscale emotional support of the Dutch questionnaire SSLD (Sociale Steun Lijst-Discrepanties) from Sanderman and van Sonderen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. (4) Satisfaction with relationship was measured by asking the participants to rate their relationship on a 1/10 scale and to rate their relationship on a VAS scale, ranging from the worst possible relationship to the best possible relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (5) Satisfaction with and aspects of the visit, as measured by The QUality Of care Through the patient's Eyes (QUOTE) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The severity of the disease as measured through the Rankin-scale is assessed during the shared medical appointments and through reviewing the chart notes for individual appointments by the participating neurologists or primary researcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Outcome measures and instrumentation patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Instruments</th><th align="left">T0</th><th align="left">T1</th><th align="left">T2</th><th align="left">T3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Primary outcome measures</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Quality of life</td><td align="left">EQ5D, SF36, INQOL</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Secondary outcome measures</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Demographic statistics</td><td/><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severity of the disease</td><td align="left">Rankin Scale</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Use of care resources and medicine</td><td align="left">Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI)</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td/><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Self efficacy</td><td align="left">SE questionnaire from Schwarzer, SE NMD</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Social support</td><td align="left">SSLD (Sociale Steun Lijst-Discrepanties)</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Satisfaction with relationship</td><td/><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Satisfaction with the appointment</td><td align="left">QUality Of care Through the patient's Eyes (QUOTE)</td><td/><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td><td align="left">&#x0221a;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Outcome measures for partners are listed in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.

Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective, relating differences in costs to difference in health outcome as measured by the Euroqol-5D, an instrument to evaluate different health states. Bootstrapping will be used for pair-wise comparisons in direct health care costs, direct non-health care costs, total direct costs, total indirect costs, and total costs between the two groups. Confidence intervals will be obtained by conventional re-sampling methods (bootstrapping). The cost effectiveness analysis will provide information on the marginal costs and effects of shared medical appointments relative to conventional one-to-one outpatient visits through the calculation of an incremental cost effectiveness ratio. Ratios will include the primary outcome of the trial, i.e., quality of life and two secondary outcome parameters; functional activities, and self-efficacy. Cost acceptability curves will be calculated showing the probability that the shared medical appointment is cost effective at specified ceiling ratios. In situations where there is no significant difference in effects, the use of cost-minimization analysis will be used for the reporting of cost differences only. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted, exploring the sensitivity of the conclusions to various sources of uncertainty, including sampling variation (e.g., differences in self-efficacy and functional abilities in both groups) and point-estimates (e.g., unit cost prices of major cost drivers).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial which evaluates the effect of shared medical appointments versus usual care for neuromuscular patients. Evidence shows that shared medical appointments can have substantial added value, deriving not only from sharing a health care professional's time, but also from sharing mutual experiences, particularly for patients with a chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the literature, group visits have been shown to result in fewer hospitalizations and emergency visits, increased patient satisfaction and increased self-efficacy as compared to usual one-to-one outpatient visits in elderly, chronically ill patients (Scott et al. 2004). In patients with diabetes, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated an increased frequency of preventive procedures among patients attending group visits, resulting in a better general health status as measured by the SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sadur et al (1999) demonstrated greater satisfaction with diabetes care, greater self-efficacy, better glycemic control, and lower service utilization among patients with diabetes who were randomly allocated to group visits as compared to counterparts who were allocated to usual care.</p><p>This study has several strengths. Firstly, shared medical appointments will be compared with usual care in a randomized design. This will enable to determine if there is additional value of shared medical appointments to the current management spectrum. Secondly, this study involves measuring effect of a treatment on partners of patients with a neuromuscular disease. Studies from Baanders et al (2007) and Timman (2010) show that living with a chronically ill person, specifically with a neuromuscular disorder, has an impact on the partner's life that goes beyond the consequences of care giving, for example consequences on personal life strain, social relations, financial burden, and intrinsic rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. And that marital satisfaction is a strong predictor of better wellbeing, both for patients and, even more so, for partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thirdly, this study aims to determine the cost effectiveness of shared medical appointments as compared to care as usual. In current healthcare time is a scarce good. Efficiency goals are on top of every healthcare managers' list. When introducing a new way of delivering care, such as shared medical appointments, this preferably is just as or even more efficient than care as usual. Therefore it is important to take cost effectiveness of the intervention into account in this study. A limitation of this study can be the fact that it is a single center study. This may influence the transferability of the research results to other hospitals. Due to pragmatic and financial reasons the follow up time is limited to 6 months. For patients with neuromuscular disorders annual control visits are offered, this limits the number of shared medical appointments a patient receives during the study to one. Possibly the effect of group visits increase when attended several times. With this study design it is not possible to show this effect. A reflection of practice in this study, that could be a possible limitation, is inclusion of different patient groups. Although patients all have a chronic neuromuscular disease, possible differences in effects between patient groups could be difficult to show with this study design.</p><p>In conclusion, this study will provide greater insight in the (cost) effectiveness of shared medical appointments for neuromuscular patients. The concept of group visits or shared medical appointments is a typical example of organizing the delivery of health care in a different way, in an attempt to improve patient outcome within the limits of available resources. Many attempts at increasing efficiency of health care consist of reducing the amount of time health care professionals spend on specific activities. Such attempts risk, however, to jeopardize the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. When our study shows that group visits produce the alleged benefits, this may help to increase the acceptance of this innovative and creative way of using one of the most precious resources in health care more efficiently: time.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>CPEO:Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; CRAMP database: Computer Registry of All Myopathies and Polyneuropathies; FSHD: Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy; IBM: Inclusion body myositis; INQOL: Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life; OPMD: Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy; SMA: shared medical appointment; RCT: randomized controlled trial; RUNMC: Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FS is primary investigator and responsible for data collection and analysis and for drafting the manuscript.
