Body Age is a fitness assessment method and a product concept developed in the late 1980s. Body Age applies a person&#x02019;s demographics, health status, lifestyle questionnaires, and fitness assessments. Reliable and repeatable assessments are made possible by hardware provided by the Body Age System, herein referred to as the test system (Polar Electro Inc., Kempele, Finland). The fitness assessment results are characterized by a Body Age score, which defines the person&#x02019;s biological age (in years). The software of the test system generates an assessment report automatically <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Heterogeneity of the age-related physiological changes is shown by the &#x0201c;biological age,&#x0201d; which determines the rate of aging experienced by each individual. Biological age is defined as the functional capability of a human, and the selected biomarkers encompass various complex physiopathological factors related to intrinsic and extrinsic physiological and functional aging. It can be measured, for example, by functional capacity tests, blood tests, and skin, retinal, and strength tests <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The biological age index is commonly constructed from a number of the most reliable biomarkers of aging <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Compared with individual biomarkers, the index has been shown to be a reliable biomarker of mortality, and a cognitive and physical performance prognostic factor. The correlation is not demonstrated only with individual biomarkers <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To our knowledge, the applicability of Body Age to occupational health services has not been studied previously.</p><p id="p0030">The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of technology-aided testing and feedback given (Body Age score) on physical activity and biological age during a 12-month follow-up period in a cluster randomized controlled study in a medium-sized enterprise.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study sampling and design</title><p id="p0035">This study was carried out among employees of a medium-sized enterprise in recycling. The circular economy company provides comprehensive environmental management services. The intervention project took place in its main site (Riihim&#x000e4;ki, Finland) in the years 2008&#x02013;2009. The company employed both blue and white collar workers, the majority working in manufacturing but a part also in administration. All employees (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;220) were invited to participate in the physical activity intervention program. Both the occupational health nurse and the executive director informed all the employees beforehand, and everyone could sign up for the study. In addition, electronic information channels delivered general information about the study. In all 67% (149) of the employees registered for the study and were cluster randomized into three groups based on age, sex, and occupation (blue and white collar). The study was carried out through the occupational health service in the company and coordinated by an occupational health nurse. An ethics committee approval statement was obtained from the Lahti Region Hospital Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0040">The inclusion criteria were readiness to participate in the study, age between 18 and 64 years, and the occupational physician in the company approving the self-reported medical history.

The age value of each assessment represents an age increment or decrement of the Body Age, and depends on how the corresponding test results ranks in statistical data of similar demographics. The ranking is based on generally accepted data provided by scientific publications. For Body Age calculation, the sex- and age-specific classification of each assessment is used. The number of classifications varies from five to seven depending on the assessment. Depending on the number of classifications, each class of each assessment affects Body Age. For example, for the cardiovascular assessment, a seven-scale classification for VO2<sub>max</sub> is used as a reference <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Thus, awareness of Body Age did not have any effect on biological age. Our results contradict other studies that show that employer-sponsored wellness programs have achieved significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, such as weight management and waist circumference <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Participation in well-structured worksite wellness programs have also increased health and life satisfaction for employees, and helped employees develop and maintain healthy behaviors <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Participation in workplace physical activity programs has also been associated with improvements in the mental component of health-related quality of life, even though the physical activity level remains the same <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="p0105">Self-reported physical activity levels (according to the IPAQ-SF) did not change during the intervention period. One possible explanation could be that the measurement of physical activity was unsatisfactory. This is typically an inherent bias in self-reported data, as they overestimate physical activity as measured by objective criterion <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, if the IPAQ-SF overestimates physical activity, the finding that there was no change in self-reported physical activity during the intervention period could actually mean a real decrease in physical activity.</p><p id="p0110">A limitation of the study was that the Biological Age method has not been tested for reliability, although the method includes separate measurements that all have widely been used and tested <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p id="p0115">During the study, however, all groups improved their biological age during the 12 months. The biggest improvements in time occurred within the first 6 months. Systolic blood pressure levels improved significantly and thus partly explain the results. Blood pressure is a sensitive measure, which may also be affected, in addition to physical activity, by mental stress. Mental stress was minimized by that the blood pressure was measured after a rest period of 5 minutes. Thus, the testing could be, at least in baseline, a more stressful situation than during the follow-ups. The feedback could also have affected the participants&#x02019; health behavior in many ways, such as affecting their diet, sleep quantity, and everyday choices. The improvement in biological age could also partly be explained by a learning effect: the participants learned how to do the different tests. The change in biological age was rather fast, and a longer follow-up should be important in future interventions to see if the changes persist in the long run.</p><p id="p0120">The study was a cluster randomized controlled study. The program involved 70% of the company&#x02019;s employees. Participation was voluntary, and we cannot rule out that those who volunteered may more likely have other lifestyle activities that are positive for reduction of biological age than those who did not participate, which may have affected the results.</p><p id="p0125">The self-training does not seem to have been sufficient, although the participants received appropriate guidance in increasing physical activity. Organized training sessions or personal trainers could have been a better solution, although self-training with possible backup, if needed, is a very realistic and economical situation for most companies.</p><p id="p0130">A strength of the study was the good compliance by the management, occupational health care, and employees (the participation rate was 70% at baseline). The program motivated and engaged the people involved, although this was not adequate to help them reach a higher level of fitness. The Body Age method was also perceived as quick and easy to use, and gave the occupational health care information about the health and fitness of the employees. The intervention was successfully completed by the employees. They were enthusiastic regarding participation, and all measurements were conducted in accordance with a set pretested protocols. The basis of this intervention was easy to manage, and the participants calculated measurements during their workday. Days were organized with a similar protocol to involve all participants. A limitation is that the study was not blinded, because the employees knew and talked to each other during working hours, and, in addition, most of them lived in the same small town. Therefore, the workers could discuss the physical activity and test results with each other. Thus, there could have been a Hawthorne effect in the reference group (A), which received only individual test results but not the body age. This disturbs and certainly affects the randomized and controlled study design. If the study would have been carried out in different cities, the results might have differed.</p><p id="p0135">The present study suggests that technology-aided testing and feedback do not seem to change the level of an individual&#x02019;s physical activity but may enhance physical fitness measured by biological age.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0140">All
