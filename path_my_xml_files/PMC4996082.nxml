and emotions that make them experience much stress and anxiety. Anxiety is considered a
cognitive, affective and behavioral disorder, caused by situations that are perceived as
threatening<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The desire to obtain information and the expectation to visit a family member
in a hospital setting may aggravate the perceptions of family members, regardless of the
surgical procedure.</p><p>In this context, providing information regarding the perioperative period and
alleviating the anxiety of surgical patients has been the focus of nursing care. Care
provided to family members, however, also demands attention. The hospitalization,
surgical procedure and recovery in an intensive care unit cause anxiety because the
family has to face an unknown situation the patient is inserted in that is full of
uncertainty<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. Note that anxiety is at highest when family members are, most often, in waiting
rooms, awaiting information regarding the surgical intervention<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The contact with a hospital setting and the expectation of meeting the patient
surrounded by monitoring equipment cause doubts and anxiety in family members<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The inclusion of family members in perioperative orientation can help the family to feel
safer about the impending surgery. When well oriented, family members encourage the
patient and help in the recovery. Considering that changes affecting one family member
potentially affect the remaining members of the family, interventions directed to the
entire family can indirectly benefit the patient<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. For this reason, the establishment of an effective relationship between the
health staff and family members minimizes insecurity and distress, ultimately
contributing to overcome difficulties<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The literature shows that visiting a patient in the recovery room only is not sufficient
to significantly reduce the anxiety of family members<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Interventions implemented at the time the family is waiting to visit the
patient in the Immediate Post-Operative (IPO) period have been tested, aiming to
decrease anxiety levels among family members. A pre-post intervention study, conducted
to verify the effect of watching a movie in the waiting room, reports decreased anxiety
levels among the family members of surgical patients (from 46&#x000b1;9.2 to 39.1&#x000b1;11.8 points;
p=0.003)<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Another study, conducted to verify differences in the levels of anxiety, stress
and relaxation of family members in the waiting room of a surgical center after
listening to live music for 20 minutes, show that even though the outcome levels did not
significantly decrease after the intervention, relaxation scores increased
(p=0.0008)<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Nonetheless, strategies to encourage greater interaction between the nursing
staff and family members while in the waiting room, including intergroup comparisons,
have not been tested yet.</p><p>Given the previous discussion, this study's objective was to verify the effectiveness of
nursing guidance provided to the families of patients in the immediate post-operatory
period of cardiac surgery before the first visit in the post-anesthesia care unit in
decreasing anxiety levels when compared to the unit's routine guidance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This open randomized clinical trial was registered in the ReBEC (Brazilian Registry of
Clinical Trials) and in the Universal Trial Number (UTN) under No. U1111-1145-6172, and
conducted in a cardiac reference hospital in the South of Brazil from March to June
2013. </p><p>The sample was composed of family members of patients undergoing CABG or heart valve
surgery, who were expecting the patient to return from surgery in the waiting room
across the surgical center and awaited the first visit in the Immediate Post-Operative
Care Unit (IPO). Inclusion criteria were: both sexes, 18 years old or older, being a
family member/caregiver, and consent to participate in the study. Those who had already
accompanied a patient in prior cardiac surgery were excluded. The sample size was based
on a previous study<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>, considering that 52.5% of the companions presented average levels of anxiety.
We estimated that 105 family members would be necessary in each group to obtain a
difference of 20% in the average level of anxiety, with power of 80% and 95% of
confidence level. </p><p>Family members were approached in the IPO's waiting room after being invited to
participate, receiving clarification, and signing free and informed consent forms, and
were assigned to the Intervention Group (IG) or Control Group (CG), using simple random
sampling obtained at http://www.randomizer.org, established for one week: the
individuals approached in week 1 were assigned to IG and those in week 2 were assigned
to the CG. An independent professional performed the randomization. Both groups answered
a structured questionnaire, addressing sociodemographic variables and variables related
to preparation to visit a patient in the IPO.</p><p>The intervention was implemented by one of the researchers, a nurse with experience in
the immediate post-operative following cardiac surgery, and was composed of audiovisual
orientation, provided in groups in the period prior to the visit. The family members
were oriented in the waiting room about the potential conditions the patient would face
post cardiac surgery, using audiovisual resources such as illustrative images of
equipment/devices used in the immediate post-operatory. The intervention lasted
approximately 20 minutes, after which the individuals were encouraged to clarify doubts.
The CG received orientation routinely provided in the unit, which includes aspects
related to the sector's routine, such as visiting hours, hand washing, maximum number of
visitors, and the fact that the medical staff would provide information regarding the
patient's condition after visitation. A nursing technician, nurse or members of the
surgical team usually provides such information.</p><p>The family could visit the patient at hours previously established by the unit. Visits
lasted up to 30 minutes and only one visitor was allowed per time. The anxiety outcome
was verified using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI after intervention and
before the first visit. </p><p>STAI is a self-report questionnaire widely used in the monitoring of anxious states,
composed of two distinct scales developed to measure two concepts of anxiety, trait and
state anxiety. It has been translated and validated for the Brazilian population with
satisfactory psychometric properties<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. In this study, only the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-State) was used because
anxiety was assessed before the post-operatory visit, when the instrument was handed to
the family member to complete and then return it to the researcher.</p><p>The concept of state anxiety is defined as a transitory emotional state, or as a
condition of the human body characterized by unpleasant feelings of stress and tension,
consciously perceived and accompanied by increased activity of the autonomous nervous
system. In this self-reported 20-item tool, the intensity of anxiety is classified on a
Likert scale that ranges from 1 (absolutely not) to 4 (very much). The total score
ranges from 20 to 80, in which higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. Scores
of questions with a positive nature are inverted, that is, if the individual answers 4,
1 is attributed in the coding process, if s/he answers 3, 2 is attributed, if answers 2,
then 3 is attributed and, if the individual answers 1, 4 is attributed. Levels of
anxiety were categorized for the purpose of analysis<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>: scores from 19 to 40 were considered to be low, from 41 to 60 - average, and
scores from 61 to 76 were considered high.</p><p>The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board at the Cardiology
Institute of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil (CAAE 09904012.0.0000.5333). </p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version
18.0. Categorical variables were expressed through absolute and relative frequencies and
continuous variables were presented using mean and standard deviation, according to
normal or non-normal distribution. The unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test was
used for intergroup comparisons regarding the level of anxiety variable (numerical) and
remaining quantitative variables. The Chi-square test was used to check for associations
between qualitative variables and the group variable. The Mann-Whitney test was utilized
to compare the groups with regard to the outcome (anxiety) when it was treated as an
ordinal qualitative variable. A level of significance of 5% was considered. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>

</p><p>The individuals were given an opportunity to clarify doubts after the intervention and
the researchers answered the questions. The main doubts concerning the IPO period
included: the unit's routine, length of stay in the unit and hospital, what could
possibly happen if the patient became too emotional when seeing family, and questions
concerning how long the patient should wait before resuming daily activities. </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized clinical trail addressing the relatives of patients undergoing cardiac
surgery shows that nursing orientation provided at the time preceding the first visit in
the immediate post-operatory unit contributed to decrease anxiety levels of family
members and helped them to feel prepared to visit the patient in the post-anesthesia
care unit. </p><p>The STAI-State assessment revealed significant decrease in the anxiety levels of
individuals in the IG when compared to those from the CG. Most individuals from the CG
presented high levels of anxiety, while those in the IG remained at intermediary levels.
The moment that antecedes the first visit in the immediate post-operatory unit generates
anxiety that cannot be completely eliminated in the face of an unknown situation
involving a family member, though comfort and reassurance can be provided during the
waiting time, which help alleviate tension.</p><p>A study conducted with family members and patients undergoing coronary angiography for
the first time, aiming to identify levels of anxiety during the waiting period for the
exam, verified that the mean score the patients' companions obtained in the STAI-State
was 42.8&#x000b1;9.9, while intermediate levels of anxiety predominated among most companions
(52.5%)<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. In this study, the mean score the IG obtained in the STAI-State after
intervention was similar, while the CG obtained higher scores (41.3&#x000b1;8.6 versus 50.6&#x000b1;9.4;
p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Another study<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>, addressing 41 family members, verified the perception of individuals concerning
visitation to the intensive care unit and found that the feeling most frequently
mentioned at the time of visitation was anxiety, followed by distress and sorrow. It is
known that the visit in the immediate post-operatory period contributes to decrease the
anxiety of family members of patients who underwent a cardiac surgery<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Fear and insecurity, arising from uncertainty concerning the patient's
conditions after surgery, however, may be intensified if family members are not properly
informed about the situation. Such a fact might explain the findings of a study
conducted in Greece with the family members of surgical patients, aiming to determine
whether the visit to patients in the post-anesthetic care unit in the post-operatory
period would decrease the anxiety of family members. The results showed that scores
obtained in the STAI-State were higher before than after the visit (57 [23-80] versus 51
[21-77]; p=0.000008). The visit, however, did not significantly decrease anxiety levels
measured before and after the visit (from 76% to 58%, respectively)<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>These feelings become more intense when facing a cardiac surgery, the impact of which is
considerable, not only on patients but also on family members. Hence, care and support
should be offered to family members as they closely share the distress that involves the
perioperative period<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. In addition to providing printed pamphlets containing information regarding how
long the procedure lasts, informing the recovery room's routine and useful telephone
numbers, verbal interaction with a nurse from the sector where the patient will recover
can also minimize the anxiety of those waiting for news and an opportunity to visit the
patient<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Additionally, the mere fact of feeling properly treated by the service already
minimizes the feeling of helplessness and, as a consequence, anxiety.</p><p>When asked about how they felt before visiting the patient for the first time after
surgery, most family members from the IG answered "prepared and confident", while less
than half of the CG provided a positive answer. This finding shows that orientation
provided during this study's intervention contributed for family members to feel more
prepared, whether because of the nursing guidance provided or because of the reception
they received. The onset of a severe disease and the distress experienced by the family
cannot be prevented. Nonetheless, identifying the needs of families and planning
interventions that meet the real demands of both patient and family are essential for
the work of the nursing staff <sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Orientations provided to family members before the first visit in the immediate
post-operatory period are rare, leaving these individuals unprepared as to how to behave
towards the patient, what care is provided, and regarding the sector's dynamics. This
lack of preparation can cause emotional stress that negatively affects the visit. The
interaction between professionals and family members before the visit can alleviate
stress, a feeling that is common in this period, allowing the family to feel
reassured<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. One study aiming to determine the needs and experiences of patients and
families in the perioperatory period reports that the highest scores obtained by the
family members included in the study referred to the need to communicate with the
surgeon after the procedure, the opportunity to ask questions, and have concerns
clarified by the hospital's staff, in addition to having information regarding the
surgical procedure per se<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. The intervention conducted in this study is one strategy that can be used to
meet these needs because it enables interaction between family members and IPO
nurses.</p><p>In another study, the objective of which was to identify orientations nurses provided to
the family members of patients hospitalized in an ICU at the time of visitation, found
that 52.6% of the nurses provided orientation during the first visit; 36.8% reported
they did not provide any orientation; and 10.5% reported that orientation was provided
depending on the situation<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. There is a concern on the part of nurses to provide orientation to family
members during the first visit, while clarifying norms and routines and reporting the
condition of patients are among the individuals' main needs. There are, however,
different demands workers accompanying the patient and family need to meet in order to
establish a relationship of trust from the time the patient is admitted. The supply of
information improves the bond established between patient and institution, and with
professionals, consequently decreasing anxiety concerning the hospitalization period,
surgery, anesthesia and hospital routines, among other common doubts<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The communication process is key in the care provided to families. The attitudes of
family members can change after being properly oriented; the family becomes more
cooperative and confident toward the care provided. The nursing staff should meet these
needs and establish greater interaction with families, also perceiving them as clients
who demand care, so that integral care is provided, minimizing anxiety through the
establishment of trust, cooperation, understanding, acceptance of diagnosis and
procedures used, improving understanding and empathy, enabling family members to take
part in decision making regarding care delivery<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Not only the patient, but also those accompanying the patient should receive care. We
should only allow the family member to visit the patient after surgery; families need to
be prepared for the moment. It is known that the waiting period is tense and
distressing. Small actions on the part of the staff may go a long way. Situations that
for healthcare workers are commonplace, such as the monitoring of patients with sound
alarms and other devices, can be threatening for a concerned relative who waited hours
to see a patient. A lack of information can be interpreted as something more serious
than it really is. A family member who feels prepared and confident for the first visit
can better grasp the staff's work process and is not easily scared by seeing the
handling of equipment; on the contrary, (s)he is able to understand a patient's real
needs, most of which are temporary, and to collaborate with the care provided.</p><p>This study's limitations include the fact that anxiety was not assessed in the
pre-intervention period (baseline) because the family members usually arrived at the
waiting room approximately 30 minutes before visitation. Additionally, family members
accompanying patients for the first time were not compared with those who had this
experience. Therefore, there is a need to apply a statistical model considering
potential confounding variables. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A nursing intervention focused on providing guidance to family members at the time that
antecedes the first visit in the IPO unit of cardiac surgery helps decreasing the
anxiety of family members, making them feel more prepared for the visit, so that it is
more useful and beneficial to both families and patients.</p><p>Note that this is a low cost intervention that can be implemented in other contexts of
waiting rooms for surgical patients. We recommend, however, that further studies with
experimental designs, including pre- and post-intervention, be conducted to confirm the
results of this study.</p><p>Nursing interventions focused on family members implemented in health care services
humanize care delivery, strengthen the bonds between professionals and families and
contribute to the recovery of patients. As there are not always professionals available
and some are not properly prepared to provide information and interact with families, we
suggest, as a complementary strategy, to develop and distribute educational brochures to
clarify doubts. </p><p>This study contributes to the implementation of communication strategies directed to
family members of patients in the immediate post-operatory period, intended to improve
the nurse/patient/family relationship in line with the recovery process of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Munday</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kynoch</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hines</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effectiveness of information-sharing interventions as a means to
