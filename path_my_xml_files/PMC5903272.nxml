The validated arthritis-specific Work Productivity Survey assessed the impact of axSpA on work and household productivity and participation in social activities during the preceding month. Data are shown to Wk96, with responses compared between treatment arms (placebo vs CZP 200&#x02009;mg and 400&#x02009;mg dose groups combined) and subpopulations using a non-parametric bootstrap-t method.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, 63.2% of placebo and 72.0% of CZP patients were employed.

At home, by Wk24, CZP patients reported on average 3.0 household work days gained per month versus 1.3 for placebo.

The first question addresses employment status and provides information on job type for employed patients (non-manual, manual with no supervisory duties or mixed) and on the status of those not employed. For employed patients, three questions relate to work productivity outside the home. These assess, over the past month, absenteeism (full days of work missed due to axSpA); presenteeism (days with work productivity reduced by&#x000a0;&#x02265;50%&#x02009;due to arthritis); and the level of arthritis interference on work productivity (0&#x02013;10 scale; 0=no&#x02009;interference, 10=complete&#x02009;interference).</p><p>All patients, regardless of employment status, answer five questions about household work and daily activities. These questions assess, over the previous month, the number of days with no household work performed due to arthritis; days with household productivity reduced by&#x000a0;&#x02265;50%&#x02009;due to arthritis; days with outside help hired; days with family, social or leisure activities missed; and the level of arthritis interference with household productivity (0&#x02013;10 scale; 0=no&#x02009;interference, 10=complete&#x02009;interference).

The typical age of disease onset, in the third or fourth decade, is when many patients are in the midst of their working careers,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> and the resulting limitations in work productivity are likely to have substantial consequences for career progression. Loss of productivity also affects patients&#x02019; lives outside work, and patients with AS and nr-axSpA report significant reductions in their ability to participate in social and leisure activities, and general health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16 31</xref> In order to fully quantify the impact of an intervention on productivity, it is crucial to consider the entire productivity continuum both at work and at home.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p><p>The financial burden associated with axSpA is significant, and it has been suggested that costs associated with loss of productivity constitute the largest part of the total cost of illness of AS.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Patients with AS and, consequently, society are affected by substantial costs related to medications and healthcare provider expenses.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11 33</xref> Therefore, there is interest in understanding the impact of the entire spectrum of axSpA and potential axSpA treatments on work and household productivity.</p><p>The impact of treatment of axSpA on employment and household productivity has not been widely described. A review of the effects of anti-TNF treatment in patients with AS showed improvements in work absenteeism and presenteeism,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and a number of studies have reported that that&#x000a0;treatment with anti-TNF agents enabled patients with RA and AS with severe disease to return to work or work more productively.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 19 35 36</xref> It was also indicated that there is less future work disability in patients who responded to anti-TNF therapy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 19 35</xref> CZP and methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy has previously been found to improve productivity within and outside the home in patients with RA, where improvements were seen relative to placebo plus MTX.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Similarly, CZP treatment resulted in increased work and household productivity in patients with PsA.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</p><p>RAPID-axSpA is the first large, randomised controlled trial enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the baseline characteristics, burden of disease and treatment efficacy of an anti-TNF, allowing direct comparison of nr-axSpA and AS subpopulations in terms of economic burden.</p><p>In general, a higher burden of disease at study baseline was seen in patients with nr-axSpA than AS. This may be due to demographic differences in the two populations: in RAPID-axSpA, there were expected differences in age, gender and disease duration between AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations, consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> On average, patients with nr-axSpA were younger, with a shorter disease duration and a higher proportion of women. Baseline data suggest that axSpA has a substantial impact on work productivity, both at paid work outside home and within the home. These findings are consistent with previous reports of work disability and loss of productivity in patients with AS, indicating that the disease has a significant impact on employment status, ability to work and is associated with a high risk of premature retirement.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10 19 41</xref> Of note, a difference was observed in the proportion of patients employed at baseline between the CZP and placebo treatment arms due to chance in randomisation as patients were not stratified by employment status at baseline. These differences were seen prior to any study treatment being administered.</p><p>CZP treatment resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in workplace and household productivity. Significant reductions in absenteeism, presenteeism and axSpA interference with work, as well as improvements in household productivity and increased participation in social, family and leisure activities were observed as early as week 4&#x000a0;and maintained through to week 96. Similar improvements were reported in AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations. These results are consistent with the clinical improvements seen in response to CZP treatment in patients with axSpA<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> and indicate that CZP is a valuable therapeutic option. Increases in productivity may also contribute to improvements in patients&#x02019; health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
</p><p>A limitation of the current report is that the use of the clinical trial population, composed of patients with active disease, may not accurately represent the entire spectrum of patients with axSpA.</p><p>In summary, the results of the RAPID-axSpA trial demonstrate that treatment with CZP is efficacious in patients with axSpA, including the AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations, resulting in significant improvements in work and home productivity as well as increased participation in family, social and leisure activities over 96 weeks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients and their caregivers in addition to the investigators and their teams who contributed to this study.
