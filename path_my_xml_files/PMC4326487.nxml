It is used as a treatment for some autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus and Crohn's disease. Low-dose MXT has been used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for almost 50&#x000a0;years, is very effective and is recognised as treatment of choice and first-line therapy for many patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MXT is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, MXT competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, in rheumatoid arthritis it most likely acts by the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism or by inhibition of T cell activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There has been interest in using MXT in other conditions where excessive immune activation and inflammatory mediators are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis. For example, Gong <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] showed that in cardiac failure patients, low-dose MXT has significant anti-inflammatory effects and improved functional outcomes and quality of life. In an animal model of cardiac failure Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed that MXT has the ability to regulate inflammatory responses and improve cardiac function, hence contributing to prevent the development of post-myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p>There is growing evidence that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In our recent randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in Pakistan and Brazil, funded by the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), the addition of minocycline (an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drug) for 1&#x000a0;year to treatment as usual (TAU) reduced negative symptoms and improved some cognitive measures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies have noted increase in peripheral inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the brain, cytokines seem to be involved in regulating the action of several neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, and glutamate. The interaction of cytokines with dopamine and glutamate seems to be especially relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of cytokine changes in the peripheral blood has identified IL-12, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) as trait markers of schizophrenia because their levels were elevated during acute exacerbations and remission
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. An extensive meta-analysis by Potvin <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reports significant increases in <italic>in vivo</italic> peripheral levels of IL-1RA, sIL-2R, and IL-6 in schizophrenia patients, supporting evidence of immune activation and an inflammatory syndrome in schizophrenia. Studies show that IL-6 mediates the deleterious effects of noncompeting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists on cortical interneurons
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and cytokines have an impact on the regulation of neuroplasticity, cellular resilience, and apoptosis control
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. TNF-alpha seems to inhibit brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, compromising the protective effect of this neurotrophin.</p><p>A number of studies report that treatment with antipsychotic drugs affects the cytokine network
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This supports the rationale that the influence of antipsychotics on the cytokine systems may be responsible for their clinical efficacy in schizophrenia. Peripheral immune processes may be mirrored in the brain by microglial cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The 'microglia hypothesis of schizophrenia' suggests that the release of proinflammatory cytokines, kynurenines, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activated microglia might cause neuronal degeneration, white matter abnormalities and decreased neurogenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies during acute psychotic episodes in early schizophrenia suggest an activation of microglia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>If MXT, which is already on the market for the treatment of heart disease, cancer and rheumatic diseases, proves effective for reducing symptoms of schizophrenia then this could transform the suffering evidenced by patients which severely impairs their quality of life. Targeting the inflammatory response is a major focus of novel drug development especially relevant to the treatment of Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS). Based on the evidence of strong anti-inflammatory properties of MXT, we propose that low-dose MXT may be an effective therapy in early schizophrenia.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>AIMS</title><p>To test the prediction that addition of MXT to treatment as usual (TAU) for patients with early schizophrenia will result in following outcomes: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; To demonstrate that the trial design is acceptable to participants including randomisation to x arms</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; To demonstrate that the interventions are acceptable to participants and indicate likely attrition rates and tolerabilityImprovement in negative symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Improvement in positive symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Improvement in social functioning</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Improvement in cognitive functions</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview</title><p>This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of MXT added to TAU for patients suffering from schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified or schizophreniform disorder. The ethical approval covering all sites was obtained from the Research and Ethics Committee of the Pakistan Institute of Learning and Living and was submitted to the funding body, SMRI (Project Reference: PILL/SMRI/12627). Patients will be recruited from inpatient and outpatient settings. They will initially be approached by the treating psychiatrists and the multi-disciplinary teams (MDT). Patients will continue to take TAU during the trial. Although, the study assessments will be carried out by the research assistants (RAs), the responsible clinician (consultant psychiatrist) will remain in charge of the overall treatment. Antipsychotic dosage will be kept constant, unless clinically warranted, any changes will be recorded on monthly reviews.</p><p>After consenting to take part in the study, 72 patients will be randomised into two groups: 36 in each arm over the 3-month period. Full clinical assessments will be carried out at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks. Social and cognitive assessments will be carried out at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks (Table&#x000a0;

Allocation will be determined in Manchester by pseudo-random number generation by the trial statistician. The results will be conveyed to the trial pharmacist so that medication can be given to participants without anyone else on the team being aware of the allocation (that is, double-blind).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blinding</title><p>This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility study. Random allocation to treatments will be undertaken by a statistician who will have no knowledge of the patient characteristics. The details of the allocation will be concealed from the research team until all data collection has been completed. Blinding of participants and treating physicians to allocation status will be assured by identical capsule appearance, by identical labelling between placebo and the active drugs (apart from labels identifying the patient). Blinding of the capsules, packaging and labelling, will be undertaken by pharmacist independent of the study. Study investigators and researchers administering the assessment measures will not be aware of the study drug allocated to the individual. In the event a patient develops any side- effects, where drug unblinding is required, the treating physician will be made aware of the study drug, possible side-effects and make the appropriate decision whether to continue or discontinue the drug. The safety and wellbeing of the patient will be paramount at all times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical consideration</title><p>Our sample size consideration is based on the hypothesis that there will be a significant difference in changes from baseline to end-point on the clinical outcome measures and the cognitive function measures between the MXT group and the TAU group. With 32 participants per group, this study will have 80% power to detect a standardised effect size of 0.53 (medium by the definition of Cohen) by using a 2-sided significant level of 0.20. As this is a preliminary study, we used a less stringent significance level so as not to miss a promising effect rather than being too concerned by false positives. The estimated loss to follow-up rate is 10% and, therefore, a total of 72 patients (36 MXT, 36 TAU) are needed. Our sample size is adequate to estimate the parameters of acceptability and tolerability to the necessary degree of precision.</p><p>The planned analyses will be by intention-to-treat (ITT). Careful consideration will be given to the potential biases arising from the drop-out and missing data. Group differences in the change of clinical outcome measures and cognitive function measures at baseline to 12&#x000a0;weeks will be assessed using the <italic>t</italic>-test or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline differences. For repeatedly measured clinical outcomes at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks, we will also use generalised estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the effect of MXT treatment on longitudinal outcomes, including baseline values and time terms as covariates. GEE offers a robust method to take account of the within-subject correlation in longitudinal data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion/Exclusion criteria</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Signed informed consent, indicating that the subject understood the purpose of and procedures required for the study, before the initiation of any study specific procedures</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aged 18 to 35&#x000a0;years</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV</italic> (DSM-IV) diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified or schizophreniform disorder</p></list-item><list-item><p>Early schizophrenia (within first 5&#x000a0;years of diagnosis)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Competent and willing to give informed consent</p></list-item><list-item><p>Medication remained stable 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to baseline</p></list-item><list-item><p>Able to take oral medication and likely to complete the required evaluations</p></list-item><list-item><p>Female participants of child-bearing capability must be willing to use adequate contraceptives for the duration of the study, and willing to have a pregnancy test pre- treatment and at 10-weekly intervals while on study medication.
