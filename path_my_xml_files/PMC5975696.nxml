To treat this infection, the current standard of care includes intravenous anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics and obtaining adequate source control. Combination therapy with an aminoglycoside or rifampin, despite early promise, can no longer be routinely recommended due to an absence of proven benefit and risk of harm. Daptomycin is a rapidly acting bactericidal antibiotic that is approved for the treatment of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteremia as monotherapy but has not been shown to be superior to the current standard of care. As demonstrated in vitro, the addition of daptomycin to beta-lactam therapy may result in enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity. Our objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of prescribing the combination of daptomycin with cefazolin or cloxacillin for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA) bacteremia in adults. We hypothesize that adjunctive therapy with daptomycin will reduce the duration of bacteremia in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The DASH-RCT trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial designed per the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. We recruit adults with confirmed MSSA bacteremia, at the McGill University Health Center. Patients are eligible if they are 18&#x000a0;years or older, can receive cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy, and are enrolled within 72&#x000a0;h of the first blood culture being drawn. Exclusion criteria include anaphylaxis to study drugs, having polymicrobial bacteremia, anticipated hospital admission for &#x0003c;&#x02009;5 days, and healthcare team refusal. While receiving standard of care, study patients are randomized to a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The trial began in December 2016 and is expected to end in December 2018, after recruiting an estimated 102 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The DASH-RCT will compare the use of daptomycin as an adjunct to an anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam versus placebo in the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. We believe that a short course of dual therapy will result in earlier eradication of bacteremia and that subsequent research could evaluate effects on metastatic infection, relapse, and/or mortality. Ongoing issues in the trial include a delay between presentation of infection, enrollment in the trial, and the potential for unrecognized deep foci of infection at diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02972983">NCT02972983</ext-link>.

Despite effective antibiotics, approximately 20% of patients will die from the initial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and as many as 62% of patients will die within one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, approximately 30% of patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteremia will develop metastatic infection requiring prolonged antibiotic courses and, in certain cases, surgical intervention. The rates of these complications are increased in those who remain febrile and/or in those in whom bacteremia does not clear within 48 to 72&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, the timely clearance of bacteremia may be an important component in the management of these patients.</p><p id="Par15">The current management of methicillin-susceptible <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) bloodstream infection consists of adequate source control and anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam (ASBL) antibiotics, notably cloxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The duration of ASBL therapy is determined by the cause of MSSA bacteremia per international clinical practice standards. In short, uncomplicated MSSA bacteremia is treated for 2&#x000a0;weeks, complicated or disseminated infection for at least 4 weeks, and infective endocarditis for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par16">The use of adjuvant gentamicin combined with an ASBL was formerly advocated, as this combination was shown to reduce the duration of MSSA bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, due to aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity without a demonstrated reduction in mortality, this combination is no longer recommended in the treatment of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections outside of prosthetic valve infective endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, finding another synergistic drug that accelerates bacterial clearance without toxicity could prove a significant finding that could translate into a reduction in subsequent metastatic infection, recurrence, and/or mortality. To this end the role of combination therapy in the treatment of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections remains an area of active research interest. The combination of vancomycin and beta-lactam therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) bacteremia has been demonstrated to shorten the duration of bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and there is now an ongoing randomized controlled trial to investigate the potential superiority of daptomycin/vancomycin in combination with beta-lactams in the treatment of MRSA infections with complication-free survival at 90&#x000a0;days as the primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic active against both MSSA and MRSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This antibiotic acts in concert with calcium ions to insert itself into the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, oligomerize, and cause a positive curvature strain on the membrane&#x02019;s phospholipids. By changing the configuration of the bacterial cellular membrane, daptomycin induces rapid depolarization of the microbe and extravasation of cell contents, and results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Daptomycin&#x02019;s synergism with various beta-lactams has been demonstrated for several different Gram-positive cocci, notably <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The therapeutically active daptomycin-calcium complex has a net positive charge and must bind to the cell surface in order to exert its therapeutic effect. It has been demonstrated that beta-lactams can reduce a bacterial cell&#x02019;s surface charge, thereby enhancing the binding of the daptomycin complex to the cell wall and as a result, increasing its bactericidal effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These interactions have even demonstrated restoration of daptomycin susceptibility to previously non-susceptible <italic>Enterococci</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While much of the potential synergism has been demonstrated in <italic>Enterococci</italic>, there is evidence that this also applies to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. For example, it has been shown in vitro that beta-lactams can reduce the net positive charge of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cell membrane, resulting in increased drug binding and a subsequent reduction in the organism&#x02019;s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to daptomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Combinations of oxacillin and daptomycin have demonstrated synergistic activity in vitro against MSSA isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and against MRSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, treatment with daptomycin and a beta-lactam appears to result in increased bactericidal activity.</p><p id="Par18">Daptomycin is licensed for the treatment of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> bacteremia including strains that are methicillin-susceptible. However, it is not currently the standard of care due to a lack of direct comparison to ASBLs in the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. <italic>aureus</italic> bacteremia.</p><p id="Par19">To investigate the potential role of adjuvant daptomycin in the treatment of MSSA infections, we designed the &#x0201c;Daptomycin as Adjunctive therapy for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Bacteremia&#x0201d; trial (DASH-RCT).

This analysis will be reviewed by an independent Safety Monitoring Board comprising two physicians and one statistician who are not appointed to the division of Infectious Diseases and are not involved in the study. They have the authority to stop the study if there is significant evidence of benefit or harm (primary outcome, primary safety outcome) based on the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming alpha-spending approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">All statistical analyses will be performed using statistical software including STATA 15.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA), SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and/or R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">The objective of the DASH-RCT is to assess whether patients receiving an ASBL and daptomycin are at reduced risk of prolonged bacteremia. We hope that an improvement in this endpoint might be associated with a reduction in metastatic infections, recurrence, and mortality. Our goal is to assess whether daptomycin is a good candidate to be studied in a larger study powered for those outcomes. Ultimately, we would like to determine whether the standard of care for MSSA bacteremia should become combination therapy with an ASBL and daptomycin.</p><p id="Par50">There are several limitations to the DASH-RCT trial. First, the identification of MSSA in blood cultures and the subsequent enrollment of the patient in the trial is delayed by the need to identify the microorganism in the laboratory. As a result, patients may be exposed to a variety of open-label broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to trial enrollment for up to 72&#x000a0;h. While we believe there will not be bias in these between the arms of the study due to randomization, there is a possibility of such imbalance, which will need to be considered. We have put into place techniques (see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>) for early identification of MSSA from positive blood cultures and enroll on evenings and weekends to minimize delays. Unfortunately, these early identification techniques could lead to early misidentification of MSSA in approximately 3% of patients (based on unpublished but extensive local verification studies) and those patients would need to be excluded. However, using our modified tube coagulase test (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>), rapid MRSA testing (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>), and accounting for known MRSA colonization status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] allows us to recruit patients into the study as close to presentation as possible, while maintaining specificity. Second, as the organism may have already disseminated at the time of species identification, the ability to evaluate whether daptomycin can limit metastatic spread may be diminished. We chose to assess patients for clinically relevant embolic or metastatic MSSA disease as evaluated by the treating team, which has been previously validated as a clinical outcome in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. While we record clinically significant metastatic events at enrollment and follow up, for cost and diagnostic stewardship reasons we will not perform extensive imaging at the time of randomization nor systematically search for embolic disease during the trial, which is in keeping with other large randomized controlled trials involving <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As we do not anticipate differential allocation of patients with early metastatic disease to a specific arm, a difference in clinically relevant events between groups would be suggestive (but not definitive) of a drug effect. This secondary endpoint should thus remain informative despite the absence of additional diagnostic procedures performed throughout the study.</p><p id="Par51">To mitigate the previously mentioned limitations, we could have enrolled all patients with presumed staphylococcal infection per the presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters on Gram stain of positive blood cultures. Rapid enrollment would have reduced the time between presentation and initiation of the study drugs at the cost of increased post-randomization exclusions. Indeed, more patients would have been recruited with MRSA blood stream infections or blood culture contamination due to coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>. Advances in earlier diagnosis using a molecular microbiologic technique could provide the opportunity for earlier enrollment without enrolling patients with non-relevant Gram-positive cocci.</p><p id="Par52">Second, many patients enrolled in the trial will be expected to be clear of bacteremia by the time of enrollment, as only approximately 30&#x02013;40% of Staphylococcal bacteremia persists. It is very difficult to predict in advance who these patients will be and the study sample size has been chosen to allow for this. Due to the lag in identification of bacteremia, it is impossible to avoid the enrollment of patients who may have already be clear of bacteremia at enrollment. Nevertheless, this limitation will apply to both the study group and the placebo group and therefore the role of adjunctive daptomycin in mitigating complications of the bacteremia will still be of interest. Moreover, we have also pre-planned a modified intention-to-treat analysis to look only at those who still have bacteremia when they start the study drug.</p><p id="Par53">Despite the aforementioned limitations, we believe that the DASH-RCT is founded in rigorous methodology and examines a biologically plausible hypothesis. Our study may demonstrate that daptomycin in combination with an ASBL results in faster clearance of MSSA bacteremia than the current standard of care. Prescribing a short course of daptomycin at the Health Canada and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dose will limit potential dose-dependent toxicities. Benefits similar to combination therapy with aminoglycosides may then be demonstrated, but with reduced rates of adverse events. If our hypotheses hold true, further trials to evaluate daptomycin as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of MSSA-associated diseases will be warranted. However, given that the mortality associated with MSSA bacteremia is approximately 20%, a significantly larger randomized controlled trial would be required to demonstrate a survival benefit of using combination therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par54">The DASH-RCT began enrolling patients on 1 December 2016.
