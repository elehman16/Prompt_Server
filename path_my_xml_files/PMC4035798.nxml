The objective of this trial is to study the effects of two treatment schemes following total knee arthroplasty: conventional treatment following discharge from hospital and early follow-up by telephone consultations in addition to conventional treatment following discharge from hospital. The ultimate aim is to increase the effectiveness of the treatment by improving patients' health status, promote self-efficacy, and reduce the number of acute visits to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic during the rehabilitation period.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>The design is a randomized un-blinded parallel group clinical trial conducted at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Gentofte Hospital, the Capital Region of Denmark. In total, 116 patients will be allocated by an external randomization program to 2 groups: an intervention group following usual treatment after discharge supplemented by a nurse managed structured follow-up consultation conducted by telephone 4 and 14&#x000a0;days after discharge from hospital and a control group following treatment as usual. The consultations are structured by key subjects relevant to assess the health status according to the VIPS-model (the Swedish acronym for the concepts Well-being, Integrity, Prevention and Safety). The content of the consultations can vary according to the patients&#x000b4; individual situations and needs. All consultations are conducted by the researcher responsible for the trial.</p><p>The effect is measured 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-surgery. The primary outcome is self-reported physical function measured by The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index. Secondary outcomes are self-reported health-related quality of life, general self-efficacy and the number of acute visits to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The result of this trial is expected to provide new knowledge to support the development of targeted and effective follow-up after total knee arthroplasty in order to improve the patients&#x000b4; health-related knowledge and skills of being able to take actively part in their illness and improve their health status.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01771315?term=telephone+follow-up&#x00026;rank=12">NCT01771315</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Telephone follow-up</kwd><kwd>Health status</kwd><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The number of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures is increasing and estimated to 1.4 million worldwide in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Denmark approximately 9000 TKA procedures are performed annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The main clinical indication for TKA is osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] causing severe pain and substantial functional disabilities, leading to a decrease in health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>TKA is a common procedure that, despite of low level of mortality and complications, entails a severe surgical trauma and a protracted recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The implementation of the fast-track programs for surgical patients has reduced the stay in hospital for TKA-patients, and the length of stay is now only around 3&#x000a0;days in several Danish surgical centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Commonly the patients are discharged to home and referred to physiotherapy in the community settings, with only one scheduled follow-up by the surgeon 3&#x000a0;months post-surgery.</p><p>During the early rehabilitation period TKA- patients have experienced several health problems especially physical ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a survey conducted at Gentofte University Hospital in 2011, 96% out of 86 patients identified 1&#x02013;7 physical postoperative health problems two to three weeks after undergoing TKA (unpublished observations by the researcher responsible for this trial). The health-related information given during the admission course has been difficult to transfer to the home settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and following discharge the patients have needed further guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the problems were apparent, the patients were reluctant to contact health professionals due to a belief that their problems were too insignificant to bother health care providers with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. During the rehabilitation period the experience of inadequate preparation for physical symptoms and psychological reactions, as well as unrealistic expectations to activity level have led to anxiety, depression and disappointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] to the extent of affecting the patients&#x000b4; general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Self-efficacy is the degree of belief of having adequate action-oriented resources to control events affecting the everyday life successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Self-efficacy is positively correlated with physical and mental aspects of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Self-efficacy is an important parameter during the rehabilitation period following TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] by influencing physical function and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for the study</title><p>Follow-up interventions after discharge of TKA patients have especially focused on the effect of various programs for physiotherapy. Internet based as well as home-based physiotherapy was assessed to be as effective as outpatient physiotherapy measured by physical function and health-related quality of life, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. An intensive outpatient physiotherapy program additional to standard care (home-based exercise program) improved physical functional ability and health related quality of life compared to standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Postoperative exercise is a highly prioritized part of the TKA treatment, aiming at improving the ability to practice daily activities immediately after surgery as well as maximizing the long term functional benefit of TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the early rehabilitation period after TKA is characterized by a broad range of physical as well as mental symptoms as mentioned in the introduction.</p><p>A standardized follow-up program involving an exit video with role models, extra information through newsletters about the rehabilitation process, two telephone calls and weekly telephone hours was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. The trial included 103 patients undergoing total knee and total hip arthroplasty eligible for a short stay (less than 6&#x000a0;days) in hospital and showed no effect on self-efficacy, social support and pain coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The program was not designed to provide individual counselling according to the patients&#x000b4; personal circumstances and the progress during their rehabilitation period. In contrast a structured telephone follow-up focusing on individual care in regard to physical, social and mental aspects of the rehabilitation period had a positive effect on physical function, as well as general and mental health in 122 patients aged 65&#x000a0;years or older undergoing total hip arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is assumed that it is possible to retrieve a corresponding positive effect for patients undergoing TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of a structured nurse managed telephone follow-up in the early rehabilitation period, based on the patient&#x000b4;s individual situation related to physical as well as psychosocial problems following TKA.</p><p>We hypothesize that telephone follow-up as a supplement to conventional treatment will improve health status and self-efficacy and reduce the number of acute clinical outpatient consultations after TKA compared to conventional treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>The study is designed as a randomized single centre parallel group clinical trial.

Discharge is scheduled 2&#x02013;3 days post-surgery based on the following criteria: able to manage personal hygiene by themselves, to walk with one or two crutches, and to climb stairs. The patients are referred to physiotherapy in the community settings, to removal of stitches or stables by their general practitioner, and to an outpatient consultation by the surgeon 3&#x000a0;months post-surgery.</p><p>All participants follow the conventional course of treatment for TKA-patients including the program for patient education pre-surgery conducted by a surgeon, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and a nurse, focusing on the surgical intervention, possible complications and risks, the admission course, and introduction to physical exercise training and equipment.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The participants allocated to the intervention group receive telephone follow-up 4 and 14&#x000a0;days post discharge in addition to conventional treatment. A uniform structure of the consultations is based on key subjects for nursing status defined by the VIPS-model (the Swedish acronym for the concepts Well-being, Integrity, Prevention and Safety). The VIPS-model is a process-oriented documentation model developed to generate structured general information about the patient&#x02019;s condition, needs, desires, problems and resources relevant for nursing to provide adequate nursing interventions and evaluation of the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The nursing status is based on predefined key subjects identified as relevant to assess the health status in the course of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The telephone follow-up consultations are structured and contain the following key subjects: communication, cognition/development, breathing/circulation, nutrition, elimination, sleep, pain/perception, skin/tissue, sexuality/reproduction, activity and psychosocial /spirituality/culture. The themes are supplemented with specific issues relevant to health status after TKA in regard to treatment and observation of the wound and the operated limb, management of painkillers, and ability to exercise as recommended. However, the course of the consultations may vary due to the individual needs of the patients.</p><p>All interventions are conducted by the researcher responsible for this trial. The adherence of the protocol for the intervention is assessed by audiotaping consultations executed the first Wednesday in each month. Subsequently the records are checked by an external research assistant to ensure compliance with the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures are collected at baseline defined by 3&#x000a0;days after discharge from hospital, and 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-surgery. These data are obtained by self-administered questionnaires mailed to the patients, except for the questionnaire for baseline data, as the first questionnaires are handed to the patients just before discharge. The patients are contacted by phone once by research assistants if questionnaires are not received by the researcher 7&#x000a0;days after scheduled date for answering.</p><p>It is recommended to use a disease-specific health status measure supplemented by a generic measure of health-related quality of life to fully assess outcomes after TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

The consecutive enrolment and external web-based randomization with a block unknown to persons involved in this trial ensure random allocation and maintain concealment of the allocation sequence, as the patients and the persons enrolling patients cannot foresee the assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the randomization process is executed just before discharge from hospital to avoid the outcome of the randomization to influence the counselling and information during hospitalization.</p><p>In non-pharmacological trials the care providers and the patients are frequently un-blinded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The lack of blinding could affect the estimate of the treatment effect positively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In this trial neither the patients nor the person conducting the consultations are blinded after the randomization, because it is impossible to hide whether the patients receive consultation or not. The participants who are assigned to receive a new treatment including extra follow-up may have favourable expectations, and those assigned to conventional treatment may be disappointed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, the patients have no previous experiences of the rehabilitation period after TKA and hereby no basis for comparison of any gain of the follow-up consultations with conventional treatment after being discharged following TKA. Furthermore, the control group has no knowledge of the content of the consultations, and contact between patients post discharge with opportunity to discuss benefits or disadvantages of follow-up consultations are unlikely. However, it cannot be excluded that the patients meet by chance at follow-up in the outpatient clinic.</p><p>Deviation from the protocol after randomization is expected, since some patients will withdraw, some may be unavailable at the times set for the consultations, and some may not return the questionnaires. Exclusion of the patients deviating from the protocol destroys the distribution of similar characteristics in the two groups and could influence the estimation of the effect of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Intention to treat analysis will be performed including all randomized patients providing the least bias when comparing results between the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The drop-out rate can be expected to increase during the 12&#x000a0;months follow-up period and rapid response to unreturned questionnaires is executed by telephone calls to minimize the drop-out rate.</p><p>All interventions in this trial are conducted by the first author, reflecting the practice of that specific nurse and representing a positive attitude to the intervention, which could influence the outcome positively. The performance of the intervention will not reflect the intervention in an everyday clinical practice, which is influenced by the skills and attitudes of a range of nurses and the intervention needs to be tested in every day nursing practice to enhance generalizability. Random checks by audiotaping the intervention sessions and documentation in case report forms, assess treatment adherence essential to be able to appraise the feasibility and reproducibility of the intervention in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>The effect of follow-up consultations by telephone after TKA has not previously been studied. Patient satisfaction with care related to information and contact with health professionals during stay in hospital was positively correlated with self-perceived health status up to 12&#x000a0;months after total hip and knee arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and a long term effect of telephone follow-up consultations after TKA cannot be excluded. Due to timing and content of the intervention the effect is expected to be strongest and with the stated clinical relevant difference in scores between groups in the early recovery period.</p><p>Selection of patients enrolled in a trial may lead to problems with generalizability if the selected population differs in important ways to the more general one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The practical value of a trial is supported by enrolling patients with characteristics that reflect the range and distribution of patients observed in clinical practice for a particular problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. To enhance generalizability, all patients admitted are consecutively enrolled in this trial if they meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. However, the sample in this trial will only represent the group of patients with a short stay in hospital, which minimizes the time for health-related counselling and information, but also increases the possibility of a positive outcome of the study.</p><sec><title>Perspective</title><p>This trial can be categorized as a pragmatic clinical trial with hypothesis and study design based on information needed to make decisions in the clinical practice. The trial addresses practical questions concerning benefits of the intervention as they will occur in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The results can provide new knowledge to support the development of targeted and effective follow-up after TKA, in order to improve the patients&#x000b4; health-related knowledge and skills and enable the patients to take actively part in their handling of their illness and thereby improve health status.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors took part in designing the study, developing the protocol and drafting the manuscript.
