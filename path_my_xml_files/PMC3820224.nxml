level laser therapy is more effective in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia of multiple
sclerosis patients. [Methods] Thirty multiple sclerosis patients of both sexes
participated in this study. The age of the subjects ranged from 40 to 60&#x02005;years and their
mean age was (56.4&#x02013;6.6). Participants were randomly selected from Dental and Neurology
Outpatient Clinics at King Khalid Hospital, Najran University, Saudi Arabia. Patients were
randomly divided into two equal groups of 15. The Laser group received a low level laser
therapy, 830&#x02005;nm wavelength, 10&#x02005;Hz and 15&#x02005;min duration, while the Electromagnetic group
received repetitive transcranial electromagnetic stimulation at a frequency of 10&#x02005;Hz,
intensity of 50 mA and duration of 20 minutes. Patients were assessed pre and post
treatment for degree of pain using a numerical rating scale, maximal oral mouth opening
using a digital calibrated caliper, masseter muscle tension using a tensiometer and a
compound action potentials of masseter and temporalis muscles. [Results] There were
significant improvements after treatment in both groups, with a significant difference
between the Electromagnetic and Laser groups, in favor of the Electromagnetic group.
[Conclusion] Repetitive transcranial electromagnetic stimulation at 10&#x02005;Hz, 50 mA, and 20
minutes duration is more effective than low level laser therapy at reducing trigeminal
pain, increasing maximum oral mouth opening, masseter and temporalis muscle tension in
multiple sclerosis patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Trigeminal neuralgia</kwd><kwd>Low level laser</kwd><kwd>Trans-cranial electromagnetic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an uncommon disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of
facial pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution. Typically, brief attacks are triggered by
talking, chewing, teeth brushing, shaving, a light touch, or even a cool breeze<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pain is nearly unilateral, and it may
occur repeatedly throughout the day. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden,
severe, brief, stabbing, and recurrent episodes of facial pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence ratio is 4 per 100,000 in the population, and
commonly affects patients over 50&#x02005;years, occurring more frequently in women than men with a
ratio of 1.5&#x02013;2:1, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
also more common in patients with multiple sclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. TN is associated with decreased quality of life and impairment of
daily function. It impacts upon employment in 34% of patients and depressive symptoms are
not uncommon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The condition may be
severely disabling with high morbidity particularly among the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is evident that trigeminal pain occurs in multiple
sclerosis because of pressure on the trigeminal nerve root at the entry zone into the
pontine region of the brain stem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.Compression or insufficiency of blood supply may cause local pressure,
leading to demyelination of the trigeminal nerve axon which causes ectopic action potential
generation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. TN is almost always
unilateral with the maxillary branch being most commonly affected and the ophthalmic branch
the least<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain attacks usually last from
a few seconds to 2&#x02005;min and may recur spontaneously between pain-free intervals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trans-cranial magnetic simulation (TMS) is a technique for stimulating of the human brain.
A noninvasive stimulation technique, Repetitive Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS),
may be suitable for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain as it modulates neural
activities not only in the stimulated area, but also in remote regions that are
interconnected to the site of stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prolonged pain relief can be obtained by
repeating rTMS sessions every day for several weeks at 10 HZ frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A low-level laser (LLLR) produces photo-biochemical reactions that result in pain relief.
Considering the effect of neurotransmitters on nerves, LLLR are expected to be effective in
eliminating all kinds of pain that result from nerve irritation and nociceptor excitation
(neuropathic pain)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. LLLR can reduce
pain of inflammatory origin through their anti-inflammatory properties. Also, low-level
lasers have been shown to be effective in alleviating oral and maxillofacial pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hypothesis of the current study was
that there are no differences between rTMS and LLLR treatments. The purpose of the current
study was to determine which of rTMS or LLLR better reduces trigeminal pain, increases low
oral mouth opening and improves the power of the masseter and temporalis muscles in TN of
multiple sclerosis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Demographic characteristics of the patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LG (n=15)<break/>M &#x000b1; SD</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MG (n=15)<break/>M &#x000b1; SD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.8&#x000b1;6.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.6&#x000b1;9.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.3&#x000b1;6.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.8&#x000b1;8.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of illness (month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.12&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.95&#x000b1;0.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>LG: Laser group, MG: Electromagnetic group, M: mean, SD: standard deviation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>This study was conducted at Dental and Neurology Outpatients Clinics at King Khalid
Hospital, Najran University, Saudi Arabia. Thirty multiple sclerosis patients with TN (of
all branches) of both sexes were randomly selected and participated in this study.
Diagnosis was carried out by a neurologist through the use of physical examination and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients' ages ranged from 40 to 60&#x02005;years and their mean
age was 56.4 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x02005;years. The weights of the subjects ranged from 60 to 80&#x02005;kg, and their
mean weight was 75.00&#x02013;7.7&#x02005;kg. Classical TN was diagnosed according to the International
Classification of Headache Disorders2 Criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the duration of illness ranged from 6 to 12 months (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Pain during attacks should not be less
than six according to a numerical rating scale (NRS), with no satisfactory medical pain
relief in the last three months. Patients were conscious, co-operative and free from
psychological disorders (as documented by a psychologist), and disabilities secondary to
orthopedic problems or special senses impairments. Patients were excluded if they had TN
secondary to tumor, herpes zoster or any another causes, i.e. serious cardiopulmonary
dysfunction, past invasive treatment (radiofrequency, ethanol, glycerinum injection,
Gama-knife microvascular decompression) or coagulation dysfunction. Patients were randomly
divided into two equal groups of 15 by a random allocation method (thirty folded papers
were allocated in a bag, with two series of 15 papers on which were written either LG or
MG and every patient had the chance to choose one folded paper).</p><p>The Laser group (LG) consisted of 15 patients whose ages ranged from 40 to 58&#x02005;years with
a mean age of 48.80&#x02013;6.3&#x02005;years, and a weight range of 65 to 88&#x02005;kg, with mean weight of

with the equipment to be psychologically assured and to familiarize themselves with the
treatment steps. The treatment was performed three times per week on consecutive days for
eight weeks of total twenty four sessions.</p><p>The pain intensity of all patients was assessed using NRS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> (0=no pain, 5=moderate pain, 10=worst pain), when patients were
not under medication. The masseter and temporalis muscle compound motor action potentials
of all patients were measured before and after treatment.</p><p>The subjects were seated comfortably upright and were asked not to move their heads
during recordings. A stimulating needle electrode was placed intra-orally on the nerve
branch at the medial angle of the mandible. The recording electrodes were positioned on
the masseter muscle belly parallel to muscular &#x0fb01;bres about 3&#x02005;cm above and anterior to the
mandibular angle, two centimeters distance from the two recording electrodes. This
electrode placement was demonstrated to be optimal for avoiding cross-talk responses from
facial muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The electrode over
the anterior temporalis was placed just in front of the hairline; the reference electrode
was placed just above the eyebrow. The signals were amplified, filtered, and digitized at
1,000&#x02005;Hz by the Spike 2 system (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the assessment of maximal Active
mouth opening range, patients were asked to open their mouths as much as possible with
their heads fixed, and the vertical distance between upper and lower teeth was measured
using a calibrated caliper with 1&#x02005;mm accuracy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the assessment of muscle
power, patients were instructed to tightly clench their mouth as much as possible for
assessment of masseter muscle power, and the amount of tension was recorded by a
tensiometer.</p><p>Subjects in the Laser group were treated with a low power 15mW helium-neon laser of wave
length 830A units and a laser beam density of 150&#x02013;170 mw/cm<sup>2</sup> for irradiation.
The treatment was first given intra-orally following the path of the nerve branch for
1&#x02013;2&#x02005;min, then extra-orally on the most tender points for 10&#x02005;min. In the sitting position,
the contact laser technique was used on the skin overlying the four tender points of the
face<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects in the electromagnetic group received repetitive TMS at
a frequency of 10&#x02005;Hz, 50 mA intensity, and 20 minutes duration. In the sitting position
with all metal objects removed the splenoid was applied tangentially over the patient's
head, and held on one side (contra-lateral to trigeminal pain). A rest period of 10
minutes after application was allowed for all patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of both
groups were statistically analyzed to compare the differences within each group and the
differences between the two groups. The statistical package of social sciences (SPSS,
version 10) was used for data processing and a p=0.05, as the level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison between pretreatment mean values of NRS, masseter muscle tension,

pretreatment mean values (respectively p=0.001 and p=0.003) (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Significant differences was found between the
post-treatment values of the two groups, with the best results in MG (masseter, p=0.001 and
temporalis CAP, p=0.003) (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The purpose of the study was to determine which of transcranial electromagnetic stimulation
or low level laser therapy is more effective for trigeminal neuralgia of multiple sclerosis
patients. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has been used clinically and some researchers have
reported the efficacy of LLLT in the treatment of various pain conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, there were
significant improvements in TN compared to pretreatment measurements and the results of NRS
indicated a slight but significant reduction in facial pain. Patients also noted a reduction
in their anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the present results showed a significant improvement in
maximal mouth opening after application of LLLT. These findings are in agreements with
reports of significant reduction in pain and improvements of range of motion after 3 months
of LLLT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study showed a strong relationship between the application of repetitive
transcranial electromagnetic stimulation and the improvement of TN symptoms. There was
reduction of pain according to NRS. These results are in agreement with those of another
study that applied the TMS at 5&#x02005;Hz to treat orofacial pain patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, 10&#x02005;Hz rTMS was applied to treat TN
patients and there was a highly significant improvement in maximal mouth opening. This
result was confirmed by other result who demonstrated that application of rTMS at 5&#x02005;Hz or
more was able to relieve neuropathic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, this was also in agreement with the study that applied four
different frequencies (0.5&#x02005;Hz, 1&#x02005;Hz, 5&#x02005;Hz and 10&#x02005;Hz) of rTMS to treat patients with
orofacial pain ; the best results was at 10&#x02005;Hz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The efficacy of rTMS in producing significant analgesia seems to
depend on a precise targeting the frequency. It has been reported that application of rTMS
sessions over the motor cortex can produce excitatory changes in the brain and induce
excitation of the muscles action potentials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The application of low frequency TMS may alter cerebral
excitability, brain rhythms, and a variety of human behaviors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study found that there were improvements in the masseter muscle tension in
bothtreatment groups with the best results in rTMS group. These findings are supported by
other studies that reported significant improvement in the cervical muscle together with
significant improvements in the range of motion and relief of pain due to an inhibitory
effect on neural discharges around the stimulated cortical areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The study concluded that repetitive transcranial electromagnetic stimulation at 10&#x02005;Hz and
50 mA, for 20&#x02005;min is considered more effective than low level laser therapy at reducing
trigeminal pain, and improving the maximum mouth opening, and masseter and temporalis muscle
tensions of multiple sclerosis Patients. It is also considered more useful and safe modality
than drugs for other orofacial dysfunctions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>RECOMMENDATION</title><p>We recommend the investigation of the long-term effects of both rTMS and LLLT in various
