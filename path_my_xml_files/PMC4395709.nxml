outcome. Our study aim was to establish whether a low-dose botulinum toxin A (BTX-A)
injection in subacute stroke patients can improve spasticity, gait, and daily living
abilities. [Subjects] Twenty-three subacute stroke patients were randomly allocated to
BTX-A treatment group (11 patients) and control group (12 patients). [Methods] In the
BTX-A treatment group patients, 200 units BTX-A was injected into the triceps surae (150
iu) and posterior tibial (50 iu) by electrical stimulation-guided. The patients in the
control group received the same volume of placebo solution into the same injection
locations. Gait analysis (step length, cadence, speed), the 6-min walking test, Fugl-Meyer
Assessment (FMA) of the lower limbs, modified Ashworth scale assess (MAS) assessment of
the lower limbs, surface electromyography (sEMG), and modified Barthel index (MBI)
assessment were performed before and at 4,8 weeks after treatment. [Results] We found that
the FMA of the low limbs and MBI were significantly improved in both groups. The gait
analysis, FMA, and MBI results in the BTX-A treatment group were better than those in the
control group. MAS and surface electromyography (sEMG) showed better improvement of
spasticity in the treatment group. [Conclusion] Early low-dose botulinum toxin A (BTX-A)
injection in subacute stroke patients into the lower-limb may improve gait, spasticity,
and daily living abilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Botulinum toxin A</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Spasticity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In patients with lower-limb spasticity after stroke, spastic equinus foot represents a
prolonged abnormal lower-limb posture and affects gait, standing, and transfer<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Poststroke lower-extremity spasticity may
cause severe functional limitations and pain. Spasticity is a phenomenon defined as
disordered sensorymotor control, resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion and presenting
as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles. Stroke often affects
sensorimotor networks and descending tracts, as reflected by the negative and positive signs
of upper motor neurone (UMN) syndrome<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Spasticity causes motor incoordination, which is more associated with gait speed than
positive features<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spasticity may
interfere with motor function and is a common reason for clinical interventions such as
physiotherapy, use of orthoses, or other technical devices or drugs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is a potent neurotoxin
produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. BTX-A blocks acetylcholine release at
neuromuscular junctions, which accounts for its therapeutic action in relieving dystonia,
spasticity, and related disorders. Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin are used to
target one or more of the positive signs of UMN syndrome<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The reported prevalence of spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) at 3
months or later after first-ever stroke in studies of unselected, consecutive patients after
stroke is around 20% or higher<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Early identification of potentially disabling spasticity is
important to enable preventive intervention. Patients with initially severe limb paresis are
at higher risk for developing spasticity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Unfortunately, intramuscular injections of botulinum are often carried out when the
patients have obvious spasticity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
normally given once the clinical signs of elevated muscle tone have become established;
therefore, it is usually given at least three months after stroke<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This will
impede rehabilitation of the patients. Accordingly, the present pilot study asked whether
early lower-limb injection of low-dose botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) in severely affected
patients within 4&#x02013;6 weeks after stroke could help to prevent disabling muscle stiffness and
walking dysfunction 8 weeks later.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a single-center phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study.
Patients were recruited from the stroke/neurology units or rehabilitation department of Sir
Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University. All patients gave informed
consent. The study had ethics permission from the ethics committees of the College of
Medicine of Zhejiang University.</p><p>Adults with hemiplegic stroke and severe or moderately severe spasticity following stroke
were recruited. The inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows:</p><p>1. They were over the age of 18 and less than 80&#x02005;years and had had a stroke within 6
weeks.</p><p>2. They had slight spasticity of the triceps surae as defined by a score of 1&#x02013;1+ on the MAS
or ankle clonus (+).</p><p>3. They had sufficient cognitive and communication ability as defined by an MMSE

These patients were randomly assigned with the help of a computer-generated
list to either the experimental or control group.</p><p>In group A patients (experimental group, n=11), an experienced physician injected 200 units
BTX-A (Allergan, 1&#x02005;ml dilution per vial) by electrical stimulation-guided (Dantec
CLAVIS<sup>TM</sup>, REF 9015A0011) into the gastrocnemius (medial and lateral head of the
gastrocnemius, 100 units), the soleus (50 units), and the posterior tibial muscle (50
units). Group B (control group, n=12) patients received the same volume of placebo solution
into the same number of injections of the same muscles. There was no other specific
treatment other than the injections. Both groups received comprehensive rehabilitation. This
included physiotherapy (45 minutes every workday) and occupational therapy (30 minutes every
workday). Gait training was also performed. The therapy combined elements of the
neurodevelopmental technique and motor relearning program.</p><p>The outcome measures were evaluated at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, and 8. Fugl-Meyer assessment
(FMA) of the lower limbs, modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) assessment of the lower limbs,
surface electromyography (sEMG), and the modified Barthel index (MBI), were assessed. At the
end of the research, we also performed a gait analysis (step length, cadence,speed) and
6-min walking test in every patient. Muscle tone was assessed with the help of the MAS
scores (0&#x02013;4). The MAS is widely used for the assessment of muscle tone and spasticity in the
lower limbs<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Investigators were trained in the procedures to assess the MAS
ankle score. Patients were assessed in the prone position and knee extension. The ankle was
examined at the edge of an examination table and from maximal plantar flexion through to
maximal dorsal flexion for the MAS ankle score. None of the patients had contracture or
joint ankylosis, which would limit ROM. Lower-limb motor control was assessed with the help
of the Fugl-Meyer motor score (0&#x02013;34). Surface EMG electrodes were placed over the lateral
and medial gastrocnemius. Where available, guide lines written by the Surface
Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles group were adopted for the
surface electromyography procedures<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The starting position for all ankle assessments was the prone position and knee extension.
The ankle was initially moved from maximal plantar flexion through to maximal dorsal
flexion. For the analysis of spasticity of the gastrocnemius, the average integrated sEMG
levels were calculated during slow passive dorsiflexion of the ankle. We assessed every
patient 3 times in each assessment and took the average value.</p><p>The SPSS 14.0 software was used for the statistical analyses. Descriptive summary
statistics for differences between the mean scores and mean change from baseline (SD) for
all other secondary measures are presented. Within-group and between-group comparisons were
carried out using, respectively, paired and independent t-tests. Dichotomous variables were
analysed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. A Kruskal-Wallis test was initially carried out on the
baseline data to test for any differences between the two groups. The level of statistical
significance was set as p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The clinical and demographic data at baseline were comparable (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-three patients completed the study. Side effects

spasticity can suffer from impaired walking ability that includes equinus foot;
consequently, this disability negatively affects performance of the patient&#x02019;s activities of

the first month after a stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, but

at this early stage (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This finding is
in agreement with a study that evaluated the early development of spasticity in a severely
impaired population<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A neurolytic agent
lessened the spasticity-related intermittent or sustained involuntary muscle activity of the
ankle flexors, so that the joints were held in a less fixed position. This also again might
have delayed and/or diminished the subsequent contracture development, resulting in reduced
muscle stiffness at follow-up. Cosgrove reported that the intramuscular injection of BTX-A
prevented the development of contractures<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subacute stroke patients would benefit from early BTX-A injection. It would reduce the
degree of spasticity in lower limb muscles. It also provides a valuable time window for
patients to receive the therapy, which is concentrated on mobilization of the lower
extremity joints in conjunction with tone-inhibiting and facilitating manoeuvres. We
speculated that an early lower-limb BTX-A injection in subacute stroke patients with a
nonfunctional lower extremity (defined as a LEMI &#x0003c; 10) might improve their functional
outcome. It may be that by changing the time course of spasticity development, the
functional outcome may have been influenced. While this could stem directly from the
botulinum toxin, an altered time course of spasticity may have allowed for improved
effectiveness of therapy during the acute rehabilitation period.</p><p>In our study, the dose injected was lower than that in a previous study<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kaji reported that a 300 iu BTX-A
injection will obviously decrease the degree of spasticity<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our group, the patients (experimental group, n=11) who received
the 200 iu BTX-A injection also obtained the same effect. It may be that by preventing
spasticity development and providing a time window for rehabilitation, the earlier BTX-A
injected, the lower dose will be used. Possible improvement of equinus foot after BTX-A
treatment in combination with rehabilitation is expected to allow correction of walking
patterns reduce the systemic burden of walking. Increasing walking distance (or decreasing
time required for a given walk) may expand the range of patient activities and lead to
improved ADL. These results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of BTX-A and that it was
useful in improving rehabilitative treatment of subacute poststroke lower-limb spasticity.
Early low dose BTX-A injection in subacute stroke patients may reduce spasticity, improve
gait, and daily living abilities.</p><p>The limitation of the study is obvious: the number of patients is small. The long-term
efficacy and safety and the effects on rehabilitation of early BTX-A injection will be
evaluated using data obtained in more patients. We also should perform further research to
find the optimal dose of BTX-A for subacute stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the participants included in this study and their family
