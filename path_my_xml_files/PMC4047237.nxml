motion and stretch pain and the relationships between the effects. [Subjects] The subjects
were 15 healthy males. [Methods] Subjects performed all three interventions: (1)
ultrasound (US group), (2) without powered ultrasound (placebo group), and (3) rest
(control group). Ultrasound was applied at 3&#x02005;MHz with an intensity of 1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>
and a 100% duty cycle for 10 minutes. The evaluation indices were active and passive range
of motion (ROM), stretch pain (visual analog scale; VAS), and skin surface temperature
(SST). The experimental protocol lasted a total of 40 minutes; this was comprised of 10
minutes before the intervention, 10 minutes during the intervention (US, placebo, and
control), and 20 minutes after the intervention. [Results] ROM and SST were significantly
higher in the US group than in the placebo and control groups for the 20 minutes after
ultrasound, though there was no change in stretch pain. [Conclusion] The effects of
ultrasound on ROM and SST were maintained for 20 minutes after the intervention. The SST
increased with ultrasound and decreased afterwards. Additionally, the SST tended to return
to baseline levels within 20 minutes after ultrasound exposure. Therefore, these effects
were caused by a combination of thermal and mechanical effects of the ultrasound.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Range of motion</kwd><kwd>Stretch pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound is one of the most widely used physical modalities in the clinical
practice of rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, therapeutic ultrasound in rehabilitation has a
number of uses including the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders such as pain, muscle
spasm, joint contracture, and tissue injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is now recognized as a major
therapeutic method in treating musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Essential treatment
parameters for therapeutic ultrasound include frequency, intensity, duty cycle, treatment
time, and treatment area<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The frequency
for therapeutic ultrasound ranges from 1 to 3&#x02005;MHz, with 3&#x02005;MHz used specifically for the
treatment of superficial tissues, and 1&#x02005;MHz is applied to treat deeper tissues<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the combination of intensity
and duty cycle during ultrasound produces thermal and/or nonthermal (i.e., mechanical)
effects<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, therapeutic
ultrasound has been used with the aim of having both thermal and mechanical effects<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
physiological effects of thermal therapeutic ultrasound include increased tissue
temperature<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, increased local blood
flow<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, increased extensibility of
tissue<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reduced viscosity of fluid elements in the tissue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, the mechanical effects accelerate
tissue metabolism by promoting cellular permeability and ion transport<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, therapeutic ultrasound has been used as a
treatment method for relief of pain and muscle spasm and for improvement of joint
contracture and wounded tissue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have tended to use pain and/or range of motion as
an outcome index<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the relationship
between the changes in active and passive range of motion and the pain associated with
stretching of the muscle (i.e., stretch pain) that are caused by ultrasound is not clear.
Stretch pain is defined as pain associated with stretch stimulations in soft tissue such as
the skeletal muscles. Therefore, control of stretch pain is necessary to increase the range
of motion.</p><p>Our previous studies have revealed that therapeutic ultrasound on the upper fibers of the
trapezius muscle reduced muscle stiffness and increased the active range of motion<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, we have not attempted to distinguish the relationship
between the above effects and stretch pain; therefore, the interactions remain unclear. This
study aimed to clarify whether therapeutic ultrasound affects active and passive range of
motion, and stretch pain. A further object of the study was to collate fundamental data on
the effects of therapeutic ultrasound for pain, muscle spasm, and joint contracture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 15 healthy males with a mean age of 26&#x02005;years (range; 21&#x02013;32), mean body
height of 171.7 &#x000b1; 6.0&#x02005;cm, mean body weight of 62.7 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;kg, and mean body mass index of
21.3 &#x000b1; 2.2. All the subjects were right handed.</p><p>This study was approved by the Koriyama Tohto Academy Educational Foundation Ethics
Committee (No. 08-004). All the subjects signed a consent form after being informed of the
study purpose and content, and of all the risks involved.</p><p>We compared the following 3 interventions in a randomized trial using the same subjects:
(1) ultrasound (US group), (2) without powered ultrasound (placebo group), and (3) rest
(control group). Each condition was tested 1 week apart. The intervention and measurement
sites were defined as the upper fibers of the right trapezius muscle, specifically the
midpoint on the C7 spinous process to the acromial end of the clavicle.</p><p>We used an ultrasound unit (EU-940, Ito Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with an effective
radiating area of 6.0&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and a beam nonuniformity ratio of 3.2: 1 (reported by
the manufacturer). Ultrasound was applied at 3&#x02005;MHz with an intensity of 1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>
and a 100% duty cycle (i.e., continuous mode) for 10 minutes. To denote the ultrasound
treatment site, an area twice the size of the ultrasound transducer head was marked on the
top of the upper fibers of the right trapezius muscle, and we moved the transducer in a
stroking method. Ultrasound transmission gel was used as the conducting medium, and it was
applied to the skin after warming to a mean temperature of 33&#x02005;&#x000b0;C for all groups. The placebo
treatment was unpowered ultrasound and otherwise was performed using the same method and
conditions as those for the US treatment. The control group received application of
ultrasound gel and was then instructed to rest.</p><p>The measurement indices were the active range of motion (A-ROM) and passive range of motion
(P-ROM) of cervical lateral bending to the left, stretch pain (SP) expressed by the visual
analog scale (VAS) for P-ROM, and skin surface temperature (SST). In order to standardize
the suppress strength in the measurement of P-ROM and SP, a handheld dynamometer was set to
push against the subject&#x02019;s right temple, and the cervical vertebra was bent with a suppress
strength of 30 N and monitored by the dynamometer. In this position, SP is induced by a
stretch stimulation in the upper trapezius muscle. This position also followed the method of
active individual muscle stretching (i.e., active ID stretching) for the upper fibers of the
trapezius muscle<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SP was also
confirmed at the end of P-ROM. The subjects also assumed a sitting position with both upper
limbs on top of both thighs, with the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle exposed for
measurement of the A-ROM and SST. The measurement instruments were a digital inclinometer
(MJ-1, Satoshoji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), handheld dynamometer (&#x003bc;-Tas MT-1, Anima Co.,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and an infrared thermometer (THI-700L, Tasco Japan Co., Ltd., Osaka,
Japan).</p><p>The experimental protocol was executed after a 20-minute acclimation period set for
subjects to adapt to the laboratory environment. The protocol included 10 minutes before the
intervention (rest), 10 minutes during the intervention (for each condition), and 20 minutes
after the intervention (rest). The data collected before and after the interventions were
divided into 10-minute intervals for further analysis. The experiment was conducted in a
controlled environment with the temperature maintained between 24&#x02005;&#x000b0;C to 26&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and 40% to 60%
relative humidity.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 3 &#x000d7; 5
(groups &#x000d7; time) repeated measurements of the change in A-ROM, P-ROM, SP, and SST for
comparisons between all groups. Once significant differences were detected by two-way ANOVA,
Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc multiple comparison (Tukey-HSD) test was performed. The level of
significance was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows ver.

it decreased afterwards, and the SST tended to return to baseline levels (i.e., T1 and T2
levels) by T5, which was 20 minutes after ultrasound exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we investigated whether therapeutic ultrasound affects active and passive
ROM and SP. Furthermore, we included SST as an assessment criterion to determine how changes
in each ROM and SP are related to tissue temperature during therapeutic ultrasound. We
compared changes in each ROM, SP, and SST in the US, placebo, and control groups for 20
minutes after the interventions. The present study revealed that each ROM and SST were
significantly higher during the 20 minutes after the intervention period in the US group
than in the placebo and control groups. However, no change in SP was expressed in a
subjective pain assessment, i.e., VAS. These results showed that ultrasound increased the
threshold of SP. Given the above, our study revealed that therapeutic ultrasound provided
increases in both ROM accompanied by an increased SP threshold for at least 20 minutes after
the conclusion of the interventions.</p><p>There are primarily two reasons that explain the above findings. Firstly, Mense et al.
reported that high threshold mechanoreceptors in skeletal muscle respond to stretch
stimulation<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we
hypothesized that ultrasound affected the sensitivity of sensory receptors such as muscle
spindle and high threshold mechanoreceptors in skeletal muscle and that this led to the
increased ROM. Secondly, ultrasound increases extensibility of the skin and muscle due to
the thermal effect that influences tissue viscoelasticity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our previous studies have revealed that therapeutic ultrasound on
the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle reduced muscle stiffness and increased the active
range of motion<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these two reasons, the effect of therapeutic ultrasound
on ROM would be caused by a combination of the changes in SP threshold and tissue
extensibility. One of these changes in the SP threshold and tissue extensibility is due to
the thermal effect of ultrasound, and the thermal effect was observed in our study, as the
SST was increased. In a previous study completed with the same methods as in our study
(i.e., same frequency, intensity, duty cycle, and treatment time), Draper et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported temperature increases of 5.8&#x02005;&#x000b0;C in
tissues at 0.8 and 1.6&#x02005;cm depths after the application of ultrasound. In our study, the SST
increased by a mean of 1.6&#x02005;&#x000b0;C in the US group after the intervention. The following changes
in the biological reaction resulting from tissue heating have been suggested: an increase in
metabolism and a reduction in mild inflammation resulting from a rise of 1&#x02005;&#x000b0;C in tissue
temperature, an increase in blood flow and a reduction of muscle spasm and pain resulting
from a rise of 2 to 3&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, and increases in ROM and tissue extensibility resulting from a
rise of 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C<sup>1)</sup>. Therefore, in light of this study and the previous study&#x02019;s
results, we considered that the thermal effect of ultrasound influenced the ROM and SP
threshold.</p><p>Although the increased SST at the conclusion of the intervention indicates the thermal
effect in the ultrasound group, the SST gradually decreased afterwards. At 20 minutes after
the ultrasound intervention, the SST tended to return to baseline levels (i.e., T1 and T2
levels), which means that the increases in ROM and SP threshold were maintained while the
SST exhibited a gradual decrease. This demonstrates a greater presence of mechanical effects
on the changes in the ROM and the SP threshold. The mechanical effects were caused by the
direct micro vibration effects of ultrasound, which decreases the sensitivity in SP receptor
(i.e., high mechanoreceptors and muscle spindles) and change muscle viscoelasticity.
Therefore, the present results, i.e., increased ROM and SP threshold, were due to a combined
effect of thermal effects and mechanical effects in ultrasound.</p><p>In contrast, the SST in the placebo group and control group decreased during the 20 minutes
after the intervention period. This decrease could be due to the evaporative cooling of the
ultrasound gel. Tissue cooling generally leads to a decrease in pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there were no changes in the ROM or the SP
threshold, suggesting that the placebo group and control group had no cooling effect on the
tissue. In other words, these groups displayed no physiological effects on the tissue; thus,
the clinical implication of tissue cooling is not considered to be important. On the other
hand, the ultrasound group showed significant influences, such as favorable results in the
ROM and SP threshold during the 20 minute period after the intervention. This is clear
evidence that ultrasound causes a direct mechanical effect on the skin and muscle. To our
knowledge, there has been no previous research studying the relationship between active /
passive ROM, SP threshold, and SST in order to observe the prolonged effects of
ultrasound<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

new evidence.</p><p>Clinically, scar tissue and fibrosis cause pain, muscle spasm, and joint contracture.
Therefore, increases in tissue viscoelasticity and extensibility caused by an ultrasound
application, which improves scar tissue and fibrosis, leads to greater ROM and less pain,
and thus it is clinically important. Our results can be used as fundamental data and
scientific evidence of the therapeutic effects of ultrasound on pain, muscle spasm, and
joint contracture. Furthermore, our results endorse the active application of pain
management and therapeutic exercise such as ROM exercises by therapists in the 20 minute
window after application of ultrasound<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, since favorable physiological results
were shown to be present during this window. This window represents a treatment opportunity,
and thus the combined effect with another therapeutic procedure would be greater. That is,
this study suggests that therapeutic ultrasound is possibly an effective treatment method
especially when applied with other therapeutic methods. The medical fee system for
rehabilitation in Japan classifies 20 minutes as 1 unit; thus, the findings in this study
showing that the effect was maintained for 20 minutes suggest that therapeutic ultrasound
would be effective and practical in the clinical practice. In this study, we used a handheld
dynamometer for the constant suppress pressure of 30N when measuring the P-ROM and SP. Due
to the constant pressure, it is considered that the measured values of P-ROM are reliable
and objective. Furthermore, because the VAS results were associated with the objective ROM
data, the VAS data in the present study could also be clinically important.</p><p>Several limitations in this study warrant discussion. Firstly, since this study was done on
healthy subjects, care should be taken when applying the findings in our study to practical
situations. Secondly, we used the same suppress strength in the assessment of passive ROM to
maintain the objectivity of this experiment; however, passive ROM could be assessed by
passive torque tissue resistance at a consistent angle instead in order to examine the
effects of ultrasound. Therefore, we are now planning to quantitatively evaluate changes in
tissue resistance by using a toque machine.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>LK</given-names></name><name><surname>Draper</surname><given-names>DO</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic Modalities.
