frequently receive blood transfusions. Some reports show an association between aged or stored blood and increased morbidity and mortality, including the development of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). However, the existence of conflicting data endorses the need for research to either reject this association, or to confirm it and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-eight sheep were randomised into two groups, receiving saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sheep were further randomised to also receive transfusion of pooled and heat-inactivated supernatant from fresh (Day 1) or stored (Day 42) non-leucoreduced human packed red blood cells (PRBC) or an infusion of saline. TRALI was defined by hypoxaemia during or within two hours of transfusion and histological evidence of pulmonary oedema. Regression modelling compared physiology between groups, and to a previous study, using stored platelet concentrates (PLT). Samples of the transfused blood products also underwent cytokine array and biochemical analyses, and their neutrophil priming ability was measured <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TRALI did not develop in sheep that first received saline-infusion. In contrast, 80% of sheep that first received LPS-infusion developed TRALI following transfusion with "stored PRBC." The decreased mean arterial pressure and cardiac output as well as increased central venous pressure and body temperature were more severe for TRALI induced by "stored PRBC" than by "stored PLT." Storage-related accumulation of several factors was demonstrated in both "stored PRBC" and "stored PLT", and was associated with increased <italic>in vitro </italic>neutrophil priming.

Sick (LPS infused) sheep rather than healthy (saline infused) sheep predominantly developed TRALI when transfused with supernatant from stored but not fresh PRBC. "Stored PRBC" induced a more severe injury than "stored PLT" and had a different storage lesion profile, suggesting that these outcomes may be associated with storage lesion factors unique to each blood product type. Therefore, the transfusion of fresh rather than stored PRBC may minimise the risk of TRALI.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>There is currently heightened concern about the negative outcomes associated with transfusion of "older" or stored blood products. Several studies have identified the age of transfused packed red blood cell (PRBC) units as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], including in the critical care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The existence of contradictory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], however, indicates that this is still a matter of conjecture which necessitates further research.</p><p>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious and potentially fatal adverse transfusion event that has been associated with the transfusion of stored blood products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), TRALI manifests as respiratory distress with symptoms of hypoxaemia and pulmonary oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in the case of TRALI, the onset of symptoms is temporally associated with transfusion (developing either during or within six hours of transfusion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TRALI has been reported by haemovigilance programs to be the most frequent cause of transfusion-related mortality in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and a leading cause of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, TRALI is thought to be under-diagnosed and under-reported, particularly in the busy critical care setting where the development of symptoms may be attributed to multiple other disease processes or therapeutic interventions (for example, post cardiopulmonary bypass) rather than transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Indeed, a prospective study, which was not limited by the under-diagnosis and under-reporting inherent to haemo-vigilance programs, described the incidence of TRALI in the critical care setting as 8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], while a retrospective study described an incidence of 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, another prospective study reported an incidence of TRALI of 29% in end-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients admitted to critical care with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, suggesting that particular patient groups within the critical care setting may be at further risk of TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The normal rate of mortality in cases of TRALI is estimated to be 5 to 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; however, it may be higher in critical care patients as a mortality rate of 41% has been reported, although this was not adjusted for the influence of other morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>TRALI is postulated to develop as the result of two separate clinical events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The first or priming event is due to the patient's primary disease or condition which results in activation of the pulmonary endothelium and the accumulation of primed, adherent neutrophils in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The second event is the subsequent blood transfusion, whereby the primed neutrophils are activated by either a leucocyte antibody or biological response modifiers (BRM) present in the transfused blood product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Activation of the primed neutrophils results in augmented release of their microbicidal arsenal, which causes collateral injury to the pulmonary endothelium that manifests as capillary leak, and clinically as TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus the two-event mechanism proposes that both recipient and blood product factors contribute to TRALI pathogenesis. Critical care patients may, therefore, be particularly susceptible to the development of TRALI, first, because of the severity of their underlying illness, and second, because they are more likely to receive blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Current risk reduction strategies (the preferential use of plasma from male donors, or the screening of donors for leucocyte antibodies) address the risk of TRALI associated with transfusion of leucocyte antibodies rather than BRM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These BRM are thought to accumulate as part of the storage lesion of cellular blood products, such as packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelet concentrates (PLT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Data from <italic>in vivo </italic>animal models as well as retrospective and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies indicate that stored PRBC or PLT may pose a greater risk of inducing TRALI than equivalent fresh PRBC or PLT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The role of blood product factors, therefore, requires further elucidation. Using an established <italic>in vivo </italic>ovine model, this study investigated the hypotheses that: (i) both recipient factors (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion to approximate clinical infection) and blood product factors (stored PRBC) would be required to induce TRALI, and (ii) that differences in the storage lesions of PRBC and PLT would result in differences in the haemodynamic and respiratory changes associated with the development of TRALI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were approved by the University Animal Ethics Committee of the Queensland University of Technology, the Health Sciences Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland and the Ethics Committee of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, and conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.</p><sec><title>Collection and preparation of supernatant pools for transfusion</title><p>Seventy units of non-leucoreduced PRBC units were prepared by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service using standard procedures, including collection into citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) and the addition of saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) additive solution. Thirty-five PRBC units were processed on Day 1 to obtain a "fresh PRBC" supernatant pool. The remaining 35 PRBC units were stored under standard conditions (4&#x000b0;C) until expiry (Day 42), when they were processed to obtain a "stored PRBC" supernatant pool. Supernatant pools were prepared by centrifugation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and were similarly heat-inactivated (56&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes) to eradicate the non-specific actions of complement and fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar pools of heat-inactivated Day 1 and Day 5 whole blood PLT supernatant were prepared in a previous study (d1-PLT-S/N or "fresh PLT" and d5-PLT-S/N or "stored PLT") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and aliquots were stored for further analyses in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfusion protocol</title><p>The <italic>in vivo </italic>transfusion protocol has been previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Management of anaesthesia, mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, voluemia and infusion/transfusion protocols were identical to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Briefly, 28 female sheep (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>) received intravenous buprenorphine analgesia and ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia supplemented with butorphanol where required, and were mechanically ventilated and instrumented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A one-hour period of stabilisation was allowed, after which hemodynamic monitoring and baseline bloods were collected. Sheep were randomly assigned into six groups to receive either saline or LPS as a first event, and then either saline or "fresh PRBC" or "stored PRBC" as a second event (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Either 30 ml of saline or LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>serotype O55:B5 (15 &#x003bc;g/kg based upon previous titration studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) were infused intravenously into the sheep over 30 minutes (first event), followed by monitoring for 1 hour. For the second event, either saline or "fresh PRBC" or "stored PRBC" (10% of total blood volume) were infused into the sheep (200 ml/hr). Since the majority of clinical cases of TRALI develop within this time-frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], sheep were then monitored for two hours, after which they were euthanised with 12 ml pentobarbitone sodium (325 mg/ml; Virbac Animal Health, Milpera, NSW, Australia).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Groups of sheep and incidence of TRALI</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Group names</th><th align="left">1<sup>st </sup>event</th><th align="left">2<sup>nd </sup>event</th><th align="left">n</th><th align="left">Hypoxaemia</th><th align="left">Pulmonary oedema</th><th align="left">ALI/TRALI</th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/><th><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/><th align="left">Number positive (% positive)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Sham</td><td align="left">Saline</td><td align="left">Saline</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left"><bold>0 (0%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Saline-fresh</td><td align="left">Saline</td><td align="left">"Fresh PRBC"</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left"><bold>0 (0%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Saline-stored</td><td align="left">Saline</td><td align="left">"Stored PRBC"</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left"><bold>0 (0%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LPS-control</td><td align="left">LPS</td><td align="left">Saline</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left"><bold>0 (0%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LPS-fresh</td><td align="left">LPS</td><td align="left">"Fresh PRBC"</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left"><bold>1 (20%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LPS-stored</td><td align="left">LPS</td><td align="left">"Stored PRBC"</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left"><bold>4 (80%)<sup><italic>a</italic></sup></bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</td><td align="left">LPS</td><td align="left">"Fresh PLT" (d1-PLT-S/N)</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left"><bold>1 (20%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</td><td align="left"><bold>LPS</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>"Stored PLT" (d5-PLT-S/N)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>5</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>4</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>5</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>4 (80%)</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ALI, acute lung injury; d1-PLT-S/N, pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from Day 1 human platelet concentrates; d5-PLT-S/N, pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from Day 5 human platelet concentrates; "fresh PLT", pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from Day 1 human platelet concentrates; "fresh PRBC," pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from Day 1 human PRBC; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; n, number of sheep in group; "stored PLT", pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from Day 5 human platelet concentrates; "stored PRBC," pooled heat-inactivated supernatant from day 42 human packed red blood cell concentrates; TRALI, transfusion-related acute lung injury.

Samples for histology were immediately fixed in 10% formalin and then processed and embedded in paraffin using routine methods. Histological examination of lung sections was as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In brief, 4 &#x003bc;m sections of lung underwent haemotoxylin and eosin staining before being semi-quantitatively assessed for pulmonary oedema by two researchers blinded to the experimental groupings. Twenty fields of lung histology for each section were photographed and graded for pulmonary oedema via a scoring system of 0- normal, 1- mild oedema, 2- moderate oedema and 3- severe oedema.

Analysis of the relative light intensity (RLI) of the corresponding spots via PDQuest Basic 2-D Gel Analysis Software (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) provided a relative measurement of the concentration of each specific cytokine or chemokine.

These models were used to examine differences between groups over time whilst accounting for repeated data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Data from LPS-treated sheep that developed TRALI due to either "stored PRBC" or "stored PLT" transfusion were also compared using mixed modelling.

While some patients may progress to either ALI or ARDS, the association with recent blood transfusion may be overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, many cases of ALI/ARDS may in fact represent TRALI, and the true scale of the risks posed by TRALI in the critical care setting are likely to be under-appreciated. Prospective studies have revealed an incidence of TRALI ranging from 5 to 8% in general critical care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and up to 29% in ELSD critical care patients admitted with GI bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This study provides additional evidence that both patient and blood product factors contribute to the development of TRALI, and that the type of blood product influences the severity of injury.</p><p>Patients with severe illness are hypothesised to be more likely to develop TRALI, thus critically ill patients may be particularly susceptible to the development of TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this study, TRALI only developed in "ill" sheep and did not develop in any of the "healthy" sheep, even following transfusion of "stored PRBC." This is consistent with previous TRALI models, in which both a clinical first event, either LPS-infusion or, in the case of mice, their exposure to a germ environment, and an appropriate second event (that is, stored blood or leucocyte antibody) were required for TRALI to develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, this study reaffirms the importance of patient factors in the development of TRALI.</p><p>The age of the transfused blood product was also found to be crucial to the development of TRALI, as it predominantly developed in LPS-primed sheep transfused with "stored PRBC" and not "fresh PRBC." This adds to findings from previous <italic>in vivo </italic>models in which TRALI has been described subsequent to transfusion with supernatant from stored human PRBC in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or stored human PLT in both rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. During routine storage of PRBC and PLT, proteins and lipids (or their metabolites) are released by cells into the storage medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These soluble factors are retained in the supernatant and are thought to contribute to the development of TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], although some studies have also implicated the transfused cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In this study, cytokine array and ELISA analyses were used to identify the soluble factors that may have contributed to the development of TRALI in the sheep. It was demonstrated that "stored PRBC" contained higher levels of EGF, ENA-78, GRO-&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-16 and MCP-1 relative to "fresh PRBC", while levels of lactate and potassium increased and levels of sodium decreased. Since neutrophils are key effector cells in TRALI pathogenesis, the biological relevance of these changes was confirmed by the increased <italic>in vitro </italic>neutrophil priming ability present in "stored PRBC" compared to "fresh PRBC".</p><p>Heat-inactivation of the human blood product supernatant used in this and in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was necessary to prevent widespread thrombus formation and mortality due to non-specific actions of complement and fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; however, represents a limitation of these models. As was demonstrated for sCD40L, heat-inactivation may reduce the concentration of some protein BRMs; however, levels of EGF, ENA-78, GRO-&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-16 and MCP-1 were all unaffected by heat-inactivation. It remains possible that heat-inactivation may have affected other parameters not investigated, and may have influenced the development of TRALI. The alternative approach of transfusing homologous ovine with PRBC rather than with heat-inactivated supernatant from human PRBC was not used in this study because of the limitations of this alternative approach. First, while the preparation of ovine PRBC is not technically difficult, this process requires standardisation and validation to ensure that the ovine PRBC provide a suitable model of human PRBC. Second, as has been demonstrated in small animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], there are likely to be differences between the storage lesions of ovine and human PRBC. Detailed comparative data comparing the storage lesions of ovine PRBC and human PRBC are, therefore, essential to validate an ovine model of homologous transfusion for the study of effects related to the age of blood. While future studies are planned to address these limitations of homologous transfusion models, it was felt that, at the present time, the transfusion of heat-inactivated supernatant from human blood products, provided a more relevant clinical model of TRALI.</p><p>PRBC that have not undergone pre-storage leucoreduction comprise a significant proportion of the PRBC used in the USA (approximately 20% of the approximately 17 million PRBC transfused in 2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Hence, the findings of this study are of particular clinical relevance to the USA and other countries in which universal pre-storage leucoreduction of blood products has not yet been implemented. Leucoreduction has been shown to reduce the concentration of leucocyte-derived factors in the storage lesion of cellular blood products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; however, whether it also reduces the risk of TRALI remains a matter of conjecture based upon current evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Of note, analyses of 89 TRALI cases from two tertiary care medical centres in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and of 60 TRALI cases in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] failed to demonstrate any association between the length of storage of leucoreduced PRBC and TRALI, although these analyses may have been confounded by the presence of leucocyte antibodies in a proportion of leucoreduced PRBC. Hence, the importance of the present study, and the ovine model, as a historical marker allowing for further investigation of the effects of leucoreduction upon TRALI pathogenesis. Accordingly, follow-up studies using equivalent leucoreduced PRBC have been planned to identify common BRM and to elucidate the effects that transfusion of supernatant from stored leucoreduced human PRBC may have upon TRALI pathogenesis in the ovine model. These effects may then be compared to those reported in the present study.</p><p>The definition of TRALI used in this study included cases in which a sustained worsening of pre-existing hypoxaemia was evident following transfusion. This was justified because the control groups and detailed monitoring used in the experimental setting make it possible to clearly define such cases. Two separate analyses confirmed the robustness of these data. First, analyses of averaged data demonstrated that the LPS-stored group had lower PaO<sub>2 </sub>values post-transfusion compared to the LPS-control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Second, analyses using mixed modelling demonstrated that the LPS-stored group had lower PaO<sub>2 </sub>values post-transfusion compared to both the LPS-control and LPS-fresh groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Thus, it was possible to conclude that the worsening hypoxaemia was related to the transfusion of "stored PRBC" rather than the continued effects of LPS-infusion. In contrast to the experimental setting, defining worsening hypoxaemia related to transfusion is problematic in the clinical setting. Therefore, more restrictive criteria, in which TRALI is only defined by the onset of new hypoxaemia, are used clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, Koch <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that, regardless of transfusion history, over 60% of cardiac surgical patients were hypoxaemic upon admission to ICU, this highlighting the difficulty in applying current TRALI definitions in the critical care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>The relative similarity in pulmonary anatomy and physiology between sheep and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] represents a significant advantage of this ovine model over existing small animal rodent models of TRALI. Another distinct advantage is the larger size of the sheep relative to the rats and mice used for other TRALI models. This enabled detailed monitoring of the respiratory and haemodynamic changes associated with TRALI. In sheep that developed TRALI, the observed reduction in C<sub>stat </sub>and decrement in oxygenation represents a physiological manifestation of the loss of the open alveolar structure evident upon post-mortem histological analysis. The continuous physiological monitoring also revealed that TRALI was associated with development of pulmonary arterial hypertension, further increasing the workload on the right heart, which may lead to poorer tissue oxygenation, with increased venous pressures and reduced cardiac output. Hence, TRALI worsens oxygenation at the arterio-alveolar interphase, as well as diminishing tissue oxygen delivery, due to the cardiovascular perturbations. In addition to predisposing the development of TRALI, it is possible that by worsening tissue dysoxia in other organs the transfusion of stored blood might also contribute to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], although further studies would be required to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>This study provides further evidence that both recipient (first event) and blood product (second event) factors contribute to the development of TRALI. Such a two-event mechanism was first postulated for some instances of ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], then was adapted for TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and recently has been re-stated as a threshold mechanism for TRALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This proposes that the development of TRALI is associated with both the severity of underlying illness and the strength of blood product factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This interaction may provide an explanation for both the unexpected lack of TRALI in a single LPS-infused sheep transfused with "stored PRBC" as well as the unexpected development of TRALI in a single LPS-infused sheep transfused with "fresh PRBC." In the former case, it is possible that recipient factors were protective against TRALI. Genetic factors have been implicated in the development of ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and it is possible that they may also play a role in TRALI as only some patients transfused with stored PRBC go on to develop TRALI. In the latter case, <italic>post hoc </italic>analyses revealed that abnormal baseline respiratory data were indicative of pre-existing lung injury (initial PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>was 277.5, which recovered to 452.5 at the start of the experiment). Therefore, we speculate that pre-existing injury in combination with LPS-infusion may have rendered this sheep more susceptible to the development of TRALI, such that a weaker second event stimulus ("fresh PRBC") was sufficient to induce TRALI. This would be consistent with the proposed threshold mechanism. Thus, critical care patients may be particularly susceptible to the development of TRALI because of the severity of their illness. In addition, the risk of developing TRALI may be further increased if they are transfused with stored blood products which have a higher BRM content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Finally, this study demonstrated that the injury profile of TRALI induced by "stored PRBC" was more severe than that previously described by "stored PLT" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Data re-modelling confirmed a reduction in MAP and CO as well as higher CVP and temperature in TRALI induced by "stored PRBC." The strength of the recipient factors was consistent, as the same dose of LPS was used in both studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the difference in symptoms may be attributable to a difference in blood product factors. This is supported by the higher concentrations of EGF, IL-8, IL-16, MCP-1, lactate and potassium measured in "stored PRBC" than in "stored PLT." The observation that these higher concentrations, present in the transfused blood product were associated with more severe symptoms is suggestive of a dose-response relationship; however, further research would be required to confirm this hypothesis. Also, the mechanism by which each of these potential BRM may act requires further elucidation. As no differences were observed in the <italic>in vitro </italic>neutrophil priming ability of "stored PRBC" and "stored PLT," direct actions of these potential BRMs upon neutrophils are unlikely to contribute to the differences observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is possible that other cells, such as platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which also contribute to the pathophysiology of TRALI, may have contributed to the observed haemodynamic differences and this warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has confirmed that the transfusion of soluble factors present in stored blood products (that is, PRBC) presents a significantly increased risk of TRALI compared to equivalent fresh products. Symptoms associated with TRALI induced by "stored PRBC" were more severe than for TRALI induced by "stored PLT," possibly due to an increased range and concentration of cytokines and other factors present in the "stored PRBC," and is suggestive of a dose-response relationship. Improved understanding of the injurious soluble factors present in stored blood products is required to direct the manufacture of safer blood components. This study has also reaffirmed the importance of recipient (patient) factors in the development of TRALI as only LPS-primed sheep went on to develop TRALI. Hence, severely ill patients, such as those in critical care units, may be at increased risk of developing TRALI.
