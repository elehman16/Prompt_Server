In particular, patients with metastatic disease have a poor prognosis, with less than 5% alive at 5 years. A multicentre randomized trial comparing methotrexate and vinblastine (MV) with cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine (CMV) in advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma was conducted in the UK. From April 1991 to June 1995, 214 patients were entered by 16 centres, 108 randomized to CMV and 106 to MV. A total of 204 patients have died. The hazard ratio (relative risk of dying) was 0.68 (95% CI 0.51-0.90, P-value = 0.0065) in favour of CMV. This translates to an absolute improvement in 1-year survival of 13%, 16% in MV and 29% in CMV. The median survival for CMV and MV was 7 months and 4.5 months respectively. Two hundred and eight patients objectively progressed or died. The hazard ratio was 0.55 (95% CI 0.41-0.73, P-value = 0.0001) in favour of CMV. Two hundred and nine patients symptomatically progressed or died. The hazard ratio was 0.48 (95% CI 0.36-0.64, P-value = 0.0001) in favour of CMV. The most important pretreatment factors influencing overall survival were WHO performance status and extent of disease. These two factors were used to derive a prognostic index which could be used to categorize patients into three prognostic groups. We conclude that the addition of cisplatin to methotrexate and vinblastine should be considered in patients with transitional cell carcinoma, taking into account the increased toxicity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1067" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1068" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1069" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1070" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1071" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1072" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1073" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1074" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00012-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1075" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
