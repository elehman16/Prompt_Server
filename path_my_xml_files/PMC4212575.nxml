In South and Central America, an estimated 8.2% of the adult population had diabetes in 2013. This number is expected to rise by close to 60% over the next 20&#x02005;years,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> largely due to an obesity epidemic fueled by the lifestyle changes associated with the economic transitions occurring in this region. In the USA, the age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic/Latino adults (estimated at 12.1%) is currently even higher than in South and Central America, with individuals in this population 1.7 times more likely than non-Hispanic/Latino white adults to have been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Furthermore, this group has an increased risk of diabetes-related complications and mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The reasons underlying the increased burden of T2DM in Hispanic/Latino populations are complex and involve a combination of genetic, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. For example, in the USA, ethnic disparities are evident in the quality of T2DM care, with Hispanic/Latino patients more frequently diagnosed at a later disease stage and not adequately treated compared with non-Hispanic/Latino patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, many Hispanic/Latino patients with T2DM are resistant to initiating insulin therapy or increasing insulin dosage as necessary to achieve glycemic control.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Some data also suggest the presence of a genetic predisposition toward increased insulin resistance,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref> which may be further exacerbated by a high prevalence of abdominal obesity in this group.</p><p>It is acknowledged that responses to pharmacological therapy may vary across different racial and ethnic groups. The evidence for the efficacy and safety of glucose-lowering agents in Hispanic/Latino populations is scarce and a need for randomized controlled clinical trials exists. Until these studies are initiated, pooled data from the large development programs of new glucose-lowering drugs will provide valuable insights. Linagliptin is an oral, selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Evidence from the linagliptin clinical trial program, as well as subgroup analyses of pooled data, demonstrates that linagliptin improves glycemic control across a range of patient groups.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Most patients within the linagliptin trials self-reported their ethnicity as non-Hispanic/Latino; however, a large number of Hispanic/Latino patients were included across studies. Pooling of data from these trials was facilitated by comparable study designs and endpoints, and this pooled analysis was therefore undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of linagliptin in self-identified Hispanic/Latino patients with T2DM from North and South America.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient population</title><p>In this retrospective analysis, data were pooled from six randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials of linagliptin given once daily as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies. The pooled analysis included only those patients who self-identified ethnicity as Hispanic/Latino; patients also self-identified race. Two trials were of 18-week duration and four trials were of 24-week duration<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;17</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJDRC2014000020TB1">table 1</xref>).

endpoint of the original studies was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 18 or 24. Secondary endpoints were the change in HbA1c from baseline by week over time and the change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline by week over time. A meal tolerance test (MTT) was performed in a subgroup of patients in one trial (NCT00601250), and the change in postprandial glucose (PPG) levels after 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment was also considered a secondary endpoint. Before the MTT, blood was collected for determination of FPG. For the MTT, patients ingested two nutrition bars and 200&#x02005;mL of diet Ensure Plus, after which, blood was drawn for the determination of 2&#x02005;h PPG. Other safety-related endpoints were the change in body weight from baseline to week 18 or 24, and the changes from baseline in lipid parameters (including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and plasma triglycerides), blood pressure, and heart rate. Except for changes in body weight and lipid parameters, the studies of 24-week duration included assessments at week 18. Safety was assessed in terms of the incidence and intensity of adverse events (AEs) up to 18 or 24&#x02005;weeks. Hypoglycemic episodes that were regarded as AEs were classified by the investigator as asymptomatic, symptomatic, or severe hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which comprised all randomized patients who were treated with &#x02265;1 dose of study drug and who had a baseline and &#x02265;1 on-treatment HbA1c measurement. Missing data were imputed using a last observation carried forward approach, including linear interpolation for measurements missing between visits. The changes in mean HbA1c and FPG from baseline to week 18 or 24 were compared between the linagliptin and placebo groups in the pooled population using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included continuous baseline HbA1c and fixed effects for treatment, study, and washout (where applicable, patients who were pretreated with non-permitted antidiabetes agents underwent a 4-week washout period, followed by a 2-week placebo run-in period). The model for FPG also included continuous baseline FPG. The OBSMARGIN option for the computation of least squares means coefficients (LSMEANS), which corresponds to the number of observations per treatment, was used in the models without interactions. Interactions of treatment-by-subgroup were included in the models for subgroup analyses, and therefore an equal weighting option was used for the computation of LSMEANS. Subgroup analysis was performed according to baseline HbA1c categories (&#x0003c;7%, &#x02265;7% to &#x0003c;8%, &#x02265;8% to &#x0003c;9% and &#x02265;9%), duration of diabetes categories (&#x02264;1&#x02005;year, &#x0003e;1 to &#x02264;5&#x02005;years and &#x0003e;5&#x02005;years), age categories (&#x02264;50, 51 to &#x0003c;65, 65 to &#x0003c;75 and &#x02265;75&#x02005;years), body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;30 and &#x02265;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, sex, the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome (identified using the International Diabetes Federation definition), and the presence or absence of basal insulin treatment.</p><p>The change in 2&#x02005;h PPG was analyzed for the MTT FAS set using an ANCOVA model that included fixed effects for treatment, washout, continuous baseline HbA1c, and continuous baseline PPG after 2&#x02005;h as covariates. The MTT FAS set consisted of all patients in the FAS who had a valid MTT at baseline and at least one valid on-treatment MTT. An MTT was considered valid if it had a valid FPG and a valid 2&#x02005;h PPG value.

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This pooled analysis of data from six randomized, controlled phase 3 trials of up to 24&#x02005;weeks in duration was performed to assess the glucose-lowering potential and safety of linagliptin in Latin American and US Hispanic/Latino patients with inadequately controlled T2DM. Treatment with oral linagliptin 5&#x02005;mg once daily led to significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control as assessed by changes in HbA1c and FPG in a patient population with predominantly long-standing disease (&#x0003e;5&#x02005;years&#x02019; duration), and against a broad background of other commonly used antidiabetes drugs, including insulin. The overall incidence of AEs was similar in patients receiving linagliptin and placebo, as were all other indices of safety including serious AEs, drug-related AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs. Furthermore, treatment with linagliptin was also weight-neutral.</p><p>The overall incidence of investigator-defined hypoglycemia was similar for linagliptin and placebo. A similar observation was made when patients with background insulin or without background sulfonylurea were analyzed separately. A low risk for hypoglycemia is clinically relevant, because such events have been associated with a reduction in quality of life in patients with diabetes and a fear of hypoglycemia is common in certain Hispanic/Latino groups.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This may lead to compensatory behaviors such as decreasing oral antidiabetes medications or insulin doses, which ultimately result in worsening of glycemic control and an increased risk of complications. A fear of hypoglycemia may also contribute to a reluctance to begin insulin therapy, and such &#x02018;psychological insulin resistance&#x02019; is particularly common in Hispanic/Latino populations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> An oral antidiabetes drug with a limited risk of hypoglycemia would therefore enhance therapeutic options for Hispanic/Latino populations, and this study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in this group, as well as its low risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>The efficacy of linagliptin has been demonstrated across ethnic groups, including in Japanese, Chinese, and Black/African American populations.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Although the results of this pooled analysis add to the knowledge of the efficacy and safety profile of linagliptin in an important and previously understudied ethnic population, the findings are limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis. As with all pooled analyses, the patients in this study were not randomized specifically for this analysis, and therefore it remains possible that baseline differences between the groups could have confounded the results; however, baseline values for key efficacy criteria, such as HbA1c or FPG, were similar between the linagliptin and placebo groups. The analysis is also limited by the relatively short-term nature of the original studies, with a maximum duration of 6&#x02005;months. For linagliptin, longer term (2&#x02005;years) safety and efficacy data are available for the general T2DM population.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A 2-year, head-to-head comparison of add-on linagliptin versus add-on sulfonylurea in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin showed that linagliptin was non-inferior in lowering HbA1c, but was associated with relative weight loss and significantly less hypoglycemia.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Further evidence of the efficacy of this combination was provided by a 52-week study demonstrating that initial combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin was superior to metformin monotherapy for reducing HbA1c levels in patients with poor glycemic control, with the additional benefits of no weight gain and a low risk of hypoglycemia.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Studies suggest that adherence to diabetes treatment is improved through the use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> FDCs are generally competitively priced compared with the same combinations as separate tablets,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

The study, expected to complete in 2018, plans to enroll 8300 patients globally, including participants from Latin American countries. Its renal outcome component may provide particular insight into Hispanic/Latino patients, in whom the rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 1.5 times greater than that seen in the non-Hispanic/Latino population in the USA.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>

<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The lowering in HbA1c of approximately &#x02013;0.6%, observed in the present analysis, suggests that clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control can be achieved in Hispanic/Latino patients whether as monotherapy or against a background of common antidiabetes treatments, including insulin. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the glycemic efficacy of linagliptin in Hispanic/Latino patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.
