It has been found that modest weight loss of &#x02264;10% in obese patients with related complications is associated with better health outcomes as there is improvements in glycemic control, reduction in blood pressure (BP) and reduction in cholesterol levels.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The strategies to treat obesity involve life-style interventions and pharmacological therapies. Many medications were introduced in for obesity management in past and were withdrawn from the market subsequently.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Rimonabant, a selective antagonist of cannabinoid type 1 receptor due to safety concerns (psychiatric effects)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and sibutramine, due to it associated potentials to increases BP and pulse rate were withdrawn from the market recently.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Currently, orlistat which is a pancreatic and gastrointestinal tract lipase inhibitor is the only agent approved by Food and Drug Administration for long-term use in obesity. However, it is also associated with gastrointestinal side-effects and questionable efficacy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Thus, the focus of anti-obesity treatment has shifted toward herbal drugs. However, there are few concerns about the safety and efficacy of even herbal supplements as well.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Adverse events including hepatic injury, psychiatric, autonomic, gastrointestinal and palpitations have been reported with the use of some herbal supplements.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These reports contradict the myth regarding the safety of herbals and calls for detailed scientific evaluation of herbal supplements before they are recommended.</p><p><italic>Caralluma fimbriata</italic> is one such Indian herb widely used for obesity in traditional medicine. It is an edible succulent cacti, which belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae. It is well-known as a famine food, appetite suppressant and grows wild all over India.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The scan of literature reveals few studies regarding the efficacy and safety of <italic>C. fimbriata</italic> in humans for the management of obesity and whatever data is available is equivocal. Hence, the current study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy and safety of <italic>C. fimbriata</italic> with respect to anthropometric parameters and appetite suppression in overweight and obese individuals to supplement the earlier work to arrive at conclusive result before it is advocated as anti-obesity drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial was conducted in Post Graduate Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics in collaboration with the Department of Internal Medicine at Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee under number Pharma/IEC/2010/528 dated 27.10.2010. Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects after explaining them the nature and purpose of study. All principles of Bioethics were followed. All patients received herbal drug under supervision of AYUSH out-patient department (OPD) of the hospital.</p><p>A total of 106 patients attending Medicine OPD were enrolled for the study.

Clinical evaluation with complete medical history, general physical examination and systemic examination was done. After enrollment the subjects underwent standardization and stabilization for a period of 2 weeks: Overweight and obese patients without existing co-morbid conditions were stabilized on diet and physical activity. Overweight and obese patients with existing co-morbid conditions were standardized according to the recommended guidelines of treatment in addition to diet and physical activity. The patients were then randomized by a table of random numbers into two groups, to receive either <italic>Caralluma fimbriata</italic> extract (CFE) or matching placebo. CFE available commercially (Cap S 500 mg) of the same batch of manufacturing (1 g daily)/oral for 12 weeks in the test group was used. Dose selection of the test drug used was made from the available clinical study.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The placebo group was similarly administered placebo in the form of 2 identical capsules to CFE twice a day/oral for 12 weeks. All subjects were also provided with the same standard advice regarding diet and physical activity.</p><p>Patients were evaluated clinically and biochemically in current single blind study where patients were blind to treatment for a period of 3 months at 4, 8 and 12 weeks for anthropometric measurements (weight, waist circumference [WC], hip circumference [HC], waist hip ratio [WHR], BMI); appetite assessment using visual analog scales (VAS) for &#x0201c;hunger&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;thoughts of food&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;urge to eat&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fullness of stomach&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Biochemical investigations like lipid profile (Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], total triglycerides), blood glucose (fasting/postprandial), liver function tests (Total protein, Serum Bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and alkaline phosphatase), renal function tests (serum creatinine and serum urea), complete blood counts (hemoglobin [Hb], total leukocyte count [TLC], platelet count) were undertaken.

Complementary and alternative therapies have long been used in the Eastern world but recently these therapies are being used increasingly world-wide. When conventional medicine fails to treat chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity efficaciously and without adverse events, many people seek unconventional therapies including herbal medicine.</p><p>Evaluation of the data generated from the current study revealed that CFE did not lead to any significant reduction in weight and BMI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) during the 12 weeks of the study. When compared with the placebo group no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was observed at any time point during the study period. Our study results are in accordance with the study conducted by Kuriyan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>WC is at least as good an indicator of total body fat as BMI and is also the best anthropometric predictor of visceral fat. HC is another important anthropometric parameter. Effect of CFE on these anthropometric parameters (WC and HC) in the current study also did not lead to any significant reduction in WC and HC (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) during the 12 weeks of the study. The WHR is a robust measure of risk in many population studies and has been suggested to be a superior predictor of CVD risk. In the current study, evaluation of WHR revealed that it almost remained static over the entire period of the study. When compared with the placebo group no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was observed at any time point during the study period. Our results are however in accordance with the study conducted by Kuriyan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which also reported non-significant decline.</p><p>Appetite assessment based on VAS in the current study failed to yield any positive results with CFE. No significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) were observed in the change of &#x0201c;hunger&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;thoughts of food&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;urge to eat&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fullness of stomach&#x0201d; over a period of 12 weeks when compared to baseline both in the test and placebo group, however, a numerical improvement in all the parameters could be appreciated in both the groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) observed in the change of appetite on comparative analysis between the test and placebo group. Kuriyan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] however, in their study reported a significant decline in the hunger levels in the experimental group when compared to the placebo group. A small sample size in their study could have led to disparity with our results.</p><p>Our study explored product safety in the form of clinical evaluations and reported adverse events. The biochemical and clinical parameters of the subjects belonging to both the experimental and placebo group showed no alterations at different assessment points of the study. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed on comparative analysis between the test and placebo group. Most adverse events reported by patients in our study were mild in severity and transient in nature. The observed adverse events in the present study were nausea, palpitation, glossitis, insomnia, generalized weakness and constipation. No significant differences were observed between placebo and treatment groups in number of reported adverse events and no subjects were removed from the study for a treatment-related adverse event. However, strangely one known case of hypertension presented with exacerbation of BP which was transient in nature and was controlled. The patient continued with CFE with no recurrence of the adverse event during the entire period of the study. In a similar way studies by Kuriyan <italic>et al</italic>. and Lawrence and Choudhary also reported no serious adverse event with the use of CFE.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The foregoing discussion brings forth that a commercially available extract of <italic>C. fimbriata</italic> in an oral dose of 1 g/day for 12 weeks has failed to yield any positive results on anthropometry and appetite in overweight and obese patients. The current study underscores the need to carry more research before CFE is recommended as an anti-obesity drug in the clinical practice. The negative anti-obesity results seen with CFE in the current study open up a new debate about method of issuing regulatory approval to manufacture and sale any product without much of the existing scientific evidence in its favor.</p><p>There are some limitations in the present study such as short duration, single blind design and inadequate sample size. In future, studies of longer duration d are further needed to substantiate the much hyped health claims of CFE. An important concern in all pharmacological trials, particularly those in which herbal products are evaluated, is the amount and bioavailability of the active agent. As a standard procedure, we took commercially available standardized extract of CF in the form of capsules. However, we did not measure the active ingredient (pregnane glycosides) blood levels or evaluate its tissue or cytosolic activity which was not in the purview of our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A commercially available extract of <italic>C. fimbriata</italic> in an oral dose of 1 g/day claimed to have anti-obesity effect failed to yield any positive results on anthropometry and appetite in overweight and obese individuals beyond placebo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>AYUSH OPD in Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Lakhan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mittal</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pathophysiology and genetics of obesity</article-title><source>Indian J Exp Biol</source><year>2007</year><volume>45</volume><fpage>929</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18072536</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>WHO Fact Sheet 311, 2006</article-title><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2013 Aug 15</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
