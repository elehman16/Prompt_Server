One of the frequent medications which is used to prevent from stent thrombosis is clopidogrel, but, stent thrombosis was seen in many of the patients despite given the conventional dosage of this drug. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of doubling the maintenance dose of clopidogrel to prevent from early stent thrombosis, MI and mortality rate.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a clinical trial study which was done in Shahid Chamran Hospital in winter 2010 in Isfahan, Iran. A total of 400 patients with PCI were prospectively followed-up for 30 days. All the patients were randomly allocated into two groups. The control group received a maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel while the case group received 150 mg clopidogrel after the initial dosage of 600 mg for 30 days after the PCI. The incidence of primary outcome such as total mortality was recorded during the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Early stent thrombosis was observed in 4 patients (1%) (One subject in the control group and 3 in the case group) during the first 30 days after PCI, but the difference was not significant between the two groups (P=0.62). Mortality due to stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients in the case group which showed no significant difference in this group (P=0.5). In addition, MI occurred in 2 patients (1 in each group) which also showed no significant difference between the two groups (P=1). Drug complication such as major bleeding had no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.9).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study showed that doubling dose of clopidogrel could not reduce the incidence of early stent thrombosis, mortality and myocardial infarction in comparison with conventional dosage; therefore it is recommended that more studies be done in Iranian and Asian race for clinical decision-making to prevent form stent thrombosis using high dose of clopidogrel.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Primary Coronary Intervention</kwd><kwd>Early Stent Thrombosis</kwd><kwd>Clopidogrel</kwd><kwd>Coronary Stenting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing incidence of cardiovascular disease particularly coronary artery diseases has enlarged the mortality rate due to prevalence of this group of disease all over the world, and it has reached the world's top 10 mortality causes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref> On the other hand, high incidence of these diseases caused increasing progression and advancement of new techniques and methods to treat such diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref> Naturally, invented techniques and tools to treat cardiovascular disease induce some complications for the patients. The tools which are highly applicable and effective for the patients with coronary artery stenosis and atherosclerosis are stents which are inserted for the patients in most of the medical and specialized cardiovascular centers. Despite its efficacy and high efficiency for saving the patients&#x02019; life, stents have also a series of complication that sometimes lead to death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref> According to the conducted studies, the prevalence of these complications in the patients undergoing stenting is 5-10 percent. The most important short-term complications in the studied patients are as the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Mortality: Death with all the cases</p></list-item><list-item><p>Myocardial Infarction: Increasing total CK = 2 times the upper limit of normal or CK MB = 20 (ng/ml) with or without the presence of new pathologic Q waves in at least two continuous leads.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Urgent Target Vessel Revascularization: Repeated PCI or surgery at the same treated vein.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stroke</p></list-item><list-item><p>Acute thrombosis due to stent: As angiographic evidence of thrombus at the lesion site.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Angiographic complications: Including coronary dissection and coronary perforation.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>One of the most serious stenting complications is the stent thrombosis which is considered as acute stent thrombosis (less than 24 hours), subacute stent thrombosis (24 to 30 days) and delayed stent thrombosis (30 days to 1 year).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> Early stent thrombosis includes acute and subacute cases which are identified based on clinical, angiography and pathological criteria and usually are associated with serious and lethal complications, increase in mortality and morbidity and recurrent infarction. Furthermore, it can prolong the duration of hospitalization of the patients in the hospital and cause imposing exorbitant costs on them.</p><p>At the initial experiences of primary percutaneous coronary intervention, the incidence of early stent thrombosis was associated with more than 24% of the cases; however, following the use of antiplatelet aspirin and ticlopidine drugs and acquiring appropriate techniques of stenting, this figure declined to less than 2 percent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>
</p><p>Clinical definition of the stent thrombosis includes each of the following items 30 days after the primary percutaneous coronary intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Observing stent occlusion based on angiographic criteria.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sudden death without any clear reason when not sure about patency of the stent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Myocardial infarction or need to emergency revascularization</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In a study, the prevalence of mortality following the early stent thrombosis is reported 7&#x02013;25 percent which the major prognostic factors included inadequate patency of the stents, residual tear and inadequate inhibition of the platelet aggregation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>
</p><p>In order to prevent from dangerous and deadly complications, various factors have been studied; the most important of which are using platelet inhibitory drugs. Conventional and routine dose of these drugs are about 75&#x02013;325 mg Aspirin and 300-600 mg Clopidogrel which the dosage would be different based on the type of the applied stents, the time of using and the dose of these two drugs. Using 150 mg Clopidogrel is recommended for the patients who have left main coronary artery involvement or if the only patent vessel of the patients had been PCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>
</p><p>It is recommended that combination of maintenance treatment be used for one year after the primary percutaneous coronary intervention and the combination of these two rugs also be used for at least 6 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref> One of the other causes of stent thrombosis is resistance to aspirin and Clopidogrel and/or inadequate dose these drugs in inhibiting the platelets. In a study, the comparison of Aspirin and Clopidogrel in inhibiting the platelets and resistance to them showed that stent thrombosis was more due to aspirin-resistance and increasing the dose of this drug had no effect on platelet inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>
</p><p>In a clinical trial study which was done by Steven in North America in 2011, 2116 patients who underwent PCI surgery were studied. In this study, 1053 patients (case group) received 300 mg Clopidogrel and the control group (1053 patients) received a daily placebo pill 3 to 24 hours before the surgery. Moreover, all the patients received 75 mg Clopidogrel for 28 days after the surgery and from the 29<sup>th</sup> day to the next 12 months after the surgery, the first group received 75 mg Clopidogrel while the control group received placebo. The results of the study after one year follow-up indicated that Clopidogrel could reduce the relative risk of mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke rate to 26.9%. In addition, taking Clopidogrel at least 6 hours before the surgery could reduce the relative risk of mortality rate to 38.6%. The mortality rate had no significant difference between the Clopidogrel group and placebo group since the 29<sup>th</sup> day to one year after the surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref> which was in accordance with the results of the present study.</p><p>In another study, 2954 patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention; it was concluded that doubling the dose of Clopidogrel could reduce mortality, MI and stent thrombosis in the first 15 days after the PCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>
</p><p>Considering the different results of various studies, the fact is that there are still not adequate available documents for a decisive conclusion. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of doubling the maintenance dose of Clopidogrel on early stent thrombosist.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This clinical trial study was done in winter 2010 in Shahid Chamran Hospital in Isfahan. The study population included all the patients with coronary stenosis who underwent stenting. Sampling method was done in simple consecutive sampling. The inclusion criteria included patients with marked coronary artery stenosis, candidates for stenting and desire to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria included stenosis in left main coronary artery and proximal part of LAD, allergy to Clopidogrel, implementing angioplasty, history of MI in the past month, symptoms toward congestive heart failure and stenting on the only patent vessel of the patient.</p><p>After selecting and obtaining the consent form, the patients were given the initial dose of 600 mg Clopidogrel one day before the PCI. The patients used two type of stents; Bare Metal Stent (BMS) and Drug Eluted Stent. The patients, who had PCI complications such as incomplete wall, dissection apposition or stent under expansion, were excluded from the study. Thereafter, the rest of the patients were divided into two groups with random allocation method. The first group was given 75 mg Clopidogrel once a day for 30 days. The second group also was given 75 mg Clopidogrel twice a day for 30 days. The mentioned patients were followed-up at the end of second and fourth weeks and the results were recorded in their files. Besides, the patients were recommended to contact the researcher if any problem such as bleeding or fever happened. The data was collected using a checklist which had been designed to do so through interviewing with the patients and their relatives, observing the patients&#x02019; status and also results of the angiography and physical examination. Collection of the data was conducted by referring the researcher to the patients&#x02019; beds and examination and also interviewing them to complete the checklist.</p><p>In order to review the drug complications such as bleeding, neutropenia (less than 1500 counts), thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and also gastrointestinal symptoms, hive and purities one month later, the patients were contacted and additional test (complete blood count, &#x02026;) was performed.</p><p>The data of the study, after collecting and revising were analyzed using Software SPSS<sub>17</sub>.

However, the initial dose in the present study was 600 mg while it was 300 mg in other mentioned studies which might justify lack of difference between the two groups of the present study. Thereto, considering the very low incidence of stent thrombosis, further studies should be done with larger sample size. Certainly, it should not be ignored that genetic differences, as indicated in the mentioned studies, in European and American races could cause similarity of the results because pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of the drugs are varied in different races. Besides, the above mentioned studies emphasized that the effect of increased dose might have different responses in low risk and high risk groups which may not specify this in general researches and requires to be conducted in the high risk groups separately.</p><p>At the end, it is recommended that future studies be done with larger sample size and higher dose and over a multi-level medical
