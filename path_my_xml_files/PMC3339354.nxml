Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective for pain relief, yet it is rarely practiced in the ED. The current study aims to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for providing effective analgesia to patients presenting with acute low back pain, migraine and ankle sprain at the EDs of four hospitals in Melbourne, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The study is a multi-site, randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial of acupuncture analgesia in patients who present to an ED with low back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. Patients will be block randomized to receive either acupuncture alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone. Acupuncture will be applied according to Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). Pain after one hour, measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS), is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes measures include the following instruments; the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire, 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life questionnaire and Patient's Global Assessment of Ankle Injury Scale. These measures will be recorded at baseline, 1 hour after intervention, each hour until discharge and 48 &#x000b1; 12 hours of ED discharge. Data will also be collected on the safety and acceptability of acupuncture and health resource utilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will determine if acupuncture, alone or as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy provides effective, safe and acceptable pain relief for patients presenting to EDs with acute back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. The results will also identify the impact that acupuncture treatment may have upon health resource utilisation in the ED setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12609000989246.aspx">ACTRN12609000989246</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>ankle sprain</kwd><kwd>migraine</kwd><kwd>low back pain</kwd><kwd>emergency</kwd><kwd>acute</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is evidence that pain is often inadequately managed in emergency settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Emergency department (ED) staff is constantly under pressure to assess, treat and admit or discharge patients within strict time constraints despite having little or no control over patient influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Hence, additional therapy that could provide safe and effective pain relief, shorten ED length of stay, and avoid patient admission would be advantageous.</p><p>Since 1984, acupuncture has been reimbursed by the Australian National health System under the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) (items 173, 193, 195, 197 and 199). In the 2009/2010 financial year, there were a total of 537,785 acupuncture services reimbursed by Medicare at a cost of $ 21,143,968. Of these services, only 49 were delivered within hospitals at a cost of $ 1,821 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The discrepancy between hospital and community acupuncture use suggests that acupuncture is under-utilised in hospital settings.</p><sec><title>Acupuncture research</title><p>Amongst Australian general practitioners (GPs), acupuncture is one of the most accepted forms of complementary medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In 1998, a United States National Institute of Health Consensus Conference Panel reviewed the status of acupuncture and concluded that: <italic>"There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture's value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value</italic>."[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] Similarly, in 2002, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that acupuncture is a safe, simple and convenient therapy and that its effectiveness as analgesia has been established in controlled clinical studies.</p><p>While the literature on the physiological effects and mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia is extensive, the clinical literature is of poorer quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most reports have methodological flaws including poor study design, inadequate statistical analysis, difficulties in diagnosis definition, unsuitable placebo or sham interventions and control groups, and a lack of funding, or qualified researchers with access to clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, it has been shown that acupuncture analgesia in the treatment of chronic pain is comparable to morphine and that its better safety profile and lack of dependence makes it the preferred method of choice for these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Also, the publication of the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines in 2002[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] has resulted in a dramatic improvement in the precision of reporting of acupuncture interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>There are very few clinical trials of acupuncture for acute pain to inform clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When reviewing the evidence for the use of acupuncture in acute settings, only two published randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in an ED setting could be located in the peer-reviewed literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One study found a significantly greater reduction in pain in the group receiving acupuncture and standard therapy, compared to the group receiving standard therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The other found that the use of concomitant auricular and electrical acupuncture, when implemented early in acute spinal cord injury, can contribute to significant neurologic and functional recoveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although these studies describe the acupuncture treatment protocol and utilised some blinding (blinding of assessors) they did not examine the effect on length of stay (ED and hospital), applicability or acceptability of acupuncture.</p><p>As of June 2011, virtually all of the 31 reviews and 32 review protocols listed in the Cochrane library suggest that the evidence for acupuncture is inconclusive. Consequently, there has been a call for the funding of well-planned, large-scale studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture under real-life conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that the best methodological approach to clinical acupuncture research is through pragmatic trials where acupuncture is compared to standard care rather than placebo-controlled trials. Such trials may be more able to provide data that is relevant to patients, practitioners and policymakers, and to inform decision-making about treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this research is to determine whether acupuncture is effective, safe and acceptable for patients presenting to the ED with low back pain, migraine or acute ankle injuries.

The DSMC will review all trial protocols, monitor patient safety, investigate any adverse events, and analyse mid trial results. They will terminate the trial if there are concerns for participant safety, or if the interim results indicate that a particular arm of the trial is clearly superior to the others.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We performed sample size calculations for each of the three conditions, i.e., back pain, migraine and ankle sprain, using both the equivalence (between acupuncture and pharmacotherapy) and non-inferiority (between combined and pharmacotherapy) approaches, assuming that a difference of 1.5 units in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score is clinically relevant. The conservative equivalence sample size will allow detection of superiority of the combined treatment arm if present.</p><p>Standard deviations were estimated from pilot data obtained from the Northern Hospital. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> was generated using sample size software (PASS2005; Utah; USA). It shows the number of participants required per intervention group (round to the next 5) to achieve 0.8 power at the 0.05 alpha level, after adjusting for an attrition rate of no more than 10%. Hence, the maximum number of subjects required will not exceed (70 + 60 + 55) &#x000d7; 2 + (35 + 35 +65) = 505. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis and found that the maximum sample size will reduce to 360 if the equivalence limit is defined as 2.0 units of VAS.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Sample size justification</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Testing</th><th/><th align="left">Power</th><th align="left">Sample Size</th><th align="left">Equiv Limit</th><th align="left">True Diff</th><th align="left">Standard Deviation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Equivalence</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Ankle Sprain</bold></td><td align="left">0.81</td><td align="left">35</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">1.95</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><bold>Migraine</bold></td><td align="left">0.80</td><td align="left">35</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">1.96</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><bold>Low Back Pain</bold></td><td align="left">0.80</td><td align="left">65</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">2.79</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Non-Inferiority</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Ankle Sprain</bold></td><td align="left">0.80</td><td align="left">70</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">3.25</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><bold>Migraine</bold></td><td align="left">0.80</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">2.98</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left"><bold>Low Back Pain</bold></td><td align="left">0.81</td><td align="left">55</td><td align="left">1.5</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">2.88</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Continuous outcome variables, of the groups at different time points, will be compared using mixed models with the treatment group as a fixed factor and time as a random factor. Categorical data will be analysed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). While all analyses will be undertaken following the intention-to-treat principle using imputation techniques, per-protocol analysis will also be undertaken as a form of sensitivity analysis. The Sharpened Bonferroni method will be used to adjust for individual alpha level when multiple testing is performed. For qualitative data, we will identify recurring themes and develop a conceptual framework to apply to the complete data set. Data analysis will be conducted by specialist statisticians' independent from the research team.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this research will determine if acupuncture, alone or as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy provides effective, safe and acceptable pain relief for patients presenting to EDs with acute back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. The results will also identify the impact that acupuncture treatment may have upon health resource utilisation in the ED setting.</p><p>These results could inform revisions of ED clinical pain management guidelines as well as the training of emergency physicians and ED staffing on a national and international level.</p><p>The results could also provide consumers with information about viable analgesic choices. If acupuncture is demonstrated to be effective in these conditions, there may be a number of patients with these conditions who seek out acupuncture rather than pharmacotherapy.</p><p>The research may also have a major impact on future research for other acute symptoms where acupuncture is thought to be efficacious.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in recruitment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MC conceived of the study, prepared the initial protocol and drafted the manuscript.
