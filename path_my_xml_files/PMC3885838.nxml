stabilization exercises on the electromyographic activity of the shoulder stabilizers in
normal adults. [Subjects] In the present study, 20 normal adults were divided into an
experimental group (EG, n=10) that performed cervical stabilization exercises and shoulder
stabilization exercises and a control group (CG, n=10) that performed shoulder
stabilization exercises. [Methods] The EG and CG performed their exercises three times per
week for four weeks. The cervical stabilization exercises consisted of Craniocervical
flexion exercises (CCFEs) that were performed using pressure biofeedback units (PBUs). The
shoulder stabilization exercises consisted of scapula-setting exercises, wall stretching,
and external rotation exercises. To examine the electromyographic activity of the upper
trapezius (UT) muscle, lower trapezius (LT) muscle, and serratus anterior (SA) muscle, the
electromyograms for these muscles were compared and analyzed. [Results] In comparisons
within the groups, the EG showed statistically significant differences in the UT, the LT
and the SA. The CG did not show any significant differences. [Conclusion] Cervical
stabilization exercises and shoulder stabilization exercises are considered to be an
effective intervention for the electromyographic activity of the shoulder stabilizers, the
UT, LT, and SA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cervical stabilization</kwd><kwd>Stabilizer</kwd><kwd>Electromyographic activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People often lean their shoulders forward or move their neck frequently when sitting in the
work environment, such as when driving or working in front of a computer or desk for long
periods of time, and use desks and chairs that are not suitable for their body types, as
well as inappropriate bedding. These poor lifestyle habits may cause muscle spasticity in
the neck and shoulders and induce muscle fatigue that hampers effective biomechanical
functions, and this may weaken soft tissures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Endogenous risk elements, such as forward head postures, change the kinematics and muscle
activation of the scapula region and increase stress on the shoulder joints, thereby causing
instability and bringing about dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, because stability can be more effectively provided when
the locations and alignments of all joints in the body, such as those in the head, neck, and
shoulders, are in neutral areas, to maintain shoulder stability, stability for maintaining
the normal posture of the neck is important. Thus, cervical stability is very important.
Recently, the roles of the longus colli and the longus capitis, which are deep muscles, have
been emphasized further in relation to the maintenance of cervical stability because
increases in the strength and endurance of the deep muscles can improve the ability to
maintain a standing posture and the proper neutral position of the neck.</p><p>Normal use of the arm is one of the essential elements for holding objects and maintaining
balance, and the stability of the shoulder complex is very important for functional and
efficient use of the arm. Shoulder complex stability can improve flexibility, coordination,
endurance, and muscle strength, thereby facilitating more efficient movements of the distal
part of the upper limbs and improving muscle endurance. Unlike various joints that rely on
ligaments, shoulder complex stability relies on muscles. Muscles that are essential for the
provision of stability include the rotator cuff muscles, the serratus anterior muscle, and
the trapezius muscle. These muscles are known to be important elements in maintaining normal
scapulohumeral rhythms. If these muscles are weakened, scapular winging will occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Along with the serratus anterior muscle,
the trapezius muscle is important for scapula stability, and it is also a very important
muscle because if it is weakened, the serratus anterior muscle&#x02019;s control ability will
decrease, resulting in instability. The effects of shoulder complex stability are not
limited to the shoulder, because biomechanical units such as the head, the neck, and the
shoulder are interconnected with one another through many complicated soft tissues, and
thus, individual segments can exert normal motor skills only when relatively appropriate
positions of the connected joints are maintained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Craniocervical flexion exercises (CCFEs), Swiss ball exercises, sling exercises, etc, are
used to reinforce the endurance and strength of the deep cervical muscles that play
important roles in maintaining posture and improving stability. CCFEs pull the jaw downward
and maintain the posture in a supine position, and they are frequently applied which is
frequently used in clinics in order to improve cervical stability. Falla et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> applied CCFEs by using a pressure
biofeedback unit (PBU) to improve the ability of cervical pain patients to maintain proper
neck alignment. Retraining the deep muscles of the neck can increase the activity of these
deep muscles and improve the ability to maintain standing postures and neutral positions of
the neck<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies on the effects
of CCFEs, which are cervical stabilization exercises, on shoulder stability are
insufficient. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of cervical
stabilization exercises on the electromyographic activity of the shoulder stabilizers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 20 healthy males in their 20s at Y University in
Chungbuk, Republic of korea. The study subjects were divided into an experimental group (EG)
(mean age 23.88&#x000b1;2.42&#x02005;years, height 176.5&#x000b1;7.82&#x02005;cm, and weight 68.88&#x000b1;12.93&#x02005;kg) that performed
cervical stabilization exercises and shoulder stabilization exercises and a control group
(CG) (mean age 24.50&#x000b1;0.84&#x02005;years, height 176.17&#x000b1;5.15&#x02005;cm, and weight 65.17&#x000b1;9.62&#x02005;kg) that
performed shoulder stabilization exercises. All the study subjects heard explanations of the
purpose of the present study and exercise methods and voluntarily agreed to the experiment.
All the subjects read and signed consent forms in accordance with the ethical standards of
the Declaration of Helsinki. Each exercise was performed three times per week for four
weeks. Thus, each exercise was performed twelve times in total. The selection criteria of
the study subjects were that they must have a sufficient range of joint motion to perform
the exercises required in the experiment and have no pain in the neck or shoulder joints.
Those who had received muscle strength reinforcement training within the last six months or
sustained orthopedic or neurologic damage were excluded.</p><p>Pressure biofeedback units (PBUs; stabilizer, Chattanooga Group Inc, Hixson, TN, USA) were
used to perform the cervical stabilization exercises. The PBU is a representative
stabilization apparatus using air pressure that can be applied to the waist, back, arms, and
neck. It consists of a pressure gauge and pressure cuff. The pressure gauge enables
numerical identification of the weight of the exercises being performed, thereby providing
visual feedback regarding whether the exercises are accurately performed qualitatively so
that the exercises can be observed in detail.</p><p>The scapula stabilization-related muscles were measured while the subjects performed the
push-up plus exercise. For the starting posture, the subjects were instructed to take a
crawling position, placing their hands at the shoulders to support their weight, with both
hands and both knees. Then, while maintaining the neck bone region and the backbone region
in a straight line to maintain the neutral position of the neck bone region, the subjects
were instructed to maintain a position in which the maximum isometric contraction could be
measured when the scapula was protracted for five seconds, which was done in response to the
verbal command &#x0201c;Start&#x0201d;. The experimenter measured the maximum isometric contraction three
times when the subjects held the posture correctly, and the subjects rested for two minutes
after each performance.</p><p>To measure changes in the electromyographic activity of the muscles, an MP150 (BIOPAC
Systems, Inc. Santa Barbara, CA, USA), which is a type of electromyographic (EMG) equipment,
was used. Surface electrodes were attached to the upper trapezius muscle (UP), lower
trapezius muscle (LT), and serratus anterior muscle (SA). The EMG signals were sent to the
MP150 system, converted into digital signals in the system, and processed in the PC using
the Acqknowledge software (Version 4.01). The average value of the EMG signals from each
subject was expressed as a percentage of the maximum value of isometric contraction
(%MVIC).</p><p>The EG performed cervical stabilization exercises and shoulder stabilization exercises,
while the CG performed only shoulder stabilization exercises. For the cervical stabilization
exercises, CCFEs were performed to reinforce the deep cervical flexor. The exercise method
was as follows: first, after taking the ready position by placing a PBU below the upper neck
bone in a supine position and inflating the PBU to 20 mmHg, the subject gently nodded his or
her head, as if saying &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d;. The subject was instructed to nod his or her head until the
targeted pressure of 22 mmHg was reached, and then, the subject maintained the pressure
accurately. Thereafter, the pressure was reduced to the initial pressure of 20 mmHg so that
the subject could rest. The exercise was performed by maintaining the targeted pressure for
10 seconds, followed by a rest for five seconds. This exercise was performed ten times in
total. After performing this exercise ten times, the pressure was increased by 2 so that the
subject had to maintain a pressure of 24 mmHG, and this was repeated until the target
pressure reached 30 mmHg. A rest period of one minute was given every time the pressure was
changed. To prevent the activity of the platysma or the hyoids as a form of compensation,
the subject was instructed to keep the tongue between the upper and lower teeth while
performing the exercise. The exercise was performed three times per week for four weeks.
Thus, it was performed twelve times in total.</p><p>For the shoulder stabilization exercises, the shoulder stabilization manual used in a study
conducted by Jung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> was used after revising
it to fit the situation of the present experimental study. The shoulder stabilization
exercises consisted of scapula setting exercises, wall stretching, and external rotation
exercises. For the scapula setting exercises, the subject took a posture in which the lobule
of the auricle was aligned with the acromion of the scapula in a prone position, and the
experimenter instructed the subject, saying, &#x0201c;Bring your shoulder toward your spine.&#x0201d; For
the wall stretching exercises, the subject was instructed to stand away from the wall at
arm&#x02019;s length in a vertical position, bend 90&#x000b0;, push the wall, and maintain that state. For
the shoulder external rotation exercises, the subject was instructed to maintain the
shoulder joint in a neutral position and the elbow joint in 90&#x000b0; flexion in a standing
position sideways to the wall, make the forearm touch the wall, perform an external
rotation, and maintain this state. During these exercises, each posture was maintained for
10 seconds, followed by a rest for 5 seconds. This was performed five times, and four sets
of these five repetitions were performed. A rest period of one minute was applied after each
set. Each exercise was performed three times per week for four weeks. Thus, each exercise
was performed 12 times in total.</p><p>In the present study, to examine changes in electromyographic activity within the groups,
paired sample t-tests were conducted. SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used for statistical
processing, and the significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of the present study, comparisons within the groups revealed that

complex way, and individual segments can exert normal motor skills only when appropriate
positions of the joints are maintained. CCFEs were implemented using PBUs to exercise the
longus capitis and the longus colli, which are deep flexors that play important roles in
cervical stability.</p><p>In a study conducted by Dusunceli et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was reported that 55 chronic cervical pain patients were followed
up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and according to the results, the group given physical
therapy and a cervical stabilization exercise program showed significant pain relief and
functional improvement, even 12 months after the treatment. Jull et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when CCFEs and cervical flexion exercises
(CFEs) were performed by chronic cervical pain patients for seven weeks to reinforce flexor
muscle strength and endurance, the strength of the deep flexor muscle of the neck increased.
McDonnell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when
exercise programs including CCFEs were applied to relieve headaches, the headaches were
relieved, and neck bone functions were improved.</p><p>Falla et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that performing
CCFEs for six weeks could relieve pain, as well as help in maintaining a neutral position of
the cervical spine. O&#x02019;Leary et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that coordination exercises through CCFEs and muscle endurance exercises through
CFEs showed immediate local mechanical hypoalgesic responses with regard to hyperalgesia in
chronic cervical pain patients. Cho<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when cervical stabilization exercises were applied to adult chronic cervical
pain patients for eight weeks, the patients&#x02019; pain was significantly relieved, and maximum
cervical muscle strength, muscle endurance, the range of joint motion, and muscular
cross-sectional areas increased significantly. In their study, Chiu et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when patients with chronic
cervical pain performed deep flexor exercises for six weeks, their level of pain and
disability index decreased significantly, and their cervical muscle strength increased
significantly as compared to with group that did not perform these exercises.</p><p>In the present study, electromyographic activity levels were compared within the EG and CG.
According to the results, whereas the EG showed significant increases in the UT, SA, and LT;
the CG did not show any significant differences. The significant increases in the
electromyographic activity of the UT, SA, and LT in the comparison of electromyographic
activity within the EG are consistent with reports in previous studies as follows: Lee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when CCFEs were performed
for five weeks to enhance the strength and endurance of the longus capitis and the longus
colli included in the deep cervical muscles, the muscle strength and endurance of the deep
cervical muscles were enhanced and that when shoulder muscle strength was measured through
using a Cybex device, increases in muscle strength were shown. Hur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in his study that when CCFEs were performed for
eight weeks to enhance the endurance of the longus capitis and the longus colli, the
strength and endurance of the deep cervical muscles were enhanced. Given these reports, it
is believed that as the muscle strength of the longus capitis and longus colli, which are
included in the deep cervical muscles, included in the deep cervical muscles increased, the
neck position was properly aligned, and a balance was achieved between muscle lengths and
muscle strength that enhanced the electromyographic activity of the muscles around the
shoulder: the UT, the SA, and the LT. The results of the comparson with the
electromyographic activity within the CG, where no significant differences were shown, are
inconsistent with the following results of previous studies: in a study conducted by
Jung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, scapula stabilization exercises
performed for eight weeks enhanced shoulder muscle strength, and in a study conducted by
Choi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, when wall stretching and
scapula setting exercises were performed for six weeks, the electromyographic activity of
the SA, UT, and LT increased. The reason for these inconsistencise is believed to be the
fact that in the present study, shoulder stabilization exercises were performed for four
weeks, which was shorter than the periods of exercise in previous studies. Therefore, the
EG, which used both cervical stabilization exercises and shoulder stabilization exercises,
improved the strength and endurance of the longus capitis and longus colli, deep cervical
muscles, more than the CG, which used only shoulder stabilization exercises. This improved
the ability to maintain the standing position and proper neutral position of the neck, which
in turn induced correct alignment of the shoulder girdle, resulting in the improved activity
of the muscles around the shoulder.</p><p>The present study has the following limitations. First, because the subjects were normal
males, the study results cannot be generalized. Second, because the stabilization exercises
were performed for a relatively short period of four weeks, it is difficult to consider the
results of the present study to be long-term treatment effects. Studies of the effects of
cervical stabilization exercises on the shoulder stabilizers should be conducted with
cervical pain patients in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Hur</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name></person-group>: Effects of neck stabilization exercise to the patients with chronic neck
