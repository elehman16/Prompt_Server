The primary outcome will be community reintegration using the Reintegration to Normal Living Index at 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of physical activity level using the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity and accelerometry; balance using the Berg Balance Scale; lower extremity function using the Short Physical Performance Battery; exercise capacity using the 6-min walk test; grip strength and isometric knee extension strength using hand held dynamometry; and health-related quality of life using the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension Questionnaire. We are also assessing cardiovascular health and lipids; glucose and inflammatory markers will be collected following 12-h fast for total cholesterol, insulin, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. Self-efficacy for physical activity will be assessed with a single question and self-efficacy for managing chronic disease will be assessed using the Stanford 6-item Scale. The Patient Activation Measure will be used to assess the patient&#x02019;s level of knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management. Healthcare utilization and costs will be evaluated. Group, time, and group&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time interaction effects will be estimated using generalized linear models for continuous variables, including relevant baseline variables as covariates in the analysis that differ appreciably between groups at baseline.

In 2013, we estimate that there were 405,000 individuals experiencing the effects of stroke in Canada, yielding a prevalence of 1.15%, and projected to increase to 726,000 by 2038 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By 2021, approximately 6 million Canadians will be aged&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years, substantially increasing the burden of disability associated with stroke within the next decade. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the risk for recurrent stroke is high: 26% at five years and 39% at ten years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An estimated 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008 and 6.2 million deaths were due to stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Low levels of physical activity have a long-term impact on mobility and health outcomes by perpetuating sedentary behaviors, contributing to further mobility limitations, and elevating the risk for future events. Decreased motor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are also associated with dissatisfaction and lower quality of life (QOL) after stroke. This downward cycle may be interrupted through regular exercise and enhanced physical activity, but formal rehabilitation services are time-limited, often lasting only a few weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and rarely beyond one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, few opportunities exist for ongoing community exercise beyond rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and many modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity, cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes remain poorly managed after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Innovative and sustainable community programs to optimize function and minimize burden and costs of stroke are urgently needed.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Benefits of exercise after stroke</title><p id="Par25">Persons with stroke need access to exercise programs where the benefits on motor control, strength, upper extremity function, mobility, balance, and aerobic capacity have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, often these programs are developed in the context of research projects and thus have time-limited accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A summary of these studies follows, with more detail provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Functional benefits with community-based exercise after stroke</title><p id="Par26">In pre-post intervention trials, community stroke exercise programs have been shown to improve muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], gait speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], balance ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], timed up-and-go time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Noteworthy are two prospective trials of community-based stroke programs. First, a prospective cohort design compared the impact of a self-management and exercise program to an education program (Living with Stroke [LWS]). Increased social support was observed following both programs, but only the exercise intervention also improved community integration, and benefits were retained 12 weeks after the programs ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Second, in one of the first randomized trials focusing on stroke-specific community-based exercise, the Fitness and Mobility Exercise (FAME) program was effective in improving aerobic capacity, gait speed, and paretic-side muscle strength, but no outcomes related to community reintegration or QOL were included, nor were follow-up assessments conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effects of post-stroke community exercise on cardiovascular risk factors</title><p id="Par27">While benefits to cardiovascular risk factors have been demonstrated after exercise in other populations, few trials have examined the analogous effects of post-stroke exercise. Cardiovascular risk factors, associated with primary and secondary event risk, are prevalent after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. High blood pressure (BP) is the strongest independent predictor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and interventions to lower BP are associated with lowered stroke risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and is associated with increased stroke risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Inflammatory markers are elevated with age and in the presence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, yet are inversely associated with physical activity and exercise in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In the few studies that have examined the effects of exercise training on cardiovascular risk factors after stroke, inconsistent benefits have been reported and none have examined the retention of benefits. Training-related improvement in BP at submaximal workloads of exercise has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but there are conflicting effects on lowered resting heart rate (HR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Even fewer studies have examined the effects of community-based exercise programs on cardiovascular risk factors. Improvements in fasting glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], insulin, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Community-based cardiac rehabilitation models of care that specifically focus on exercise and secondary prevention have also been adapted successfully for people with moderate disability from stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] with demonstrated improvements in a composite cardiac risk score, although not in individual risk factors such as waist circumference, cholesterol levels, BP, or aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In individuals with little to no disability following stroke, improvements in aerobic capacity, lipid profiles, and body composition measures were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cost-effectiveness of community-based exercise programs</title><p id="Par29">One of the aims of exercise programs is to increase overall physical activity levels to counteract potential negative health consequences that result from long-term sedentary behaviors. Cost-effectiveness analysis that jointly considers healthcare resource uses and effect on health-related QOL provides an important piece of information for policy making. A commonly used summary measure for cost effectiveness analysis is incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained by a new intervention in comparison to its comparators. The cost-effectiveness of strategies to promote physical activity have been demonstrated in various groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and high-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, such cost-effectiveness analysis for stroke-specific community exercise programs has not been previously studied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Need for effective and sustainable community stroke exercise programs</title><p id="Par30">The current state of evidence suggests that community-based exercise programs are beneficial in improving impairment, function, and health status and are greatly needed for persons with stroke. However, limitations of these studies include risk of bias, feasibility, and cost issues. The majority were non-randomized trials with small samples that did not evaluate for retention of benefits. Many studies were conducted in laboratory settings, required health professionals for program delivery, and therefore less sustainable, and did not include participant-important outcomes, such as reintegration and QOL. Few community-based exercise trials have examined the effects on cardiovascular risk factors and no previous study has included cost or healthcare utilization analyses. Moreover, many studies were conducted in laboratory settings, required health professionals for program delivery and therefore less sustainable, and did not include participant-important outcomes, such as reintegration and QOL. A Canadian trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to evaluate an evidence-based intervention with an adequate follow-up.</p><p id="Par31">From 2011&#x02013;2012, we undertook a randomized controlled pilot study, funded by the Ontario Stroke Network, to establish the feasibility and preliminary effects of FIT for FUNCTION, a community-based wellness program for stroke survivors. This 12-week YMCA-based exercise and self-management education program was compared to a 12-week standard YMCA membership (without participation in a formal program) that served as the control intervention. An innovative feature of this intervention lies in the LiveWell Partnership between the YMCA, Hamilton Health Sciences, and McMaster University that crosses sectors to create sustainable evidence-based community programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The Les Chater YMCA in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, was used for the site of this pilot study. The program was supported by a stroke rehabilitation physiotherapist from Hamilton Health Sciences and evaluation of program outcomes led by researchers at McMaster University. Sixty-one participants were evaluated pre and post intervention and at 24-week follow-up. As a result of this pilot study, we were able to confirm the feasibility of recruitment and randomization, and that stroke survivors could safely undertake this community-based exercise intervention. The FIT for FUNCTION group demonstrated greater improvement after the 12-week intervention compared to the control group with respect to community integration (Reintegration to Normal Living Index [RNLI]), balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS]), lower extremity function (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]), and walking ability (6MWT), which were maintained at 24-week follow-up. Specific measures of cardiovascular function were not included in the pilot study, nor were analyses of cost-effectiveness of the program.</p><p id="Par32">To confirm our preliminary findings and to expand access to the FIT for FUNCTION program to more communities across south-central Ontario, we propose a larger-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate FIT for FUNCTION in three additional YMCA sites in south-central Ontario (Downtown Hamilton, Brantford, Niagara). These programs will be supported by stroke rehabilitation physiotherapists from Hamilton Health Sciences, Brantford Community Health System, and Niagara Health Care System. This evidence-based initiative has modest resource demands, capitalizes on existing local community program infrastructure, and will serve as a model for sustainable, accessible, effective, and cost-effective wellness programs for individuals with chronic conditions. This larger study is single-blinded in design, will include additional outcomes related to cardiovascular health and function to evaluate the program&#x02019;s effectiveness on mediating cardiovascular risk, evaluate for retention of benefits following program completion, and examine the cost-effectiveness of this program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par33">The primary objective of this RCT is to assess the effectiveness of FIT for FUNCTION, a 12-week YMCA community-based wellness program specifically designed for people with stroke, vs a standard YMCA membership (no formal program) on community integration among people with stroke at 12 and 24 weeks. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of FIT for FUNCTION program vs standard YMCA membership on physical activity levels, physical functioning, health-related QOL, cardiovascular health, and self-management. Tertiary objectives are to evaluate the retention of benefits, healthcare utilization and costs, cost-effectiveness, and to determine the prognostic indicators associated with program responsiveness.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Research questions and specific hypotheses</title><p id="Par34">The proposed trial aims to answer the following research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par35">Is the 12-week FIT for FUNCTION stroke program more effective than a standard YMCA membership in improving community reintegration (primary outcome) at 12 and 24 weeks?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par36"><italic>Hypotheses:</italic> Participants in the FIT for FUNCTION group will demonstrate greater post-program improvement in community integration.

An interpretive phenomenological approach will be utilized, following a constructivist paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].

Effectiveness will be measured with QALY, using the utility values calculated from the EQ-5D-5L with duration. The main summary measure for the cost effectiveness analysis will be the incremental cost per QALY gained over the 24-week duration of the trial. Given that this cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted alongside the trial, non-parametric bootstrap will be used to calculate the 95% CI around the incremental cost per QALY ratio. The decision uncertainty will be presented using cost effectiveness acceptability curves, which show the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with the control group at specified societal willingness-to-pay for a QALY. The economic analysis will be conducted in using Statistical Analysis Software 9.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Feasibility</title><p id="Par86">The results of the pilot provided us with information about the feasibility of the project including the recruitment, randomization, the ability of this population to undertake and remain safely engaged in the program, and the suitability and responsiveness of the outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Protocol modifications</title><p id="Par87">We will communicate any changes to the study protocol to study investigators and the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and other research ethics boards (in writing) and electronically to the trial registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). Participants will be contacted by phone to communicate any change in risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par88">This proposed study will be the largest RCT examining the effectiveness of a community program for individuals with stroke. Additionally, as a RCT with broad study eligibility criteria, participants in the study will represent a wide spectrum of individuals living in the community with stroke, reflecting the heterogeneity of this population. Thus, if positive benefits are demonstrated, results will provide strong research evidence to support the implementation of structured, community-based exercise and education programs for a broad range of people living in the community with stroke. However, the rate of change is likely to be diverse, due to the wide age range and length of time since stroke, and this may limit the effect of the intervention. The advantage of the broad eligibility criteria is the generalizability of the results. We have expertise within our team to support the implementation of FIT for FUNCTION in communities from diverse regions; as a result of the pilot study, we developed strategies to address these challenges.</p><p id="Par89">The eligibility, as noted, for this trial are very broad so there will be a heterogeneous sample of participants with a wide range of function, fitness, and ages who will potentially participate. This approach was intentional as this will be the target population who will receive the intervention through the YMCAs if it is a positive trial. However, this broad sampling approach may diminish the effect size. Although the participants of the trial need to gain medical clearance to participate, referral occurs by self-referral or by a health practitioner. This may result in some degree of sampling bias since this approach may self-select people who have had a previous propensity for exercise and engagement in positive health behaviors. Attrition maybe a factor due to age, reoccurrence of stroke, or other health issues. Absenteeism is often seasonal in this age group, where attendance rates may drop in the winter months when travel becomes increasingly challenging. Depression is often associated with stroke and may result in difficulties for participants remaining in the trial. Since participants are required to have completed bloodwork before having their baseline assessment and randomization, it is possible that persons who would usually join an exercise trial but who would not wish to undertake bloodwork will exclude themselves.</p><p id="Par90">A limitation of the trial, as with most rehabilitation trials, is that it is not possible to blind the participants. Therefore, participants who are randomized to the control group may find it more difficult to adhere to exercise where there is less standardization and support compared to the intervention group. In addition, expanding this intervention to other YMCAs that have their own institutional idiosyncrasies may result in some site-specific effects, so we plan to examine the results of the trial by site. A further consideration is how time since stroke may influence the primary outcome of reintegration and may introduce bias. Persons who have low reintegration scores at one year, for example, may be different from participants with stroke who have low scores at 30&#x02013;60 days which would result in the population at risk being different at the assessment time points. Persons who enter the trial at shorter time post stroke may have more spontaneous improvement and reintegrate earlier biasing the comparison to the null while persons who enter later may have more severe disease which will decrease the likelihood of a response in either group. To address this issue, we will adjust for time since stroke in our analyses and also use time since stroke to create subgroups to examine the outcomes.</p><p id="Par91">A novel aspect of this study is it will be the first community-based trial to examine exercise-associated changes to cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the known increase in risk for recurrent events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], cardiovascular risk factors are often poorly managed after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The benefits of fitness training on walking ability are clearly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] but there is insufficient evidence that analogous improvements in cardiovascular risk factors can be observed. Few studies have included risk factors as outcomes and most have been conducted in research settings or in other controlled environments with smaller sample sizes. This study offers a large sample size to contribute to the state of the evidence related to changes in these risk factors following exercise and is the first community exercise trial to inform how to implement such strategies for secondary prevention within a sustainable community program model.</p><p id="Par92">Ultimately, the results will help to inform how healthcare institutions and community agencies can work together to provide long-term exercise to persons of all ages following stroke and will increase the understanding about the degree of support and tailoring required to make these programs effective. It will also provide the foundation for future studies using factorial designs to more specifically examine effects of dosage and exercise types.</p><p id="Par93">Another key innovation of the FIT for FUNCTION program is that it involves a unique and innovative collaboration through the LiveWell partners across healthcare, community, and academic centers. Our partners and collaborators include those who provide service delivery, those who coordinate regional stroke services, and from the Local Health Integrated Network who manage the overall integration of healthcare services. The YMCA delivers recreational services in all provinces and regions across Canada. This partnership will ensure that, if the results are positive, this model of care will be disseminated provincially and nationally within their organization and to other service providers. Each province and territory has a Stroke System and the YMCA is a national body, which will ensure that the impact from this trial is high.</p><sec id="Sec47"><title>Anticipated results and research knowledge translation strategies</title><p id="Par94">Results will be disseminated through professional organizations, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, peer review conferences, journal articles, and special interest groups such as local and regional stroke recovery groups. Provincially, the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators, Knowledge Users, and Collaborators on this current proposal will provide support and networking through Regional, Provincial, and National Stroke Networks such as the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada for other groups who wish to develop similar programs within their communities. The project results will be communicated at provincial and national stroke forums such as: The Annual Stroke Symposium Meeting of the Inter-Urban Stroke Academic Association; the Annual Stroke Collaborative; and the Canadian Stroke Congress. The LiveWell model and the study results will be also be disseminated provincially and nationally within the YMCA organization to stakeholders (healthcare professionals, healthcare administrators, and policy makers) from different provinces and territories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par95">Recruitment started in October 2014 and at the time of protocol submission, this study is recruiting participants.
