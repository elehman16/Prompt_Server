Our aim was to examine its efficacy and safety as monotherapy or in combination with commonly used oral antihyperglycemic drugs in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Patients on diet/exercise alone or diet/exercise plus an oral antihyperglycemic drug (sulfonylurea, glinide, &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor, biguanide, thiazolidinedione or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) were randomized to either 100 or 200&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin while continuing prior therapy. Patients were treated for 52&#x000a0;weeks in an open-label manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Canagliflozin significantly reduced hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose and bodyweight in all the study groups. Improvements were apparent by 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and were maintained for 52&#x000a0;weeks. The reduction in hemoglobin A1c ranged from &#x02212;0.80 to &#x02212;1.06%, and from &#x02212;0.93 to &#x02212;1.26% in the 100 and 200&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin groups, respectively. Drug-related adverse events occurred in approximately one-third of patients, and included hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia and pollakiuria. Hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia was most common in patients treated with a sulfonylurea. Most adverse events were classified as mild or moderate in severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study confirmed that treatment with canagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in glycemic control and bodyweight that were maintained for 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment irrespective of whether it was administered as monotherapy or in combination with another oral antihyperglycemic drug. Canagliflozin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no.

However, many patients continue to have inadequate glycemic control with diet/exercise alone or with an antihyperglycemic drug as monotherapy. Therefore, it is essential to consider the effects of adding novel oral agents, including SGLT2 inhibitors, to ongoing therapies if insulin therapy can be avoided.</p><p>Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control (elevated HbA1c) on diet/exercise therapy alone or diet/exercise in combination with an existing oral antihyperglycemic drug. The present study was carried out in accordance with the Japanese Guideline for the Clinical Evaluation of Oral Hypoglycemic Agents<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, which states that the efficacy and safety of oral antihyperglycemic agents should be examined in long-term, open-label studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Outpatients aged &#x02265;20&#x000a0;years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months before screening and HbA1c (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program values) of &#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;10.0% (monotherapy) or &#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;10.6% (combination therapy) were eligible for the present study.

The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT01387737). After providing informed consent, patients on diet/exercise alone or using one of six classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents underwent screening. A washout period was also included if another antihyperglycemic agent was used. At week&#x000a0;0, eligible patients were randomized to 100 or 200&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin. Diet/exercise therapy and the combination antihyperglycemic drug were to be continued unchanged from 83&#x000a0;days before week&#x000a0;0 until the end of the follow-up period. Visits were scheduled every 4&#x000a0;weeks during the treatment period, and at 2&#x000a0;weeks after study completion or at study withdrawal (if before week&#x000a0;52).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Five deaths occurred in patients treated with the antihyperglycemic agents (2 patients in the 100&#x000a0;mg group, 3 patients in the 200&#x000a0;mg group). Drug-related AEs occurred in approximately one-third of patients in each of the study groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Table S4</xref>). Between 1.4 and 6.9% of patients in each group discontinued because of AEs. The most common study drug-related AEs included hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia and pollakiuria.</p><p>The sulfonylurea dose was reduced in 5.6% (7/124) and 6.4% (8/125) of patients in the 100 and 200&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin dose groups, respectively. The glinide dose was reduced in 1.5% (1/65) and 1.6% of (1/64) patients in the 100 and 200&#x000a0;mg dose groups, respectively.</p><p>As expected from the properties of the combination drugs, the incidence of hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia was highest in patients treated with canagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Table S4</xref>). Among patients treated with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia occurred in 17.7% (22/124) and 14.4% (18/125) of patients treated with 100 or 200&#x000a0;mg, respectively, whereas asymptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in 14.5% (18/124) and 12.8% (16/125) of patients treated with 100 or 200&#x000a0;mg, respectively. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia (events that made the patient's daily activities impossible to perform) in any group. In patients treated with canagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea, the incidence of hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia (events per person-year) decreased from 4.28 before the sulfonylurea dose reduction to 2.24 after the dose reduction in the 100&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin group and from 8.57 to 3.09 in the 200&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin group.</p><p>Genital infections mostly occurred in females. Most of the events were mild in severity and the patients recovered after antifungal therapy. Urinary tract infections occurred in &#x02264;6.5% of patients in each group, and none of these events were severe. Volume depletion-related AEs occurred in &#x02264;4.8% of patients in each of the study groups. These events were generally classified as mild; none were severe.</p><p>Changes in laboratory values are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd11">Table S5</xref>. Reductions in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase) were observed in each of the groups, although the magnitude of reductions was not clearly related to the canagliflozin dose. Hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen levels increased in each of the groups, whereas the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio decreased. Serum creatinine levels increased slightly, whereas eGFR and serum uric acid levels decreased slightly in each of the groups. There were no significant changes in calcium and phosphorus levels, whereas magnesium levels increased slightly in all of the groups.</p><p>The mean total ketone body concentration increased in each of the groups, although the magnitude of the increase was not apparently related to the canagliflozin dose or combination treatment. Total ketone bodies (reference range &#x02264;130&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) increased to &#x02265;3,000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L in 22 patients and to &#x02265;5,000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L in six patients. The median total ketone body level increased to approximately 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L within 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks, but then declined to approximately 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L in each of the groups by week 24, and then remained stable thereafter. There was one episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, which was rated as severe, in one patient treated with 100&#x000a0;mg canagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea. This event occurred 13&#x000a0;days after discontinuing treatment with the study, and was accompanied by hyperglycemia (&#x02265;600&#x000a0;mg/dL), subjective feeling bad and vomiting. The patient's highest total ketone body level was 13,263&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L. The event was preceded by infectious gastroenteritis. Therefore, it was suspected that the episode of diabetic ketoacidosis was a result of the development of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus after viral infection. The patient's laboratory data were generally consistent with the Japanese criteria for fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis resolved after treatment with insulin and was not considered related to the study drug. This case of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus was reported as a SAE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study confirmed that canagliflozin as monotherapy or in combination with another oral antihyperglycemic agent lowered HbA1c and FPG, with effects that were apparent within 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks and were sustained for 52&#x000a0;weeks. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% increased between week 24 and week 52, showing the improvements in HbA1c continued over 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. We also observed marked improvements in bodyweight, BP and lipid levels (HDL-C and triglyceride) during the study.</p><p>Some antihyperglycemic drugs, including sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, are associated with weight gain<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, especially when used in combination therapy<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Therefore, identifying treatments that have beneficial effects on bodyweight is particularly important in the context of type 2 diabetes care<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In the present study, reductions in mean bodyweight were apparent within 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and continued throughout the 52-week study without an apparent rebound. Bodyweight reductions were also apparent in patients treated with a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, although the magnitude of the bodyweight reduction tended to be smaller in these groups than in the other groups. It is likely that the reductions in bodyweight in the first 4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks of the study are partly related to changes in fluid volume, mediated by increases in urine volume. However, the continued reductions in bodyweight over the 52-week study suggest that changes in metabolic activity also contribute to this outcome. This is supported by the changes in lipid levels and total ketone bodies, suggesting that the reduction in circulating glucose is compensated for by increased triglyceride metabolism.</p><p>The reductions in BP and changes in lipid levels, especially HDL-C and triglyceride levels, might be of relevance in terms of cardiovascular disease risk, although the study was not designed to address this possibility in terms of study duration or sample size. The mechanism and clinical effects, if any, of the increase in LDL-C levels observed in the present study and in studies of other SGLT2 inhibitors<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> also warrant investigation. The ongoing Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study should provide insight into the cardiovascular effects of canagliflozin<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>The improvements in glycemic control and bodyweight observed in the present study were consistent with those reported in other clinical studies of canagliflozin in Western<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and Japanese patients<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>The progression of type 2 diabetes is invariably associated with progressive &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and loss of insulin secretion. In the present study, we observed a reduction in the proinsulin/C-peptide ratio and an increase in HOMA2-%B, similar to the results reported by Rosenstock <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Stenl&#x000f6;f <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, suggesting that treatment with canagliflozin led to some improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function. Although the mechanism is unclear, we suspect that the improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function was secondary to a reduction in glucotoxicity<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> rather than as a direct effect of canagliflozin on &#x003b2;-cells, because &#x003b2;-cells do not express SGLT2. Intriguingly, SGLT2 deletion preserved &#x003b2;-cell function and increased &#x003b2;-cell mass in <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice fed a high-fat diet for 4&#x000a0;weeks<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, probably by preventing excess hyperglycemia.</p><p>Study drug-related AEs occurred in approximately one-third of patients, and the most common were pollakiuria and hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia. However, the incidences of AEs and drug-related AEs were similar in each group, and most were classified as mild or moderate in severity.</p><p>The incidence of hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia is at least partly attributed to the combination drug, because it was highest in patients treated with canagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea, and lowest in those treated with canagliflozin in combination with an &#x003b1;-GI, which are associated with low rates of hypoglycemia. Nevertheless, there were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia.</p><p>Urinary tract infection and genital infection have been reported in patients treated with canagliflozin, and are associated with the increased UGE<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. However, these events were relatively rare, were generally classified as mild in severity and were manageable.</p><p>The rise in urinary glucose increases the osmotic pressure of urine, hindering water reabsorption and promoting urine excretion, as evidenced by the high incidence of pollakiuria. High water loss might ultimately lead to osmotic diuresis and a reduction in intravascular volume. However, volume depletion-related AEs occurred in &#x02264;4.8% of patients in each group, and none of these events were severe. Nevertheless, slight changes in plasma volume could explain or contribute to the increase in hematocrit and the reduction in BP. We also noted a slight increase in serum creatinine, which might reflect dehydration over the short term.</p><p>There were increases in total ketone bodies in the early phase of the study, which likely reflect the changes in metabolic activity, shifting from predominantly glucose metabolism to triglyceride metabolism. However, the magnitude of the increase was not apparently related to the canagliflozin dose, and the levels gradually decreased over time. Although one patient experienced diabetic ketoacidosis as a severe event, it was not considered related to the study drug. There were no apparent explanations for the increases in ketone bodies in the other patients.</p><p>We also observed reductions in liver enzymes, suggestive of improvements in liver function, and in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, suggestive of an improvement in kidney function.</p><p>Some limitations of the present study warrant mention, including the descriptive nature of the analyses and the absence of placebo or other control groups. However, the inclusion of control groups was deemed unnecessary, because multiple studies have already confirmed the superiority of canagliflozin to placebo and would have exposed a large number of patients to unnecessary harm or high withdrawal rates because of inadequate glycemic control. Although the inclusion of active control groups was possible, this would have increased the complexity of the study. Furthermore, we did not statistically compare the doses or treatment regimens. However, our objective was to document the long-term safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in combination with a variety of oral antihyperglycemic drugs in accordance with Japanese regulatory guidelines, not to compare its effects with those of other drugs or to compare the effects of different doses of canagliflozin.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with canagliflozin as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycemic drugs improved glycemic control, bodyweight, BP and markers of &#x003b2;-cell function in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with a low incidence of SAEs. AEs of specific interest were generally infrequent and were easily manageable, although the incidence of hypoglycemia/asymptomatic hypoglycemia was slightly higher in patients treated with canagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea. The current data support the use of canagliflozin in clinical practice in Japan.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Canagliflozin is being developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation in collaboration with Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC.
