RESTORE is the first web-based resource designed to enhance self-efficacy to manage CRF following curative-intent treatment. The aim of this study is to test the proof of concept and inform the design of an effectiveness trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A multi-centre parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative process evaluation was employed in the study. Participants (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years; &#x02264;5&#x000a0;years post treatment with moderate to severe fatigue) were recruited and randomly assigned to RESTORE or a leaflet. Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, completion of outcome measures and process evaluation. Change in self-efficacy to manage CRF was also explored. Outcome measures were completed at baseline (T0), 6&#x000a0;weeks (T1) and 12&#x000a0;weeks (T2). Data were analysed using mixed-effects linear regression and directed content analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and sixty-three people participated in the trial and 19 in the process evaluation. The intervention was feasible (39&#x000a0;% of eligible patients consented) and acceptable (attrition rate 36&#x000a0;%). There was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the intervention group vs comparator (mean difference 0.51 [&#x02212;0.08 to 1.11]), though the difference in groups decreased by 12&#x000a0;weeks. Time since diagnosis influenced perceived usefulness of the intervention. Modifications were suggested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proof of concept was achieved. The RESTORE intervention should be subject to a definitive trial with some adjustments. Provision of an effective supportive resource would empower cancer survivors to manage CRF after treatment completion.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN67521059">ISRCTN67521059</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Web-based</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Macmillan Cancer Support</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>With improvements in cancer detection and treatment, the number of cancer survivors is steadily rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the consequences of cancer and its treatment can have a significant impact on health services and individuals&#x02019; daily lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is growing demand for tailored resources to support survivors to live with the consequences of cancer, including supported self-management, to address individual needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a frequently reported and distressing symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], is associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and can persist for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] after treatment completion. CRF can be difficult to manage; pharmacological solutions have limited effect and there has been a call for non-pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], cognitive behaviour therapy and psychosocial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] may improve CRF, but existing programmes are not accessible to many and often require significant input from trained professionals to deliver them.</p><p>Evidence is growing that Internet-based interventions can help people manage physical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Internet can reach a large population in a cost-effective way: 87&#x000a0;% of the British and 74&#x000a0;% of the US populations have access to the Internet with the over 50s being the fastest growing group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, with changes in cancer aftercare, particularly a move towards supported self-management, resources to support patients to self-manage are of utmost importance.</p><p>Foster and Fenlon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] devised a conceptual framework of recovery of health and wellbeing following cancer treatment which assumes that cancer and its treatment disrupt people&#x02019;s lives, and requires a process of recovery. The framework is underpinned by principles of self-efficacy theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Belief in one&#x02019;s ability to manage consequences of cancer and its treatment may be low after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and support to enhance self-efficacy to live with problems, and thus improve health and wellbeing, is likely to be an important part of recovery. Few web-based interventions for cancer survivors consider CRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and none have explicitly attempted to improve self-efficacy to self-manage CRF.</p><p>Interventions designed to increase self-efficacy to manage physical symptoms have been shown to be effective in chronic-disease populations, and several self-management programmes are designed to enhance self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Increased self-efficacy to manage a symptom may alter a person&#x02019;s perception of that symptom, making it feel less bothersome to everyday life, thus enhancing quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) and process evaluation was to test the proof of concept of RESTORE, a web-based resource designed to increase self-efficacy to manage CRF. Proof of concept was tested by exploring feasibility, acceptability and potential to increase self-efficacy to self-manage CRF following primary cancer treatment. Data from this study will also inform a sample size calculation for a full-scale effectiveness RCT. Participants were introduced to the trial in secondary care to test the feasibility of embedding the resource in this context. This paper presents findings of the exploratory RCT, following Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and informed by Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidance for clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Impact on health care resource use will also be explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The intervention</title><p>RESTORE was developed using LifeGuide open-source software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Full details of the development of RESTORE are provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>RESTORE consisted of five sessions informed by Macmillan Cancer Backup&#x02019;s leaflet, <italic>Coping with Fatigue</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; self-efficacy theory; cognitive behavioural therapy; and evidence of fatigue management in cancer survivors. The content of RESTORE is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, participants were limited to 6&#x000a0;weeks access to RESTORE and presented with sessions at weekly intervals. Sessions 1 and 2 were mandatory and introduced CRF and goal setting. For the next 3&#x000a0;weeks, participants chose from (i) diet, sleep, exercise, home and work life; (ii) thoughts and feelings; and (iii) talking to others. Participants can choose to complete all available sessions or spend more time on the area/s most important to them. Structured activities were available throughout including goal setting, automated tailored feedback on achievement of goals and fatigue level, and videos of patient stories. Participants were also encouraged to download and complete a fatigue diary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>A parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory RCT with a qualitative process evaluation was employed.

A range of cancer types were represented; the majority (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) had breast cancer. Six in the RESTORE group had accessed &#x02265;3 RESTORE sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Feasibility</title><p>One hundred and sixty-three participants were recruited, an average of five participants per week. Forty-one percent of eligible participants consented to the study (16&#x000a0;% of those screened). Nine percent of patients screened were ineligible due to a lack of access to a computer/Internet, and a further 1&#x000a0;% declined due to the web-based nature of the study.</p><p>Randomisation worked well; baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced between groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, the intervention group had a higher proportion &#x02018;not working&#x02019; (48.8 vs 36.0&#x000a0;%), primarily due to more retired people in this group, and a greater number of days since last cytotoxic treatment (577.71 vs 484.61).</p><p>No process evaluation participants reported having to learn new skills to use RESTORE. However, concerns were raised that older people might struggle if they did not use computers regularly. Some participants encountered problems navigating RESTORE, experienced difficulties logging on, had password refused and reported screens freezing or closing down unexpectedly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Acceptability</title><p>Half of participants in the process evaluation felt the timing of participation was &#x02018;about right&#x02019;. The remainder would have preferred RESTORE sooner. They were &#x02265;1&#x000a0;year from diagnosis and suggested benefits of participating before treatment completion.</p><p>Most participants identified benefits of taking part in the trial, including feeling supported and reassured that someone was interested in their condition. A number made positive changes to their lifestyle as a result of using RESTORE or the leaflet. For some, RESTORE had improved their understanding of CRF and how to manage it; for others, involvement in the trial offered a period of reflection and allowed them to re-evaluate what they could do. Most reported an increase in confidence to self-manage the effects of CRF and considered their CRF to be less bothersome.</p><p>Of those who accessed both RESTORE and the leaflet, half preferred RESTORE, finding it more flexible and interactive. Others felt the leaflet was more convenient as it was immediately available and could be consulted any time.</p><p>Suggested improvements to the intervention included providing more cancer-specific information and more personalised feedback.</p><p>Total attrition rate (consent to T2) was 36&#x000a0;%. Nine people (5.5&#x000a0;%) actively withdrew and 36 (22.1&#x000a0;%) did not complete follow-up questionnaires. Seven participants from the RESTORE group, and 2 from the comparator group missed T1 but completed T2 questionnaires. Four people were excluded due to metastatic disease. No adverse events were reported.</p><p>Seventy-one percent of participants were deemed to have adhered with the intervention (logged on to sessions 1 and 2 and a third session). Sixty percent logged on to four sessions, 43&#x000a0;% to five sessions. The <italic>Work and home life</italic> session was the most visited (51&#x000a0;% of participants) of the three &#x02018;optional&#x02019; sessions, and <italic>Talking to others</italic> was the least visited (27&#x000a0;% of participants). Within sessions 3&#x02013;5, participants engaged most with the goal-setting section and least with the goal review section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Potential to increase self-efficacy to manage CRF</title><p>Missing data were handled using multiple imputation where appropriate. Ninety-seven (61.0&#x000a0;%) complete cases were observed and 130 (81.8&#x000a0;%) people had &#x02264;6 missing values. Imputation models were constructed for all outcomes at each time point. As a typical example, the imputation model for fatigue self-efficacy at T1 included fatigue self-efficacy at baseline and T2, each of the other outcomes at T1, centre, group, age, gender and time since last treatment. Examination of partial correlations between all outcomes suggested the inclusion of baseline values of fatigue self-efficacy and BFI in each imputation model. Time since last treatment also required multiple imputation (missing <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15 [9.4&#x000a0;%]); the imputation model included all baseline values of outcomes, centre, group, age and gender.</p><p>Multiple imputation was performed using Stata 12.1. Predictive mean matching was used to ensure feasible values of the outcomes, with imputations drawn from the nearest three neighbours. Inspection of histograms suggested observed and imputed values had similar distributions.</p><p>The intended analysis (between-group, repeated-measures model with random intercept for centre and random coefficients for time) could not be implemented due to failure of the model to converge; we believe the highly variable nature of how fatigue evolves over time in an individual is the reason for this. Instead, simpler mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of the intervention on outcomes at T1 and T2 separately (controlling for baseline scores and with a random intercept for centre).</p><p>Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows mean scores for all outcome measures over the three time points.

Examination of available descriptive data suggests comparable use of resources between groups: mean number of visits to a GP practice at T2 2.29 (1.27) in the RESTORE and 1.90 (1.04) in the comparator groups, and 1.41 (0.80) and 1.29 (1.27) visits to the oncologist respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary aim of the study was to test proof of concept by establishing the feasibility and acceptability of RESTORE and the potential to improve fatigue self-efficacy following treatment with curative intent. The intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable and established proof of concept. Uptake of the intervention was high (39&#x000a0;%) compared to that of similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], suggesting a demand for supportive resources in this population. Although not powered to detect change, there was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the RESTORE group compared with the comparator group, though improvements in the comparator group meant the difference between groups was negligible by 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Participants in the process evaluation did not have to learn new skills to take part but felt those less familiar with the Internet would need support. Dropout was higher in the RESTORE arm and this may be because they struggled with the web-based nature of the trial.</p><p>Despite being a problem that is widely reported during treatment and in the year following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], fatigue is not routinely assessed or discussed. In this study, many people were experiencing fatigue in the years following treatment and found participation in the trial beneficial as an acknowledgement of their fatigue and its impact. This complements results from Yun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] who describe the only other web-based intervention for CRF, reporting improvements in CRF following a 12-week education programme.</p><p>There appears to be no discernible pattern to fatigue self-efficacy over time in this sample. This may in part be due to the complex nature of CRF and the wide range of time since treatment completion (&#x02264;5&#x000a0;years). For some, fatigue may be relatively short-lived; for others, it may have persisted for several years. Those with long-standing fatigue are likely to have tried a number of different strategies to manage their CRF. Other studies have identified the process of trial and error in relation to self-management of chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, timing of an intervention like RESTORE is likely to be highly important. Our results suggest that offering RESTORE soon after treatment completion may have the greatest benefit.</p><p>More people are turning to the Internet for health-related information but the need to reduce digital exclusion is recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Only 9&#x000a0;% of those screened for this study were deemed ineligible due to a lack of computer or Internet access; nevertheless, our results suggest some individuals have a preference for written media. Individual preferences are likely to be important for the success of resources such as RESTORE and need to be considered in future work&#x02014;e.g. asking people if they would prefer web-based, leaflet or a combination.</p><p>RESTORE appeared to have additional benefits when compared to the leaflet through the accessibility of the resource and the structured activities. There was evidence that participants engaged with RESTORE and gained benefit from doing so, in particular the goal-setting sections and interactive nature of the intervention. These components have been shown to be effective in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Some participants were more adherent than others, and these individuals appear to have yielded more benefit although a larger trial will enable us to test this.</p><p>The proportion of missing data across outcome measures was consistent, suggesting no single measure is particularly (un)suitable as a primary outcome in a future study, though methods to reduce missing data rates will be required. Low completion rates of economic data suggest these data collection methods should be simplified or condensed through, for example, use of alternative sources of routinely collected data such as Hospital Episode Statistics.</p><p>Participant dropout was higher than expected (particularly in the RESTORE group) and higher than reported in comparable studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This was explored in the process evaluation where some areas of improvement were identified, e.g. timing and choice of paper-based and web-based content. Measures to improve engagement with the resource need to be further explored. Higher dropout rates are not unusual for web-based intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Reasons cited for this include the severity and chronic nature of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], loss of interest and salient content. However, there is a paucity of data on approaches to sustain usage, and some data suggest participants who drop out may still benefit from the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a number of limitations. We compared RESTORE against a leaflet which was also an intervention. Our rationale for doing this was the importance of determining if RESTORE is likely to yield greater benefits than an existing resource. However, we were unable to restrict independent access to a publicly available resource by the RESTORE group. In addition, it was not possible to blind participants to group allocation. Additionally, we worked closely with recruiting sites through study days to talk through study processes and procedures. We involved people affected by CRF and they gave powerful accounts of their experiences of CRF. This raised awareness of CRF among research nurses who had not considered this to be a significant problem, and consequently, there were several reports of changes in practice. Process evaluation results should be interpreted with caution due to the low response rate. Finally, external generalisability is affected by the larger proportion of women (and participants with breast cancer) in the study.</p><p>The findings from this exploratory trial suggest that RESTORE is feasible and acceptable and warrants testing in a larger efficacy trial. However, a number of refinements to RESTORE are required before testing its effectiveness in a large trial, for example including cancer-site-specific information, providing more personalised feedback on progress and targeting the intervention for participants within 12&#x000a0;months of treatment completion.
