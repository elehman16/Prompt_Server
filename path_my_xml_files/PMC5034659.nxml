Diabetes management involves strict adherence to a complex regimen, and poor management and non-adherence are a persistent problem among children. Parent-child interactions and parenting have been identified as crucial points of intervention to support children&#x02019;s health and emotional well-being, yet few parenting interventions have been developed or evaluated for parents of young children. This paper describes a randomised controlled trial of a brief, group-based parenting intervention for parents of young children (2-10 years) with type 1 diabetes compared against care as usual (CAU).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Families will be randomised to either Positive Parenting for Healthy Living Triple P or CAU. Positive Parenting for Healthy Living Triple P involves 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;h group sessions. Outcomes will be assessed via parent and child questionnaire, home observations and blood glucose monitoring at baseline, 1-month and 6-months post-intervention. Primary outcomes will be parent- and child-reported parenting behaviour, parent-reported child behaviour and adjustment, and parent-reported child quality-of-life. Secondary outcomes will include parental self-efficacy with diabetes management, illness-specific and general parenting stress, parent-reported child illness behaviour, family quality-of-life, observed parenting and child behaviour, and child&#x02019;s illness control.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The theoretical background, study hypotheses, methods and planned analyses are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365312&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12613001281785</ext-link>.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition which requires constant attention and monitoring. Day-to-day management involves frequent blood glucose monitoring, multiple insulin injections, and regulation of carbohydrate intake and physical activity to prevent short-term and long-term complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the problems associated with poor management, non-adherence to diabetes treatment regimens is a persistent problem, and adherence tends to be worse than for other chronic health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Rates of adherence for insulin injections have been reported to range from 20 to 80&#x000a0;%, about 65&#x000a0;% for dietary recommendations, 57 to 70&#x000a0;% for blood glucose monitoring, and 19 to 30&#x000a0;% for adherence to exercise regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Research has established links between poor illness management and children&#x02019;s psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which may in turn contribute to poorer diabetes control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Parents play an important role in management of diabetes, especially with young children when parents assume complete responsibility for illness management. Parents of children with type 1 diabetes need to integrate general parenting tasks, such as helping children manage their emotions and providing them with appropriate social and play experiences, with diabetes-specific tasks, such as maintaining optimal blood glucose levels and responding quickly and effectively to emergency situations (e.g., extreme hypoglycaemia). Management of type 1 diabetes in young children requires them to cooperate with their treatment regimen, yet research has demonstrated that children with diabetes tend to report more behavioural, adjustment and emotional problems compared to healthy children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The link between ineffective parenting and child behaviour problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has been clearly established, and it plays an important role in parenting children with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Positive parenting behaviours characterised by positive, confident and effective parenting have been associated with better management of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], better child adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and diabetes-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Parenting and family factors also play an important role in child health outcomes. Factors such as positive and confident parenting have been linked with good diabetes control and treatment adherence in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, inconsistent and ineffective parenting practices (for instance, permissive parenting and overprotection) have been associated with poor metabolic control and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In spite of the clear links between parenting and child outcomes in the context of type 1 diabetes, a recent review highlights the scarcity of parenting interventions for this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most existing interventions are educational in nature, focusing narrowly on the child&#x02019;s medical management rather than on the broader psychosocial context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], despite evidence that behavioural interventions are more effective than educational interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although data on effectiveness of parenting interventions in children with type 1 diabetes is limited due to a relative dearth of well-controlled studies in this area, existing parenting interventions have demonstrated some potential for effectiveness in improving responsibility sharing and child cooperation in diabetes management, child behaviour difficulties, parental behaviour, parents&#x02019; psychological distress and child health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interventions aimed at reducing family conflict and improving family communication have also led to improved adherence rates and health outcomes for adolescents with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Given the increasing prevalence of the condition, the reported difficulties with illness management, the higher levels of child behavioural and emotional problems and the lack of evidence based interventions, there is a critical need to establish the efficacy of parenting interventions for parents of children with type 1 diabetes so that evidence-based parenting programs can be made available to families. Parenting interventions which aim to improve positive parenting practices may lead not only to better general child behavioural and emotional outcomes, but also better child health outcomes. Interventions which focus on parental skills, parenting efficacy and effective self-regulatory skills can assist parents to manage their child&#x02019;s condition more effectively through developing better daily routines and encouraging their child&#x02019;s involvement in illness management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Application of triple P in type 1 diabetes</title><p>The Triple P - Positive Parenting Program is an established, evidence-based system of parenting intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is based on social learning principles, cognitive-behavioural and developmental theory, and aims to treat and prevent child behavioural and emotional difficulties by improving the skills, knowledge and confidence of parents, improving communication between parents, and reducing parental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Several meta-analyses have provided solid evidence that the program is effective in improving child behaviour and parenting outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Triple P has been adapted for and found to be effective in different populations such as parents of children with a disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], Indigenous families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and parents going through a divorce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], among others.</p><p>To date there have been limited evaluations of Triple P with parents of children with a chronic health condition. Westruppet al. (2014) evaluated a 10-session individually delivered program (Standard Triple P) for parents of children with type 1 diabetes, aged 4&#x02013;12 years. Parents randomly allocated to the intervention condition reported improved parent mental health, parenting skills and family functioning at 3&#x000a0;months post-intervention, but no effects were seen on child mental health, child behaviour and glycaemic control at either 3- or 12-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses revealed that the program was effective in improving child behaviour in children with pre-existing internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems, with moderate-to-large effect sizes at 3&#x000a0;months post-intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Another study by Doherty, Calam and Sanders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] evaluated whether the Self-Directed Teen Triple P workbook (10 modules) plus a chronic illness tip sheet could reduce diabetes-related family conflict and parental stress in parents of adolescents (aged 11-17 years) with type 1 diabetes. Participants in the intervention group reported significantly improved diabetes-related family conflict problems after participating in Triple P compared to those in usual care. However, no significant difference was found between groups for parental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>In both of these studies, the content of the program was neither adapted nor tailored specifically for parents of children with type 1 diabetes or any other health condition (except for the addition of a chronic illness tip sheet in the study by Doherty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]), and this may be one reason why effects were seen on some outcomes but not others. Also, both used lengthy interventions (each lasting 10 sessions), which may be difficult to implement with this population considering that the day-to-day management of diabetes is in itself challenging and time-consuming. With this in mind, we set out to investigate whether a brief, tailored adaptation of Triple P designed for parents of children with a chronic health condition (<italic>Positive Parenting for Healthy Living</italic>) would be effective in improving outcomes for parents and children with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><italic>Positive Parenting for Healthy Living</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] is a two-session group program, with each session lasting about two hours. A brief, tailored program may be beneficial for families by minimizing the time required to participate in the program, resulting in increased parent attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Parents of children with a chronic health condition often report feelings of isolation and lack of social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; thus, a group program may provide an opportunity to connect with, discuss and learn from experiences of other parents experiencing similar issues, while improving cost-efficiency. This program has already been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial with parents of children with asthma and/or eczema (Morawska A, Mitchell A, Burgess S, Fraser J: Randomised controlled trial of Triple P for parents of children with asthma or eczema: Effects on parenting and child behaviour, submitted), which compared intervention to care as usual at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up, and demonstrated significant improvements in use of effective parenting strategies, parent stress, general as well as illness-specific child behaviour problems, parents&#x02019; confidence with illness management, and health-related quality of life for parents and families, with moderate to large effect sizes. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in parent-reported asthma and eczema severity were also reported, and results support the need for further research examining the effect of parenting interventions on illness management and health outcomes for other chronic health conditions.</p><p>A program with a generic condition approach was chosen for this study because primary care and community health services are more likely to care for children with a range of chronic health conditions; thus, a program addressing the common issues and concerns across different health conditions (with examples tailored for specific condition groups) may be more helpful from a large-scale population dissemination perspective. This is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the <italic>Positive Parenting for Healthy Living</italic> program for parents of children with type 1 diabetes. Given the scarcity of parenting interventions for this population, and demonstrated efficacy of the program in the asthma and eczema context, the program may have the potential to improve parent and child outcomes in the type 1 diabetes population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to use multi-informant assessment to test the efficacy of <italic>Positive Parenting for Healthy Living</italic> for parents of children with type 1 diabetes. Specifically, the primary outcomes will be: (i) parent self-reported parenting behaviour; (ii) child-reported parenting behaviour; (iii) parent-reported child behaviour and adjustment; and (iv) parent-reported child health-related quality-of-life. Secondary outcomes will be: (i) child&#x02019;s metabolic control (as indicated by HbA1c and within-range blood glucose readings); (ii) parents&#x02019; self-efficacy with diabetes management; (iii) parent-reported illness-specific child behaviour problems; (iv) parent-reported family quality-of-life; (v) parents&#x02019; diabetes-related stress and (vi) general parenting stress; (vii) observed parenting behaviour; and (viii) observed child behaviour. We hypothesise that, compared to a CAU group, the intervention group (INT) will show significantly greater improvement on each outcome measure at (a) post-intervention and (b) 6-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Approach and methodology</title><p>This research will evaluate a brief skills-training program for parents of children with type 1 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial comparing the parenting intervention against care as usual. A care as usual group was chosen as the comparator to allow for evaluation of the intervention against current practice. The CONSORT guidelines for randomised controlled trials will be used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>The study is a 2 (Triple P vs CAU) &#x000d7; 3 (time: pre-test, post-test, 6-month follow-up) design superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the Queensland Children&#x02019;s Health Services Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/14/QRCH/1) and the University of Queensland Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee (2013001357). This trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials registration: ACTRN12613001281785 (<xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>: Table 2). Ethics amendments approval will be sought before any further modification to the protocol is made. Any further approved changes to the protocol will also be updated on the trial registry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants will be 60 families of 2&#x02013;10 year old children with type 1 diabetes, recruited through primary care settings, paediatric specialists, specialist clinics at major Brisbane hospitals, and through targeted mail-out and media campaigns. Diagnostic confirmation of the child&#x02019;s diabetes will be sought from the child&#x02019;s treating diabetes team.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Parents of children aged 2-10 years with type 1 diabetes will be recruited. Parents must be concerned about their child&#x02019;s behaviour, emotions, or illness management to be included in the study. Parents will be excluded if: (i) the child has a disability, including language and speech impairment; (ii) parents are currently seeing a professional for the child&#x02019;s behaviour difficulties; (iii) the child has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for less than three months; (iv) parents are currently receiving psychological help or counselling; (v) parents are intellectually disabled; or (vi) parents do not read and understand English.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will primarily be recruited through in-clinic recruitment at the Endocrinology Clinic of the Lady Cilento Children&#x02019;s Hospital (Brisbane, Australia). All parents with a child between 2 and 10&#x000a0;years of age with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes listed on the hospital database will be mailed a letter of invitation to participate in the study. Parents can register their interest in the study by phone, email, or on the study website. Parents will also be encouraged to discuss any questions or concerns regarding participation with a member of the research team who will be present in the clinic.</p><p>Recruitment brochures and posters will also be distributed and displayed at GP clinics and paediatrician offices across the Greater Brisbane area. In addition, information about the study will be emailed to Brisbane schools for inclusion in school newsletters. The same information will also be available through advertisements posted on websites and social media pages of relevant organisations, such as Diabetes Queensland and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Australia. Other sources of recruitment include advertisements in the University of Queensland staff newsletter and posts on diabetes-specific parenting forums.</p><p>Interested parents will be assessed for eligibility and enrolled in the study by the study coordinator. Following eligibility screening, both parents will complete self-report assessment measures as relevant, and a home observation and child report measures will also be completed. All parent and child participants will receive information and consent forms detailing the project, and consent will only be gained once participants have had an opportunity to address any concerns or questions. Consent will also be sought to contact the family&#x02019;s diabetes team to obtain confirmation of the child&#x02019;s diagnosis and details of illness status. Participation will be completely voluntary and participants will be free to withdraw at any time. No further data will be collected from participants who actively withdraw from the study. Any families needing additional help at follow-up will be provided with appropriate referrals to community-based professional services. Participants will be provided with contact details for the research team and ethics committee should they need to report any adverse events. Detailed progress reports will be submitted to the relevant ethics committees annually, and any adverse events will be reported within 72&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation of participants to either the INT or CAU group will be done using a random allocation sequence, generated by a researcher not involved in the project, using a computer-based random number generator. A pre-prepared series of sealed opaque envelopes, each labelled with a participant ID number and containing a Randomisation Notification Letter, will be used to conceal the group allocation from researchers and participants until after completion of the baseline assessment. Participants in either group will continue to access their regular medical treatment with their child&#x02019;s diabetes team.</p><p>Immediately after completion of the baseline home observation session, the research assistant conducting the home visit will open the envelope, and participants will be notified of their condition. The Randomisation Notification Letter will be provided to the participant to retain for their records.</p><p>Participants will be assigned to intervention sessions based on individual preferences for day, time, and location, depending on availability of groups.

Since other research staff will not be blinded to allocation, a data monitoring committee is not needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention will consist of two, 2-h <italic>Positive Parenting for Healthy Living</italic> group discussion sessions. The content of the sessions draws on the theoretical principles that form the basis of Triple P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The sessions are designed to be interactive and provide opportunities for discussion.</p><p>The proximal targets of the intervention are parenting skills and confidence relating to both general child behaviour, and behaviour problems specific to illness management. The intervention aims to increase parental self-regulation, promote child self-regulation, increase positive parenting practices to promote child cooperation (particularly relating to illness management), lead to consistent discipline and promote routine, and enhance parents&#x02019; capacity to take care of themselves in order to reduce parenting stress and improve family wellbeing. The intervention will be conducted by parents with their children and there will be no direct contact with children in terms of intervention delivery.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Positive parenting for healthy living &#x02013; part I</title><p>The first session is designed as an introduction to the principles of positive parenting in the context of child chronic illness management. It begins by exploring the impact of the child&#x02019;s condition on the child, parent, and family, and introduces the principles of positive parenting as a way to promote children&#x02019;s development and manage children&#x02019;s behaviour and emotions in a constructive way.</p><p>It aims to assist parents to develop strategies to manage their child&#x02019;s condition effectively while minimising the impact on the child and family by continuing regular activities, having realistic expectations of their child and themselves, involving the child in age-appropriate diabetes management tasks, reducing child and family stress, balancing work and family, working as a team, communicating effectively with the child&#x02019;s diabetes team and caregivers, and helping siblings cope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Positive parenting for healthy living &#x02013; part II</title><p>The second session will be conducted one week after the first session. It aims to build on the principles of positive parenting introduced in Part I, to promote positive practices, assist parents to develop effective disciplinary methods, and help create environments conducive to caring relationships between parents and their children. It begins with a discussion of why children with chronic health conditions may be at risk of behaviour problems, before examining common parenting traps from the perspective of parenting a child with a chronic illness. The session focuses on providing parents with strategies that will empower them to prevent and manage problem behaviours and ensure their children are implementing their illness prevention and management plan appropriately (e.g., taking medication as prescribed, using devices correctly). Assertive discipline strategies are also discussed, including giving clear instructions, using praise effectively, and managing disobedience and problem behaviour.</p><p>Parents will also be provided with a &#x02018;Communicating with Others&#x02019; tip sheet, developed for this study, outlining suggestions for how to effectively communicate and work together with the child&#x02019;s other caregivers and health care professionals<italic>.</italic> Finally, parents will be encouraged to take their child to regular, ongoing visits with their diabetes team.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Care as usual condition</title><p>Families in CAU will complete assessments at baseline, 6&#x000a0;weeks later, and then again at 6&#x000a0;months. During this time, families will continue to receive regular medical management from their usual diabetes team, as appropriate. After the 6-month follow-up assessment, families will be offered participation in the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Protocol adherence</title><p>Each practitioner delivering the intervention will be trained using a standardised system of training and accreditation, designed to promote program use and fidelity. Practitioners deliver Triple P according to a standardised manual and follow treatment delivery protocols, and complete protocol adherence checklists for each session conducted. These will be reviewed and coded by a research assistant familiar with the protocols for adherence. Practitioners will receive regular clinical supervision. Group sessions will be videotaped and independently coded for protocol adherence, using structured session checklists.

In this study, we are taking a novel approach in shifting the focus of diabetes management from a traditional medical management approach to a more holistic approach which includes parenting intervention as a component of an illness management plan. In addition, including perceptions of intervention outcomes of both parents and children and applying an advanced statistical approach to modelling family system data will assist in expanding the theoretical understanding of outcomes and tailoring the intervention to better ensure sustainability of outcomes, as eventually it is the children that are the target and assumed beneficiaries of parenting programs. However, since this area is still in infancy and there is a paucity of well-validated child assessment measures for young children, it raises certain methodological concerns, such as the validity and interpretation of child responses. Thus, special care and caution will need to be exercised when interpreting child responses in this study.</p><p>Recruitment and enrolment to the study commenced in April 2014, and will continue until mid/late 2016.

It is expected that participating in a brief, group-based parenting intervention has the potential to decrease ineffective parenting behaviour, improve general child and illness behaviour, improve child and family quality of life, reduce parent stress, enhance parental self-efficacy and improve child&#x02019;s illness control.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec35"><title>Appendix A</title><p><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Data category</th><th>Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary registry and trial identifying number</td><td>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12613001281785</td></tr><tr><td>Date of registration in primary registry</td><td>20 November 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary identifying numbers</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Source(s) of monetary or material support</td><td>Australian Research Council&#x02019;s (ARC) <italic>Discovery Projects</italic> scheme</td></tr><tr><td>(Project ID: DP140100781)</td></tr><tr><td>Primary sponsor</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary sponsor(s)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Contact for public queries</td><td>Dr Alina Morawska</td></tr><tr><td>Contact for scientific queries</td><td>Dr Alina Morawska</td></tr><tr><td>Public title</td><td>Efficacy of the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) for parents of young children with type 1 diabetes</td></tr><tr><td>Scientific title</td><td>Efficacy of the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) for parents of children with type 1 diabetes in improving parenting skills and confidence relating to general child behaviour and illness management?</td></tr><tr><td>Countries of recruitment</td><td>Australia</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">Health condition(s) or problem(s) studied</td><td>Type 1 diabetes (Illness severity/control)</td></tr><tr><td>Parenting practices/behaviour</td></tr><tr><td>Child behaviour and adjustment</td></tr><tr><td>Parent adjustment and stress</td></tr><tr><td>Child illness behaviour</td></tr><tr><td>Parenting efficacy</td></tr><tr><td>Child's quality of life</td></tr><tr><td>Family quality of life</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention(s)</td><td>2 &#x000d7;
