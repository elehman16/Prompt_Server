Expression of the gene encoding NKB is elevated in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, rodent studies suggest that NKB signalling may mediate menopausal hot flushes. However, the effects of NKB administration on hot flushes have not been investigated in humans. To address this, we performed a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-way cross-over study. Ten healthy women were admitted to a temperature and humidity-controlled research unit. Participants received 30 minute intravenous infusions of NKB and vehicle in random order. Symptoms, heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and skin temperature were compared between NKB and vehicle in a double-blinded manner. Eight of ten participants experienced flushing during NKB infusion with none experiencing flushing during vehicle infusion (P = 0.0007). Significant elevations in heart rate (P = 0.0106 vs. pre-symptoms), and skin temperature measured using skin probe (P = 0.0258 vs. pre-symptoms) and thermal imaging (P = 0.0491 vs. pre-symptoms) characteristic of menopausal flushing were observed during hot flush episodes. Our findings provide evidence that NKB administration can cause hot flushes in women. Further studies are required to determine if pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling could inhibit hot flushes during the menopause and during treatment for sex-steroid dependent cancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hot flushes (or flashes) are intermittent episodes of sweating and heat sensation associated with decreasing circulating sex steroid levels. Hot flushes are experienced by 70&#x02013;80% of women during the menopausal transition and postmenopause, and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Hot flushes are also experienced by many patients undergoing sex steroid deprivation therapy for breast and prostate cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective and commonly used pharmacological treatment for menopausal hot flushes. However, current guidelines recommend a limited duration of HRT therapy due to the associated risks (e.g. breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, and thromboembolism)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore HRT is contra-indicated in many patients (e.g. history of thromboembolic disease, breast/endometrial cancer, liver disease), and may be unsuitable for patients with hormone-dependent cancers undergoing sex steroid deprivation therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Other therapies such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), gabapentin, and clonidine can be used to treat hot flushes. However these treatments are less effective than HRT and have a number of commonly associated adverse effects such as sedation, nausea and orthostatic hypotension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. There is therefore a major need to identify therapeutic targets to treat hot flushes more effectively.</p><p>Menopausal flushes are triggered by a fall in circulating sex steroid levels. Furthermore, thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus are thought to play a crucial role in mediating the hot flush response. However, the central mechanisms through which sex steroid deficiency triggers flushing remain unclear. Learning more about the mechanisms governing hot flushes may allow us to identify novel therapeutic targets to better treat patients affected by these symptoms. It has recently emerged that the hypothalamic hormone, neurokinin B (NKB) may play an important role in linking oestrogen deficiency to hot flushes. NKB is a decapeptide and a member of the tachykinin family of peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In humans, NKB is encoded by the TAC3 gene and binds preferentially to the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R, encoded by the TAC3R gene)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Hypothalamic NKB expression is elevated during menopause, and restored to normal levels with oestrogen replacement in monkeys<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, rodent studies suggest that the flushing response to oestrogen deficiency may be dependent on endogenous hypothalamic NKB signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. These animal data combined suggest that NKB signalling may be crucial in the hot flush aetiology.</p><p>The question of whether exogenous NKB can induce hot flushes in humans has not yet been investigated. We performed a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study to determine the effects of NKB administration on hot flushes in women.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee London &#x02013; West London (registration number 10/H0707/68) and were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

A cannula was inserted into a large forearm vein in both arms: one for collection of blood, and the second for vehicle (gelofusin) or NKB infusion. 30 minute iv infusion of either NKB (5.12&#x02005;nmol/kg/h) or vehicle (equivalent volume) were commenced at t = 60 minutes and t = 180minutes (90 minute washout period between infusions), by an investigator blinded to the identity of each infusion. Each participant received one NKB infusion and one vehicle infusion, randomised and prepared by an independent investigator. Participants were informed that they could receive any of the following: NKB followed by vehicle; vehicle followed by NKB; NKB twice; vehicle twice. This strategy ensured integrity of blinding, since any symptoms experienced during the first infusion would not allow participants to automatically deduce the identity of the second infusion.</p><p>In order to prevent confounding factors which may affect flushing, participants were asked to refrain from hot drinks, caffeine, alcohol and spicy foods for 12&#x02005;hours preceding the study start and for the duration of the study. All participants wore light cotton standard hospital gowns. All studies commenced between 9.30&#x02013;10.30am. Two experienced physicians were in attendance at all times.

An improved understanding of the central mechanisms responsible for hot flushes may lead to novel therapies for affected patients, particularly those in whom HRT is contraindicated. Recent data have implicated NKB signalling as an important mediator in menopausal flushing. Hypothalamic NKB neurones exhibit marked hypertrophy and NKB expression increases following the human menopause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Moreover, hypothalamic NKB neurones also undergo hypertrophy and NKB expression increases following ovariectomy in monkeys, while estradiol replacement restores NKB neurones to a size comparable to ovary-intact monkeys<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, ablating NKB receptor-expressing neurones (NK3R) within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus using NK3R-saporin, blocks the typical changes in tail skin and core body temperature in observed in rats following ovariectomy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The effects of NKB on flushing may be mediated within the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). The MnPO expresses the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R), and receives information from warm-sensitive, cutaneous thermoreceptors and projects to CNS centres to modulate heat dissipation effectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. C-fos expression (a marker of neuronal activation) in the MnPO increases in ovariectomised rats when compared with ovariectomised and estrogen-replaced rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Furthermore, micro-infusion of the NK3R agonist, senktide, into the MnPO reduces core temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>Collectively, the current and previous studies suggest that an increase in NKB signalling may trigger hot flushes during oestrogen sex steroid deficiency. Our data suggests that intravenous infusion of NKB induces hot flushes in healthy women. This is consistent with previous rodent data implicating the NKB signalling pathway as a novel therapeutic target for menopausal hot flushes. A number of NK3R antagonists have already been evaluated in humans for the potential treatment of schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. It would therefore be interesting in future studies to test whether NK3R antagonists could inhibit endogenous hot flushes in patients with sex steroid deficiency.</p><p>We took a number of precautions during the current study to optimise data quality and reduce bias. We used subjective reports of flushing as the primary endpoint of this study, since it is the gold-standard diagnostic measure (and the definition, itself) of hot flushes. We also measured objective clinical indices such as skin temperature, HR and skin conductance which are commonly altered during natural menopausal flushing episodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. All study visits were scheduled during days 3 to 10 of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase) when core body temperature is most stable. In addition participants received standardised instructions from a study investigator prior to each visit, and were asked to verbally report frequency and severity of any body sensations or symptoms in real time during the study. Furthermore participants were not specifically informed that they may experience &#x02018;hot flush&#x02019; symptoms to avoid reporting bias. During Study 2, participants received one infusion of vehicle and one infusion of NKB, in random order; therefore in order to prevent the identity of the second infusion being deduced from symptoms experienced during the first infusion, all participants and bedside investigators were intentionally told that either or both infusions could contain NKB (when in fact, only one of the two infusions would contain NKB). Finally, Study 2 allowed us to compare the effects of vehicle and NKB on flushing during the same study visit. Our data showed that the primary endpoint, i.e. hot flush symptom, was only observed during NKB infusion in healthy premenopausal women.</p><p>Menopausal flushing is known to be associated with increases in heart rate and skin temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. During menopausal hot flushes, HR has been reported to increase by approximately 5&#x02013;15 beats per minute without coincident change in blood pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and increases in skin temperature of 0.2&#x02013;1.0&#x000b0;C have also been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Indeed, during the current study, both HR and skin temperature increased significantly and by similar magnitudes to natural menopausal flushes. In addition, it is important to note that overall mean levels of HR, MAP and skin temperature were similar between <italic>entire</italic> NKB and vehicle infusions in healthy women, which suggests that NKB <italic>per se</italic> does not affect these parameters (i.e. significant changes were specific and confined to hot flush episodes rather than over the <italic>entire</italic> infusion duration). Our results therefore suggest that NKB elicits hot flushing episodes in women, which are accompanied by objective physiological effects similar to those observed in menopausal flushes. Sternal skin conductance, a surrogate marker of sweating also showed increases in 6/8 women in study 2, at the time of flushing episodes reported during NKB administration.</p><p>NKB is co-expressed within the arcuate nucleus with two other neuropeptides (kisspeptin and dynorphin) in kisspeptin-dynorphin-neurokinin B (KNDy) neurones, which regulate the secretion of gonadotrophin releasing hormone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Inactivating mutations in TAC3 or TAC3R cause pubertal failure in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. It was therefore important to measure any effects of NKB on reproductive hormone release. In this study we found at the dose tested, NKB had no significant effects on reproductive hormone release (consistent with our previous study investigating the effects of intravenous NKB administration on reproductive hormone secretion in healthy men and women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to consider whether the effects of NKB we have observed in this study are due to NKB action at central or peripheral NK3Rs. The various physiological parameters were not raised throughout the NKB infusion period, only during the acute intermittent hot flushes which favours a central site of NKB action. This is in keeping with data from animals which shows that microinfusion of NK3 agonist (senktide) centrally into the rat MnPO modulates body temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Furthermore, ablation of NK3-expressing neurones inhibits cutaneous vasodilation in rats as measured by tail-skin temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, NKB administration was not associated with gonadotropin secretion and hence this may suggest NKB actions at peripheral NK3Rs also contribute to the effects observed in our study. Whilst TAC3 and TAC3R genes are predominantly expressed centrally there is also expression in several peripheral tissues including the reproductive, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts with putative contributory roles in epithelial cell function, gastric motility, and airway physiology amongst others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Hence although the effects of NKB observed in the current study are consistent with a central site of NKB action, we cannot exclude the possibility that NKB acting at peripheral NK3Rs could be contributing to the effects we have observed.</p><p>In summary, our data shows that intravenous infusion of NKB acutely induces hot flushes in premenopausal healthy women. Further studies are required to determine if pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling could inhibit hot flushes associated with the menopause and treatment for sex-steroid dependent cancers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.J., A.C., E.S., M.H. and W.D. designed the study.
