treatment, there have been few studies of its effects in rehabilitation for acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the effects of a
home-based exercise training using a wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device on
ACS patients. [Subjects] Fifty ACS patients were randomly divided into a experimental
group of 25 patients and a control group of 25 patients. [Methods] The experimental group
received education on the training before discharge from hospital and started home-based
exercise training two weeks after discharge from hospital. The control group received
conventional treatments. The left ventricular function was measured in both groups before
the intervention at and 12 weeks, at the end of the intervention. [Results] Both the
experimental group and the control group showed significant improvements in the left
ventricular ejection fraction and number of regional wall motion abnormalities. In the
comparison of the two groups, the experimental group showed a significantly greater
decline in regional wall motion abnormalities than the control group. [Conclusion]
Home-based exercise training implemented with a wireless monitoring device was effective
at improving the left ventricular function of ACS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)</kwd><kwd>Home-based exercise</kwd><kwd>Ventricular function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The numbers of patients with circulatory disorders are gradually increasing in Korea and
the rest of the world due to health-related factors such as increased intake of animal fat,

methods suited to home-based rehabilitation, with the exercise intensity and protocols
prescribed by hospitals tailored to the needs of individual patients. Studies of the ability
of cardiac rehabilitation to treat ACS, which is closely related to sudden deaths, are
considered more meaningful in clinical terms than previous studies on various types of IHD
patients.</p><p>Therefore, the present study attempted to identify the effects of home-based exercise

Dongsan Center in Korea from October 2010 to March 2011, who received a percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI). The study was carried out until June 2011. Twenty-five of the
subjects were randomly placed in a experimental group which received cardiac rehabilitation,
and 25 subjects were placed in a control group with conventional care (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The cardiac rehabilitation program was comprised of
standard mediations of conventional treatment, education, and exercise training.</p><p>The selection criteria were individuals aged 20 to 70&#x02005;years with a diagnosis of ACS who had
received a PCI. Candidates with chronic stable angina, New York Heart Association class
III&#x02013;IV, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, chronic renal failure, or
exercise disabilities were excluded from the study.</p><p>The details of the study were explained to the subjects during their initial
hospitalization, and each patient read and signed the informed consent from approved by the
institutional medical review board.</p><p>A researcher who read and understood the educational content of the intervention, including
the risk factors for cardiac diseases, and the application of diet therapy and exercise
training, educated the subjects before they were discharged from hospital. The subjects
participated in the exercise program from the second week after their hospital discharge to
the 12th week. The exercise program consisted of a walking exercise four times a week. Each
exercise included a warm-up and a cool-down of flexibility exercises, each lasting 10&#x02005;min,
and the main walking exercise which lasted for for 30 minutes.</p><p>When the subjects performed the exercise at home, they were instructed to wear a wireless
ECG monitoring device (HeartCall<sup>TM</sup>, U-HEART, Korea) provided two weeks after
their hospital discharge. Thereafter, their ECG and heart rates were measured. The
researcher also conducted individual consultations with the patients over the phone at least
once a week to control risk factors, and to adjust the exercise intensity depending on the
phase of the rehabilitation program.</p><p>The exercise intensity was calculated in terms of heart rate reserve (HRR) based on the
maximum heart rate (HR max) and the resting heart rate (HR rest) measured through a gradual
symptom-limited exercise load test. The HHR was increased from 40% to 80% in phases. The
target HR was calculated using the Karvonen formula: target heart rate = (HR max &#x02212; HR rest)
&#x000d7; (percentage %) + HR rest. The control group was treated with standard medications and
dietary therapy for conventional treatments and performed home-based individual exercises.
This group did not participate in the cardiac rehabilitation program.</p><p>Both the experimental group and the control group underwent gradual symptom-limited
exercise load tests before the intervention and at 12 weeks, at the end of the intervention.
The subjects&#x02019; exercise ability was measured in a gradual symptom-limited exercise load test,
based on a modified Bruce protocol, performed on a treadmill (Marquette, GE, USA). In the
second minute of each exercise phase, the HR and blood pressure were measured using a
12-channel real-time ECG machine and an automatic blood pressure monitor (Ambulatory Blood
Pressure, GE, USA).</p><p>Before the intervention and at 12 weeks, at the end of the intervention, both the
experimental and the control groups underwent transthoracic echocardiography (Vivid7, GE,
USA). From this, the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular end-systolic
dimension, left ventricular ejection fraction, and regional wall motion abnormalities were
measured.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). The paired t-test was conducted to examine the significance of within group changes in
the left ventricular function resulting from the intervention. To verify differences between
the two groups, ANCOVA tests were conducted. The statistical significance level was chosen
as p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Echocardiography data of the experimental and control groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Variables</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Experimental group (n = 25)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group (n = 25)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After 12 wk</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After 12 wk</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LVDd (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.05 &#x000b1; 0.38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.90 &#x000b1; 0.81</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.06 &#x000b1; 0.62</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.15 &#x000b1; 0.45</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LVDs (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.51 &#x000b1; 0.43</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.56 &#x000b1; 0.69</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.50 &#x000b1; 0.68</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.45 &#x000b1; 0.73</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LVEF (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.48 &#x000b1; 9.40</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.04 &#x000b1; 9.42<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.12 &#x000b1; 8.32</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.64 &#x000b1; 9.34<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RWMA score<sup>**</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.32 &#x000b1; 0.39</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.08 &#x000b1; 0.17<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.37 &#x000b1; 0.36</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.29 &#x000b1; 0.32<sup>*</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD, * p &#x0003c; 0.05: comparison between baseline and 12 wk follow-up, ** p &#x0003c;

quickly and reduce risk factors associated with reoccurrence. Interventions include exercise
to reduce coronary risk factors and medications to prevent coronary artery diseases and
sudden cardiac deaths. In addition, the purpose of cardiac rehabilitation is to induce
various physiological adaptations in the heart, skeletal muscles, and blood vessels,
increasing oxygen content within the arteries during maximal exercises. Some studies have
recommended that regular exercise training should, in most cases, be prescribed based on
individual programs for primary and secondary interventions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the echocardiography results confirmed a statistically significant
increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction of both groups. However, the experimental
group attained a more significant increase, on average, than the control group. Also, the
number of regional wall motion abnormalities in the experimental group exhibited a
statistically more significant decline than the control group.</p><p>In both groups, the improvements in the left ventricular ejection fraction can be inferred
as having been influenced by the PCI and the medications, as well as the exercise training.
However, given that the scores of regional wall motion abnormalities showed a more
statistically significant decrease in the experimental group, the exercise training can be
considered to have been helpful in reducing cardiovascular blood circulation disorders
resulting from regional wall motion abnormalities.</p><p>A previous study that conducted exercise training for patients with coronary artery
diseases reported statistically significant improvements in blood circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study of IHD patients treated with
cardiac rehabilitation, Ahn et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that their patients showed a statistically significant increase in the left
ventricular ejection fraction. However, they detected no statistically significant declines
in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the left ventricular end-systolic diameter,
and the score of regional wall motion abnormalities. Andres et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that cardiac rehabilitation can increase heart
disease patients&#x02019; blood volumes at the left-ventricular end-diastolic and improve cardiac
outputs, as well as increasing maximum oxygen consumption, thus slowing the progress of
heart disease.</p><p>The findings discussed above are similar to the results of the present study of a
statistically significant increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction. However, the
fact that the present study also observed a statistically significant decline in the scores
of regional wall motion abnormalities may be meaningful. Based on the present results, we
conclude that stepwise individually prescribed exercises can increase patients&#x02019; maximum
oxygen consumption and reduce their myocardial burdens, thereby increasing left-ventricle
ejection fractions and reducing the occurrence of regional wall motion abnormality. To
achieve more significant improvements through exercise training, however, an extended
research period with a greater number of subjects should be undertaken.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study of ACS patients with IHD found statistically significant
improvements in left ventricular function following the implementation of a home-based
exercise training program shortly after the subjects were discharged from the hospital. The
anxiety that patients generally feel during exercising at home was reduced by wearing the
wireless monitoring device in this study, and the results of this study can be considered a
clinically meaningful. The findings of this study will need to be confirmed through future
studies based on additional cases of clinical utilization of the protocol described in this
study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">Statistics Korea: Statistics of
