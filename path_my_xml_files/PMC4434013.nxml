training on the gait of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] This study subjects were
20 stroke subjects patients who were randomly assigned to either the experimental group
(EG) or the control group (CG), 10 subjects in each group. Therapists induced arm swing of
affected side of EG subjects using Nordic poles, while subjects in CG had the affected arm
restricted to prevent arm swing. Training was performed for 30 minutes, 3 times a week for
4 weeks. The timed up and go test (TUG), the dynamic gait index (DGI) and the 6-minute
walk test (6MWT) were assessed before and after the training. [Results] After the
training, there were no significant differences in the TUG times of EG and CG. There were
significant differences in the DGI and the 6-minute walking distance of EG, but not of CG.
There were also significant differences in the improvements of the DGI and the 6-minute
walking distance between the groups. [Conclusion] Arm swing training had a positive effect
on patients&#x02019; gait ability. Further studies are required to generalize the results of this
study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Arm swing</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To maintain a functional and repetitive gait pattern, it is important to not only increase
stride length but also to recover gait symmetry<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, hemiplegic patients have a problem with gait symmetry due
to the asymmetry of the lower limbs and restrictions to the movements in the upper extremity
of the paretic side during gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
normal gait, rotational compensation of the arms in the direction opposite to pelvic
rotation plays a role in maintaining body balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining body balance is thought to reduce the overall energy
consumption used by the body<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jackson et
al. reported that energy consumption is reduced in terms of the overall body, despite energy
consumption by the muscles of the upper extremities involved in swing motion of the arms
during a gait cycle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is because the
swing of the upper extremities during the gait cycle induces trunk rotation which helps to
maintain body balance, thereby minimizing energy consumption. It has been reported that
treadmill gait-training programs are effective at improving the gait and balance abilities
of hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study aimed
to prove the clinical effect of treadmill gait training with active arm swings, which can
induce trunk rotation in the direction opposite to pelvic rotation. This maintains body
balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,

intervention program of this study, the gait training implemented by Behrman et al. and
Stephenson et al. served as references<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects held Nordic poles in both
hands during treadmill (M90T, Motus, Korea) gait training, while the experimenter also held
Nordic poles behind the subject and walked together with the subject, counting out loud to
help the subject swing the upper limbs. The gait velocity was increased gradually in
accordance with the individual gait abilities of the study subjects, and without interfering
with gait independence or stability. If degradation of gait independence or stability of a
study subject was noticed, the velocity was reduced to its previous value. The Nordic pole
was fixed with a bandage if a subject could not hold the grip of the pole using the hand on
the affected side. Arm swing treadmill gait training was performed by the experimental group
for 30&#x02005;min, three times a week for four weeks.</p><p>The control group performed arm-fixed treadmill gait training in the same way as the
experimental group, but with their hands holding the treadmill grip. If the affected hand
could not hold the grip, a bandage was used to fix it to the grip. Starting at a velocity
that did not interfere with gait independence or stability, the walking aped was gradually
raised from 1.0 Km/h initially up to 3.0 Km/h, according to the individual gait abilities of
the subjects. The velocity was increased in increments of 5%<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and if gait independence or stability were compromised due to the
increased velocity, the velocity was reduced to its previous value. Arm fixed treadmill gait
training was performed for 30&#x02005;min, three times a week for four weeks. The average speeds of
the experimental and control groups were (mean&#x000b1;SD) 2.8&#x000b1;0.4 and 2.1&#x000b1;0.7&#x02005;km/h, respectively,
and there was no significant difference between them.</p><p>The paired t-test was conducted to test the significance of differences in each group
between before and after the training, while the independent t-test was conducted to test
the significance of differences between the groups before and after the training. A
significance level to 0.05 was chosen for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the TUG and DGI and 6MWT values of the experimental and control

treadmill gait training groups before or after the experiment. However, the improvement in
the arm-swing treadmill gait training group after the intervention had a p-values of 0.06,
which was close to the significance level, whereas that of the arm-fixed treadmill gait
training group was 0.10. The arm-swing treadmill gait training group showed a significant
improvement in DGI compared to the arm-fixed treadmill gait training group after the
intervention. Arm-swing during gait helps hemiplegic patients to concentrate on awareness of
the upper limb on the affected side<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, arm-swing helps hemiplegic patients to recognize their arms as a feedback
mechanism, which is good for postural adaptation and balance maintenance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
as well as for minimizing the deviation of the body&#x02019;s center of gravity, thereby reducing
muscle effort and energy consumption during gait<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, arm- swing treadmill gait training can be considered a method
that improves the overall gait and dynamic balance abilities of hemiplegic patients.</p><p>The arm-swing treadmill gait training group showed a significant improvement in 6MWT from
239.6&#x000b1;98.8 to 278.5&#x000b1;99.3 m, which was significantly better than that of the arm-fixed
treadmill gait training group. The movements of the upper limbs of hemiplegic patients can
induce trunk rotation and influence stride length during gait. According to the study of
Stephenson et al., the simultaneous harmonic movements of the upper limbs during the gaits
of hemiplegic patients induce trunk rotation and increase the range of movement of the ankle
joints, thereby increasing stride length<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Wagenaar and van Emmerik reported that when the
movements of the upper limbs of hemiplegic patients are restricted, trunk rotation is
limited, thereby reducing stride length, weakening muscle power, and impairing
coordination<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly arm-swing
treadmill gait training for hemiplegic patients induces trunk rotation leading to increases
in stride length, muscle power, coordination, and gait endurance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that the study results cannot be generalized to all
hemiplegic patients due to the small number of study subjects. Also, the results do not
guarantee the long-term effect of arm-swing treadmill gait training, as the effect was
studied after only a four-week intervention. Therefore, it will be necessary to conduct
research that includes more subjects and analyzes the long-term effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical feasibility of integrating fast-tempo auditory
