It retains most of the advantages of phacoemulsification but can be delivered at a lower cost. It has come as a boon to fill the yawning gap between high cost, high tech phaco machine, and conventional large incision ECCE.</p><p>The MSICS is possible without application of superior rectus suture and construction of conjunctival flap. Elimination of these two steps will not only reduce the duration of surgery (minimal duration cataract surgery [MDCS]) but also have other advantages such as better, early healing, and lesser scarring. These modifications to the conventional technique will further refine the SICS and altering the position of incision to astigmatic neutral position makes this technique at par with phaco surgery. Minimal postoperative congestion, minimal scarring, and astigmatism are the final outcome of surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>There are differences in the healing effects of incisions at the limbus and the cornea.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Limbal incisions appear to heal more quickly and are more resistant to deformation pressure than those in the cornea. Clear corneal incisions also appear to increase the likelihood of visual threatening endophthalmitis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The clear corneal incision has the advantage of better anterior chamber (AC) approach during surgery, but its limitation becomes apparent when it needs enlargement, either for implantation of rigid IOL or in complicated surgery, where suturing will be required and astigmatism will be significant. Similarly, scleral incision has the advantage of lesser induced astigmatism, infections, despite large incision. However, it makes surgery difficult, particularly in hard cataracts, smaller pupil, and deep set eyes.</p><p>The sclerocorneal tunnel gives the advantages of both the approaches with lesser induced astigmatism and better AC manipulations. Hence, this study was taken up to compare the MDCS with oblique limbal stab incision in SICS and phacoemulsification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was carried out in 200 patients with 100 SICS (Group A) and 100 phaco (Group B). Each group was further subdivided into two groups of 50 each for right (A1, B1) and left (A2, B2). One hundred patients undergoing oblique incision (6&#x02013;7 mm) cataract surgery were compared with another age- and sex-matched 100 patients undergoing phaco (2.8 mm) surgery. Cases with complicated cataract, corneal diseases, preoperative &#x02013; astigmatism more than 1.5 D were excluded from the study. The patient were subjected to standard preoperative evaluation such as visual acuity (VA), slit lamp examination, IOP recording, fundus examination, keratometery, and biometry. Keratometery was done to know the astigmatism and cylindrical axis as most of the eyes had hazy media due to cataract. The procedure was studied in terms of astigmatism, visual outcome, surgical duration, surgeon comfort, patient comfort, and complications.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique</title><p>All surgeries was performed under local anesthesia using peribulbar block with 6&#x02013;8 ml of 2% xylocaine with adrenaline (1 in 2 lac) (Astra&#x02013;Zenecia Pharma India Ltd.,) and hyaluronidase (50 IU/ml) (Hynidase, Shreya Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd.,) using a 25 mm long 24 G disposable needle. All the surgeries were performed by a single experienced eye surgeon.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Stage 1: Direct stab incision: After application of wire speculum, the incision was given directly with keratome (2.8 mm) through the limbal conjunctiva, where it was firmly adhered with the episclera, without superior rectus, conjuctival flap, and cauterization. The tip of keratome was inserted just posterior to the limbus and slowly pushed through the limbal tissue [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. Once the tip reached in the cornea, the forward force was reduced and knife was slightly elevated initially to move along the corneal curvature and later dipped down into the AC to make a sharp and straight entry. The optimal incision depth was usually one-half of the thickness of the limbus or about 0.3&#x02013;0.4 mm. The length of the tunnel was 2.8 or 3.2 mm depending on the blade and breadth was kept with a similar proportion, respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 1b</xref>]. The shape of external entry incision was straight or slightly curved and that of internal entry was straight. The position of stab incision was oblique in superotemporal quadrant in right eye and superonasal in left eye taking 10:30 clock hour of limbus as center point.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stage 2: From entry into anterior chamber till nucleus delivery [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 2</xref>]

The tunnel was extended for SICS with 5.5 mm blade to the desired length based on the nucleus size and phaco was performed without extension. Care was taken while extending the tunnel, the extension blade was positioned straight in the stab and globe should be stabilized, so that external incision does not tear away. The length of the self-sealing incision varied from 6 to 6.5 mm for cortical cataract and could be extended safely from 7 to 8 mm for brown and hard Grade IV cataract [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(a) Group A1: Right temporal posterior limbal tunnel in small incision cataract surgery, (b) Group A2: Left nasal posterior limbal tunnel in small incision cataract surgery, (c) Group B1: Right temporal posterior limbal tunnel in phacoemulsification, (d) Group B2: Right nasal posterior limbal tunnel in phacoemulsification</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-10-155-g004"/></fig><p>In phacoemulsification, the surgery was performed with the same approach but a 2.8 mm posterior limbal stab incision was made in right upper temporal position in right eye and upper nasal position in left eye.

The trend in cataract surgery is now toward correction of low vision and any existing refractive error. Even where surgical services are available, low vision associated with cataracts may still be prevalent, as a result of long waiting for operations, cost and lack of information, and transportation problems.</p><p>The techniques of cataract surgery have been continuously evolving since its first description by Indian surgeon, Sushruta (6<sup>th</sup> century BC), who described it in his work the Sushruta Samhita.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] SICS is the simple, effective, cheap alternative procedure for management of cataract in the developing world.</p><p>MSCIS was developed mainly as a cost-effective alternative to phacoemulsification cataract surgery and will be the standard procedure where phaco surgery is not possible.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the developing countries where the cost is a major issue and number of surgeries performed by a surgeon is large, duration of surgery is not only important for handling more patients but also there is lesser tissue handling, coaxial light exposure, and less disturbances to ocular physiology [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 4</xref>].</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Postoperative photograph of a patient with phaco surgery at 6 weeks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-10-155-g009"/></fig><p>Maximum number of the patients in our study had preoperative VA &#x0003c;6/60. This might be due to the fact that most of our catering population is from rural setup, which seeks medical attention only when they become visually handicapped.</p><p>The difference between intraoperative complications was not statistically significant. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was the most common (16%) postoperative finding in SICS group and 5% in phaco group. The subconjunctival bleeding was due to the posteriorly located incision, where conjunctival vessels are present and cautery was not used. The SK was the most common (21%) complication in phaco group and it was seen in 7% of SICS group. Posterior capsular rent was seen in 1% of cases in SICS group and 7% in phaco group. SK and posterior capsular rent was higher in phaco group due to higher use of energy and manipulation in harder cataract (advanced Immature senile cataract or mature senile cataract). As most patients in our setup opt for late surgery once they have significant visual loss (&#x0003c;6/60). Hyphema was seen in 2% cases in SICS and 1% in phacoemulsification (statistically significant, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) but did not require surgical intervention. It was because of the posteriorly located incision where the conjuctival vessels are patent and the larger size of the incision in SICS. None of the patient in the two groups with oblique limbal stab incision had leaking anterior chamber or endophthalmitis.</p><p>The amplitude of postoperative astigmatism was higher in Group A (1.16 + 0.37) than in Group B (0.88 + 0.57). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. Pipat Kongsap documented[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that a superior scleral incision was associated with slight against-the-rule astigmatism (flatter vertical axis), while a temporal scleral incision was associated with slight with-the-rule astigmatism (flatter horizontal axis). Our study differ from the previous studies in respect to against the rule as major postoperative axis, possibly due to the temporal incision taken in these studies as compared to oblique incision taken in our study.</p><p>The site superotemporal (right eye) or superonasal (left eye) incision provides more space on the sides than superiorly in the absence of superior rectus suture. Planes of incision and intraocular manipulations are more accurate as eye is straight with better fundal glow rather than in down gaze position, as occur in superior rectus suture. The tunnel is created as one-step incision and 2<sup>nd</sup> step during extension; so the opposing surfaces are smoother for better sealing and healing. The closure placement of the tunnel to the limbus also facilitates delivery of nucleus.</p><p>Mean surgically induced astigmatism in Group A was 0.63 &#x000b1; 0.34 D and 0.45 &#x000b1; 0.39 D in Group B which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001 which is statistically significant). Oblique limbal stab incision in phaco causes less astigmatism. A 2.8 mm incision is too small to alter the corneal shape. Such an incision maintains the preoperative cylinder profile. Large incisions cause more flattening. The site of incision is between the horizontal and vertical meridian, which is the reason for lesser astigmatism in both the techniques (&#x0003c;1 D). We did not use cauterization in this technique which too reduced scaring and hence astigmatism. The surgically induced astigmatism with this technique is comparable with standard scleral incision cataract surgery but is more as compared to phaco. When the incision is located superiorly, both gravity and eyelid blink tend to create a drag on the incision. The superotemporal incision has a better wound strength due to minimal seperational force of the lid pressure and gravity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Total time taken for surgery during Group A 690.09 s as compared to 409 s in Group B. More time was taken in phacoemulsification group because most of the cases were having hard nucleus and hence surgeon comfort was also less. The technique of direct limbal stab incision reduces the overall surgical time to 9&#x02013;12 min by eliminating five surgical steps and related complications - superior rectus stitch, conjunctival flap, cautery, incision, and tunnel making. Thus, the difference in surgical duration between the two groups was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The lesser duration of surgery is very important because it reduces tissue manipulation and is useful in high volume surgery.</p><p>With the use of this technique, overall surgical time is reduced to 5&#x02013;8 min by eliminating three surgical steps - superior rectus stitch, conjunctival flap, and cautery. There are also no chances of postoperative ptosis as superior rectus suture is not applied. The healing of incision is also very fast as conjunctival vessels are patent and epithelialization covers the clean incision site quickly, good comfort, and visual outcome.</p><p>Patient's comfort is related to anesthesia during surgery and pain during postoperative period, which in turn is dependent on the tissue manipulation and extent of tissue damage caused by a procedure. Patient comfort was P1 in both the groups because with this technique we least disturbed the ocular physiology.</p><p>At 12 weeks 26% patients in Group A and 83% patients in Group B had VA 6/6. During whole course, postoperative VA remained statistically insignificant between two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.67) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. Ashwini <italic>et al</italic>. in their Hyderabad study reported that 82% of the patients in temporal group had VA of &#x0003e;6/9 compared to superior group in which only 78% of the patients had VA of better than 6/9.

A total of 64 eyes of 64 patients (34 male/30 female) with a mean age of 62.10 years (range: 45&#x02013;82 years) were included in the study. They found a significant against the rule shift in astigmatism in the phacoemulsification group and the MSICS superior incision group. The MSICS group with temporal incision had with-the-rule shift in astigmatism. At 90 days, conventional SICS superior incisions showed 1.92 &#x000b1; 0.53 D of against the rule astigmatism and temporal incisions showed 1.57 &#x000b1; 0.24 D of WTR astigmatism. Phacoemulsification with clear corneal incisions and scleral pocket showed 1.08 &#x000b1; 0.36 D and 1.23 &#x000b1; 0.71 D of astigmatism, respectively.</p><p>Thus, astigmatism with this technique is significantly less as compared to SICS and phacoemulsification done by clear corneal approach. Mean surgically induced astigmatism in Group A was 0.63 &#x000b1; 0.34 D and 0.45 &#x000b1; 0.39 D in Group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0015 which is statistically significant). The clear corneal incision has advantages like shorter tunnel length, no need of cauterization but it causes more astigmatism, infections and requires suturing if length of incision is larger than 3.2 mm. Hence it is not suitable for SICS. Hence, a direct posterior limbal incision has the advantages of both and the surgery is faster, has easier AC approach, lesser astigmatism, and rigid IOL can be implanted without suture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>One can eliminate the steps of bridle stitch, conjunctival flap, and cauterization and self-sealing tunnel can be made in single step by keratome 2.8 mm as done for phaco but at the posterior limbus and extended in second step for SICS. The technique is as effective, easy, less time-consuming, and eliminate the complications of these additional steps. SICS with oblique limbal stab incision technique is a rapid, cost effective and good alternative to phacoemulsification in hilly areas since the final visual outcome is the same with both the techniques. Although duration was more with phacoemulsification, it was because of the learning curve of phacoemulsification and the surgeon was an experienced SICS surgeon. The fact that the patients with rigid pupil and pseudoexfoliation were more in Group B also increased the duration in Group B. Surgically induced astigmatism was less with phacoemulsification (less than one diopter), with the advantage of extension without suturing, in cases where required (rigid intraocular lens and complicated cases). Phacoemulsification gives better BCVA in a larger proportion of patients at 12 weeks, so it is a good option with controlled parameters.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>What was known?</title><p>Standard MSICS is done by constructing a self-sealing tunnel using four different knives (incision blade, crescent knife, keratome, and extension blade) after bridle stitch, conjunctival flap, and cauterization, which consume more time, requires multiple steps. Conventional SICS superior incisions showed 1.92 &#x000b1; 0.53 D of against the rule astigmatism and temporal incisions showed 1.57 &#x000b1; 0.24 D of WTR astigmatism.

The technique is as effective, easy, less time-consuming and eliminate the complications of these additional steps. Astigmatism introduced by this technique in phaco is less than the clear corneal and scleral incisions in phacoemulsification.
