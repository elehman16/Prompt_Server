In addition to its anti-diabetic effect, metformin has also been associated with a reduced risk of cancer incidence of a number of solid tumours, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the underlying biological mechanisms for these observations have not been fully characterised in PCa. One hypothesis is that the indirect insulin lowering effect may have an anti-neoplastic action as elevated insulin and insulin like growth factor&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;1 (IGF-1) levels play a role in PCa development and progression. In addition, metformin is a potent activator of activated protein kinase (AMPK) which in turn inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other signal transduction mechanisms. These direct effects can lead to reduced cell proliferation. Given its wide availability and tolerable side effect profile, metformin represents an attractive potential therapeutic option for men with PCa. Hence, the need for a clinical trial investigating its biological mechanisms in PCa.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">METAL is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, window of opportunity study investigating the biological mechanism of metformin in PCa. 100 patients with newly-diagnosed, localised PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy will be randomised 1:1 to receive metformin (1&#x000a0;g b.d.) or placebo for four weeks (+/&#x02212; 1&#x000a0;week) prior to prostatectomy. Tissue will be collected from both diagnostic biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. The primary endpoint is the difference in expression levels of markers of the Fatty acid synthase (FASN)/AMPK pathway pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms. Secondary endpoints include the difference in expression levels of indicators of proliferation (ki67 and TUNEL) pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms.

Patients presenting with localised disease at diagnosis are categorised into low, intermediate or high risk based on clinical stage, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and histopathological Gleason score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current treatment options for men with intermediate and high risk disease include radical prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic or robotic) and radiotherapy with Neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormone therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, due to the risk of relapse in these groups, Neoadjuvant treatment has been investigated, but with disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) or impaired glucose tolerance are included in the cluster of disorders which comprise the metabolic syndrome (MetS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During the last decade, studies have investigated whether MetS is involved in the aetiology of PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A meta-analysis to quantify the risk of PCa related to MetS found a pooled relative risk of 1.54 (95% CI:1.23&#x02013;1.94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent studies have also suggested that the presence of MetS or some of its features is associated with higher grade disease in men with PCa and can lead to more rapid progression to castrate resistant PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is a biguanide class of oral hypoglycaemic agent and commonly used for the treatment of T2DM. Metformin inhibits gluconeogenesis and reduces circulating levels of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is also thought to play a role in lowering triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The usual dose is 2&#x000a0;g daily in divided doses and mild gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhoea is the most common side effect (&#x0003e;10%). Other common side effects include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. However, if dose escalation is perfomed carefully most patients are able to receive maximum drug dosing. Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but a serious adverse event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To limit the risk of lactic acidosis, patients with risk factors for its development will be excluded from the study (renal impairment, hypoxia, congestive heart failure).</p><p id="Par37">In addition to the anti-diabetic effect, metformin has also been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers, including PCa incidence and mortality in epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the underlying biological mechanisms for these observations have yet to be fully characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One hypothesis is that indirect insulin lowering effect may have an anti-neoplastic effect as elevated insulin and insulin like growth factor&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;1 (IGF-1) levels play a role in prostate cancer development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, metformin is also a potent activator of activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other protein synthesis. These direct effects can lead to reduced cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">A recent study has evaluated the effects of metformin on PCa focusing on the AMPK pathway in paired pre-treatment and prostatectomy specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although the study was limited by small sample size and lack of a control arm, a change in the proliferation marker ki67 could be observed following metformin therapy (mean 50% reduction). Together with our collaborators at the Centre for Molecular Oncologic Pathology (CMOP), Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), we have also investigated the molecular pathways involved in PCa in a cohort of 181 men. Preliminary results from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) cohort showed that men with higher levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) had an increased risk of prostate cancer death compared to patients with normal levels (unpublished data). Furthermore, Flavin et al. have shown that lack of AMPK activity is associated with and may be an important biochemical alteration in MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for the study</title><p id="Par39">A potential role for metformin in PCa has been suggested and given its wide availability, tolerable side effect profile and safety record it may represent a therapeutic option for men with PCa. However, the mechanism of action by which metformin exerts its anti-cancer effect has yet to be fully characterised. This &#x02018;window of opportunity&#x02019; trial provides an opportunity to investigate this by comparing baseline prostate biopsies with post-treatment surgical specimen by focussing on assessment of the FASN/AMPK axis. This study will have a placebo arm in order to provide a control group. Non-diabetic patients with newly diagnosed PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy will be eligible for treatment with metformin/placebo for four weeks prior to prostatectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Risk/benefit</title><p id="Par40">Usual timing between diagnostic biopsy and prostatectomy is four weeks on average, so therefore it is not expected that surgery will be delayed as a result of participation in this study. Since this is a proof of principle trial with a relative short duration of treatment, it is unlikely that patients will derive significant benefit by study participation. However, it has been shown that metformin is well tolerated in a non-diabetic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and it is not anticipated that patients will experience increased morbidity by study participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par44">This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, window of opportunity study investigating the biological mechanism of metformin in PCa. Patients with newly-diagnosed, early stage, prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy will either enter the main study and be randomised 1:1 to receive metformin (2&#x000a0;g daily over 2 divided doses; Arm A) or placebo four weeks prior to prostatectomy (standard of care; Arm B). A subset of five patients will enter the exploratory PET-MRI sub study. These five patients will all receive metformin and will undergo an additional two PET-MRI Scans (see below).</p><p id="Par45">Patients with a history of a current or historical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and/or prior metformin use will be excluded.</p><p id="Par46">The primary objective of this study is to investigate the biological mechanism of metformin on PCa using pharmacodynamic markers (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The primary endpoint for this study is the difference in expression levels of biomarkers representing the FASN/AMPK pathway for the metformin and placebo groups, as measured by the H score.

Secondary analyses will include a comparison of differences in expression levels of biomarkers of the FASN/AMPK pathway, as well as indicators of proliferation, between benign and malignant tissue. Finally, we will perform a multivariate regression analysis to predict effects of metformin on expression levels using tumour and patient-specific characteristics.</p><p id="Par162">Our original sample size calculation was based on the H-score used to assess expression levels of the studied biomarkers, which ranges from 0 to 300. We conducted a two-sided test (alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05; power&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.80) comparing the mean difference in the two groups for different scenarios as we will be testing different biomarkers. Based on these scenarios, we planned to recruit 90 patients for each arm over a period of 15&#x000a0;months. However, since the start of our trial we have also identified other pathways to be studied in the prostate tissue. Moreover, we will set up a stratification trial following the biological information obtained in this trial. As a result we have reviewed our sample size calculation by increasing the type I error to 20% - which will require us to only recruit 50 men in each group. As we will conduct a follow-up trial with a clinical outcome, the potential type I error can be corrected for in this second trial. At the current stage it is thus more important to reduce the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. Hence, we have not changed the power in our revised sample size calculation. Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> below shows the revised power calculation. In addition to the 50 patients in each arm, we will recruit an additional five patients in the exploratory endpoint group who will not be randomised.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Sample size calculation (two-sided test with power&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.80) to identify mean difference in H score between biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen for the metformin and control group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Mean Difference (SD)<break/>in Metformin Group</th><th>Mean Difference (SD)<break/>in Control Group</th><th>N needed<break/>with &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05</th><th>N needed<break/>with &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10</th><th>N needed<break/>with &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.20</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scenario 1</td><td>15 (35)</td><td>0 (35)</td><td>86</td><td>38</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Scenario 2</td><td>30 (65)</td><td>0 (65)</td><td>74</td><td>59</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Scenario 3</td><td>20 (25)</td><td>5 (25)</td><td>44</td><td>35</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Scenario 4</td><td>30 (50)</td><td>5 (50)</td><td>63</td><td>50</td><td>37</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
