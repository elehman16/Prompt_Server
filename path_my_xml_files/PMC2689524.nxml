Patients in the etanercept group discontinued sulfasalazine at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Clinical assessment</title><p>Response to therapy was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92 and 104. The primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving 20% or greater improvement, as defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> at week 24, was reported previously.</p><p>Key efficacy assessments included ACR response rates (ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70), disease activity score (DAS) and morning stiffness in minutes.

The PGAD is recorded on an 11-point numeric rating scale in which a score of zero means no disease activity and a score of 10 means extreme disease activity. For the GHVAS, patients responded to the question &#x0201c;How do you feel concerning your arthritis?&#x0201d; by marking the appropriate position on a 100-mm VAS ranging from &#x0201c;very well&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extremely bad.&#x0201d; For both PGAD and GHVAS, lower scores imply better health.</p><p>To determine whether PRO closely reflected clinical improvements, the study examined the relationship between changes in health status measures or disability and changes in disease activity. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the four PRO measures (HAQ, EQ-5D VAS, PGAD and GHVAS) and a measure of disease activity, DAS.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety assessments were based on reports of adverse events and results of routine physical examinations and laboratory determinations. An event was considered to be a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it occurred during the study or if the severity or frequency of a preexisting event increased during the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) included any event resulting in death, hospitalisation or cancer. An infection was a serious infection if reported as an SAE.</p><p>Testing for antinuclear, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-etanercept and anti-cardiolipin antibodies was performed at screening and at specified visits.</p><p>The incidence of malignancies in this study was compared with the incidence estimated from the US National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s (NCI) surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> The age and sex-specific incidence rates for cancer from the SEER database were applied to the exposure in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 response rates were analysed using the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, stratified by study centre. Changes from baseline in components of the ACR and PRO (HAQ disability index, EQ-5D, GHVAS and PGAD) were analysed with a two-way analysis of covariance with treatments and centre as factors and the baseline as a covariate. Efficacy analyses were based on a modified intent-to-treat population, including patients who received any test article and provided efficacy data at baseline and at any subsequent visit. The proportions of patients with clinically meaningful changes in the HAQ disability index at week 104 were compared between treatment groups using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analyses. Pearson correlation analyses were used to assess correlations between DAS and PRO over 104 weeks. The last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach was used to account for missing data points. LOCF imputation was also applied to patients who discontinued for unsatisfactory response. Adverse events were summarised and compared among treatment groups, using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The sample sizes, 100 for the etanercept-alone group and sulfasalazine plus etanercept group versus 50 for the sulfasalazine-alone group, gave approximately 90% power to detect pairwise differences in the ACR 20 response of 33% versus 66% between the monotherapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Efficacy</title><p>Of the 260 patients who were randomly assigned in the study, 254 patients received one or more test articles (etanercept 103, sulfasalazine 50 and combination 101).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The population was predominantly white, female, and had a mean age of 51 years (consistent with the typical RA population).

There were significant differences between the etanercept group and both the sulfasalazine and combination groups (p&#x0003c;0.001). Medically important infections occurred in more patients receiving etanercept (11; 10.7%) than in those receiving combination (5; 5%, p not significant) or sulfasalazine (0; p&#x0003c;0.05). After 352 days receiving combination therapy, one patient was hospitalised and withdrawn from the study and treated with antituberculous drugs following a histological determination of tuberculous lymphadenitis.</p><p>There was no clustering of SAE. In the 2 years of the study, 23 patients receiving the combination, 27 receiving etanercept and two receiving sulfasalazine had one or more SAE. Non-infectious SAE were significantly greater in patients receiving etanercept (20.8% for the combination and 20.4% for etanercept alone) compared with 4% for patients receiving sulfasalazine (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>At all scheduled visits, patients receiving the combination had a significantly greater reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts (mean change from baseline) than those receiving sulfasalazine alone (p&#x0003c;0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in this laboratory parameter between the etanercept and sulfasalazine groups. Across all treatment groups, no subjects developed any NCI grade 3 or 4 WBC abnormalities, except for one subject who had a transient grade 4 WBC abnormality that normalised. All mean WBC counts were within normal limits at all visits.</p><p>Leucopenia was reported as a TEAE in eight (7.9%) patients in the combination group, two (1.9%) in the etanercept group and none in the sulfasalazine group (p not significant). None of the events of leucopenia were associated with NCI grade 3 or 4 levels of neutrophils or other NCI grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. No patients withdrew from the study because of TEAE of leucopenia; all events were resolved during the study.</p><p>Malignancy was diagnosed in two patients receiving etanercept. One patient with a history of skin cancer developed actinic squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. The second patient, whose diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome after 12 weeks of etanercept, then developed myelocytic leukaemia and subsequently died.</p><p>The incidence of malignancy observed in this study was compared with the expected incidence based on the US SEER programme. The observed number (1.0) of malignancies in etanercept or combination-treated patients during the entire study was lower than the expected numbers (2.7) based on SEER, which excludes non-melanoma skin cancers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>The second reported death was a patient with interstitial pneumonitis, who had a history of smoking, coronary obstructive pulmonary disease and childhood pneumonia.</p><p>No patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus or a lupus-like syndrome, glomerulonephritis, pleuritis, peritonitis, or seizure. There were no reports of central demyelinating diseases in this study. Occurrences of auto-antibodies were not significantly different among groups at baseline and at the last visit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results from this 2-year double-blind, randomised study in patients with active RA despite sulfasalazine therapy provide further evidence that etanercept, either alone or when added to existing DMARD therapy, has a favourable long-term safety and efficacy profile. The addition of or switching to etanercept resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement of all clinical efficacy endpoints compared with sulfasalazine alone. The efficacy results were similar in both etanercept groups, indicating that patients inadequately responding to sulfasalazine would benefit by either the addition of etanercept to their existing (sulfasalazine) treatment or by switching from sulfasalazine to etanercept. Treatment with etanercept, sulfasalazine, or the combination did not result in any unexpected safety findings. The combination of etanercept and sulfasalazine was not associated with greater toxicity than either therapy alone.</p><p>Modifications to a less than adequate treatment regimen, such as the addition of another agent or substitution of a &#x0201c;failing&#x0201d; drug with another agent, are a standard approach. Clinical studies in patients with RA have shown that adding or substituting an anti-TNF agent to the existing methotrexate therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> results in a significant improvement in the therapeutic response. The addition of an anti-TNF agent to (or in place of) inadequate sulfasalazine has not been extensively evaluated in clinical trials. In the only other placebo-controlled trial in RA patients not adequately treated with sulfasalazine, adalimumab was added to the existing treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In that study, patients receiving the combination showed a greater degree of improvement than those receiving sulfasalazine alone. However, modest sample sizes (sulfasalazine alone, n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 33; sulfasalazine plus adalimumab, n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 29) make it difficult to compare the efficacy results among the treatment arms. In a larger open-label study evaluating adalimumab alone and in patients inadequately responding to at least one traditional DMARD, the number of ACR 20 responders was similar for adalimumab plus sulfasalazine and adalimumab alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></p><p>Patients who received etanercept monotherapy or etanercept plus sulfasalazine combination achieved significantly higher ACR response rates than patients in the sulfasalazine monotherapy group (p&#x0003c;0.01). For all three treatment groups, the core components generally followed the pattern of the ACR composite response. Mean ESR values in both the etanercept plus sulfasalazine combination and etanercept monotherapy groups were significantly lower than in the sulfasalazine monotherapy group from week 2 (p&#x0003c;0.01) to week 104 (p&#x0003c;0.01). For a short period (week 8 to week 20) the combination group had significantly lower ESR levels than the etanercept-alone group (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the difference was not significant from week 24 to week 104.</p><p>Physical function scores were significantly improved in the groups receiving etanercept, either alone or in combination with sulfasalazine, compared with sulfasalazine alone, using several previously defined thresholds.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> In patients with RA, a change of 0.22 or more units in the HAQ score has been used to estimate the number of patients with a clinically significant improvement in physical function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> In this study, by week 104, three in every four patients receiving etanercept, either alone or as add-on therapy, achieved a HAQ improvement of 0.22 or more, compared with less than 1 in two patients continuing on sulfasalazine therapy.</p><p>Etanercept and combination therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in all measured PRO than the modest improvements seen with sulfasalazine therapy. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between disease activity, as assessed by the DAS, and physical function, as assessed by the HAQ. Significant correlation was also observed between disease activity and other PRO, including the EQ-5D VAS and PGAD.</p><p>The study was originally designed as a 6-month trial, which is not long enough to detect radiographic changes, but was subsequently extended to 2 years. However, because both disease activity and radiographically assessed joint damage have been shown to be major contributors to the physical functioning of the patient with RA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> the significant improvements in disease activity and physical functioning would suggest that radiographic progression was inhibited in these patients.</p><p>Treatment with etanercept, sulfasalazine, or the combination did not result in any unexpected safety findings; however, the comparison of TEAE among treatment groups in this study has bias. Generally, with any drug patients report adverse events at a higher frequency during the first few weeks or months after the start of treatment and patients who cannot tolerate the drug are withdrawn. As a protocol-inclusion criterion, patients in the sulfasalazine group were required to have tolerated sulfasalazine well; hence, these patients were expected to report adverse events at a lower rate than patients receiving a &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; treatment.</p><p>The use of anti-TNF agents has also been associated with the increased frequency of autoantibodies, which could result in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> Although the number of patients who tested positive for anti-dsDNA increased by the end of our study, there were no relevant clinical symptoms associated with the positive anti-dsDNA test results in any of the treatment groups.</p><p>Leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have also been reported in patients receiving anti-TNF therapies. In this study, the incidence of TEAE of leucopenia was greater in the combination group (7.9%) than in the etanercept group (1.9%) or the sulfasalazine group (0%), but between-group differences were not statistically significant. Investigators categorised the severity of all eight events in the combination group as mild; none of the TEAE of leucopenia were associated with NCI grade 3 or 4 values of neutrophils or with other NCI grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. No patients withdrew from the study because of leucopenia. The lower WBC counts thus did not seem to be clinically relevant. Furthermore, there were no reports of aplastic anaemia or pancytopenia.</p><p>This study shows that the addition of etanercept to sulfasalazine, a DMARD other than methotrexate, can provide significant long-term improvement in efficacy. In particular, it shows that etanercept provides benefit when added to or switched with sulfasalazine in patients who show an inadequate response to sulfasalazine. The reported findings are especially relevant in view of the recent reports regarding monotherapy failures, which discourage the choice of both methotrexate plus sulfasalazine and leflunomide plus sulfasalazine combination therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Generally, combination treatment was not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Etanercept either alone or added to existing sulfasalazine therapy is associated with a favourable risk benefit profile, thus broadening the range of options for the treatment of patients with active RA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Ruth Pereira and J Maitland Young in the Publications and External Communications Group at Wyeth for their writing support and S Sun of Wyeth Research for contributions to statistical analyses of the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Supported by Wyeth Research, Collegeville, PA, USA (study drug and grants to investigational sites).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> Declared.
