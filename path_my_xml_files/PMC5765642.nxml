While antimalarial drugs, antibiotics and other definitive treatments are well understood, the role of emergency care with supportive therapies, such as maintaining normal glucose and electrolyte balances, has been given limited attention. Hypoglycaemia is common in children admitted to hospital in low-income settings. The current definition of hypoglycaemia is a blood glucose level&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;mmol/L in a well-nourished child. Outcomes for these children are poor, with a mortality rate of up to 42%. An increased mortality has also been reported among acutely ill children with low-glycaemia, defined as a blood glucose level of 2.5&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L. The reason for increased mortality rates is not fully understood. This proposal is for a randomised controlled trial to determine the impact on mortality of a raised treatment cut-off level for paediatric hypoglycaemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A total of 1266 severely ill children (age range&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x000a0;month &#x02013; 5&#x000a0;years) admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi with blood glucose in the range of 2.5&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L will be randomised into intervention or control groups. The intervention group will be treated with an intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose 5&#x000a0;mL/kg followed by a dextrose infusion in addition to standard care while the control group will receive standard care only. Children will be followed until discharge from hospital or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The first patient was enrolled in December 2016 and the expected trial deadline is January 2019. This study is the first to evaluate the benefits of increased dextrose administration in children presenting to hospital with low-glycaemia.

While the management of children in African hospitals and health centres routinely involves the administration of antimalarial drugs, antibiotics and other definitive treatments, the role of emergency care with supportive treatments, such as oxygen, fluids and glucose, has received less attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hypoglycaemia is known to be associated with poor clinical outcome and long-term negative effects on neurodevelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most low-income settings lack the capacity for rapid laboratory confirmation of hypoglycaemia and the presenting symptoms are often unspecific, such as drowsiness, agitation, hypothermia and seizures. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently defines paediatric hypoglycaemia as a blood glucose level&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;mmol/L (or&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mmol/L in a severely malnourished child) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A blood glucose level above these limits is considered adequate for sufficient energy supply for vital functions and particularly to the brain, which is dependent on glucose metabolism.</p><p id="Par15">Previous studies have shown that 1.8&#x02013;7.3% of children admitted to hospital in sub-Saharan Africa are hypoglycaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a recent study from north-eastern Tanzania, hypoglycaemic children had an increased risk of death with a mortality rate of as much as 42% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. That study and others in similar settings have also showed an increased mortality in children with low-glycaemia, defined as a blood glucose level of 2.5&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L, leading to a questioning of the current cut-off for hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In children with an emergency sign, as defined in the WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and low-glycaemia, the mortality was 15% compared to 6% mortality for those with an emergency sign and blood glucose&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L (personal communication Nadjm B 2015).</p><p id="Par16">Plasma glucose concentration is maintained by the interplay of the glucose-lowering action of insulin and the glucose-raising actions of the four counter-regulatory hormones cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon and growth hormone. The counter-regulatory response has been shown at plasma levels&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3.8&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In acute illness, the normal physiological response is the release of stress hormones such as cortisol, which activates the release of glucose into the blood, consequently increasing the blood glucose levels and causing hyperglycaemia.</p><p id="Par17">Paediatric neuro-endocrine responses in critical illness have not been studied in detail, although several differences in the host response in children compared to adults have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The &#x02018;natural hyperglycaemia&#x02019; occurring in critical illness due to the release of stress hormones could potentially be beneficial: the higher glucose concentration compensating for a decreased or dysfunctional circulation. The child with low-glycaemia may, therefore, be a result of late care-seeking or more severe illness leading to an abnormal stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and a &#x02018;pre-hypoglycaemic stage&#x02019;. Alternatively, the lack of an increased blood glucose level may be a result of failure to use alternative sources of energy such as ketone bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], infection with specific pathogens, prolonged fasting during the illness period and/or a sub-optimal nutritional status before the illness. These children may benefit from increased glucose administration.</p><p id="Par18">The current cut-off level for treating hypoglycaemia (&#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;mmol/L for well-nourished children or&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3.0&#x000a0;mmol/L for severely malnourished children) is based on pathophysiological assumptions that lack robust evidence. This study will report the effect of therapeutically targeting low-glycaemia, in other words the study tests raising the cut-off for treating low blood glucose from&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;mmol/L to&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific objectives</title><p id="Par19">

</p><p id="Par75">Primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Per-protocol analyses will also be conducted and the number of children who do not follow protocol will be reported. Protocol violations include, in the intervention group: failure to give an initial dextrose bolus; failure to repeat the blood glucose test after 30&#x000a0;min; failure to give a repeat dextrose bolus; failure to prescribe or to start the dextrose infusion or oral nutrition; incorrect dose of dextrose. And in the control group: admission to the ward&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;min after enrolment; additional blood glucose testing or dextrose administration in the emergency department. Protocol violations are included in the weekly data report from the data manager.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par76">Blinding of group allocation is not possible in the emergency department for the study participants, parents/carers or research staff as ethics preclude the administration of placebo intravenous fluid boluses. Data will be blinded to the data analysist by labelling the groups with non-identifying terms until data collection has been completed. Breakage of blinding will be possible for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) in the interim. A list of the randomisation code will be kept by the independent statistician in Malawi who can communicate with the data manager and the DSMB when needed. A sealed envelope containing the randomisation code will be kept in the investigator site file.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial monitoring and safety</title><p id="Par77">Trial monitoring will be done by an independent clinical trial monitoring team at pre-decided scheduled visits: before study-start; after the enrolment of 20 patients; at 50% enrolment; and at the end of the study. A three-member sponsor-independent DSMB who are not involved in the design or conduct of the study has been appointed to deal with any safety issues that arise while the trial is in progress and to scrutinise the interim analysis. The DSMB consists of one epidemiologist, one professor in paediatrics and one professor in biostatistics. SAEs are identified by the study team and reported to an independent Clinical Monitor within 48&#x000a0;h. Following the Clinical Monitor&#x02019;s assessment, the SAEs are sent to the DSMB and to the College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee. Interim analyses will be conducted by the trial statistician and reviewed by the DSMB. The intention is for an analysis conducted at 50% of information time (percentage of participants with data for the primary endpoint) though the DSMB committee may suggest other or additional times for interim analyses. The interim analysis will be done for trial safety including review of eligibility and treatment, summary of response, survival and any adverse events (AEs). Stopping rules are detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan, which can be requested from the study team. Any important protocol modifications will be communicated to the IRB, the DSMB and the trial registry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par78">The risk of AEs due to dextrose administration is low and is mainly related to complications of cannulation such as infections or subcutaneous fluid administration. The skin will be disinfected before pricking and the cannula removed in case of signs of subcutaneous fluid administration. Dextrose is a sugar that is rapidly metabolised to carbon dioxide and water in the body, providing energy. The administration of 10% dextrose may cause irritation to blood vessels with an associated discomfort that is self-limiting. Any SAEs occurring in participants, whether likely to be due to the trial or not, will be systematically recorded and reported.</p><p id="Par79">The use of intraosseous needles will be applied in situations of difficult intravenous cannulation. Considering that all study children present with one or many WHO Emergency sign(s), it is considered clinically warranted to ensure a soon access to the systemic venous system, but will only be applied after repeated attempts of intravenous cannulation. In cases of intraosseous cannulation, standard procedures will be applied to avoid complications such as proper cleaning and removal of the needle not later than 24&#x000a0;h after insertion.</p><p id="Par80">Knowledge about the impact of a raised blood glucose cut-off level for dextrose administration in acutely ill children will inform local, national and global management guidelines, potentially improving survival rates.</p><p id="Par81">Study findings will be communicated with the hospital management, the College of Medicine and the Malawian Ministry of Health as soon as available. Results will be further disseminated through scientific publications, presentations at international child health scientific conferences and to the WHO. Trial presentations will adhere to the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. If the findings have public interest, they will be disseminated through newspapers and radio broadcasting</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par82">Enrolling since 5 December 2016.

Eligible patients will be identified by study staff in the paediatric A&#x00026;E. If fulfilling inclusion criteria, a study nurse or clinician will approach the guardian and provide information about the study in Chichewa, the local language in Blantyre, or in English. Information will be given in or close to the Emergency room at the paediatric A&#x00026;E, depending on the severity of the child&#x02019;s presentation. After receiving detailed study information, guardians will be asked to provide written consent for their child to participate in the study&#x000a0;(Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, since some children will be in need of immediate emergency care, complete study information before provision of dextrose may not always be possible and, in this case, full study information will be deferred to after stabilisation of the child. If consent is denied after stabilisation or if the child dies, no data will be collected from the patient or guardian. In addition to consent, assent from children aged&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;years is sought. Enrolment will not be possible in patients who have already initiated treatment.</p><p id="Par87">If consent is withdrawn after enrolment in the study, no additional data will be collected and patients will consequently not be part of the primary analysis.
