There is an unmet need for further symptomatic therapeutic strategies, particularly as gait disturbances generally respond unfavourably to dopaminergic medication and conventional deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in advanced disease stages. Recent pathophysiological research pointed to nigro-pontine networks entrained to locomotor integration. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus is currently under investigation, however, hitherto remains controversial. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) - entrained into integrative locomotor networks - is pathologically overactive in PD. High-frequent stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata preferentially modulated axial symptoms and therefore is suggested as a novel therapeutic candidate target for neuromodulation of refractory gait disturbances in PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and refractory gait disturbances under best individual subthalamic nucleus stimulation and dopaminergic medication will be enroled into this double-blind 2 &#x000d7; 2 cross-over clinical trial. The treatment consists of two different stimulation settings using <italic>(i) </italic>conventional stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus [STNmono] and <italic>(ii) </italic>combined stimulation of distant electrode contacts located in the subthalamic nucleus and caudal border zone of STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata [STN+SNr]. The primary outcome measure is the change of the cumulative 'axial score' (UPDRS II items '13-15' and UPRDS III items '27-31') at three weeks of constant stimulation in either condition. Secondary outcome measures include specific scores on freezing of gait, balance function, quality of life, non-motor symptoms, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of the present trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of a three week constant combined stimulation on [STN+SNr] compared to [STNmono]. The results will clarify, whether stimulation on nigral contacts additional to subthalamic stimulation will improve therapeutic response of otherwise refractory gait disturbances in PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered with the clinical trials register of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01355835">NCT01355835</ext-link>)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation (DBS)</kwd><kwd>freezing of gait (FOG)</kwd><kwd>gait disturbance</kwd><kwd>interleaved pulses</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>stimulation</kwd><kwd>substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)</kwd><kwd>subthalamic nucleus (STN)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Refractory gait disturbances in Parkinson's disease</title><p>Severe gait disturbances in idiopathic Parkinson's disease are observed in up to 80% of the patients in advanced disease stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] with important impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therapeutic deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) as an evidence-based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] generally ameliorates segmental symptoms and motor fluctuations, whereas axial symptoms and in particular gait disturbances may respond unfavourably and generally aggravate in parallel with the underlying neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this condition, increasing intensity of high-frequent STN-DBS at 130 Hz even worsens the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Currently, several approaches are under investigation in order to address the therapeutic need for gait disturbances refractory to dopaminergic treatment and STN-DBS. STN-DBS on lower frequencies, e.g. at 60 Hz can improve gait disturbances, however is limited by the recurrence of segmental symptoms like tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine area for refractory gait disturbances remains controversial at the moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], however several experimental lines of evidence demonstrated the integrative role of reciprocal brainstem circuitries including substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the pedunculopontine area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Importantly, activity of the SNr can be modulated after implantation for conventional STN-DBS, as the caudal electrode contacts are generally located in the caudal border zone of STN and SNr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous stimulation of STN and SNr with <italic>interleaved pulses</italic>: uncovering of a novel stimulation paradigm for refractory gait disturbances?</title><p>At present, stimulation impulses are generally delivered on single monopolar contacts polarised against the generator case or between bipolar adjacent electrode contacts. Recently, the advancement of the implantable impulse generators enabled the novel paradigm of the so-called <italic>'interleaved pulses'</italic>, i.e. stimulation impulses are delivered simultaneously on two different contacts in alternating order. Importantly, each of the contacts can be programmed onto specific parameters (amplitude, pulse width) at a common stimulation frequency (e.g. 125 Hz on each contact). This might allow for <italic>(i) </italic>optimization of the stimulation settings by minimizing side effects from current spreading to the vicinity of the STN (especially if stimulation on a second monopolar contact is necessary to achieve sufficient therapeutic effects without inducing side effects), and <italic>(ii) </italic>improved therapeutic efficacy by delivering the stimulation pulses more selectively on different and distant contacts, although both issues remain to be demonstrated in clinical studies.</p><p>In our center for deep brain stimulation electrodes in STN-DBS surgery are generally placed with the uppermost contact of the quadripolar electrode located in the rostral border zone of zona incerta and STN and the lowermost contact in the caudal border zone of STN and SNr. This neuroanatomic assumption is substantiated by several common intra- and postoperative findings: <italic>(i) </italic>efficacy of a proximal contact on segmental symptoms like rigidity or tremor and a facultative induction of dyskinesias on the respective contact (upon increasing energy delivery) indicates its localisation in the dorsolateral STN motor area; <italic>(ii) </italic>intraoperative single cell recordings often identify bursting STN activity followed by regular tonic discharge when the descending microelectrode is leaving STN and entering SNr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The novel paradigm using <italic>"interleaved pulses" </italic>therefore enables simultaneous stimulation with specific parameters of both STN area and the caudal STN/SNr border zone.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>We hypothesize that simultaneous stimulation on contacts located in both STN and caudal STN/SNr border zone [STN+SNr-DBS] improves gait disturbances compared to conventional STN-DBS delivered on a single contact located in the STN area [STNmono].</p><p>&#x027a2; To test the hypothesis that [STN+SNr-DBS] is more effective on hypokinetic gait disturbances compared to [STNmono] in a randomised double-blind cross-over three week follow-up.</p><p>&#x027a2; To evaluate the <underline>short term effects </underline>of the conditions [StimOff], [STNmono] and [STN+SNr] on hypokinetic gait disturbances.</p><p>&#x027a2; To assess the impact of combined [STN+SNr-DBS] on further specific gait and balance features including freezing of gait in particular, as well as further non-motor features of Parkinson's disease in terms of quality of life, non-motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary endpoints.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design and Methods</title><p>This double-blind randomised cross-over clinical trial consists of two arms.

The 'axial score' is built by 8 items from the UPDRS II and III, all 5-point rated. For the statistical evaluation the five rating points are represented by the numbers 0 to 4, which represent increasing levels of pathology. The 'axial score' will be scored by the sum of the ratings across the 8 items (range 0 to 32). As change in UPDRS scores is a common primary efficacy outcome measure in Parkinson's disease and only items of the original UPDRS are required for the definition of the primary endpoint the statistical evaluation methods should be based on the psychometric validation of the UPDRS and no own validation studies are necessary.</p><p>The primary endpoint for the statistical evaluation will be the change in 'axial score' from baseline to visit 2 (after 6 weeks). For every patient we will determine two change-scores for the two phases in the Cross-Over. By means of a paired t-test the null hypothesis of equality of the two therapies concerning the change in 'axial score' will be tested. The decision for maintaining or rejecting the null hypothesis will be made applying a two-sided test with &#x003b1; = 0.05. The observed effects will be described by use of means and effect sizes including the appropriate 95%-confidence intervals. The confirmatory statistical evaluation of the efficacy of the [STN+SNr-DBS] in this trial will be restricted to the primary endpoint. Only the rejection of the null hypothesis will be interpreted as statistical evidence for the efficacy of [STN+SNr-DBS].</p><p>As no comparable study is available at the moment, we defined an improvement of 4 points on the primary outcome measure 'axial score' to be clinically relevant on hypokinetic gait disturbances and assumed a standard deviation of 4.0 (effect size: 1.0). A sample size of 10 will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 4.0 (e.g. first condition mean: 16.0 and a second condition mean of 12.0), using a paired t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level (sample size estimated using NQuery Advisor 7.0). To adjust for a maximum of two dropouts a total of n = 12 patients will be included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Endpoints</title><p>As all secondary endpoints are based on validated scores, we assume that parametric statistical methods can be used for the analysis. The secondary endpoints will be compared and statistically assessed for descriptive purposes and not in a confirmatory sense. The aim is explorative data analysis, not hypothesis testing or generation of evidence for efficacy. Because of the explorative character of this part of the analysis, no a priori statistical analysis plan exists. If adequate, changes of scores over time will be analysed with paired t-tests or appropriate statistical methods (eg. Repeated Measurements Anova). If a categorization of scores should be adequate (eg. classification in success vs. failure according to score-cut-offs) we will use adequate analysis methods for categorical variables (eg. McNemar Test). In addition, appropriate statistical methods of explorative data analysis including graphical methods and descriptive statistics will be used. No interim analysis and no subgroup analysis are planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Handling of Missing Data</title><p>All variables included in the CRF are mandatory. The monitoring will assure quality of the assessments. Thus, missing values are to be expected (eg. refusal of patients). Patients with missing values for the primary endpoint will be included with the last observed score before the planned time point (last-observation-carried-forward). All randomised patients will be included (Intention-to-treat).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>A randomisation list was prepared by the Department of Medical Biometry of the University Hospital of T&#x000fc;bingen.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Optimization of subthalamic stimulation is mandatory prior to study enrolment. Based on the current knowledge for optimized DBS programming <italic>(i) </italic>gait disturbances emerge and progress in the first years after introduction of subthalamic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>(ii) a </italic>further increase of the stimulation amplitudes may even aggravate the gait disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and <italic>(iii) </italic>the stimulation intensity of the lower extremity with longer step length should be reduced compared to the worse affected side - this was previously demonstrated to ameliorate gait symmetry with benefitial effects to gait disturbances, presumably freezing of gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These actions will be taken before considering combined [STN+SNr] stimulation, however, even if applied a substantial proportion of patients continues to exhibit refractory gait disturbances.</p><p>After written informed consent and screening for inclusion criteria, patients will be examined in the baseline condition <italic>&#x0201a;off dopaminergic medications' </italic>in order to assure optimization of the best individual stimulation parameters of the conventional STN stimulation [STNmono] and to determine the short-term effects of either stimulation setting. The [STN+SNr] condition will consist of the [STNmono] parameters and additional simultaneous stimulation with <italic>interleaveing pulses </italic>on a distal contact with best individual amplitude, 60 &#x003bc;s pulse width, and 125 Hz frequency will be introduced depending on individual thresholds for side effects from current spreading. In the baseline examination a randomised clinical evaluation of the treatment conditions [StimOff], [STNmono], and [STN+SNr] in terms of short term effects will be performed.</p><p>After the baseline examination, patients will be randomised to either [STNmono] or [STN+SNr] treatment and scheduled at three weeks of constant stimulation (Visit 1). After this first endpoint assessment treatment will be crossed-over and patients will be re-scheduled after further three weeks of constant stimulation for the second endpoint assessment (Visit 2). The follow-up period is - due to the current clinical evidence - sufficiently long to control adequately for carry-over effects since the endpoint assessment in the follow-up period will be scheduled only after three weeks of constant stimulation on either setting. STN-DBS in PD generally evokes clinical effects within short time intervals ranging from several seconds to few hours and presents completely reversible in the same time range. In the first patient described with improvement from [STN+SNr] compared to [STNmono], the clinical superiority of [STN+SNr] was demonstrated after 30 minutes of constant stimulation on either setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and monopolar stimulation on STN or SNr contacts revealed discriminable clinical effects on segmental and axial symptoms if both settings were applied randomly within one day in an independent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Dopaminergic medication will be held constant during the whole six week cross-over period and should be stable for at least 4 weeks before study enrolment.</p><p>Importantly, we did not consider stimulation on a single monopolar contact in the SNr area in our study design as this failed to improve segmental symptoms previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and therefore is not applicable for adequate management of Parkinsonian motor symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The endpoint assessor remains masked to the treatment until the final data analysis. In order to limit potential patients' knowledge on the stimulation parameters, stimulation parameters will be strictly kept subthreshold for side-effects. The parameters will be changed several times between [STNmono] and [STN+SNr] before the parameters of interest are maintained. Patients and endpoint assessor will be blinded to both short-term testings and follow-up visits, so that a possible clinical improvement of gait on either setting will remain unattributable for both patient and endpoint assessor.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics, Consent, Study Organization and Registration</title><p>The trial will be conducted in agreement with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

Based on the effect size and standard deviation of the Intention-to-treat analysis a larger clinical efficacy study will be designed.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DBS: deep brain stimulation; PD: Parkinson's disease; STN: subthalamic nucleus; SNr: substantia nigra pars reticulate; [STNmono]: conventional stimulation on subthalamic electrode contacts; [STN+SNr]: combined stimulation on electrode contacts located in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata with interleaved pulses.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study is funded by Medtronic GmbH (Medtronic, Meerbusch, Germany).</p><p>Daniel Weiss receives a research grant from the University of T&#x000fc;bingen [AKF 259-0-0] and a research grant from Medtronic.
