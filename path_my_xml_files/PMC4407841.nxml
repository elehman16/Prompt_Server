Non-dystrophic myotonia (NDM) is a group of inherited, rare muscle diseases characterized by muscle stiffness. The reimbursement of mexiletine, the expert opinion drug for NDM, has been discontinued in some countries due to a lack of independent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It remains unclear however, which concessions can be accepted towards the level 1 evidence needed for coverage decisions, in rare diseases. Considering the large number of rare diseases with a lack of treatment evidence, more experience with innovative trial designs is needed. Both NDM and mexiletine are well suited for an N-of-1 trial design. A Bayesian approach allows for the combination of N-of-1 trials, which enables the assessment of outcomes on the patient and group level simultaneously.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will combine 30 individual, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled N-of-1 trials of mexiletine (600 mg daily) vs. placebo in genetically confirmed NDM patients using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Our results will be compared and combined with the main results of an international cross-over RCT (mexiletine vs. placebo in NDM) published in 2012 that will be used as an informative prior. Similar criteria of eligibility, treatment regimen, end-points and measurement instruments are employed as used in the international cross-over RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The treatment of patients with NDM with mexiletine offers a unique opportunity to compare outcomes and efficiency of novel N-of-1 trial-based designs and conventional approaches in producing evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients with rare diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02045667">NCT02045667</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Combined N-of-1 trials</kwd><kwd>Bayesian</kwd><kwd>Non-dystrophic myotonia</kwd><kwd>Mexiletine</kwd><kwd>Rare diseases</kwd><kwd>Skeletal muscle channelopathies</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Rare diseases constitute a heterogeneous group of over 6.000 disorders with a prevalence of &#x0003c;1 per 20.000. In Europe, 30 million patients (6 to 8% of the population) have a rare disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. International regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) accept that it is unreasonable to demand the standard level of evidence (level 1) of multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in building an evidence-base for treatment of rare diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The ability to conduct RCTs in rare diseases is hampered by low numbers of patients and large clinical heterogeneity. Relying simply on case reports or case series incurs a considerable risk of selection and ascertainment bias. Currently, it is unclear which concessions can be accepted towards the level 1 evidence needed for coverage decisions in case of rare diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The case of mexiletine treatment in Non-dystrophic myotonia (NDM)</title><p>NDM is a heterogeneous group of monogenetic rare diseases caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle chloride (<italic>CLCN1</italic>) or the sodium ion channel (<italic>SCN4A</italic>) genes. The key symptom is myotonia, a delayed relaxation after voluntary contraction resulting in muscle stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Apart from muscle stiffness, NDM patients also experience functionally limiting complaints of pain, fatigue and weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>For years, mexiletine (a sodium channel blocker) was considered the drug of choice for NDMs based on clinical experience. The immediate occasion for our study was the decision by the National Health Insurance Board of The Netherlands (and of some other countries), in 2006, to discontinue reimbursement of mexiletine as rational pharmacotherapy for patients with NDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This decision was based on a Cochrane review that reported the absence of two independent level-1 evidence studies showing an effect of mexiletine for NDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, because of the lack of precise prevalence numbers of NDM in The Netherlands, the rarity of the disease was taken into question. As a result, many of these patients had to discontinue their mexiletine treatment that seemed clinically effective.</p><p>In 2012, the Consortium of Clinical Investigation of Neurological Channelopathies (CINCH) performed an international multicenter cross-over RCT that showed the clinical effectiveness of mexiletine as treatment for patients with NDM over 4 weeks of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although a prospective RCT is the gold standard, the effort involved in conducting such a trial (as well as time, funding and international cooperation) was substantial, and it will not always be feasible for rare diseases. New innovative trial designs may be used to ameliorate problems with small patient numbers and large clinical heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Combined N-of-1 trials using a Bayesian approach</title><p>In an N-of-1 trial, multiple pairs of active treatment and placebo are offered to an individual patient in a randomized, double-blind fashion, while regularly measuring key endpoints, until efficacy is established or disproved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Due to their design, in which each treatment-pair should be exchangeable in time, N-of-1 trials are especially suitable for the investigation of treatments in chronic, symptomatic conditions, where period effects (i.e. changes in disease state) and carry over effects (i.e. lingering drug effect) are small. This is the case for a number of neurological, reumatological, psychiatric and pulmonary disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. N-of-1 trials are hardly applicable to surgical, quickly progressive or acute medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The method has been originally developed to identify the best treatment option for an individual patient in case of genuine doubt concerning treatment benefit by formalization of what a physician does on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Major advantages of N-of-1 trials from the point of view of the patient and the treating physician are: (1) an N-of-1 trial determines whether the treatment is actually of benefit in the individual patient as opposed to some percentage of a group of patients; (2) the N-of-1 trial avoids the possibly unethical &#x0201c;therapeutic misconception&#x0201d; of the RCT - where most subjects are convinced they are receiving effective treatment even though told there is a 50/50 chance they will receive placebo (and that the treatment may not be effective) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>More recently, data from multiple N-of-1 trials have been combined (or meta-analyzed) to produce estimates of treatment effect at a population level (i.e. combined N-of-1 trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For this purpose, Bayesian hierarchical models have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Bayesian models use a different approach, which does not rely on the hypothesis testing/confidence intervals paradigm of traditional (frequentist) statistical methods, but allows determination of the posterior probability of whether a treatment effect is beneficial. Additionally, Bayesian methods allow for the use of prior available information (e.g. previous trial results) within the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>The key hypothesis is that combining data from multiple N-of-1 trials using Bayesian statistics is a promising approach to produce evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments for patients with rare diseases.

Furthermore, there is relevant clinical prior information (data from the previously conducted RCT) that can be incorporated into Bayesian analysis together with our new trial data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>In this study a series of double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled N-of-1- trials is conducted. Each individual N-of-1 trial consists of one to four treatment sets, each comprising 11 weeks. A treatment set comprises two treatment periods: a four-week period of active treatment (mexiletine) and a four-week period of treatment with placebo, with a one-week wash-out in between treatment periods and two weeks for statistical analysis (individual interim analysis) at the end of each treatment set. Within each treatment set, the order in which mexiletine and placebo will be offered will be randomized (block-randomization). Total study duration will be between 11 and 44 weeks per patient, depending on the amount of treatment sets needed to produce convincing evidence of clinical effectiveness or ineffectiveness of mexiletine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Asymptomatic carriers are not represented in the registry.</p><p>Potentially eligible patients will be selected from the registry. We expect that a maximum of 40% may not be eligible to participate, because of cardiac conditions, kidney or hepatic failure or neurological diseases other than NDM. Out of the remaining patients, random stratified samples will be taken, of 15 patients with a chloride channelopathy (TMC or BMC) and 15 patients with a sodium channelopathy (PMC or SCM). During a screening visit information about the study will be given, and patients will be asked to provide written informed consent. Eligibility will be checked by taking medical history and by conducting venous blood test (blood urea nitrogen, serum chloride, carbon dioxide, creatinine, blood glucose, serum potassium, serum sodium), ECG, and urine pregnancy testing for females. Serum pregnancy testing can be performed if, in the opinion of the investigator, the urine pregnancy test is inconclusive.

To measure the extent of grip myotonia of resting forearm muscle, each participant will squeeze the grip handle with a maximum grip for three seconds then relax until the force returns to baseline.

This muscle was chosen based on our previous studies on NDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. According to established criteria of Streib et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] myotonic discharges will be defined and quantified during 10 insertions, each followed by 30 sec of visual and auditory identification of myotonic discharges. Myotonic discharges must be at least 500 milliseconds, with potential amplitudes ranging from 10 &#x003bc;V to 1 mV, waxing and waning in both amplitude and frequency. Grading of myotonic discharges: 0: No positive muscle activity or an occasional run of positive waves following needle movement (detection of myotonia in 0-2/10 insertions); 1+: Myotonia fulfilling the minimal requirements (detection of myotonic discharges in 3-5/10 insertions) 2+: myotonic discharges in more than one-half of needle insertions (detection of myotonic discharges in 6-9/10 insertions); 3+: myotonic discharges with each needle movement in all examined areas (detection of myotonic discharges in 10/10 insertions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The CSRI measures direct neuromuscular disease-related health care costs (including costs of visits to other health care providers: GPs, specialist care, physical therapy, psychological therapy, social worker contacts), professional home care and hospitalization, as well as non-health care costs such as costs for paid and unpaid help. Additional prescribed and over the counter medication will also be recorded. For unit cost prices, standard rates will be adopted from the national guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or real cost prices (e.g., for medication) will be obtained through the website of the Dutch Health Care Insurance Boards (Zorginstituut Nederland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicijnkosten.nl">http://www.medicijnkosten.nl</ext-link>). The price year will be 2014 and the currency Euros. Costs per patient will be calculated by multiplying resource volumes by unit costs. Costs and effects (in terms of QoL) will be combined to assess cost-effectiveness. If mexiletine appears to be more effective and more expensive &#x02013;or less effective and less expensive- than placebo, the cost-effectiveness will be expressed in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Nonparametric bootstrapping techniques will be used to produce confidence intervals around mean costs, mean effectiveness and (if necessary) the ICER.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>General structure of the study</title><p>Initial screening will be scheduled 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit.

No minimal clinically important difference (MCID) calculation for the IVR was available from the literature. We chose an MCID of 0.75 on the mean IVR-score as clinically relevant difference based on clinical expert opinion and a previously reported within subject standard deviation (SD) of 1.5 (with &#x000bd; SD as a distribution-based estimate for the MCID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The mean IVR score in the published RCT was 4.21 (95% confidence interval 3.40 - 5.20) on placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]).</p><p>The data of the combined N-of-1 trials will be analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Since no formula-based methodology exists for sample size or power calculations for such designs, we have performed a simulation-based sample size calculation.</p><p>The simulation-based sample size calculation consisted of the following steps: (1) Drawing a random realization from a prior distribution for the mean treatment effect, based on expert opinion. (2) For each of these realizations, we have simulated data for 30 N-of-1 trials using R software, where the data for each N-of-1 trial consisted of 2 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 2 observations (for 2 treatment arms, 10 observations per arm per treatment pair, and 2 completed treatment pairs). These simulations were performed using a model structure with a random intercept and a random slope for different individuals and a residual within-person error. (3) Each simulated data set of 30 N-of-1 trials was analyzed as described by Zucker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We have combined each of the simulated data sets with a normally distributed prior distribution with a mean of 1.75 and a standard deviation of 0.89, which was also based on expert opinion. (4) Each of these Bayesian analyses resulted in a marginal posterior distribution for the mean treatment effect &#x003b2;<sub>0</sub>. (5) For each of these posterior distributions we determined the posterior probability of a treatment effect of at least 0.75. We assumed that all participants will be subjected to two treatment pairs. Steps 1 - 5 were re-iterated 1000 times, resulting in 1000 posterior probabilities of a clinically meaningful treatment effect. From these 1000 probabilities we have determined the mean, which corresponds to an estimate of the expected posterior probability of a substantial treatment effect. The mean expected posterior probability of a clinically meaningful treatment effect was 0.82. Thus, under the specified assumptions, with the results of 30 patients with NDM completing the trial, we would be 82% certain that mexiletine produces a clinically meaningful treatment effect in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Prior elicitation, informative and non-informative priors</title><p>The strength of Bayesian analyses is that it provides an algorithm for updating the probability estimate of a particular claim being true (e.g., the claim that mexiletine produces, on average, an improvement of at least 0.75 on the IVR stiffness scale in patients with NDM, when compared to placebo) whenever novel relevant evidence becomes available. The information that was already available before the novel evidence became available is expressed as prior distributions (so called &#x0201c;priors&#x0201d;). For all model parameters a prior will be needed, however, since the mean treatment difference is the parameter of main interest, these priors will receive the most attention. In the main analysis an informative prior based on data on the treatment effect from the previous study (i.e. treatment effect in the RCT by Statland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) will be used. In a sensitivity analysis we will use a prior for the treatment effect based on expert opinion, in which case they are elicited from expert physicians: expert neuromuscular neurologists with experience in the pharmacological treatment of NDM patients. These neurologists will be asked to estimate the treatment effect based on patient demographic information, genetic information and video-clips of the baseline myotonia bedside tests. A histogram-based method (Spiegelhalter ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], p.145) will be used to elicit individual (i.e. from each neurologist) clinical priors, which will subsequently be aggregated to provide one group clinical prior. Another sensitivity-analysis will be performed with a non-informative prior for the group level mean treatment effect instead of the informative priors. For all other model parameters we will use non-informative (or &#x02018;flat&#x02019;) priors, since it is difficult to elicit parameters such as random effect variations from physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Individual interim analyses</title><p>After treatment sets 1, 2 and 3 of each N-of-1 trial we will investigate whether the existing evidence at that moment is sufficient to conclude that one of the two treatments is more effective for that particular individual. This will be done by a statistician who is blinded for treatment allocation and who will use Bayesian methods. The patient and the treating physician will be advised to discontinue the N-of-1 trial if the posterior probability of a treatment effect larger than 0.75 (clinically relevant mean difference) is at least 80% (discontinue trial participation and start regular treatment) or at most 20% (discontinue trial participation and do not start regular treatment). In all other cases they will be advised to continue the N-of-1 trial. Taking into account this advice, the physician and patient will discuss the effects of treatment, as observed by the physician and experienced by the patient, and together they will decide whether or not to continue the N-of-1 trial.</p><p>For our interim analysis we will use non-informative priors only, as we prefer to base our stopping advice on the patient data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Bayesian hierarchical analysis</title><p>This study aims to answer the following questions: What is the probability that mexiletine is clinically effective in patients with non-dystrophic myotonia (NDM) on the individual and group level? To combine the results of the multiple N-of-1 trials, a hierarchical (multi-level) Bayesian model will be used, with the IVR measure for stiffness as the dependent variable, and with the patient and the subgroup (chloride versus sodium channel mutation carriers) as the structural grouping factors (or the levels of the model). The patient will be treated as a random effect (both a random intercept and a random slope), while subgroup of patients and mutation type will be treated as fixed effects. The within person residual variance will similarly be assumed to be drawn from a common distribution. In the main analysis, the prior will be based on the RCT results from Statland et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses with a clinical prior and with a non-informative prior will also be performed. From the Bayesian analysis we will obtain posterior distributions for the mean treatment effect at the population level, as well as posterior distributions for the treatment effects at the individual level, that will exhibit borrowed strength from the population estimates through shrinkage to the population mean. For details of the procedure to be used, see Zucker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Also, we will investigate interactions between treatment effect and treatment set, and between treatment effect and treatment order. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Comparisons with the RCT and traditional analysis methods</title><p>In addition to synthesizing the data from our study with the existing RCT evidence, we will also contrast the outcomes of the two studies. To this end, a sensitivity analysis with a non-informative prior will be performed. This will provide a direct comparison of the outcomes of the two studies. In order to compare the novel methodology of combined N-of-1 trials with more traditional analysis methods, we will perform a (non-Bayesian) frequentist analysis of our data, where the same approach will be chosen as in the previous cross-over RCT by Statland et al.
