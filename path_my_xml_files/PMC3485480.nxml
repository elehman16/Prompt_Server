<italic>Background</italic>. Local periarticular injection with bupivacaine alone in TKA has not been studied. Thus, we aimed to examine the effectiveness of local periarticular injection with bupivacaine for post-operative pain control in TKA. <italic>Method</italic>. Sixty patients undergoing TKA by a single surgeon were randomly assigned into two groups in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In the injection group, patients received periarticular injections with 0.25% bupivacaine before wound closure; in the control group, patients received a 0.9% normal saline injection. Both groups received the same anesthetic procedure, post-operative pain control, and rehabilitation protocol. <italic>Results</italic>. There was a significant reduction in post-operative morphine consumption in the first six hours after the operation (mean 0.9&#x02009;mg and 2.43&#x02009;mg, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01), but there was no significant difference in post-operative morphine consumption between six hours and ninety-six hours after the operation, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, morphine side effects during the first 96 hours, length of hospital stay, or complications from morphine consumption. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Local periarticular injection with bupivacaine alone before wound closer was shown to be an effective method to improve pain control after TKA with a few complications and ease of use.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Total knee arthroplasty is a procedure that can improve quality of life, and it is performed in increasing numbers every year because of the increase in the elderly population due to improved medical technology [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the problem is that patients avoid this operation because of post-operative pain, which affects patient satisfaction and delays recovery and rehabilitation [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p> There are many modalities to improve operative pain control, such as femoral nerve blocks [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], epidural anesthesia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and periarticular injections [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These modalities have been shown to reduce post-operative pain and increase patient satisfaction. </p><p> Periarticular injection was reported to have good efficacy in controlling pain, cost effectiveness, a few side effects, and ease of use [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This method can be used by every surgeon without further training, unlike techniques like epidural anesthesia or femoral nerve blocks, which require experience and further training.</p><p> Many studies about periarticular injection have reported good results from various medications and combinations, such as ropivacaine, ketorolac, and epinephrine [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; bupivacaine, morphine sulfate, epinephrine, methyprednisolone acetate, cefuroxime, and normal saline [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; ropivacaine, ketorolac, epimorphine, and epinephrine [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All of these combinations were reported with good efficacy to control pain with a few complications. However, there have not been studies that show which of the medications in these combinations has the most important role in improving post-operative pain control. </p><p>The efficacy of local injection with bupivacaine alone was reported with good results in lumbar discectomy and lumbar laminectomy. It was found to prolong the post-operative narcotic-free duration and to decrease the amount of post-operative parenteral analgesia [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our hospital protocol for total knee replacement also uses periarticular injection with Bupivacaine alone.</p><p> The primary aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of periarticular injection with bupivacaine for reducing patient reported post-operative pain as assessed by morphine consumption via PCA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p> Sixty primary osteoarthritis patients undergoing total knee replacement at Siriraj Hospital were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were patient age between fifty to eighty years, BMI between twenty-five to thirty-five, and having a full understanding of the question in this trial. Exclusion criteria were patients with a history of allergy to the medication used in this trial, a renal problem (blood creatinine more than 1.5&#x02009;mg/dL or creatinine clearance less than 60), abnormal liver function, previous surgery on the knee undergoing total knee replacement, and those who could not receive spinal anesthesia. All included patients signed an informed consent form, and the methods of this trial were approved by the ethics committee (Siriraj Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.) The procedures in this study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Protocol</title><p> This was a parallel, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 3&#x02009;mL of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine and morphine (0.3&#x02009;mg) by an experienced anesthetist. Cefazolin (1&#x02009;g) was used for prophylaxis against surgical infection thirty minutes prior to starting the operation. Clindamycin (600&#x02009;mg) was used in patients with a penicillin or cephalosporin allergy history. Ondansetron (8&#x02009;mg) was injected at the start of the operation, and an additional 8&#x02009;mg was given 12 hours later. Patients who were anxious during the operation received midazolam (1-2&#x02009;mg) or propofol (50&#x02013;100&#x02009;mg/hr).</p><p> All of the operations were performed by a single surgeon. A tourniquet was used with 350&#x02009;mmHg of pressure while performing the surgery from the start of incision until the operation was finished. A standard minimedial parapatellar approach was used, and a redivac drain was placed in all patients. A posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis (Zimmer Nexgen Legacy: LPS-flex) with a cementing technique was used in every operation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Randomization and Blinding</title><p> Patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups (simple randomization by sealed envelope) in the operating room before the initial incision by a study coordinator who prepared the medication for periarticular injection and was not involved in the operation or patient care. The physicians, patients, and nurses who collected postoperative patients data were blinded to treatment group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Interventions</title><p> The first group was patients receiving a periarticular injection with 20&#x02009;mL of 0.25% bupivacaine before wound closure. The second group was patients receiving a periarticular injection with 20&#x02009;mL of 0.9% normal saline before wound closure. Periarticular injection was performed with a 21-gauge catheterfrom inside wound at the extensor mechanism (3&#x02009;mL), capsule (5&#x02009;mL), pes anserinus (1&#x02009;mL), iliotibial band (1&#x02009;mL), collateral ligament (2&#x02009;mL), and subcutaneous tissue (8&#x02009;mL). </p><p> For post-operative pain control, patients received an intramuscular injection of diclofenac (50&#x02009;mg) after the operation. Patients also took acetaminophen (1&#x02009;g) every 6 hours and meloxicam (7.5&#x02009;mg) every 12 hours. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used in all patients for 96 hours postoperatively. </p><p>The PCA administration was morphine 1&#x02009;mg IV bolused with 15-minute lock-out interval.</p><p> The day after the operation, the urine catheter was removed, and range of motion and isometric exercises were started. Patients were encouraged to ambulate with a walker as tolerated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Outcomes</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures</title><p> The primary outcome of this study is post-operative morphine consumption via PCA that was used to evaluate post-operative pain control, visual analog scale scores were record at rest in paper by trained nurses every 3 hours in 0&#x02013;24 hours after operation then every 6 hours until 96 hours after operation.</p><p>The VAS consists of a 10&#x02009;cm line where 0 indicates no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Complications from morphine consumption such as nausea, pruritis, urinary retention, and constipation were also recorded. Wound was inspected for any complication at two weeks postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><title>3.2.1.

Participant Flow</title><p> Patients were consecutive recruited between March 2010 and August 2010. Seventy-four patients were assess for eligibility. Of these, six did not meet the inclusion criteria, four met the exclusion criteria, and four refused to participate. Sixty patients were included in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>Thirty patients received a periarticular injection with 0.25% bupavacaine, and the other thirty patients were assigned to a control group that received an injection of 0.9% normal saline. Both groups of patients had similar baseline characteristics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1</xref> shows the demographic data of the patients in both groups.

No wound complications were found in either group of patients at two-week post operative follow up. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Discussion</title><p> A multimodal technique was developed to improve post-operative pain control after total knee arthroplasty. Femoral nerve blocks [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and epidural anesthesia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have been reported to control pain with good efficacy. However, these procedures require a well-trained physician, and there are some complications that could result from these procedures. Sharma et al. reported the rate of femoral neuropathy/neuritis after femoral nerve block has been estimated to be approximately 0.59% [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p><p> The intraoperative periarticular injection technique for reduction of post-operative pain control following total knee arthroplasty has been reported and has demonstrated good results. </p><p>Vendittoli et al. reported that perioperative periarticular infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, adrenaline, and injection with ropivacaine (150&#x02009;mg) on the first after the operative day showed a reduction in narcotic requirements at 48 hours after the operation with minimal side effects to patients when compared to the control group [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Parvataneni et al. studied the efficacy of local intraoperative injection with a combination of 0.5% bupivacaine, morphine sulfate, epinephrine, methylprednisolone acetate, cefuroxime, and normal saline in total hip and total knee replacement patients. This study demonstrated a reduction in the pain score at 72 hours after the operation, a decreased hospital stay, and increased satisfaction scores when compared with the control group [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Busch et al. reported a decreased consumption of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) at 12 hours after the operation and a lower pain score in total knee replacement patients who received a perioperative, periarticular injection with ropivacaine, ketorolac, epimorphine, normal saline, and epinephrine compared with patients who did not receive an injection [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we collected data from 0&#x02013;96 hours that was the time when the patients had PCA. Data from our study are in agreement with previous reports on the efficacy of periarticular injection. However, our study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of bupivacaine alone in reducing post-operative pain when used for perioperative, periarticular injection. Our study demonstrated that bupivacaine injection alone, without other drugs, significantly reduced morphine consumption at 6 hours after the operation. However, visual analog scale scores for pain were not different between the control and bupivacaine-injection groups. This may be because morphine that the control group patients received which was more than the other groups via PCA obscured VAS scores. So, the result confirmed that the patients used PCA machine properly when they started to feel pain. Other reason that this study lacks having an effect on the VAS scores may be the issue of dosing that the previous study used higher dose of anesthetic agent than our study.</p><p>We did not observe complications from a periarticular bupivacaine injection in our study, which is consistent with previous periarticular injection studies. Thus, our study adds to evidence that periarticular injections are safe when used in knee replacement procedures, in which post-operative infection and wound complications are the most prominent complications.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, intraoperative periarticular injection with 0.25% bupivacaine alone is effective in reducing post-operative morphine consumption with few complications. Furthermore, this treatment is as easy to use as periarticular injections with cocktail formulas demonstrated in previous studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</p></ack><ack><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>V.
