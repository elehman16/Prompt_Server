Pessary fitting has long been considered an art rather than a science, a process of trial and error whereby the clinician's training and experience best predict success. The subjective nature of pessary fitting comes from little or no formal clinical training. Furthermore, there is no consensus on clinical indications for various types of pessaries, patient characteristics for sizing, or appropriate pessary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Manufacturer product information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and texts give general guidelines for pessary fitting; however, these recommendations are not supported by research.</p><p>No studies to date have consistently linked specific patient characteristics to pessary size. A scientific prediction of successful incontinence pessary fitting based on a quantifiable prolapse exam could remove our biases of who will or will not be successful, decrease patient and clinician time needed for fitting, and serve as a useful tool in counseling patients regarding treatment options. Predicting size may give clinicians the ability to maintain a smaller selection of pessary sizes or types in the office, which could reduce office costs.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine, in a group of women without advanced pelvic organ prolapse and with or without a uterus, (1) whether successful incontinence pessary fitting can be predicted by specific pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POPQ) measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and (2) whether POPQ measures predict pessary size. We hypothesized that total vaginal length (TVL) correlates with pessary diameter during successful pessary fitting. We also hypothesized that previous hysterectomy (by any route) and a large genital hiatus impair the ability to retain a pessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This analysis was based on a subset of subjects enrolled in the Ambulatory Treatments for Leaking Associated with Stress (ATLAS) trial, a randomized multicenter study of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. Women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and POPQ stage &#x02264;2 were randomized to one of three treatment arms: (1) incontinence pessary; (2) behavioral therapy, including pelvic floor muscle training and exercise and bladder control strategies; or (3) a combination of the two treatments. IRB approval was obtained for all participating sites, and all eligible subjects provided informed consent before beginning the study. Full details on the study design and methodology have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Seven hundred forty-one subjects enrolled in ATLAS during the period May 2005 to November 2007. Four hundred forty-five subjects were randomized. This analysis includes the 266 women assigned to receive an incontinence pessary (treatment arms 1 and 3). At the time of study enrollment, a POPQ exam was performed as described by Bump et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] by a physician or study nurse who regularly performs these exams. Genital hiatus (GH) was measured at rest and with Valsalva during the POPQ exam; as the measures were not markedly different, for the purpose of this study, we used the GH with Valsalva measures.</p><p>Pessary fittings were performed by an interventionist in the study who also performed the behavioral therapy in the study. This interventionist was a trained nurse practitioner, nurse, or physical therapist who did not perform the POPQ assessment and was not aware of the POPQ result. The type of incontinence pessary (ring or dish&#x02014;see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) used for each subject was left to the discretion of the interventionist. The size and type of the final fitted pessary were recorded at all visits. Proper size and adequate fitting was considered when the provider could place a finger between the pessary and the vaginal walls and after fitting the subject could stand, cough, and strain with the pessary retained. Multiple pessaries could be fitted at one visit to determine the correct size for subject use. A pessary fitting was considered unsuccessful if the interventionist failed to obtain an adequate fit after at least three attempts, the participant found the pessary painful, or the participant did not plan to use the pessary after fitting.

We obtained the corresponding outer diameter of this ring or dish from data provided by the Milex website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.milexproducts.com">http://www.milexproducts.com</ext-link>. Incontinence rings are typically sized in small integers ranging from size no. 0 (1.75&#x000a0;in./44&#x000a0;mm diameter) to size no. 10 (4.25&#x000a0;in./108&#x000a0;mm diameter) with 0.25&#x000a0;in. (6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;mm) diameter differences between integer sizes. Incontinence dishes are not measured as integer sizes, but instead are described by their diameter; they start at a 55-mm-diameter size and increase in 5&#x000a0;mm intervals larger, up to a maximum size of 85&#x000a0;mm diameter. Seven millimeters was added to each corresponding ring diameter to account for the increased outside diameter produced by the knob on the incontinence ring or dish.</p><p>Comparisons of characteristics between subjects with successful and unsuccessful pessary fittings were tested using two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact tests for discrete outcomes. Linear regression was used to explore the relationship between POPQ measures and final pessary diameter in women with and without a cervix (hysterectomy group). Both linear and quadratic models were investigated. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study sample includes 266 women in the ATLAS study who were randomized to one of the pessary treatment arms. Data on key variables were complete, ranging from &#x0003e;99% (265 of 266 for hysterectomy status) to 92% (245 of 266 for final pessary size). The descriptive characteristics of the study population are found in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age of women in this study was 49&#x000a0;years (range, 19 to 81&#x000a0;years), with a mean body mass index of 29&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 18.0 to 58.6). The majority of study participants were parous (94%). Fifty-nine (22%) had a prior total hysterectomy (no cervix and therefore no point D on POPQ exam). Relatively few women had surgeries for urinary incontinence (5%) or prolapse (3%).

Fifty-four percent were fit during the first visit, 36% needed a second pessary fitting visit, and 10% required a third and final visit.

Women with a longer total vaginal length were more likely to be successfully fitted but various formulas involving total vaginal length did not predict pessary size. In fact, no vaginal measurement per POPQ evaluation proved helpful in determining pessary size. Approximately two thirds of our subjects could be fitted with a no. 2, no. 3, or no. 4 incontinence ring or a 65-, 70-, or 75-mm incontinence dish.

However, when utilizing POPQ measures of the GH, there was no difference in the proportion of women that were successfully fit whether the GH measured &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;cm or &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;cm (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0).</p><p>There is no uniform definition for successful pessary fitting. We considered fitting to be unsuccessful if the provider could not obtain an adequate fit after at least three attempts, if the woman found the pessary painful, or if she did not plan to use the pessary after fitting. Others have considered fitting successful when the pessary was comfortable and retained during Valsalva and voiding at the initial visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or when the fit was appropriate and the woman continued to use the pessary at the 3-week follow-up visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Whatever definition is utilized, in order to optimize pessary use in women that desire this means of treatment, early and consistent long-tem follow-up should be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>While previous hysterectomy was identified in one study as a risk factor for unsuccessful fitting in women with prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we did not find this to be the case in our population of women without advanced prolapse. Women using pessaries to treat stress incontinence differ from women using them to treat pelvic organ prolapse. The population of women with stress incontinence is younger, is less likely to have had previous surgeries, and has a longer vaginal length and narrower genital hiatus than the population with prolapse. Accordingly, the success rate for fitting pessaries in women with SUI (92% in our study, 89% in another population of women with SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) is generally higher than that for women with advanced prolapse (41% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]).</p><p>A strength of this study was that as part of a randomized non-surgical treatment trial, all patients underwent a standardized baseline evaluation, including the POPQ evaluation. An exhaustive effort was made to successfully fit and follow-up with these patients; therefore, there was minimal loss to follow-up early in the process, which is important in carefully characterizing those subjects that were fitting failures. The major limitation of this study is that the results and conclusions of our study are limited to women with SUI and no significant prolapse; a group of women with more prolapse or a wider range of POPQ values may have different results. Another limitation of this study was the lack of utilization of other patient characteristics in order to characterize those that were fitting successes or failures. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether successful pessary fitting could be predicted by specific POPQ measures and whether these measures could also predict pessary size. As this was not the case, clearly the performance of a POPQ examination prior to pessary fitting in women with stress predominant urinary incontinence without advanced prolapse is not necessary. The vaginal measures of the POPQ exam include the sagittal axis of the vagina, but not the lateral or coronal dimensions of the vagina, and these later measures may be more important for fitting.</p><p>We conclude that incontinence pessary fitting remains an art rather than a science. Fortunately, however, it is an art that is easy to do: Most women were successfully fitted, and most did not need to try more than two pessary sizes to achieve the appropriate fit.</p><p>Given the lack of correlation with anatomic and baseline characteristics, these data suggest that incontinence pessary fitting can occur in a primary care setting by interested and experienced providers of all levels, including nurses, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and physicians.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold> None.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sultan</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The history and evolution of pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse</article-title><source>Int Urogynecol J</source><year>2006</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>170</fpage><lpage>175</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00192-005-1313-6</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Shah SM, Sultan AH, Thakar R (2006) The history and evolution of pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse.
