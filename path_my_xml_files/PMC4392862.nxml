Partners are often involved in the illness trajectory by providing informal care and emotional support, and they regularly have to take on responsibilities of their ill spouse and the household, in addition to their own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, there is growing recognition that cancer not only affects the lives of the patients, but also the lives of their loved ones. Recent studies have shown that partners and other family caregivers are at risk of experiencing mental and physical health complications. In a systematic review by Stenberg et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] 200 problems and burdens have been identified related to caregiving responsibilities among family caregivers. The most frequently reported problems were emotional (e.g. anxiety, depression and fear) and social problems (e.g. financial difficulties, role strain, isolation). Partners even suffered from diminished physical functioning and experienced complaints as pain, sleep problems and fatigue. Partners of cancer patients play an important role in patient recovery and illness management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of mental and physical health complaints not only has a paramount impact on the partner&#x02019;s quality of life, but it has also a negative impact on the informal care for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>To overcome these problems, supportive interventions are available for partners of cancer patients. A recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and two recent systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] identified a variety of psychosocial interventions for partners. However, most of these interventions were aimed at couples instead of the partner alone, and as a consequence the primary focus was often on the well-being of the patients. The needs of the partners have been overlooked and only a few interventions target the partners&#x02019; self-care as primary aim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another shortcoming of the existing interventions is that partners of cancer patients seem to make no or only limited use of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This might be a result of poor diffusion strategies or it might indicate that the interventions do not meet the needs and wishes of the target group. Finally, the interventions are often not theory-based and lack thorough evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, Ussher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] recommend high quality designs for future studies and better theoretical underpinning of the interventions to gain insight in the processes that might be relevant for partners of cancer patients.</p><p>The internet can be of added value in this respect, because it offers opportunities to deliver easy accessible and (cost-)effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Advantages of web-based interventions for example are a low threshold and flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Participants do not have to make an appointment with a healthcare professional and they can use the web-based intervention at any moment or any location that suits them (24&#x000a0;hours a day, seven days in a week). This flexibility can be of great importance for partners of cancer patients, since they are often very occupied with caring tasks, and as a result have less time for their own health and personal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yet, despite these advantages, the web-based interventions for this population are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>To overcome the above mentioned problems with existing interventions and to make use of the advantages the internet offers, we developed an online delivered, theory-based self-help intervention called <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> to support partners of cancer patients. To make sure that the intervention fits to the needs and wishes of the end users, partners of cancer patients were actively and repeatedly involved during the developmental process. This paper presents the development of the <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> intervention and the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the (cost-)effectiveness of this intervention.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p><italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT is a form of contextual behavior therapy that focuses on changing a client&#x02019;s relationship with their thoughts instead of changing the content of their thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clients learn that avoidance, suppression or the attempt to control difficult thoughts can be counterproductive. They also learn to focus on behaviors and actions that are in line with their individual values &#x02013; the things they care about most. ACT targets to increase psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is defined as &#x0201c;the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The efficacy of ACT in reducing psychological distress is supported by a growing body of literature (e.g. Hayes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], including studies among cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ACT may be useful in partners of cancer patients, because it can help them to deal with the negative emotions caused by cancer (e.g. uncertainty, anxiety, sadness, anger) instead of avoiding these. Avoidance has been identified as one important factor resulting in psychological distress in cancer patients and their partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. ACT may also help partners to cope with dysfunctional thoughts such as &#x0201c;what if the cancer comes back?&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;what if my partner dies?&#x0201d;. People are often excessively entangled with their thoughts and they need to learn to defuse from them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This process of so called <italic>cognitive defusion</italic> or <italic>meta- cognitive awareness</italic> has already been proven to be effective in people with general anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and recurrent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Finally, ACT may help partners of cancer patients to focus on what is really important to them (or in their relationship) and encourage them to act upon these values as much as possible, despite any barriers. This might especially be useful, as existing values, patterns and roles may have been seriously threatened or challenged by the cancer (e.g. Northouse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; Applebaum and Breitbart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Developmental process</title><p>To ensure that the intervention actually suits the partners&#x02019; needs and wishes, we used the method of co-creation, meaning that partners of cancer patients were actively involved during the developmental process and that their input was used to shape the content and the design of the intervention (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). First, we started with a needs assessment, consisting of an interview- and survey study. We interviewed 16 partners of cancer patients and asked them about their needs and wishes regarding the content and design of a web-based intervention and about the preconditions it should meet. During the interviews we also asked partners how their partner&#x02019;s disease had affected them personally and what has been helpful to them to cope with the situation. We were interested in this information, because we wanted to gather examples of possible problems and solutions to write appealing and recognizable texts and exercises. To validate the results of our interview study, we also conducted a survey-study among 168 partners of cancer patients (results of both studies will be published elsewhere). The most important outcomes of both needs assessment studies were: (1) partners seem to be interested in a web-based intervention; (2) partners could spend about 1&#x000a0;hours a week on an intervention; (3) most prefer that at least some parts of an intervention are addressed to the partner alone; (4) the intervention should contain information and some form of peer support; (5) themes that should be addressed include coping with emotions, communication, sexuality, asking for help and moving on with life after cancer treatment; (6) partners differ in their preferences about the need for having contact with a personal counselor; (7) the intervention should be framed as informal, easy accessible support with a &#x0201c;positive approach&#x0201d; and (8) partners felt that flexibility is one of the most important features.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

At the end of this phase we had developed a first booklet version of the intervention <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic>. Next, we asked three potential users and one expert to evaluate the content. The participants were generally positive about the texts and exercises. They recognized the situations and examples given in the texts and they evaluated the exercises as useful. Yet, the participants also had some recommendations. For example, they suggested to provide more information on topics like sexuality and intimacy, financial and insurance issues and communication issues (e.g. how to communicate with younger children about the disease of their parent).</p><p>Based on their feedback, text materials were adjusted and the web-based application was developed. In a usability test, three partners of cancer patients and five immediate family members were observed while walking through the personal homepage of the intervention and the first module of the intervention. After using the intervention, they were asked to evaluate the web-based application. They found that the application was both useful and useable. Furthermore, they liked the conveniently arranged design, the use of fresh colors and the consequent structure of the different modules. The participants also made some suggestions to improve the web application. For example they said that some instructions of the exercises were unclear or confusing, they were not satisfied with the use of the colors of the &#x0201c;help&#x0201d;- and &#x0201c;home&#x0201d;-button and they disliked the image we had chosen as the header of the application. The participants&#x02019; feedback was used to improve the usability of the web-based application (for example a new header was implemented and the color of help-button changed from grey to red). At last, we will study the (cost-)effectiveness of the web-based intervention <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> in a randomized controlled trial, that is described in this study protocol. Before we move on to the study questions, a short description of the intervention is provided below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Description of the intervention: &#x02018;Hold on, for each other&#x02019;</title><p><italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> consists of six modules, which can be worked through in six weeks. In case participants need more time, they have the opportunity to work through the total intervention in maximal 12&#x000a0;weeks. In each module one particular theme is discussed. The first module focuses on the emotional consequences of being a partner of a cancer patient. Participants learn how to recognize, allow and express their emotions. In module 2, participants learn how to manage a period of chronic stress and module 3 focuses on worrying and negative thoughts. Module 4 and 5 are focused on values in life and in the relationship and the commitment to those values. Furthermore, the importance of beloved moments in a relationship are addressed. Module 6 is about the importance of communication. There are also two optional modules (participants can decide which is most relevant to them): one module concentrates on how to move on with life after successful cancer treatment; the other focuses on the terminal phase. If partners decide to do an optional module, they will receive two more extra weeks.</p><p>All modules start with a short text that matches the theme of each module (as described above). The texts are enriched with short psychological exercises. Both (texts and exercises) are based on ACT (a detailed overview of the components can be found in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Next to the ACT-exercises, in each module a meditation exercise (audio- and text-file) based on mindfulness and self-compassion is included. Mindfulness and self-compassion are congruent with ACT, and they can offer interesting insights to partners of cancer patients. Mindfulness can help partners of cancer patients to attend to the present moment in a receptive manner which will, over time, reduce the identification with self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poorer mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Besides, mindfulness can help partners of cancer patients to be aware of their painful feelings in a clear and balanced way. This means that they neither ignore nor exaggerate negative experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Self-compassion is necessary to recharge batteries and emotional energy needed to care for others. Constantly criticizing oneself, especially for the feeling that one is never doing enough, will eventually lead to stress and symptoms of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

In order to optimally support the partners of cancer patients with completing the web-based intervention, three persuasive elements according to Kelders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] were incorporated in the design of <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic>. First of all, the intervention contains a text message service. Participants can choose to receive text messages with short inspiring texts. Second, tunnelling is used in order to guide the participants through the intervention. And third, two types of social support are incorporated in the intervention: peer- to peer support and professional support. To facilitate peer&#x02013;to-peer contact, participants have the possibility (1) to share their answers on some exercises with other participants (and to read those of others), (2) to add tips and advices and to read tips of others, and (3) to get in contact with other participants in a private e-mail conversation. If participants want to share their answers, or to contact other participants, they have to create a short profile first. This profile consists of: a (nick)name, sex, age, children and form of cancer the ill partner is diagnosed with. This profile provides partners with the opportunity to look for peers who are similar to them.</p><p>As mentioned before, the intervention also contains professional support. We want to investigate two different kinds of professional support: personal support (feedback on a weekly basis provided by a counsellor) versus automated support (feedback immediately after completing an exercise). Participants in the &#x0201c;personal support&#x0201d; condition receive weekly feedback from a counsellor through e-mail contact. After the completion of a module, a counsellor sends an e-mail to the participant (at an appointed day of the week) with a reflexion on the progress of the participant and a reaction to possible problems and questions. Participants have the same counsellor during the whole intervention period. Counselling is performed by trained master students Psychology of the University of Twente in the Netherlands who are under supervision of the researcher and a clinical psychologist. In sum, the role of the counsellor is the guidance and support of the process. Aim of the e-mail contact is predominantly to improve adherence of the intervention. In addition, participants developing serious problems during the enrolment in the intervention can be recognized and advised to find help. Participants in the &#x0201c;automated support&#x0201d; condition will receive short feedback messages directly after completing an exercise. The feedback is developed before the start of the intervention and the messages will appear in a pop-up window.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Present study</title><p>This present study has several aims. First, we want to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of the intervention <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic>. Our main hypothesis is that both versions of the intervention lead to a significant reduction of psychological distress compared to a waiting list control condition. In addition, we hypothesize that (positive) mental health, health related quality of life and general health of participants of the experimental conditions will increase and caregiver burden will decrease in comparison to the participants in the waiting list control condition. The second aim of our study is to examine if psychological flexibility, self-compassion, mastery, style of support behavior (overprotection, protective buffering, active engagement), posttraumatic growth and resilience are mediators of the intervention&#x02019;s effects on the partners&#x02019; mental health. Third, we aim to examine the moderating effects of the socio demographics (age, gender, education, working situation, family situation) and disease-related characteristics of the patients (sort of cancer, stage of disease, duration and treatment of cancer). Finally, we want to know to what extend participants are satisfied with the intervention, which parts of the intervention are mostly used, and how compliant the users are.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial with three parallel groups:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Experimental condition 1: Web-based intervention <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic>, with personal support.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experimental condition 2: Web-based intervention <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic>, with automated support.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Waiting list control condition: Participants will be on a waiting list for 3&#x000a0;months from entry/intake.

As we described earlier, the internet and recent technologies offer various possibilities (availability, easy accessible, flexibility) that can be of great value for this target group. Most importantly, partners can do the intervention at any convenient time. Daily exercises are short and can often be done while working, doing the household or giving care.</p><p>Another strength of the intervention is that it consists of a variety of components. Partners of cancer patients are offered a package of different features including information, psychological exercises, peer support, practical tips and text messages. Partners can choose freely which of the components they want to use, and in which way they want to use them. For example they can decide if they want to have contact with peers, and if so, they can choose if they want to actively write down their own experiences or if they merely want to read experience of other peers. Also, persuasive elements (such as text messages, tunneling and social support) are incorporated in the design of intervention in order to improve adherence to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>If proven effective, <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> may easily be implemented in the Dutch healthcare system. One part of our implementation plan is to inform the various stakeholders from the beginning of the project: partners and cancer patients via patient societies (e.g. NFK), the Dutch Cancer Society, health care professionals as physicians, nurses, psychologist, social workers and drop-in centers. We have already started informing the stakeholders in the context of recruitment of participants. If the intervention is found to be effective, we expect that hospitals and other organizations with a focus on psycho-oncology (such as drop-in centers, general practitioners, patient organizations) will be interested in referring partners of cancer patients to this easy accessible psychosocial care option. Health care is rapidly changing and incorporating all kinds of e-health applications. In general, there is a growing interest in web-based, automated screening and monitoring of physical and psychological functioning of patients and partners as part of general portals with different functions (information, electronic dossiers, email, et cetera).</p><p><italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> may also have some limitations. First of all not every partner may be interested in a web-based self-help intervention. We realize that some partners (for example elderly people) might prefer face-to-face contact with a health care professional instead of a (web-based) self-help intervention. However, we believe that the most important step is that partners of cancer patients are at least offered any kind of help. After that, they can decide for themselves if they need help, and whether they would prefer face-to-face contact with a health care professional or whether they would like to participate in a (web-based) self-help intervention. Besides, we think that it doesn&#x02019;t have to be one or the other. Face-to-face consultation and web-based support can also become more blended, in order to fully utilize the possibilities and advantages of both forms of support. This may also be an appropriate solution for people with severe distress for whom a mere self-help intervention is not sufficient. Highly distressed partners could participate in <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> under supervision of a health care professional (e.g. a psychologist). The professional could guide them through the intervention and he or she could check on them and constantly monitor on the partners&#x02019; (mental) health.</p><p>Another limitation may be that the intervention is not targeting bereavement. Therefore, <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> is not applicable for partners who have already lost their ill spouse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Strengths and limitations of the RCT</title><p>Our study will answer questions regarding the (cost-)effectiveness of <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> and possible determinants of the effects of the intervention on psychological distress in partners of cancer patients. We will also conduct a detailed process evaluation to obtain insight in processes in use of the intervention (e.g. time spent on the website, number of exercises completed, content of the messages exchanges). Additionally, satisfaction with the intervention will be measured. For example, participants will be asked if the intervention met their expectations, if they liked the intervention and what they thought about the content of the feedback. These insights can help us to improve the intervention. Furthermore, long-term effects will be studied and an economic evaluation will be done. These two aspects are also highly relevant for a successful implementation in the Dutch healthcare system.</p><p>Our study also has some limitations. First, we have no long-term data for the waiting list control condition. For ethical reasons, the participants in this group receive the intervention after the T1 measurement (three months after the baseline measurement). Second, we expect that it is highly challenging to find enough partners of cancer patients who are willing to participate in this trial. From other studies among informal caregivers of cancer patients it is known that it is difficult to find enough participants to meet the previous calculated power (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). In order to anticipate on this challenge, we make use of a variety of recruitment channels and recruitment strategies (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, this study will yield valuable knowledge about the (cost-)effectiveness of a newly developed web-based self-help intervention for partners of cancer patients. If proven to be effective, <italic>Hold on, for each other</italic> may be offered as standard service for partners of cancer patients in the healthcare system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to the design of the study.
