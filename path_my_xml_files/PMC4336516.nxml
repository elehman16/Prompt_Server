TCM is a 6&#x000a0;day training course delivered to groups of 8&#x02013;12 teachers. The STARS trial will investigate whether TCM can improve children&#x02019;s behaviour, attainment and wellbeing, reduce teachers&#x02019; stress and improve their self-efficacy. This protocol describes the methodology of the process evaluation embedded within the main trial, which aims to examine the uptake and implementation of TCM strategies within the classroom plus the wider school environment and improve the understanding of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The STARS trial will work with eighty teachers of children aged 4&#x02013;9 years from eighty schools. Teachers will be randomised to attend the TCM course (intervention arm) or to &#x0201c;teach as normal&#x0201d; (control arm) and attend the course a year later. The process evaluation will use quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess fidelity to model, as well as explore headteachers&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; experiences of TCM and investigate school factors that influence the translation of skills learnt to practice. Four of the eight groups of teachers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) will be invited to participate in focus groups within one month of completing the TCM course, and again a year later, while 45 of the 80 headteachers will be invited to take part in telephone interviews. Standardised checklists will be completed by group leaders and each training session will be videotaped to assess fidelity to model. Teachers will also complete standardised session evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide important information about whether the Teacher Classroom Management course influences child and teacher mental health and well-being in both the short and long term.

These children also incur substantial costs to both society and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The impairment and societal costs of antisocial behaviour, however, occur across the population distribution rather than just among those with the highest level of problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>For teachers, disruptive behaviour in the classroom is associated with higher stress levels and burnout, and lack of training to manage this behaviour has been highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Children in poorly managed classrooms may see that disruptive behaviour results in staff attention, while good behaviour may rarely be acknowledged.</p><p>Jennings and Greenberg have proposed a model that highlights links between teachers&#x02019; social and emotional competence and well-being and the maintenance of teacher-student relationships, effective classroom management and successful implementation of social and emotional learning programmes for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They call for increased research to improve teacher social and emotional competence to help improve learning outcomes for students.</p><p>This protocol describes the embedded process evaluation within a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate whether a teacher classroom management programme leads to improved social-emotional competence, behaviour and learning among children and reduced stress, burn out and improved professional self-efficacy among teachers. MRC guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] emphasises that a thorough process evaluation is essential to understand implementation issues in trials of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The intervention: the teacher classroom management programme</title><p>While there are programmes that target children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a recent systematic review identified only two interventions that have been tested in randomised trials more than once, and which focus on enhancing teachers&#x02019; skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One of these programmes is the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. TCM draws on cognitive social learning theory, in particular: Patterson&#x02019;s theories concerning how coercive cycles of interaction between adults and children reinforce unwanted behaviour patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; Bandura&#x02019;s ideas about the importance of modelling and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and Piaget&#x02019;s developmental interactive learning methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. TCM is delivered to groups of ten teachers, and involves six whole-day sessions spread over six months. It is delivered in a collaborative style by trained and supervised &#x02018;group leaders&#x02019; who encourage teachers to share their experience and expertise and to value that of others. TCM uses goal setting, reflective learning, video modelling, role play, rehearsal of novel management strategies, group discussion, support and problem solving, and cognitive and emotional self-regulation training.</p><p>There have been only three trials of TCM in isolation from other interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a small observational study in Wales, 23 teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with TCM. Direct observation revealed that teachers who had accessed TCM gave clearer instructions, allowed more time for compliance and their pupils were more compliant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study preceded an RCT involving 12 classes from 11 primary schools and 107 children aged 3&#x02013;7 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Independent classroom observations showed a significant reduction in classroom off-task behaviour, teacher negatives to target children, target child negatives towards the teacher and target child off-task behaviour. However, there was no significant change in teacher behaviour towards the whole class (possibly because teachers were aware that target children were being observed), and children at low risk of conduct disorder showed no change in negative behaviour. Another trial took place in Ireland, and follow-up is on-going [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All trials suggest that TCM is sufficiently intense to change teachers&#x02019; behaviour, and may improve behaviour for some children, but not enough is known about universal classroom effects. None of the trials looked at whether benefits to children and teachers are sustained in the longer-term. Other studies involving TCM have either added additional coaching for teachers or children, and/or studied the parallel parent and child programmes with or without TCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All suggest that TCM is potentially effective but given the additional interventions it is impossible to estimate the impact of TCM alone as a public health intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The STARS trial</title><p>The TCM programme is being evaluated in the Supporting Teachers And childRen in Schools (STARS) cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations.</p><p>The setting is primary schools within Devon, Torbay and Plymouth, with one teacher and their pupils per school (cluster) allocated to TCM training or teaching as usual (TAU). Eighty schools will be recruited over three years in three overlapping cohorts; 15 in Cohort 1, 30 in Cohort 2 and 35 in Cohort 3. The trial design includes a one year pilot phase (Cohort 1), followed by a four year main phase (Cohorts 2 and 3). Each school will participate in the trial for three academic years, with a one year intervention period and two years of follow up (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

FU &#x02013; Follow up years.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1486_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The duration of the intervention (six months) dictates that the TCM programme runs once per academic year between November and April. Teachers from schools allocated to the intervention arm will attend the course in their first year of participation and, as an incentive for participation, control teachers will attend in their second year of participation. By the end of the trial, 80 teachers will have attended TCM over a four year period, i.e. eight groups of 10 teachers.</p><p>The main outcome is teacher-reported child mental health, with secondary outcome measures of parent-reported child mental health, child behaviour, child academic attainment, child-reported enjoyment of school and teacher-reported mental health, relationship to work and sense of professional efficacy. Child and teacher outcomes will be assessed at the beginning and end of the first academic year (T0 and T1). Children will have new teachers in each follow-up year (T2 and T3), who will complete the child well-being measures. Child-reported outcomes will be measured in both follow-up years (T2 and T3). The study teachers will also be working with a new class of children, which allows us to offer the control teachers TCM in the second year of participation.</p><p>This protocol describes the qualitative and quantitative data to be collected in the process evaluation. For further information about the STARS trial, see Ford et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Theoretical basis to the STARS process evaluation</title><p>MRC guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] suggests that a process evaluation can provide insight into why a successful intervention is working or why an intervention fails. Nested within a trial, process evaluation can increase understanding of trial quality and influences on implementation. However, Munro &#x00026; Bloor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] caution against collecting too much data in a process evaluation and highlight the need to prioritize both the type and amount of data collected. As well as pre-trial development, qualitative methods are advocated during and post-trial, to facilitate the interpretation of trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. One advantage of using qualitative methods during process evaluation is that they enable assessment of social processes during the implementation and uptake of an intervention, and also of the context within which implementation takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The process evaluation will build on the earlier feasibility phase evaluation of the research processes from the schools&#x02019; perspective, to optimise the conduct of the trial. Also, to increase understanding of the personal and school-based practices and contexts which influence how TCM strategies are taken up, used and transferred between staff, the STARS process evaluation aims to develop a cohesive description of teacher and headteacher perspectives and experiences relating to their use of TCM. Accordingly, the aims of the process evaluation in the pilot and main phases reflect the different research questions of these stages of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Process evaluation aims</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pilot phase: Year 1</title><p><italic>Aims</italic>: To inform main trial processes, identify use of TCM strategies in the classroom and identify any additional sources of support.</p><p><italic>Research Questions:</italic><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How do teachers experience the TCM course content and delivery and what are the influences on experiences and uptake of learning?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the teachers&#x02019; and headteachers&#x02019; views about the trial and research processes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How have teachers begun to use TCM strategies in the classroom and what influences this?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which additional sources of support are used by teachers in their management of challenging behaviours?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Both quantitative findings about attendance and course coverage, and qualitative findings about course content, delivery and trial processes will be summarised to identify aspects of the course that were more positively or negatively received than others in the delivery and content of TCM and how the trial is run.

The STARS trial will work with one headteacher, one teacher, their class and parents from each of 80 state funded primary schools. The class must be a single year group class between Reception and Year 4 (children aged between four to nine years at recruitment) and the teacher must be in the class at least four days per week. The target sample size of children at final follow-up is 1600.</p><p>This sample necessarily sets the sample frame for the process evaluation. As the control condition is to receive the intervention with a year&#x02019;s delay, quantitative attendance and satisfaction data will be collected from all 80 teachers, and there will be eight courses, comprising six sessions each, conducted by six group leaders working in pairs. There is little methodological guidance when planning sample sizes for qualitative studies, but empirical study suggests that data saturation is possible within the first 6&#x02013;12 interviews, although many more are often conducted as in the case in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

As indicated earlier, TCM draws on a number of social learning theories relevant to the process evaluation that will explore teachers&#x02019; experiences of individual, social (group) and contextual influences on their own learning within the course, and their uptake and use of TCM strategies. One example is Bandura&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]model of self-efficacy, in which he suggests that a range of influences such as role play, coaching, past experience and &#x02018;group&#x02019; learning and feedback, as well as individual emotional state, may influence self-efficacy, and in turn behaviour and performance. This and other theories can help guide analytical questions, in order to illuminate contextual and individual influences and to help identify what worked well or not so well for teachers within the context of TCM.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>All audio-taped qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Data will be stored using Nvivo software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and will be password protected. Analysis will draw on understandings of social learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and on subtle realist perspectives to help identify experiences as the lived &#x02018;reality&#x02019; of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The ways in which participants account for their experiences within the context of the trial and their own schools-based experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] will be explored. Thematic analysis of interview and focus group data will be framed by research questions and will also allow for more inductive analysis whereby emergent themes are also identified. This approach will help explain the experience and views of teachers and headteachers.</p><p>In the analysis, &#x02018;keyness&#x02019; of themes does not relate to the frequency of occurrence but to whether a theme captures information relevant to the research questions, in this case relating to a range of experiences and views about behaviours and contexts relevant to TCM strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The Framework Approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] will be used to manage data and aid systematic analysis (description and summary of key themes, patterns and links in the data), allowing the researcher to move between levels of abstraction during analysis and between a theory driven and more inductive approach, whilst also displaying the relevant data sources. This approach will help maintain a focus on the process evaluation objectives for the different phases of the study. Data analysis will be carried out separately for each stage of the pilot and main trial phases and findings will be synthesized to provide feedback at appropriate stages within the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Rigour and reliability</title><p>Two researchers will be supported by an experienced qualitative researcher who will provide interview training and on-going supervision during data collection and analysis. A number of methods will be adopted to enhance rigour during the study including: Purposive sampling to increase representation and transferability; multiple researchers; peer debriefing which allows for discussion and identification of themes and concepts to increase representation; recording of analytical discussions; checks for thematic saturation and consistency; use of the framework approach and an audit trail of analysis decisions to help minimise bias and track variability between researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Quantitative data</title><p>Based on experience during our feasibility work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], the distribution of attendance data is predicted to be highly negatively skewed, with most teachers attending most sessions, which will necessitate the use of non-parametric approaches to summarise and test them for differences between control and intervention arms.</p><p>Satisfaction with each session will be explored by reporting the proportions that endorse each response for each facet of the session (overall, videos, group leader, group discussion) by group and by session to look for systematic differences in how teachers experience the course. These can then be explored further in the data from focus groups and interviews. We will seek systematic differences between the teacher reported experience of each session across the whole trial, and between each of the eight groups that will be run using chi-squared. Finally, we will summarise satisfaction at the end of the course by the proportion reporting that they found the course &#x0201c;very helpful&#x0201d; and that they would &#x0201c;strongly recommend it&#x0201d; to a colleague. Similarly, we will explore the responses on the five-point Likert scale in relation to the different teaching techniques to seek strategies that were particularly popular/unpopular and triangulate these results with themes that subsequently emerge from the focus groups and interviews.</p><p>Fidelity to course content will be assessed by reporting the proportion of the prescribed curriculum covered in each session and over all from the group leader checklists, and examining whether this increased over time as group leaders gained experience.</p><p>We will examine whether the effectiveness of the intervention for improving child behaviour outcomes (based on the teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) is greater for pupils of those teachers that attended more TCM sessions. Because teacher attendance of TCM sessions is likely to be associated with factors that impact on pupil outcomes we will account for this confounding using instrumental variable methods described by Dunn and Bentall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry Research Ethics Committee (now under the auspices of the University of Exeter Medical School Research Ethics Committee), reference Mar12/05b/141.</p><p>The STARS study is likely to elicit sensitive and confidential data and attention to ethics and participant confidence in and acceptance of researchers is crucial. Information about the process evaluation will be included in trial information sheets, and consent for participation in focus groups or individual interviews will be obtained at the same time as consent to take part in the trial. A reminder and additional information on focus groups will be given to teachers during the TCM course. Verbal consent will be taken for participation at the beginning of each interview or focus group. It will be made clear that participants have the right to withdraw their personal data from the study at any time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The process evaluation will provide valuable outputs relevant to the aims and different phases of the STARS trial. Summary and illustrative data will be available for each phase of the trial, to facilitate further interpretation and evaluation of the TCM course, the ways in which teachers learn about and use TCM strategies and any findings on teacher and headteacher views about impacts of the course for children and schools.</p><p>Towards the end of the main phase data will be synthesised to facilitate fuller understanding and key messages about influences on how TCM is used and shared with colleagues. A final report will combine findings from across each of the trial phases, which will be analysed in tandem with the outcome measures of the STARS trial.</p><p>The process evaluation will also contribute to methodological considerations relevant to the use of qualitative research methods in public health trials.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p>As at time of submission data collection is on-going and the trial is in the main phase.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management course</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STARS</term><def><p>Supporting Teachers and childRen in Schools trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The senior research team meets bi-monthly to discuss progress, and much of this protocol emerged from discussions in these meetings during the feasibility and pilot phase of the trial.
