These athletes, when preparing to compete in hot environments, often have to rely on research information on heat acclimation obtained from moderately trained or untrained populations using long-term (ie, 12&#x02013;14 days of physical exercise in high ambient environments) heat acclimation protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-oajsm-4-161">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-oajsm-4-161">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-oajsm-4-161">12</xref> For competitive athletes, disruption of quality training time close to competitions with long-term heat acclimation could interfere with their training schedule, resulting in a negative effect on subsequent sport performance. Furthermore, competitive athletes also have to deal with environmental concerns when traveling from a mild climate region to a hot climate region (eg, countries of tropical climate) for competition, with the possibility of physical detraining (and jet lag), due to travel time and distance to the site of competition. It is critical to know the extent to which trained athletes may adapt to short-term heat acclimation to prevent negative thermoregulatory effects on physical performance. Thus, for the competitive athletes, the use of a short-term heat acclimation protocol of five daily sessions would be more economical and efficient than long-term protocols. The precise mechanisms responsible for the impaired performance in the high thermal environment in trained athletes are not yet fully understood.</p><p>During exercise in a high-thermal environment, cutaneous circulation undergoes periodic changes by increased local blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of muscular activity and to dissipate body heat.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-161">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> The mechanism of peripheral vascular reflex responses during exercise in the heat maintains adequate cardiac output and blood pressure during periods of decreased cardiac-filling pressure, suggesting that during exercise in the heat, blood flow in the nonactive region of the tissue is lowered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-oajsm-4-161">10</xref> The effect of exercise in the heat on the distribution of SkBF in the active and nonactive limbs of highly trained athletes has not been fully investigated. Thus, it is unclear as to whether skin blood flow to the active region of the working tissue after heat acclimation decreases, remains unchanged, or increases during exhaustive leg cycle exercise in high ambient temperature in trained athletes. It would be of great interest for trained athletes to examine the extent of heat acclimation that could occur with respect to cardiovascular adaptations and body heat dissipation via SkBF in the active and nonactive limbs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of five daily sessions of leg cycling exercise with an incremental work rate in high ambient temperature on physiological responses, as well as SkBF distribution in the active and inactive limb in trained athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fourteen male athletes were recruited from active members of the national all-star table tennis and the national all-star badminton teams from Taiwan. The athletes recruited for this study were six badminton and eight table tennis players. (See exclusion criteria below.) The athletes were full-time college students at the National Taiwan Sport University in Taoyuan, Taiwan, not heat acclimated, and had been residing at the same location (altitude of 250 meters above sea level) for 3&#x02013;4 years. During the study period, the months of November through March, the average monthly ambient temperature and relative humidity were: 19.9&#x000b0;C and 68% (November); 16.5&#x000b0;C and 67% (December); 15.3&#x000b0;C and 79% (January); 14.4&#x000b0;C and 77% (February); and 17.5&#x000b0;C and 82% (March), respectively. Summer month ambient temperature and relative humidity averaged 28&#x000b0;C&#x02013;30&#x000b0;C and 80%&#x02013;88%, respectively. The age, height, body mass, body surface area, and maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) of the subjects were (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation [SD]): 19.6 &#x000b1; 1.2 years; 171.6 &#x000b1; 4.7 cm; 64.7 &#x000b1; 5.0 kg; 1.78 &#x000b1; 0.08 m<sup>2</sup>; and 53.0 &#x000b1; 5.3 mL/kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per minute<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (with a cycle ergometer test), respectively. Before the subjects&#x02019; randomization, the participants were fully informed of potential risks and anticipated discomforts associated with the experimental procedure and allowed to have two familiarization sessions &#x02013; one for the cycle ergometer test protocol and one for the training protocol. All participants gave their written, informed consent to participate as study subjects. This research protocol was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki on human research and approved by the National Taiwan Sport University Ethics Committee.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>All subjects underwent pre-participation screening using a Health and Exercise History Questionnaire and a blood chemistry profile test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-oajsm-4-161">15</xref> Subjects were excluded from the study if they: (1) had a cardiovascular, liver, kidney, metabolic, or pulmonary disease; (2) were recovering from musculoskeletal injuries or respiratory tract infections that could affect the outcomes of maximal leg cycle exercise test (GXT) and aerobic training in the heat; (3) were heat acclimatized during physical training within the past 6 months; (4) had been diagnosed with Raynaud&#x02019;s disease, a vasospastic disease of small arteries and arterioles affecting circulation to the digits of the hands; (5) currently used any tobacco product; (6) were heavy caffeine users, ie, &#x0003e;500 mg per day; or (7) used vasodilator drugs. We excluded subjects with Raynaud&#x02019;s disease because intermittent occlusions of circulation to the small arteries and arterioles affect arterial blood flow to the skin region and thus compromise skin blood measurements. The subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental (EXP, n = 7; three badminton players and four table tennis players) or control (CON, n = 7; three badminton players and four table tennis players) group. After randomization, the participants followed the experimental procedure outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oajsm-4-161">Figure 1</xref>. Two separate laboratory visits were required for baseline study outcome measurements in thermoneutral and hot conditions, separated by at least a 24-hour rest. The outcome measurements were performed using a leg cycle ergometer (Model 818E, Monark Exercise AB, Vansbro, Sweden) and an incremental leg cycle protocol with 3-minute increment per stage until reaching volitional fatigue or exhaustion. The Monark cycle ergometer was calibrated daily before the measurement. The GXTs were conducted at the same time of the day on each visit (ie, &#x000b1;30 minutes), and the test order was randomly allocated and counterbalanced. Twenty-four hours after the baseline measurements, the EXP began to train in a hot environment, mean &#x000b1; SD room temperature = 38.4&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.4&#x000b0;C, and relative humidity (RH) = 52.0% &#x000b1; 4.6%, while the CON began to train in a thermoneutral environment with mean &#x000b1; SD room temperature = 24.1&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C and RH = 51.5% &#x000b1; 4.5%, both groups on upright cycle ergometers. Both EXP and CON were trained using the following cycling exercise protocol from day 1 to day 5. On day 1, the training duration and work rate were 25 minutes per day and at 10% below the individual&#x02019;s ventilatory threshold (VT) obtained from the GXT in the thermoneutral condition. The subsequent training work rates for days 2, 3, 4, and 5 were increased to 5% below the VT, equal to the VT, 5% above the VT, and 10% above the VT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oajsm-4-161">Figure 1</xref>). The subsequent training duration was increased by 5 minutes each day, until reaching 45 minutes per day on day 5. At the conclusion of the training period, within 24 hours, subjects repeated the same baseline measurements. All subjects completed the 5-day training sessions without any incident of heat-related illnesses or muscle soreness. The thermal-controlled room used for exercise training and testing was equipped with a thermal-controlled system and 122 square meters wide with an 2.44 meter ceiling. Temperature in the testing room was manually controlled by an investigator using a wall-mounted thermostat outside the testing room. One investigator (TIC) accompanied the subject in the room at all times to perform the measurements. The hot thermal room condition was significantly higher than the thermoneutral condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec><title>Determination of VO<sub>2max</sub> and time to reach exhaustion</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; VO<sub>2max</sub> was measured on a cycle ergometer in a thermoneutral room with a mean &#x000b1; SD, 24.1&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C, and RH of 51.5% &#x000b1; 4.5% and in a hot room with 38.4&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.4&#x000b0;C and RH of 52.0% &#x000b1; 4.6%. The GXT protocol consisted of a 5-minute warm-up at a work rate of 30 watts (W), and 3 minutes of stretching exercises. During the VO<sub>2max</sub> measurement, the initial cycling work rate was 60 W for 3 minutes; thereafter, the work rate was increased by 30 W every 3 minutes until reaching volitional fatigue. VO<sub>2max</sub> was determined when the subject met at least two of the following criteria: (1) failed to maintain the prescribed pedaling frequency of 60 revolutions per minute for more than 5 seconds with repeated verbal encouragement (from researcher TIC); (2) a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) &#x02265;19 (Borg 6&#x02013;20 scale); (3) respiratory exchange ratio (RER) &#x0003e;1.10; or (4) exercise heart rate &#x0003e;95% of the predicted maximal heart rate. Expired gases were collected and recorded breath-by-breath, using an automated metabolic cart system (Sensor Medics System, Model 2900, Yorba Linda, CA, USA), which was calibrated 2 hours before all testing. All subjects reached peak work rates between 210 W and 240 W before stopping the test. During the VO<sub>2max</sub> measurement, exercise time to exhaustion (t<sub>max</sub>) was determined by the same researcher (TIC). The time-to-exhaustion criteria was recorded in seconds and determined when the subject stopped pedaling the cycle ergometer, despite repeated verbal encouragement given by the same researcher. In addition, one of the following criteria must be attained: (1) a rating of RPE &#x02265;19 (Borg 6&#x02013;20 scale); or (2) an exercise heart rate &#x0003e;95% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate. Note that during the t<sub>max</sub> measurement, all the subjects met the above end-point criteria. In addition to the VO<sub>2max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub>, study outcome measurements also included: maximal minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>); oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>); rate of elimination of carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>); VT; heart rate (HR); maximal oxygen-pulse; skin blood flow in the quadriceps, (SkBF<sub>q</sub>); skin blood flow of the upper arm (SkBF<sub>a</sub>); mean T<sub>sk</sub>; and total body sweat loss. HR was recorded during all training sessions using a Polar heart rate monitor (Model #1901201, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). The equipment used for the outcome measurements was calibrated daily, 2 hours before testing or data collection. Over the 5-day period, average training HR between the EXP in the heat (163 &#x000b1; 5.2 beats per minute [BPM]<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and the CON in the thermoneutral condition (164 &#x000b1; 3.0 BPM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were not significantly different. The exercise intensity ranged from 75% on day 1% to 89% of maximum heart rate on day 5. Core temperature was not obtained, due to more than half of the subjects experiencing esophageal discomfort or gastroesophageal reflux while swallowing the esophageal thermostat probe during cycling exercise in the hot environment. Twenty-four hours prior to the GXT test, the athletes were instructed to adequately hydrate, abstain from any physical training, drinking alcohol, caffeine or tea, and no food intake 2 hours before testing or training. Each subject was provided with ten 450 mL bottles of water daily and instructed to drink three bottles of fluid 2 hours before the GXT or exercise training and at least three to four bottles of fluid following the GXT test or exercise training. Subjects maintained their regular diet by consuming cafeteria-prepared standard meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the campus dining hall. During the study period, the standard meals prepared by the cafeteria consisted of approximately 3500 kilocalories per day with 55%&#x02013;60% calories from carbohydrate, 15%&#x02013;20% calories from protein, and 20%&#x02013;25% calories from fat.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Determination of VT level</title><p>During the GXT in the thermoneutral and hot conditions, VT was determined according to Wasserman et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-oajsm-4-161">16</xref> using the criteria of systematic increase in ventilatory equivalents for oxygen (V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) with no concomitant increase of V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub>.

The mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon is unclear. These observations may be interpreted as that before heat acclimation, leg SkBF in the hot environment was largely directed to the skin region, due to cutaneous vasodilator drive in response to exercise and heat stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-oajsm-4-161">10</xref> However, after a 5-day heat acclimation process, the observed reduction in leg SkBF at 120 W, 180 W, and 240 W work rate (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-oajsm-4-161">Figure 2A</xref>) in the hot condition may be explained as follows. Before heat acclimation during dynamic exercise in the heat, blood flow in the exercising muscle increases to meet the increased metabolic demand and that is accompanied by cutaneous vasoconstriction and substantial vasodilation in the active muscle until reaching exhaustion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-161">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> In this case, we hypothesize that after heat acclimation, cutaneous blood flow during dynamic leg exercise was lowered so that blood flow in the active muscle can be maintained in the high thermal environment and thus increased the time to exhaustion.</p><p>In the thermally neutral environment, after heat acclimation, at all levels of exercise work rates, leg skin blood flow increases steadily, due to cutaneous vasodilation until work rate reached 180 W and then leg SkBF dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-oajsm-4-161">Figure 2B</xref>). This assumption is based on: (1) during leg exercise in the hot environment, internal body temperature also increases; and (2) a constant cardiac output and cardiac-filling pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> The above observations were not detected in the CON.</p><p>Arm SkBF response during leg cycling exercise in the thermoneutral condition support Smolander&#x02019;s findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-oajsm-4-161">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-oajsm-4-161">23</xref> that skin blood flow measured at the forearm increased linearly in physically active men. We observed a plateau in arm SkBF during leg exercise in the hot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oajsm-4-161">Figure 3A</xref>) and thermoneutral condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oajsm-4-161">Figure 3B</xref>). In the hot environment, our results did not support that of Hales et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-oajsm-4-161">22</xref> who observed a remarkable 80% decrease in SkBF in the nonactive arm during leg cycle exercise at intensity of 60% VO<sub>2max</sub>. Both EXP and CON groups showed a larger and steeper increase in arm SkBF in response to increased work rate in hot conditions than in the thermoneutral environments. However, in both thermal conditions, arm SkBF plateau or drop when the exercise work rate reached 180 W or higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oajsm-4-161">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oajsm-4-161">B</xref>). The observed plateau in arm SkBF is due to reflex effects from the skin temperature that work at suppressing the cutaneous vasodilator drive to rising internal body temperature by raising the threshold for vasodilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-oajsm-4-161">24</xref> We did not measure body temperature in this study and could only assume that during incremental leg cycling exercise in the hot environment, internal temperature was elevated and thus raised the cutaneous vasodilation threshold. Another possible mechanism is that when arm SkBF approaches its peak value, it begins to redirect cutaneous blood flow away from nonexercising tissues (including blood volume in the visceral vascular bed) to meet the metabolic demands of the exercising skeletal muscle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> To meet the high metabolic demands and optimize cardiac output during heavy exercise in the high ambient environment, the thermoregulatory drive that is exercise must place a constraint on cutaneous vasodilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> Stephens et al suggest that in the cutaneous blood flow, the control is from sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves manifested through the release of norepinephrine and the vasoconstricting cotransmitter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-oajsm-4-161">25</xref> Other researchers suggest that in the exercising skeletal muscles, increased blood flow may be achieved via the release of local vasodilating substances, such as increased hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) and carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco<sub>2</sub>),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-161">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-oajsm-4-161">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-oajsm-4-161">10</xref> and release of nitric oxide synthase,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-161">7</xref> overcoming the effect of sympathetic vasoconstrictor drive in those exercising muscles. These observations, redistribution of SkBF from skin presumably to exercising muscle in the active limb, led us to believe that after heat acclimation, vasodilation in the exercising muscle provides the capability for the EXP to increase their endurance time in the hot environment.</p><p>After heat acclimation, the EXP group significantly increased O<sub>2</sub> pulse during incremental leg cycle exercise in the hot and thermoneutral conditions (10.4% and 6.4%, respectively, both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-oajsm-4-161">Table 1</xref>). Wasserman et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-oajsm-4-161">16</xref> suggested that when the exercise work rate reached a critical intensity level, the O<sub>2</sub> pulse increases primarily because of an increasing arterial-mixed venous O<sub>2</sub> difference, suggesting that after heat acclimation, active tissue receives adequate arterial blood perfusion during exercise in the heat. One benefit of heat acclimation is the redistribution of blood flow away from the skin in the active muscles, or to increase blood perfusion to the working muscle by enhancing peripheral working muscle O<sub>2</sub> extraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-161">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-161">6</xref> This may be attributed to the increase in O<sub>2</sub> pulse, lowering of the heart rate, and the endurance time of the EXP after heat acclimation.</p><p>Throughout the study, our subjects were encouraged to drink fluid during the incremental leg cycle exercise in the hot and thermoneutral conditions and were encouraged to drink three 450 mL bottles fluid following each training session and to continue drinking three to four 450 mL bottles fluid throughout the day. It is possible that these athletes may have induced mild degrees of dehydration because of ad libitum (ie, not required) water intake. If a severe dehydration had occurred, due to incomplete fluid replacement from previous training sessions, the exercise time to exhaustion would have been affected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-oajsm-4-161">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-161">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-oajsm-4-161">26</xref> This could be the case for the CON at post-test measurement because sweat loss of the CON was reduced by approximately 43% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the thermoneutral conditions and 23% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in hot conditions. Thus, the subjects&#x02019; hydration status may have influenced the skin blood flow outcome measurements.</p><p>The present study was novel in that we focused on the training of the lower limbs to separate training effects on SkBF in the active and nonactive limbs, with and without heat exposure. This study was unique with regard to the short-term (five daily sessions) training protocol and the exercise intensities at or above the individual&#x02019;s ventilation threshold with heat exposure and that can be generalized to all athletic groups. Together, the present study makes a contribution to the body of knowledge in the field of sports medicine, particularly given the dearth of studies investigating this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary and conclusion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to examine whether short-term, ie, five daily sessions of vigorous dynamic cycling exercise and heat exposure could achieve heat acclimation in trained athletes and the effect of cutaneous blood flow in the active region of the skeletal muscle during all-out leg cycle exercise in the heat-acclimated athletes. The significant heat-acclimated outcome measurements during incremental leg cycling exercise in high ambient environment are: (1) 56%&#x02013;100% reduction in cutaneous blood flow to the active limbs during leg cycling exercise; (2) 28% drop in cutaneous blood flow in nonactive limb at peak work rate; (3) 5%&#x02013;10% reduction in exercise heart rate; (4) 10% increase in maximal O<sub>2</sub> pulse; and (5) 6.6% increase in endurance time to exhaustion. Based on these findings, we conclude that: (1) heat acclimation can be achieved with five sessions of dynamic cycling exercise in the heat in trained athletes; and (2) reduction of cutaneous blood flow in the exercising limb, lower exercise heart rate, and increase oxygen pulse during cycling exercise provided the heat-acclimated athletes the capability to increase their endurance time in the hot environment. Considering the importance of cutaneous circulation in body temperature regulation and blood flow distribution to the working muscle and skin, heat acclimation should be considered advantageous for trained, competitive athletes. Future research may consider using endurance athletes who compete outdoors for long-distance events with a VO<sub>2max</sub> level &#x0003e;65 mL per kg per minute and using laser Doppler images to estimate regional skin blood perfusion with heat acclimation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the coaches for their support and the athletes for their time and effort in participating as study subjects.
