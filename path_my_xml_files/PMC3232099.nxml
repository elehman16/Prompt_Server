Recently polyethylene glycol has been introduced as an effective and safe drug to treat chronic constipation. There are only a few clinical trials on comparison of PEG and liquid paraffin in childhood constipation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of PEG 3350 solution and liquid paraffin in the treatment of children with functional constipation in Sari Toba clinic during the period of 2008&#x02013;2009.</p></sec><sec id="st02"><title>Methods</title><p>Children with a history of functional constipation were subjects of this study. One hundred and sixty children of 2&#x02013;12 years old with functional constipation were randomized in two PEG and paraffin treatment groups. Patients received either 1.0&#x02013;1.5 g/kg/day PEG 3350 or 1.0&#x02013;1.5 ml/kg/day liquid paraffin for 4 months. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by stool and encopresis frequency/week and overall treatment success rate was compared in two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st03"><title>Results and major conclusion</title><p>Compared with the baseline, defecation frequency/ week increased significantly and encopresis frequency meaningfully decreased in two groups during the period of the study. Patients using PEG 3350 had more success rate (mean: 95.3%&#x000b1;3.7) compared with the patients in paraffin group (mean: 87.2%&#x000b1;7.1) (p=0.087). Administration of PEG 3350 were associated with less adverse events than liquid paraffin. In conclusion in treatment of pediatric functional constipation, regarding clinical efficacy and safety, PEG 3350 were at least as effective as liquid paraffin and but less adverse drug events.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Defecation</kwd><kwd>Encopresis</kwd><kwd>Lactoluse</kwd><kwd>Mineral oil.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 3% of general pediatric outpatient visits and 25% of pediatric gastroenterology consultations are related to perceived defecation disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). More than 95% of children older than 1 year with constipation suffer from functional constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). Liquid paraffin (mineral oil) is widely accepted and recommended as a fundamental component of regimens for the management of constipation in North America and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). Extensive experiences with long-term uses of mineral oil have shown its efficacy and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>) and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGN) clearly identify liquid paraffin as a medication of first choice in the management of pediatric constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). This drug combines ease of titration with tolerability and sustained effect despite prolonged uses and make it attractive for use in childhood constipation encopresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Mineral oil is not recommended for infants less than 1 year old due to the risk of aspiration and development of lipoid pneumonia.</p><p>Some studies have shown PEG has at least equal efficacy and fewer adverse effects in comparison with lactulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). A recent systematic review has demonstrated the efficacy of PEG as good as or even better than lactulose or milk of magnesia over a wide range of ages and treatment durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). There are only a few clinical trials on the comparison of PEG and liquid paraffin in childhood constipation.

The patients referred to Toba clinic initially were examined and followed during the study by a pediatric gastroenterologist.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: Withdrawn the treatment during the first month, hypothyroidism, Hirschsprung disease; known cardiac, renal and neurologic disorders, any sign of organic causes, and history of colon surgery. At the time of enrolment, a full history details was obtained including pain or bleeding during defection, frequency of defecation, fecal impaction, and encopresis. Written informed consent was obtained from parents after full description of the study details. The ethics committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (MAZUMS) approved this open-labeled randomized study that accomplished in Sari Toba clinic affiliated to MAZUMS during the period of 2008&#x02013;2009. At the beginning of the therapy, all patients and their parents were educated for appropriate diet, dairy consumption, toilet training and adverse drug reactions. Random table was used to randomize the patients in two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Protocol</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.0&#x02013;1.5 g/kg/day PEG 3350 or 1.0&#x02013;1.5 ml/kg/day liquid paraffin orally for 4 months. PEG 3350 powder was prepared as a 40% solution to trust reliable to apply the pediatric dosing and to increase compliance and liquid paraffin was provided from a pharmaceutical factory. For rectal disimpaction, bisacodyl suppositories were applied at the beginning of the study. After the first physical exam, the patients were visited at least on the days of 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 120 during the treatment period, repeatedly.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment</title><p>Clinical efficacy was evaluated by stool and encopresis frequency/week and overall treatment success rate was compared in two groups. Patients that were withdrawn from the study due to lack of efficacy or adverse reaction of the drug placed in unsuccessful cases and remaining were considered as successful group. Adverse drug events were determined during examination or at the time of complain of patients and their parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-16 software and results were expressed as means&#x000b1;SD.
