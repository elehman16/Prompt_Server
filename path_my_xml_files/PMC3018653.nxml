Introduction</title><p>The importance of being physically  active has been well documented from a public health perspective, with increased activity associated  with reduced risk for the development of chronic health conditions like cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Researchers have also reported positive mental health outcomes ranging from improved cognition to decreased depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additionally, there is a strong association between physical activity and weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity is suggested to reduce health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], some researchers have reported that more activity may be necessary to prevent weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and promote weight loss or prevent weight regain after a significant loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. </p><p>It is notable that physical activity behavior has been shown to distinguish those who are successful at maintaining weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other important behavioral factors associated with weight management include disinhibited eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], low-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], fruit and vegetable intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and self-weighing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although these behavioral variables are helpful in determining who might be more successful at weight management, they do not account for all the variance observed. As a result, researchers have also examined psychosocial variables to determine how to improve weight control outcomes. </p><p>Psychosocial factors encompass many different domains, including depressed mood, stress, and social support. Although the literature is mixed regarding the exact direction of the relationship between mood and weight, many studies report an association. According to results of the National Weight Control Registry, less depressive symptomatology was associated with significant long-term weight loss maintenance (i.e., <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>30&#x02009;lbs weight loss maintained for at least 1 year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Prospective work suggests that while baseline depressive symptoms negatively influence weight over time, baseline weight does not have a direct effect on one's mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in the context of purposeful weight loss, successful loss is associated with improved mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to depressed mood, perceived stress has been linked with weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For example, lower ratings of baseline stress were associated with greater weight loss in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the literature is mixed with some studies failing to find an association between perceived stress and body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Finally, social support is another psychosocial variable that has been shown to be associated with improvements in weight and physical activity behavior (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Psychological factors like depression and stress may interact with other theory-based variables like self-efficacy to promote participant behavior change that is associated with weight loss. </p><p>With regard to physical activity promotion and weight management, Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) and the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) are discussed frequently within the literature and used to tailor interventions (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Both SCT and the TTM emphasize self-efficacy or one's confidence in making a particular behavioral change. Self-efficacy (eating and exercise-related) has been shown to be predictive of short-term weight change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Additionally, self-efficacy has been shown to be a critical intermediate variable associated with physical activity and weight loss maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The TTM also highlights other constructs like decisional balance, or the pros and cons of behavior change, and the processes of change (cognitive and behavioral) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Decisional balance and processes of change have been associated with increased physical activity and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, participation in an exercise promotion trial may not always improve all theoretical constructs (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). </p><p>Overall, theory-based interventions targeting physical activity and body weight have been shown to be largely effective, and these interventions have been delivered via a number of channels including face-to-face, mailings, and the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite these studies, additional work is needed to determine the ideal components of interventions designed to promote physical activity and weight loss. In particular, there is a continued need to clarify the roles of behavioral and psychosocial variables that affect physical activity and weight management. </p><p>The <italic>Women's Wellness Project</italic> was designed to examine the efficacy two print-based physical activity promotion programs for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this project, women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) <italic>Choose to Move</italic> (CTM), a print-based physical activity intervention designed specifically for women, (2) <italic>JumpStart</italic>, a motivationally tailored print-based intervention, or (3) Wellness contact-control group. The interventions (see below) focused on the adoption on maintenance of physical activity and did <italic>not</italic> include calorie goals or weight loss targets. Since participants completed 1-year follow-up assessments, this type of physical activity trial is useful for assessing change in weight status among participants. A 1-year time point was selected as this is a designated time point for determining long-term maintenance of weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. </p><p>Given the importance of understanding individual variability in weight stability and response to physical activity interventions, we proposed to examine and identify evidence-based constructs associated with weight stability. Therefore, we hypothesized that psychosocial and behavioral variables, selected based on research and theory (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), would successfully discriminate between individuals who had different patterns of weight change over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Discriminant Function Analysis</title><p>Tests of dimensionality indentified two distinct dimensions; both of the dimensions were statistically significant. Dimension 1 (F (10, 456) = 2.76; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) had a canonical correlation of 0.26 between the response variables and weight status classification, while the canonical correlation for Dimension 2 (F (4, 229) = 2.70; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) was lower at 0.21. Standardized canonical coefficients for both dimensions were examined with the first dimension positively weighted by changes in mood (0.73) and self-efficacy (0.79). The second discriminant dimension was more weighted to change in physical activity (0.58) and fat consumption (0.55). The first dimension reflects a negative affect and self-confidence dimension, while the second reflects a physical activity and dietary behavior dimension. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref> for the standardized pooled, within class standardized canonical coefficients, which can be interpreted similarly to standardized regression coefficients. For example, a one standard deviation increase on the depression variable will result in a&#x02009;&#x02009;.73 standard deviation decrease in the predicted values on discriminant function 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The results from the discriminant function analysis indicated two statistically significant dimensions. The first dimension was a psychological dimension weighted by changes in depressive symptoms and self-efficacy for physical activity. When examining the mean changes on these variables by weight status classification, women who gained weight reported increases in depressed mood (mean = 4.47; <italic>SE</italic> = 1.58), compared with women who lost weight (mean = 1.30; SE = 0.95) or remained weight stable (mean = 0.47; SE = 0.66). This finding is consistent with other studies in which depressive symptomatology was negatively associated with weight regain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There are a few explanations for the association between mood and weight. Successful and purposeful weight loss is associated with improved mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other findings from a recent meta analysis suggest that there is a relationship between increased physical activity and improved mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, although psychosocial in nature, clinically, depression encompasses many physical and behavioral features. In fact, behavioral activation is often the first step in successful evidence-based treatments for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Given the behavioral components of depression, it is not surprising that depressive symptoms also loaded at &#x02212;.52 on Dimension 2. These results highlight a need to include distress tolerance or some other intervention targets for managing negative mood within the context of weight and physical activity trials.</p><p>The other variable that was weighted highly on Dimension 1 was self-efficacy for physical activity. Although the research related to the construct of self-efficacy and weight loss has been mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], self-efficacy has been shown to be an important construct for the adoption and maintenance of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and weight change in short-term weight loss studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The association between self-efficacy long-term weight outcomes from this physical activity-only trial provides further evidence for the importance of this construct. Self-efficacy is a construct that reflects one's confidence that they can be active despite numerous barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. While self-efficacy tends to be domain specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], there is likely overlap between one's confidence to be physically active and their confidence to perform other healthy weight-related behaviors. It is interesting to note the change scores for this construct by weight status. For women classified as losing or gaining weight, the mean change was about 0.33. However, for women classified as being weight stable, there was virtually no change on self-efficacy between baseline and Month 12 (<italic>M</italic> = &#x02212;0.02). Women who have successfully performed physical activity for a 12-month period may have already internalized their confidence to do so, which may reflect the stability of that construct over time among women who were weight stable. Future studies should investigate the longitudinal relationship between changes in physical activity self-efficacy and weight gain. For women who are gaining weight, confidence in their ability to exercise may not transfer to confidence for managing dietary behaviors. </p><p>The second dimension identified in the discriminant function analysis reflects a behavior dimension. Consistent with other studies, these results provide further evidence for the importance of behavior change (i.e., physical activity and diet) in long-term weight maintenance. In particular, women who lost weight reported, on average, 170 minutes of physical activity, in contrast to the amounts reported (93 and 96 minutes) in women who gained and remained weight stable, respectively. This result is similar to other studies indicating that physical activity behavior distinguishes successful weight loss maintainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consumption of a low-fat diet has been shown to be an important behavioral target for weight loss/maintenance, as well (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Findings from the discriminant function analysis also identify fat consumption as a distinguishing variable. However, when the means are examined, women who gained weight reported lower (&#x02212;1.80) fat consumption compared with women who lost (&#x02212;0.32) or remained weight stable (&#x02212;1.03). It is surprising that women who gained weight from baseline to Month 12 reported greater decreases in fat consumption than women who lost or remained weight stable. This could reflect a tendency for underreporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] or a social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] that women who gained weight may be embarrassed by their dietary intake and thus were not forthcoming about their intake. Unsuccessful dieters have been shown to misreport (i.e., underestimate) their intake by 47% compared with 19% of controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. It is likely the results of the current study are related to a reporting bias, which is consistent with other studies which have found selective underreporting of fat by obese participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Future studies should include more precise measures of dietary intake and behavior than the screener measure used in this study.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study which would put the findings in context. First, although weight and height were clinically measured and physical activity was assessed via an interviewer-based measure, the other measures were self-reported. A particular limitation of the measurement is the use of fruit/vegetable and fat consumption screener measures, rather than a food frequency questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. A more complete measure of dietary intake may have resulted in different findings for eating behaviors. Additionally, the study sample was all female and predominately Caucasian, therefore the results cannot be generalized to men nor to other races/ethnicities. Of the sample, only 13.8% gained weight over the 12-month period; despite this small number inclusion of this group provides an important comparison for the study. Finally, the participants were self-selected in that they were interested and willing to be part of a physical activity intervention trial. Anecdotally, many of the women reported joining the trial with the goal of losing weight. It is possible that the women were motivated, in general, to lose weight, and this could have influenced the associations found in this study. Nonetheless, a physical activity-only intervention trial, particularly one with &#x0003e;90% retention rates, provides a useful context for examining long-term weight change. This retrospective longitudinal analysis provides a framework for examining patterns of change that can be generalized to individuals who have not had the benefit of dietary recommendations, calorie goals, and problem solving for high risk situations, as is typical for behavioral weight control interventions. </p><p>Although the variables selected for inclusion in the analyses were based on theory and evidence-based practice, the study was retrospective in design, consisting of post hoc analyses. Discriminant function analyses have great potential value, particularly in the retrospective examination of certain predictor variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], but have limitations. Specifically, this approach does not allow for the examination of directionality of changes nor reverse causality. For the current study, there were other variables known as important for weight loss maintenance not included in the discriminant analyses as they were not measured in the present study. Future studies should examine other psychosocial and behavioral variables of interest. </p><p>Despite these limitations, however, the paper identifies important constructs related to weight stability. This study provides further evidence for the importance of behavior in long-term weight maintenance, particularly physical activity and dietary fat consumption. These findings also provide evidence for the importance of psychosocial variables, in particular depressed mood and self-efficacy. These results give investigators signals as to the variables of importance for targeting in future physical activity trials. Not only are they important in physical activity trials, but also for weight trials. Approximately 24% of the sample lost weight (at least 1 BMI unit) over the 12-month period, despite the lack of a calorie goal, weight loss problem solving, and behavioral weight control content. Thus, almost 1/4 of women in this trial were independently making changes to be successful at weight management without the benefit of direct education and skills provided within the context of behavioral weight loss. Therefore, it is essential to better understand the strategies and steps these women are employing to learn to extend to other individuals. Better understanding of the intermediate steps women take to lose and maintain weight over a 1-year period can help elucidate the critical mechanisms for successful weight loss and maintenance. </p><p>There also are implications for the design and content of both weight management and physical activity interventions. In particular, future interventions should continue to provide education and strategies for improving self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], particularly in the context of weight loss and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Such strategies include &#x0201c;modeling&#x0201d; or watching others perform the behavior, practicing and mastering the behavior in situations previously thought insurmountable, modifying and reinterpreting physiological states (e.g., aches/pains) to something positive (e.g., &#x0201c;I must be building muscle mass&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">69</xref>]. Additionally, while treating depression may be outside of the expertise of health promotion professionals, interventions can still provide tools for helping patients improve mood and manage distress. In particular, mindfulness-based approaches to diet and physical activity are promising adjuncts to traditional behavioral weight control interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p><p>With the high rates of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">73</xref>], there is emerging focus on the importance of understanding individual responses to physical activity and weight loss trials. This study sheds light on individual variables that may help explain why some people experience different long-term patterns of weight change. These variables also are important for understanding the mechanisms by which individuals maintain long-term weight losses. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings in physical activity intervention trials, as these trials provide a controlled way for understanding what individuals are doing outside of the context of weight loss trials, which is more reflective of the general population. The results from this study provide further evidence of the importance of continuing to refine our behavior change interventions to assure that they contain the most relevant content and theory-based skill building. By providing this information and skill building, the negative and psychological consequences of weight gain can potentially be averted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was supported by a Grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF#044224).
