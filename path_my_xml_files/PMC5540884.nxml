Hebb (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1949</xref>), for instance, argued that it was the interplay between networks of neurons that gave rise to mental activity. Further, deleterious change within neural cell assemblies drives many of the decrements often observed with aging (e.g., Berlingeri et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For example, age-related change in neural cells<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> means that older individuals must activate larger regions of these networks in order to accomplish the same task as a younger person. This additional recruitment results in slowing and the common finding that dynamic aspects of cognition are more impacted by age than more static functions (Salthouse, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p><p>If, however, these neural assemblies are the physical basis of cognition and its age-related change, then if follows that the physical factors involved in forming and maintaining those physical structures would, inevitably, influence the end-product itself. Such factors are often systemic. For example, interferon-Y, a component of the immune system, has recently been shown to regulate neural connectivity and social behavior in mice (Filiano et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Many neurotransmitters are synthesized within the gut, and the physical structure of the brain itself is dependent on dietary and immune factors originating in this distal tissue (Cryan and Dinan, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In an environment of high fat (some 60% by volume) and oxygen (25% respiratory intake), the brain must concentrate high levels of antioxidants (both dietary and endogenous, like superoxide dismutase) to prevent peroxidation (Chakrabarti et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). If antioxidants are missing in the diet, then higher levels of oxidative stress exist within the brain (Rao and Balachandran, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Over time, peroxidation of brain lipids likely results in losses such as the decrease in the quantity and integrity of white matter often seen with aging (Bennett and Madden, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), likely due to alterations in the lipid-rich axonal myelin.</p><p>Lutein, a dietary antioxidant, could help maintain brain structure by lowering chronic oxidative stress (Erdman et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The brain is also susceptible to damage due to chronic inflammation and L and Z are known to be potent anti-inflammatories (Kijlstra et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Such mechanisms, however, are largely prophylactic. It is reasonable to question then whether preventive measures are effective later in life. Is there value, for instance, in increasing dietary intake of food components thought to prevent loss after someone has likely already suffered many decades of loss?</p><p>We do know that older and diseased brains (and retinas) are under higher oxidative and inflammatory stress. Late stage intervention could possible lower such stressors helping to retard the cascade that ultimately accelerates the degenerative process (Hammond et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Joseph et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). We also know that older brains are still capable of some neurogenesis (especially within the hippocampus; Kempermann et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). If supplemental L, through diet or purified supplements, could both decrease age-related inflammatory and oxidative stress while simultaneously stimulating regenerative processes, supplementing L certainly could be a useful strategy. There is some, limited, data that are consistent with this possibility.</p><p>For instance, preliminary data suggests that, in younger individuals, supplementing L and Z increases systemic levels of brain-derived neural growth factor (Stringham et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) when compared to placebo. A number of clinical trials have shown, mostly in the young, that L and Z supplementation increases visual processing speed and reaction times (Bovier et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Bovier and Hammond, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Although there is no direct data on mechanism, it has been speculated (e.g., the neural efficiency hypothesis for L and Z) that this influence on processing speed is due to direct effects on brain connectivity (Renzi and Hammond, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), perhaps by enhancing gap junctions between neurons.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism, we do have empirical data on participants across the lifespan showing that L and Z supplementation has direct effects on improving cognition compared to placebos. Johnson et al., for instance, showed that L and Z, combined with DHA, improved verbal fluency, rate of learning and memory (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Later, this basic finding was repeated using avocados, rich in lutein and omega-fatty acids (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the current study, we extend these basic findings, also using a double-blinded placebo controlled design, to test both older men and women using only L and Z (separating it from the much larger literature on omega fatty acids and cognition).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 80 community dwelling older adults from the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia population were screened for enrollment between August 2012 and August 2014, with follow-up lasting through October 2015. This sample was part of a larger trial on xanthophyll supplementation and cognitive function. Inclusion criteria included good overall health; no xanthophyll supplementation within the 6-month period prior to study enrollment, with the exception of multivitamins that contained less than 1 mg L+Z/day; best corrected visual acuity of 20:40 or better (Snellen notation); no previous history of stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or any other neurological condition known to impair cognitive function, with the exception of affective disorders such as anxiety or depression; absence of gastric conditions known to impair absorption of nutritional supplements, such as gastric bypass or gastric ulcer. Inclusion criteria were verified as follows: all participants were given a medical examination by a qualified physician at the University of Georgia Health Center; self-reported health information was obtained; and all participants participated in a structured clinical interview, administered by qualified neuropsychological staff (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization process and intervention</title><p>Of the 80 participants that were screened for enrollment, a total of 62 participants met inclusion criteria and were randomized into one of two groups: the active supplement group, or the placebo group. Simple randomization was conducted by the clinical coordinator, who had no data collection responsibilities. A set of numerical codes was generated that corresponded with either the active supplement or the placebo. The codes were placed in an opaque envelope, and a unique code was drawn for each participant. Of the 62 participants who were randomized, 20 participants were randomized into the placebo group, and 42 participants were randomized into the active supplement group. In the placebo group, two were lost to follow-up (completed baseline but failed to attend subsequent testing sessions) and three were withdrawn due to non-compliance. In the intervention group, four were lost to follow-up and one was withdrawn.</p><p>The active supplement contained 10 mg L and 2 mg Z. The placebo was visually identical to the active supplement. Supplements and placebos (provided by DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) were contained in identical opaque, sealed bottles with labels that were visually identical, with the exception of the randomization code on the label, and contained instructions for one tablet to be taken from the bottle, daily, with a meal. Compliance to the intervention was monitored by bi-monthly telephone calls and pill counts from bottles returned by the participants during study visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline characteristics of the analyzable sample</title><p>Of the 62 participants who were randomized, a total of two participants from the placebo group and four participants from the active supplement group were lost to follow-up over the year of intervention. Three participants from the placebo group and 1 participant from the active supplement group were withdrawn by study personnel for either failure to maintain inclusion criteria, or because of non-compliance with the study regimen, determined by self-reported failure to take study supplements on a minimum of four of the compliance telephone calls.

Participants were initially recruited using newspaper advertising and print advertisements posted throughout the community. When participants contacted study personnel to express interest, a telephone screener was used to collect self-report data on past supplement use and a brief history of neurological and ocular disorders. If the participant passed the first eligibility screen, visits were scheduled with the University of Georgia Health Center for the medical examination, as well as the University of Georgia Neuropsychology and Memory Assessment Laboratory. If the study medical team confirmed eligibility, the participant progressed to the neuropsychological screen / clinical interview.</p><p>Participants were asked to bring a legally authorized representative to the interview, who could serve as a collateral source of information. In addition to baseline cognitive functional testing on the primary test battery (CNS Vital Signs; Morrisville, NC), participants and collaterals were given the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) as part of the larger interview (Morris, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Potential participants with CDR sum of boxes scores of 1.0 or higher were excluded from participation. Participants with sums of boxes equal to 0.5 (mild impairment, O'Bryant et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) were included in the study sample, in order to include participants with a wider range of baseline cognitive abilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Retinal L &#x000b1; Z levels</title><p>Retinal L+Z levels, as macular pigment optical density (MPOD) were measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic photometry (cHFP) (Wooten et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Stringham et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This procedure has been described previously (Vishwanathan et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and was modified slightly for this study. First, rather than the five trials per condition that are typically used to measure macular pigment, nine trials were completed both centrally, at 30-min of eccentricity along the horizontal meridian of the temporal retina, and parafoveally, at 7&#x000b0; of eccentricity. These trials were completed using a test stimulus that consisted of a waveband peaking at 460 nm (strongly absorbed by MP) that alternated in counterphase with a reference waveband peaking at 570 nm. Data collection was also limited to three skilled experimenters.</p><p>cHFP is the gold standard for measuring MPOD (Hammond et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and has been used previously in participants with poor ocular health (e.g., with cataract and age-related macular degeneration) (Ciulla et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Stringham et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), children (McCorkle et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and participants with mild cognitive impairment (Renzi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In order to further confirm reliability of cHFP in this sample, an additional five central trials and five parafoveal trials were conducted using a different test stimulus, which consisted of a waveband peaking at 490 nm that alternated in counterphase with the same 570 nm reference waveband. Past research using <italic>ex vivo</italic> absorption spectra (Snodderly et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> psychophysical methods (Snodderly et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Wooten and Hammond, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Stringham et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) for MP suggests that at 490 nm, absorbance is reduced by approximately half. Consequently, MPOD using the 490 nm test stimulus should be approximately half of the value at 460 nm if participants were successfully able to understand and complete the psychophysical task.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum L &#x000b1; Z levels</title><p>In addition to measuring retinal L+Z levels, which relate strongly to cortical L+Z levels in human subjects (Vishwanathan et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and are used as a biomarker of cortical L+Z in this and other studies (e.g., Feeney et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Renzi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vishwanathan et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), L and Z were also measured in serum via high-performance liquid chromatography. The methods used to acquire and analyze the serum in this study have been prevented previously (Lindbergh et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive function</title><p>Cognitive function was measured using a computerized test battery (CNS Vital Signs; Morrisville, NC) at four different time points: baseline, and after 4-, 8-, and 12-months of taking the study intervention. Participants were tested in a low distraction environment, in full ambient room lighting, in the presence of a trained research assistant who could answer questions about the test procedures should they arise. Each participant completed a practice session prior to each individual test.</p><p>Raw scores from individual functional tests taken during the test session were used to compute performance on the following larger cognitive domains: Verbal Memory (VeM), Visual Memory (ViM), Reasoning Ability (R), Executive Function (EF), Psychomotor Speed (PmS), Cognitive Flexibility (CF), and the Neurocognitive Index (NCI). For example, in order to gauge performance in CF, errors on the shifting attention test and commission errors on the Stroop task were subtracted from correct responses on the shifting attention test.

These plant pigments, long known for their effects on systemic and ocular health, have been identified in brain (Craft and Dorey, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Vishwanathan et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Accumulating evidence has shown that LZ may influence various aspects of brain function ranging from visual-motor to executive functions (e.g., Johnson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Feeney et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Bovier et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Renzi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vishwanathan et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). L and Z, being lipid-soluble, easily pass the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers and tend to deposit within central nervous system tissues with high specificity (e.g., in the retina, they concentrate toward the central macular region). Past study has shown that brain concentrations of L associate with higher cognitive test scores in the elderly (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) prompting the possibility that increasing intake could lead to benefit. Johnson et al., first in 2008 using purified supplements (Land DHA), and then again in 2011 using whole food (avocados), confirmed that such interventions could lead to improved cognitive function in older subjects (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the current study, we also found that, when compared to placebo, supplementing 10 mg of L and 2 mg of Z for one year led to statistically significant increases in complex attention and cognitive flexibility (with numerical increases, but not exceeding statistical criteria for significance, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.07, in executive function) in a sample of older adults.</p><p>In many respects, it is quite surprising that simple dietary change can lead to any improvements when considering such a homogeneous (Caucasian, upper middle-class), well-nourished and educated, group such as was sampled in our study. As with any dietary experiment, there were no true placebos, as the term is typically used in pharmaceutical studies: subjects have been exposed to the &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; all of their life (meaning that L is present in many normally consumed foods). Even during the intervention year, the control group maintained their normal diet which contains L and Z. Hence, any effect of L and Z on the treatment group would therefore have to be simply additive. Using this framing, the research question becomes: does adding LZ in supplement form to relatively well-nourished subjects with normal LZ intake improve cognition in a sample that was already well-educated? Education tends to attenuate any relation between diet and cognition (Akbaraly et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), mostly because more educated people tend to be well-fed (hence, our relatively high baseline MP levels) and dietary effects tend to be driven by deficiency (enhancement from normal is always much harder to achieve). The optimal sample for these studies are subjects who are less well fed, more diverse, less educated, etc. Similarly, an optimal intervention would likely include whole foods as opposed to supplements. Further, our study results, like many, are limited by convenience sampling/interventions which turns out to be, of course, of limited convenience when it comes to interpreting the actual real world effects of changing diet. Given these kind of limitations, the fact that L and Z did yield some benefit, especially when coupled with the results from other labs showing similar effects, suggests that L and Z do, in fact, have a positive effect on higher level functions of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Authors LR, BH, and LM contributed to research study design; LR, BH, LM, CL, and CM collected study data; MB served as clinical coordinator; LR, BH, and LM contributed to data analysis; LR and BH drafted the initial manuscript; LH, BH, and LM primarily edited the manuscript; LR, BH, LM, CL, CM, and MB assume responsibility for the final content of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Registry information</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02023645.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>During a portion of data collection, author LR was employed by Abbott Nutrition.
