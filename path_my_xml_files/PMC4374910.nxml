However, in 2010 there remained an estimated 174 million cases and 596,000 deaths due to malaria in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Universal coverage of the population at risk with long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and most malaria endemic countries in Africa (32/44) have adopted this policy [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Scaling up of indoor residual spraying (IRS) has been endorsed by WHO since 2006 in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The proportion of at risk populations protected by IRS in Africa has increased from less than 5% in 2005 to 11% in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In 2011, 30 (of 44) countries/areas in Africa with ongoing malaria transmission used both IRS and ITN in at least some areas to further reduce the malaria burden [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some studies have shown that it is beneficial to use IRS and ITNs in combination compared to using one method alone, [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but the evidence is inconsistent as other studies have shown no additional benefit [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Factors which might explain the differences in effect include: insecticide used for IRS, IRS coverage, duration between spray rounds, community ITN usage, background malaria transmission, seasonality, insecticide resistance and, confounding with other interventions such as improved diagnosis and treatment or intermittent preventative therapy [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To inform national and local planning on the advisability of using LLINs and IRS in combination, it is important to determine what factors may influence the effectiveness and hence cost-benefit of this approach.</p><p>Implementing both IRS and universal coverage of ITNs in the same geographical area could reduce malaria transmission by: 1) increasing the proportion of individuals protected by at least one intervention and 2) providing enhanced protection for individuals who are covered by both interventions compared to individuals protected by one method alone [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. How the combination exerts its effect on transmission could be investigated by determining if the addition of IRS is protective for net users or if the benefit of IRS is restricted to those not using ITNs. Observational studies in Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique and Kenya have demonstrated that individuals using ITNs and whose houses have been sprayed received greater protection than those with either method alone [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Reducing the proportion of those unprotected by either method was shown to be important in a mathematical model which showed that the benefit of a second intervention was greater if it is targeted at those that did not receive the first [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. If, as this suggests, the most important effect of using the combination of ITNs and IRS is reducing the percentage of the population that is unprotected, it could be argued that, it would be more cost-effective to increase the coverage of one intervention rather than adding a second. Recent WHO policy guidance recommends that a second vector control intervention should not be added to an existing one merely to compensate for inadequate coverage of the first [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However reaching high coverage with one intervention may not always be possible.</p><p>Tanzania has a high malaria disease burden with over ten million suspected cases reported in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

This was a secondary analysis of data from a cluster randomised trial (CRT) in north-west Tanzania that showed that there was strong additional protection provided by IRS in an area that had benefited from a recent UCC and reached moderate ITN usage (primary analysis of the CRT [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0115661.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Study Protocol</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115661.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Study Protocol</xref>, and <xref rid="pone.0115661.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study area has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In summary, it includes 68,346 households from 109 rural villages in Muleba district (1&#x000b0; 45&#x02019; S 31&#x000b0; 40&#x02019; E), Kagera region, Tanzania, at an altitude ranging from 1100 to 1600m above sea level [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The two rainy seasons are the &#x0201c;short rains&#x0201d; in October-December with an average monthly rainfall of 160mm and the &#x0201c;long rains&#x0201d; in March-May with an average monthly rainfall of 300mm [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The evidence from this study is that ITNs were providing individual protection against malaria, even in this area with high levels of pyrethroid resistance [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; the supplementary benefit of IRS was therefore not because ITNs were ineffective.</p><p>IRS effectiveness did not vary with background malaria transmission within the study area; <italic>Pf</italic>PR in the clusters varied from 1.3% to 60.8% at baseline (mean cluster <italic>Pf</italic>PR from two baseline surveys). This suggests that a benefit would be gained from using IRS in addition to nets in both low and high transmission areas. There is evidence from non-randomised studies that the combination of IRS and ITNs provides greater protection than using only one alone in high transmission areas such as Kenya and Equatorial Guinea [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Observational studies in Eritrea and Ethiopia, where malaria endemicity is low, showed that both IRS and ITN use were independently effective when used in the same area [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>There was no evidence in the current study that the additional benefit of IRS varied with individual or community ITN usage. However, in this study it could be argued that the &#x0201c;high ITN usage&#x0201d; clusters were actually only &#x0201c;moderate usage&#x0201d; because the median value in the category was 55% and the maximum was 69.5%. Further work is needed to determine if IRS would still enhance protection against malaria if ITN usage was very high.</p><p>In this study the consistency of the protective effect of IRS suggests that individual net use, and differences in community net usage or background malaria transmission, of the scale seen within this study, may not be important in determining why the combination has been shown to be more effective than one intervention alone in some studies but not in others [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However there are some limitations to the analysis presented here. One obvious limitation is the lack of statistical power to detect interactions because this was not taken into account in sample size calculations for the trial [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A second is that intervention coverage levels and malaria transmission levels investigated were limited to those present within the study area. A third is that the effect of confounding cannot be ruled out as the factors investigated were not randomly allocated (e.g. community net usage). These limitations mean that the levels of community net use and malaria transmission intensity cannot be ruled out as possible determinants for whether the combination of IRS and ITNs provides enhanced protection against malaria. There are other factors that may determine the effectiveness of the combination that could not be investigated in this study, these include: insecticide type, spray interval and the primary malaria vector. The effect of IRS in this study would have been optimised by the short interval between spray rounds of only four months. The residual efficacy of bendiocarb is reported as two to six months [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The spraying was timed to provide protection during the two annual peaks in malaria transmission but this meant that the interval was shorter than is usual practice. A CRT in Benin, that also compared bendiocarb-IRS and ITNs to ITNs alone, found no difference in malaria incidence between these two groups, but the spray interval was 8 months [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Accounting for differences in malaria transmission at baseline, individual net use, age, and household poverty did not change the odds ratio for <italic>Pf</italic>PR in sprayed villages compared to unsprayed villages. This suggests that the two study arms were well balanced in terms of these risk factors for malaria. The precision of the estimate was greater after adjusting for these factors (p-value reduced from 0.04 to &#x0003c;0.0001) due to the heterogeneity between clusters in this study area.</p><p>The majority of villages in the study area had high IRS coverage. IRS was effective in villages with coverage of &#x0003c;90% (median coverage 81%) and there was weak evidence that the effect of IRS was greater in villages with at least 90% coverage. Rehman et al [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that IRS was not protective when spray coverage was &#x0003c;80% (50 and 79.9%) in Equatorial Guinea. The &#x0201c;low coverage&#x0201d; group in the current study was defined as spray coverage of &#x0003c;90% and the distribution was skewed towards higher coverage with 16 out of the 23 (70%) clusters having spray coverage of at least 80%. Therefore the &#x0201c;low coverage&#x0201d; groups in the two studies are not comparable. The higher cut-off of 90% coverage was required in this study due to the overall high spray coverage and thus the small number of clusters with coverage below 80%.</p><p>IRS primarily reduces malaria transmission at the community-level by reducing mosquito longevity and abundance, but it has also been reported to provide household-level protection [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study there was evidence that living in a sprayed household (direct-effect) was associated with a reduction in odds of <italic>Pf</italic> infection regardless of community spray coverage. Although bendiocarb has been reported as having low irritancy and excito-repellency, some studies have reported reduced house entry, endophily and endophagy due to bendiocarb-IRS [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An alternative explanation is that the association between household spray status and <italic>Pf</italic>PR was confounded by other factors. Firstly, a sprayed household could be more likely to be surrounded by sprayed households and thus the apparent household-level protection could be a community-level effect of IRS on a smaller scale than the cluster. Secondly, households in remote locations are often poor quality with easy mosquito entry, and these households may be less likely to be sprayed. This second potential confounder was accounted for to some extent by including household SES in the model and there was no evidence to suggest that SES confounded the relationship between <italic>Pf</italic>PR and household IRS.</p><p>The effectiveness of ITNs for preventing malaria is well established [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] but the epidemiological impact of insecticide resistance on the protectiveness of ITNs is currently unknown [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite a high level of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors in this area [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] individuals who reported using ITNs were protected from <italic>Pf</italic> infection. The reduction in odds of almost one fifth (OR = 0.83) is similar to the estimated protective efficacy of 13% against parasite prevalence in stable transmission areas in the Cochrane review of ITNs [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The effectiveness of ITNs was the same in areas with and without IRS, and was not affected by IRS coverage. Non-randomised studies in Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, Kenya and Mozambique also showed a reduced risk of malaria infection in those protected by both IRS and ITNs compared to IRS alone [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The protection provided by IRS in this study appeared to be substantially greater than that provided by ITNs (adjusted ORs 0.41 versus 0.83). Although the protective effect of ITNs in this study was similar to the effectiveness calculated in a meta-analysis of studies from stable malaria transmission areas [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it could have been underestimated or suboptimal for the following reasons. Firstly, compliers were compared to non-compliers which means that the community protection provided by ITNs would not be included in this estimate and that there could be confounding because ITN use was not randomly allocated. Secondly, there were relatively low levels of ITN use in this study, suggesting that the community protection provided by the ITNs would have been suboptimal [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The high level of pyrethroid resistance may also have compromised the protective effect of the ITNs if the mortality rate due to the insecticide was reduced. There was no evidence for a community-level effect of ITN use when low coverage areas were compared to moderate coverage areas, but the study lacked power for detecting community protection, since nets were distributed in all areas.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis suggests that the addition of IRS in an area already using ITNs is beneficial in villages with high or moderate malaria transmission, and with low or moderate community net usage. More research is needed to confirm these results at high levels of ITN use, but it is difficult to design trials with the primary objective of investigating whether intervention coverage or malaria transmission intensity modify the effectiveness of the combination of IRS and ITNs. IRS was additionally beneficial to ITN users. This study demonstrated that ITNs are beneficial in this area, even when used in combination with high coverage IRS, and with high levels of pyrethroid resistance. Children receiving both interventions were more protected than those with ITNS alone. Although both IRS and ITNs have been shown to be cost effective, studies are needed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the combination [<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Based on current evidence the use of IRS with bendiocarb and combined with ITNs, is beneficial in a wide range of settings, compared to implementing either of these interventions alone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115661.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0115661.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115661.s002"><label>S1 Study Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0115661.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115661.s003"><label>S2 Study Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol addendum.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0115661.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their sincere thanks to the fieldworkers, clinical teams, and all the PAMVERC staff at Muleba and Moshi for their hard work collecting the data.
