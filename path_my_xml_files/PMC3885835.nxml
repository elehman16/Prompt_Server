on pain, disability, and thickness of the transverse abdominis and multifidus muscles in
patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain. [Subjects] Thirty patients were randomly
assigned into two groups: the McKenzie and stabilization exercise groups. [Methods] Before
and after intervention, pain, disability, and thickness of the transverse abdominis and
multifidus muscles were evaluated by visual analogue scale, functional rating index, and
sonography, respectively. The training program was 18 scheduled sessions of individual
training for both groups. [Results] After interventions, the pain score decreased in both
groups. The disability score decreased only in the stabilization group. The thickness of
the left multifidus was significantly increased during resting and contracting states in
the stabilization group. The thickness of the right transverse abdominis during the
abdominal draw-in maneuver, and thickness of the left transverse abdominis during the
active straight leg raising maneuver were significantly increased in the stabilization
group. The intensity of pain, disability score, thickness of the right transverse
abdominis during the abdominal draw-in manouver, and thickness of the left transverse
abdominis during active straight leg raising in the stabilization group were greater than
those on the Mackenzie. [Conclusion] Stabilization exercises are more effective than
McKenzie exercises in improving the intensity of pain and function score and in increasing
the thickness of the transverse abdominis muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Stabilizaton exercises</kwd><kwd>Muscle thickness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lack of spinal core stability is supposed to be one of the important predisposing causes of
recurrent low back pain (LBP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a
result, more attention has been paid to training of localized spinal stabilizer muscles in
subjects with LBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is believed that
specific stabilization exercises lead to changes in motor programing of the automatic
feed-forward recruitment of deep core muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, stabilization exercises were suggested for chronic low
back pain (CLBP) patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that the use of stabilization exercises can improve the
multifidus (MF) muscle size in acute LBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, few studies have reported the impacts of stabilization exercises on the size and
function of stabilizer muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study reported that the stabilization exercises led to
an increase in the thickness of the stabilizer muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study showed borderline changes in contracting thickness of
the TrA muscle following application of stabilization exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, there is a lack of sufficient objective
evidence about the effects of stabilization exercises on the thickness of the stabilizer
muscles, especially thickness when contracted. Another approach is the McKenzie method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This approach is focused on sustained
postures or repeated movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although McKenzie exercises could improve pain intensity in acute low back pain, subacute
low back pain and CLBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, no study with
regard to the effect of McKenzie exercises on the thickness of the stabilizer muscles in
CLBP was found in a review of the literature.</p><p>As mentioned above, this study was carried out to determine and compare the effectiveness
of stabilization and McKenzie exercises on pain, disability and TrA and MF muscle thickness
in resting and contracting states in patients with nonspecific CLBP. It was hypothesized
that stabilization exercises would increase the thickness of TrA and MF muscles and that
McKenzie exercises would not have any effects on the thickening of the TrA and MF
muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this single randomized controlled trial study, the participants were selected through a
simple non-probability sampling method and were randomly divided into two equal groups using
sequences of random numbers. The first group (n=15) performed stabilization exercises, and
the second group (n=15) performed McKenzie exercises. The examiner who assessed the outcomes
was blinded to group assignment. The training program consisted of 18 sessions of supervised
individual training for both groups, with the sessions performed 3 times per week for 6
weeks. Each training session lasted an hour and was performed at the Physiotherapy Clinic in
the School of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, between
2011 and 2012. Outcomes were measured in both groups before and after treatments. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All
patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study.</p><p>Thirty patients with nonspecific CLBP participated in this study on the basis of a clinical
examination performed by a physician and the following inclusion criteria: age between 18&#x02013;50
years, CLBP in the area between the costal margin and buttocks, with or without reference to
the lower extremity (no radicular pain) that lasted more than 3 months. Patients were
excluded if they had a history of recent fracture, trauma or previous surgery in the lumbar
region; had spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, neurological disorders,
systemic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diseases; were pregnant; were receiving
concomitant treatment, with physical therapy modalities; or were receiving other therapies
simultaneously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After referral by a specialist, patients were reviewed based on the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. Then demographic characteristics including age, sex, height, and weight were
collected using a questionnaire. The pain history including the onset, location, and
duration was recorded. Prior to and following the intervention, we measured pain,
disability, and TrA and MF muscle thickness at rest and during contraction by visual
analogue scale (VAS), Functional Rating Index (FRI) questionnaire, and ultrasound imaging,
respectively.</p><p>The VAS was used for pain assessment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In this scale, pain was rated from 0 to 100&#x02005;mm, in which the 0 represented no pain and 100
represented maximum pain tolerance. Subjects were asked to mark the best number indicating
their pain. The data were then recorded in the questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Disability was evaluated through the Persian version of the FRI questionnaire. The
questionnaire served as a tool specifically designed for quantifying mental comprehension of
function and spinal pain in the clinical conditions. The reliability and validity of the
questionnaire have already been demonstrated in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The questionnaire has 10 sections, and each section was
rated using the same 5-point scale. Patients scored their existing disability by choosing
one of the grades (the grades ranged from 0 to 4, grade 0 meant without pain and able to
complete the respective function, and grade 4 meant the maximum pain and inability to
perform the functions). The overall score was calculated by the sum of the scores of all
sections and was expressed by a percentage between 0 (no disability) and 100 (severe
disability).</p><p>Ultrasound imaging is a reliable and reproducible method for evaluation of muscle
structure, function, and activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
method allows assessment of muscle activity by measuring changes in muscle geometry during
contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, there was
high intra-tester reliability for the ultrasound measurements of the MF and TrA muscle
thicknesses at rest and during contraction (ICCs= 0.87 to 0.96). To measure the thicknesses
of the MF and TrA muscles, a B-mode ultrasound apparatus (MyLab 50 XVision, ESAOTE S.p.A,
Genova Italy) was used. Measurement of the thicknesses of the TrA and MF muscles was
performed in a resting position and during the tasks with submaximal muscle contraction on
both sides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. To record the thicknesses
of the TrA and MF muscles, we used an LA523 linear probe (set to 12&#x02005;MHz) and a CA431 convex
array probe (set to 7.5&#x02005;MHz). In order to measure TrA muscle thickness, the subjects were
set in crook-lying position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
ultrasound probe was placed midway between the iliac crest and costal margin, on the
midaxillary line, about 10&#x02005;cm off the midline of body at the level of umbilicus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. TrA muscle thickness was measured in
millimeters between the fascial lines, one centimeter away from the muscle junction in the
direction of the thoracolumbar fascia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The two submaximal tasks were performed for the TrA muscle, the abdominal draw-in maneuver
(ADIM) and active straight leg raising (ASLR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. MF muscle thickness measurements were performed in the prone
position with a pillow under the abdomen. The probe was placed along the spine, such that
the midpoint of the probe was in line with the spinous process of the fourth lumbar
vertebra. Then it was moved so that the facet joint between the fourth and fifth lumbar
vertebrae was visible. This point is located directly on the MF muscle. The muscle thickness
was measured from this point to the plane between the subcutaneous tissue and muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The submaximal task for this muscle was
elevation of the contralateral arm in a prone position with a small weight (0.5&#x02005;kg) on the
arm, the elbow at a right angle, and the glenohumeral joint at 120 degrees of abduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For warming up and before performing specific exercises, participants pedaled a stationary
bike for 5 minutes and then did stretching exercises for 10 minutes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization exercises were divided into 6 levels from
easy to difficult. At the end of each training level, participants performed each exercise
ten times for ten seconds with low intensity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the treatment session, between 80
and 100 repetitions of the selected exercises were carried out in the McKenzie group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The stabilization exercises were performed in 6 steps: 1) Segmental Control Exercises (SCE)
with emphasis on training the of isolated contraction of the TrA, MF, and pelvic floor
muscles; 2) SCE with emphasis on co-contractions of the TrA, MF, and pelvic floor muscles in
the prone, supine, and four-point kneeling positions; 3) closed kinematic chain SCE; 4)
development of SCE into the low load apply by adding leverage of the limbs during open chain
exercises; 5) development of SCE in functional situations; and 6) co-contraction of theTrA
and MF muscles during application of an external load, complication of movements, increased
load with the lumbar spine in the correct position, addition of a co-contraction pattern to
light aerobic activities such as walking, and activities that have already exacerebated the
symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the Mckenzie group, 6 exercises were used: four extension-type exercises and two
flexion-type and two flexion-type exercises. The extension-type exercises were performed in
prone and standing positions, and the flexion-type exercises were performed in the supine
and sitting positions. The final position of each exercise was maintained for 10
seconds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The data were collected over 10 months and were analyzed using SPSS version 17. They were
tested for a normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The independent samples t-test was
used for comparing the Mckenzie and stabilization groups. The paired-t test was used to
compare variables before and after training in each group. Statistical significance for all
tests was accepted below the 0.05 level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic variables had a normal distribution. No significant difference was observed

and Mckenzie exercises. Disability decreased only after the application of stabilization
exercises. The results indicated that the effect of stabilization exercises on pain and
disability was greater than Mckenzie exercises in CLBP. Also, stabilization exercises were
effective in increasing the resting thickness of the left TrA muscle, the thickness of the
right TrA muscle during ADIM, the thickness of the left TrA muscle during active SLR,
thickness of the left MF muscle when contracted. Comparison of the effects between the two
methods of exercises on muscle thickness showed that stabilization exercises were more
effective than Mckenzie exercises in increasing the thickness of the right TrA muscle during
ADIM, and the thickness of left TrA muscle during ASLR.</p><p>Despite the borderline changes that occurred in the thickness of the TrA muscle when
contracted in Vasseljen and Fladmark&#x02019;s study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, in the present study, the thicknesses of the TrA and MF muscles
when contracted increased in some of the outcomes. In our study, the exercise types were
different from those used in Vasseljen and Fladmark&#x02019;s study. The results of this study
regarding the changes in resting thickness of the TrA muscles following application of
stabilization exercises were consistent with the study by Akbari et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. They showed an increase in resting thickness of the TrA and
MF muscles following the application of stabilization exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the resting thickness of the left TrA
increased.</p><p>Accordingly, depending on the purpose of exercise applications, effects of exercises on the
muscles can lead to hypertrophy or neuromuscular adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the emphasis placed on low-level contraction and isolation of
the TrA muscles during stabilization exercises, it is expected that most of the effects of
stabilization exercises are related to neuromuscular adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, muscle hypertrophy typically occurs after 8 to 12
weeks of intensive strengthening exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, we proposed that the short duration
of the present study and effects of neuromuscular adaptation led to changes in some of the
outcomes.</p><p>The findings of this study are consistent with the findings of previous studies in terms of
improvement in pain and function following the application of stabilization exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, stabilization exercises were found
to be superior to McKenzie exercises in our study, as shown by the decreases in pain and
disability, which is consistent with the results of other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although
stabilization exercises are the most important methods in rehabilitation of LBP disorders
and in prophylaxis, the exact biological basis for the efficacy of stabilization exercises
in LBP patients is not clear yet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to describe the effects of stabilization exercises on
pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. These mechanisms include
reduction of load and improvement in the quality of movements following improvement in
co-ordination of trunk muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the stabilization exercises targeted the main deep muscle affected by LBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, deep muscle stabilizer muscles could influence by
stabilization exercises in LBP patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a change in muscle thickness was only seen after
stabilization exercises.</p><p>Considering the above mentioned points, pain reduction in the Mckenzie group might have
occurred due to other causes without changes in the thickness of abdominal and MF muscles.
This approach was focused on sustained postures or repeated movements, and pain reduction
migth have been due to postural correction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, both types of exercises reduced pain in patients with nonspecific CLBP.
Disability was reduced only in stabilization group. Also, stabilization exercises were
effective in increasing the resting thickness of theleft TrA muscle, thickness of the right
TrA muscle during ADIM, thickness of the left TrA muscle during ASLR, and thickness of the
left MF muscle when contracted. Stabilization exercises were more effective than Mckenzie
exercises in reducing pain and disability, increasing the right TrA muscle thickness during
ADIM, and increasing the left TrA muscle thickness during ASLR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded and supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Grant No:
