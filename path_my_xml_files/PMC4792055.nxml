Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) is one example of a contemporary approach that found to be conservative and advantageous for management of carious lesions in young children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In contrast to the traditional approaches of complete caries removal, ART removes only infected dentin and allows the affected dentin to get remineralized.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The primary goal of ART intervention in both primary and permanent dentitions is to induce self-repair to arrest the caries process and thus maintain the pulp vitality.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Earlier studies have shown that caries process is not perpetuated in remaining affected dentin at the base of the cavity due to the absence of the substrate.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>However, clinical trials with long-term follow-up demonstrated cariogenic microorganisms persist under restorations and have an important role in the development of secondary caries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] To reduce the potential for residual caries, the use of an antibacterial agent was found to be beneficial in disinfection of dentin before restoring the cavity. Chlorhexidine (CHX) 2% has been in the use for this purpose and found to be effective in reducing cariogenic microflora residing in the remaining dental tissues.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Studies have also reported fluorides at high concentrations (&#x0003e;3040 ppm) had a potent bactericidal effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Recently, there has been a growing trend to seek natural remedies as part of medical and dental therapeutics, which has been termed as &#x0201c;phytotherapeutics&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;ethnopharmacology.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Propolis, a resinous wax-like substance extracted from bee-hive is gaining importance for its antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to these properties, it has a wide range of applications in the field of medicine. In dentistry, it has been tried as root canal disinfectant,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] direct pulp capping agent,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] mouth rinse,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in managing periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] These findings indicate Propolis can be tested as a cavity disinfectant.</p><p>A breakthrough for dental Laser systems came in the mid 1990s. Diode Laser systems quickly began establishing themselves as compact, competitively priced, and versatile additions to the dentist's repertoire.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Diode Laser can be used for a multitude of dental procedures, predominantly soft tissue procedures such as pulpotomy, frenectomy, gingivectomy,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and some hard tissue procedures such as root canal disinfection and tooth whitening.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Application of diode Laser in root canal disinfection showed promising results in effectively reducing the microbial load in infected root canals than that of chemical disinfectants.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Because of its effective use in root canal disinfection and no availability of reports till date in regard to cavity disinfection, it has been tested in this study. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate and compare the cavity disinfection efficacy of APF gel, Propolis, Diode Laser, and 2% CHX in primary teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, single blinded, parallel grouped, active controlled trial approved by the Institutional Review Board (VDC/RP/2012&#x02013;63) and included 80 primary molars from 68 children attending the outpatient clinic of Department of Pedodontics from August 2013 to April 2014. A pilot study was conducted to check the feasibility and to obtain the sample size for the main study. Based on observations of the pilot study, a sample size of 20 was determined for each group. A letter providing all the information of the study was given to the parent/guardian, and they were considered after receiving the written consent.

Thus, thorough removal of the infected dentin has a direct influence and impact on the clinical success of the restoration.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The caries treatment procedures widely practiced currently does not eliminate all the microorganisms in the residual dental tissues.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Cavity disinfection is an adjunctive approach to reduce the bacteria in the residual dental tissues left after cavity preparation.</p><p>It is well-known that <italic>S. mutans</italic> and LB were the principal colonizers that are capable of producing dental caries in experimental animals and humans.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In this study, APF gel, Propolis, Diode Laser, and 2% CHX were tested against these cariogenic bacteria. A culture-dependent approach was used in this study as it is considered to be one of the most reliable methods for detecting the viable bacteria, particularly when samples were taken immediately after the antimicrobial treatment. Therefore, MS, LB, and TVC were evaluated from the samples that are collected before and after cavity disinfection with the test agents, and it demonstrated a significant bacterial count reduction in all the groups.</p><p>With the use of APF gel, greater percentage reduction of TVC was observed when compared to MS and LB counts, suggesting APF gel was more effective against facultative anaerobes than the principal cariogenic microorganisms. The probable mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of fluorides include fluoride increases the acquisition of protons by the cells and results in a reduction in tolerance of the oral bacteria to grow and metabolize in acidic environment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The other mechanism is by inhibition of glycolysis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Fluoride exerts this inhibitory effect by interfering with the uptake and degradation of polysaccharides by the bacterial cells and also by reducing the ability of the cell to maintain the homeostasis. Fluoride also interferes with the enzyme systems, namely, enolase and active proton transport ATPase systems regulating the metabolic activity of saccharolytic microorganisms. This results in significant reduction in the metabolic activity of the saccharolytic microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Fluorides also have an advantage of remineralizing the affected dentin. However, on the overall comparison, APF gel was found to be least effective in cavity disinfection among the agents tested.</p><p>Various studies have demonstrated the bactericidal effects of Propolis against <italic>S. mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This study showed that Propolis is also effective against LB and other cariogenic microorganisms. It was also observed that greater percentage of reductions in TVC, MS, and LB counts with Propolis when compared to 2% CHX (active control) in this study. The antimicrobial properties of Propolis were attributed to the flavonoids, phenolics, and various aromatic compounds. Flavonoids have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids including galangin, Pinocembrin, and pinostrobin are known as effective flavonoids against bacteria. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid present in the Propolis also contribute to the bactericidal action.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The cavity disinfection with Diode Laser was found to be superior when compared to the other groups. The reduction of TVC, MS, and LB counts with the use of Laser was about 99.27%, 99.49%, and 99.1%, respectively, almost an absolute reduction. It was also observed that Diode Laser was equally effective against <italic>S. mutans</italic> and LB and other facultative anaerobes. The principle mechanisms involved in antibacterial activity of diode Laser include the thermal and photodisruptive effects.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It causes lethal damage to cells including the destruction of cell wall integrity and possibly denaturation of proteins. The damage of the cell wall ceases the cell growth and successive cell lysis. At the same time, cell proteins are highly sensitive to the thermal changes leading to denaturation of proteins and cell death. Laser also causes expansion of intratubular water and collapse of water vapor as deep as possible, which is capable of producing an acoustic wave strong enough to disrupt the intratubular bacteria.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The higher reductions in microbial counts can also be attributed to the greater depth of penetration of Laser radiation about 1 mm deep into the dentin, surpassing the effect range of chemical disinfectants.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The conventional 2% CHX was considered as active control since it is commercially available for cavity disinfection. The observations of this study confirmed that 2% CHX was more effective than APF gel. However, it showed a less cavity disinfection ability when compared with the Diode Laser and Propolis. The disinfectant efficiency of CHX depends on the mechanism of adsorption onto the cell wall of microorganisms, causing leakage of intracellular components. At low concentrations, CHX has a bacteriostatic effect causing leakage of the small molecular weight substances from microorganisms. At higher concentrations, CHX has a bactericidal effect due to the cytoplasmic precipitation and/or coagulation that probably caused by protein cross-linkage. Furthermore, the cationic properties of the CHX enable their adsorption by dentin surface, making CHX molecules penetrate deeper inside the dentinal tubules and elongating its residual antimicrobial activity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated the importance of cavity disinfection in reducing the bacteria in residual dental tissues. The superior results obtained with Diode Laser suggest it as highly effective for cavity disinfection. It was also observed that both Diode Laser and Brazilian Propolis are equally effective as 2% CHX for cavity disinfection.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and
