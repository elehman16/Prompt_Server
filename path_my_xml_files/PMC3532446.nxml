It has been estimated that as many as 21% of US citizens have accessed online information about depression, anxiety, stress or mental health issues <xref rid="pone.0053244-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This high level of mental health information seeking on the Internet is not surprising given the prevalence of mental disorder in the community <xref rid="pone.0053244-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the fact that depression is the leading cause of years lost to disability globally <xref rid="pone.0053244-World1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the evidence that health information seeking on the Internet is higher among those with stigmatised health conditions <xref rid="pone.0053244-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>However, Internet usage for depression is not limited to information seeking. Recent systematic reviews have concluded that guided and unguided online psychotherapy applications are effective for preventing and treating depression <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053244-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Further, the evidence-based UK NICE guidelines for depression recommend that people with mild depression be offered access to computerised cognitive behaviour therapy <xref rid="pone.0053244-National1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Less is known about another emerging forms of online self help: Internet support groups (ISGs) from which members of the public seek information and support from others with a similar condition. An estimated 28% of US Internet users access such groups <xref rid="pone.0053244-Horrigan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and there is evidence that ISGs are particularly popular among consumers with depression <xref rid="pone.0053244-Davison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, a systematic review <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and follow-up searches failed to yield any randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of ISGs for depression. On the other hand, there is promising evidence of the effectiveness of conventional mutual support, with a recent systematic review of studies of <italic>face</italic>-to-<italic>face</italic> support groups for depression concluding that mutual support was more effective than treatment as usual and that there was no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of support groups and cognitive behaviour therapy <xref rid="pone.0053244-Pfeiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since ISGs have the potential to increase the accessibility of mutual support there is a need to determine if they, too, are effective. Such groups might also serve a second role. Online psychotherapeutic interventions are often characterised by a high attrition rate <xref rid="pone.0053244-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It has been suggested that social support might increase adherence to medical treatments <xref rid="pone.0053244-DiMatteo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. If this is the case, an online peer-to-peer support group might facilitate adherence to an automated online psychotherapy intervention through mutual encouragement. To date however, the effect of an adjunct support group on intervention adherence and health outcomes has not been examined.</p><p>The current study therefore sought to evaluate the efficacy of and adherence to a depression Internet Support Group (ISG), an automated psychoeducational and skills Internet training program (ITP), and the ITP combined with an ISG relative to each other and a plausible Internet Attention Control condition (IAC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053244.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053244.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. Since the WellBeing trial protocol has been published in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the current paper contains only a brief description of the methods employed. Participants with elevated levels of depressive symptoms were randomised to receive one of four conditions: the ISG, the ITP, a combination of the ISG and the ITP, or a plausible Internet-based Control intervention. Assessments were undertaken at baseline, at post-intervention (end-point), and at 6- and 12- month follow up. The trial was approved by The Australian National University Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol 2007/2259) and registered with the Controlled Clinical Trials registry (ISRCTN65657330).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participant recruitment and setting</title><p>Participants comprised 311 adults aged 18 to 65 years recruited in three waves between August 2008 and May 2009 via a screening survey posted to 70,000 adults randomly selected from the electoral rolls of eight Australian electoral divisions (4 rural, 4 metropolitan) with moderate to high Internet access. To be included in the intervention study, respondents were required to have obtained a Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) <xref rid="pone.0053244-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> score of more than 22, to have home or work access to the Internet and to consent to participating in the study. Those receiving treatment from a mental health professional or CBT or who were participating in a mutual support group or another research project at the lead investigator's research centre at the time of recruitment were excluded. Potential participants were also excluded if they self-reported current or past experience with or diagnosis of psychosis, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</p><p>Randomisation to one of the four trial conditions was undertaken following verbal consent on the telephone prior to the return of written consent <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. At this point neither the participant, nor the interviewer nor the project coordinator was aware of the participant's randomisation status. Accordingly, dropout at this stage could not have been influenced by the condition to which the participant was randomised. Those participants who returned informed consent forms were sent a letter advising them of the condition to which they had been randomised together with a user guide to the trial and their intervention. Baseline data were collected thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Interventions</title><p>Each of the three interventions and the Control program comprised 12 modules, one module delivered per week over a 12 week period. Once opened, these programs remained accessible to participants during the trial and 12 month follow-up period. For ethical reasons, participants in the control condition were provided with access to the ITP after the 6-month follow-up assessment. The ITP, ISG and IAC conditions employed the e-couch, WellBeing Board and HealthWatch websites respectively. The content of each intervention website is summarised below and described in detail in the WellBeing protocol paper <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>ITP: E-couch (depression stream)</title><p>The ITP comprised a research version of the depression stream of e-couch, an automated online psychological intervention application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecouch.anu.edu.au">http://ecouch.anu.edu.au</ext-link>). The intervention consisted of (i) a depression literacy module containing consumer information about the diagnosis, epidemiology and treatment of depression; and (ii) a self help module comprised of online versions of cognitive behaviour therapy; interpersonal therapy; applied relaxation; and physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>ISG: WellBeing Board</title><p>The ISG was a closed, moderated bulletin board purpose built for the trial. The structure and rules for the board were based on our public depression forum BlueBoard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blueboard.anu.edu.au">http://blueboard.anu.edu.au</ext-link>). Each week one or two new forums or topics were introduced to one of the three main WellBeing Board categories: Your WellBeing, Feeling Better, or General <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Participants were asked to login to the board at least twice weekly to read new messages posted by other members of the ISG and to contribute at least four posts to the board weekly on the current topic or past week's topics or other issues. The Board rules were displayed at first registration and were available at all times on the Board home page; they were also printed in the user manual. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref> of suicide, self harm and other traumatic topics was not permitted. To preserve their anonymity, participants were asked to employ a pseudonym and to avoid posting material that would identify them. In addition, links and email addresses were filtered out of posts and signatures using an automated script.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>ISG+ITP: WellBeing Board plus e-couch</title><p>This condition involved the simultaneous delivery of e-couch (ITP) and a dedicated WellBeing Board (ISG) over the 12 week intervention period. To prevent contamination between the ISG only and the ISG+ITP conditions, separate ISGs were established for the two conditions. The ISG for the combined condition incorporated an additional forum that enabled participants to discuss their experiences with the ITP e-couch condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>IAC: HealthWatch</title><p>The control condition was purpose-built for the current study <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It comprised 12 online modules each of which comprised two components (i) forced-choice and open-ended questions; and (ii) health information. The first component comprised a series of questions on a topic which was potentially related to depression and wellbeing such as nutrition, or social and family relationships or humour. For example, the online questions on humour (Week 11) commenced: &#x0201c;Some people believe that humour and laughter can prevent depression and increase the enjoyment of life. Today we would like to ask you to think about humour and whether it is important to your mood&#x0201d;. Examples of the accompanying questions were: &#x0201c;Do you enjoy telling jokes?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;How often do you tell jokes?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;What is the funniest joke you can remember?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Overall do you think your moods are affected by humour?&#x0201d; The second component consisted of information on topics related to wellbeing but containing minimal information about interventions for depression or stress <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Examples of topics included environmental health, nutrition myths and medicine in the home. Material for component (i) of the modules was modified and extended from questions employed in a 5-module telephone tracking Control condition in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0053244-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Material for component (ii) was modified from public domain health material published by authoritative US government health sources. Each week participants were asked to login to HealthWatch and complete the questions and read the material in the current HealthWatch module.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants who supplied their written consent for participation in the study were provided with a user ID and password via automated email. One week prior to commencement of the intervention these participants were prompted via another automated email to complete the online baseline survey. Thereafter participants in each of the four conditions received a weekly automated email informing them of the availability of their next module. A reminder email was sent 4 days after the initial email if the participant failed to login to the weekly module. Participants who still failed to log in received a telephone reminder to do so from their assigned project interviewer in the following week. The current week's module could only be accessed once all modules assigned in the preceding weeks had been completed. At the end of the trial, participants were advised by automated email to complete an online post intervention survey. Further emails were sent 6 and 12 months after the commencement of the intervention requesting that the participants complete follow-up online surveys.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Participants were randomised using a stratified block design procedure to the four conditions by the trial biostatistician (AM) who was not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the trial. Stratification variables were level of psychological distress (high/low distress level on K10), gender (male/female, unspecified), age, and location of residence (metropolitan/rural). Randomisation sequences with a fixed block size of four were generated for each strata using the Randomisation.com website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D <xref rid="pone.0053244-Radloff1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>), a 20-item self-report scale used to measure change in the severity of <italic>depressive symptoms</italic>. The CES-D has previously been demonstrated to have good psychometric properties <xref rid="pone.0053244-Radloff1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053244-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the current study, the internal reliability of the CES-D at baseline was 0.74 (Cronbach's alpha) and the 14 week test-retest reliability in the Control group (baseline to post intervention) was 0.59 (Pearson correlation). <italic>Demographic</italic> information was collected in the screening survey or the baseline survey including gender, age, marital status, level of education completed, and employment status. Measures of self-reported <italic>clinical characteristics</italic> including current and past history of depression, help seeking for depression and disability associated with depression in the past month were also collected. In addition, items were included to measure participant <italic>perceived credibility of website interventions</italic> and participant <italic>randomisation preference</italic> at baseline. Finally, a series of secondary outcome measures were collected. Details of the latter, which are not the subject of the current paper, are available in the previously published description of the trial protocol <xref rid="pone.0053244-Griffiths3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Planned sample size</title><p>Based on previous studies <xref rid="pone.0053244-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053244-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> it was estimated that pre&#x02013;post effect sizes for the ITP, IAC and ISG conditions would be .6, .1, and .35 respectively. Conservatively assuming a correlation of .5 between pre- and post-test measurements, a sample size of 500 (125 per group) was required to detect with 80% power a change from baseline of approximately .25 standard deviations <italic>a priori</italic> contrasts of treatment arms. Although well powered to detect anticipated effects of each intervention alone, it was acknowledged that the additional benefits of an ISG when added to ITP might be small and that the trial would be exploratory rather than definitive in that regard.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Analyses</title><p>Since the data contained a number of outliers (primarily involving large and uncharacteristic changes from occasion to occasion), all CES-D data were first dichotomised into caseness (where, consistent with usual practice, a case was classified as a CES-D score&#x0003e;16). This outcome was analysed on an intent-to-treat basis using a mixed effects logistic model with factors of intervention arm and occasion of measurement and a random participant intercept using gllamm in Stata 10.1. Planned contrasts of model parameters tested hypotheses regarding differences in odds of change over time between interventions.</p><p>Associations between outcomes and demographic variables and dropout were investigated using t-tests and chi-square tests. ANOVAs, t-tests, Pearson chi-square, and Fisher Exact Probability tests were employed to identify any differences between conditions in baseline attributes or scores and also to compare attrition across the conditions in order to investigate attrition bias and potential threats to internal study validity.</p><p>The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for participants above caseness criteria at baseline with confidence intervals estimated using the method proposed by Bender <xref rid="pone.0053244-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Flow of participants</title><p>The participant flow for the trial is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053244-g001">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 12,391 participants returned completed screening surveys on time (18.2% response rate excluding late responders and return to senders from the denominator). Of these respondents the majority either indicated in their screening survey that they did not wish to participate in the trial (55.1%) or failed to meet one of the other eligibility criteria (40.7%). A further 46 eligible respondents could not be contacted leaving a total of 478 participants who were randomised to one of the four conditions. Of these potential participants, 167 (34.9%) either failed to return the consent form or returned it after the cut-off date for their inclusion in the intervention. The remaining 311 participants were advised of the condition to which they had been allocated and were asked to complete the online baseline survey. Twelve consenting participants (3 per condition) either formally withdrew from the study before undertaking the baseline survey or failed to submit a baseline or subsequent survey (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2). Of these 12 participants, one participant in the ISG condition and one participant in the ISG+ITP combined condition indicated that their withdrawal was due to the condition to which they had been allocated. Further, one participant in the e-couch condition did not complete sufficient items to compute a baseline CES-D score and provided no further CES-D data. In the absence of this data this participant could not be included in the CES-D analysis. Accordingly, the primary outcome measure analyses and the comparisons of baseline characteristics across groups were based on the 298 participants who provided sufficient data to calculate at least one CES-D score over the course of the trial (IAC n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;74, ITP n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;74, ISG n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;77, ISG+ITP n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;73).</p><fig id="pone-0053244-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0053244.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Participant flow through the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0053244.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Baseline characteristics of participants as a function of condition</title><p>

In particular, the baseline CES-D scores were not significantly different for completers and non-completers in any group at any time point except that the baseline CES-D was lower among 12 month completers in the Control condition. Similarly, in most cases, K10 scores did not differ significantly for completers and non-completers except that ITP participants who completed the CES-D at 12 months had a higher baseline K10 than non-completers and the reverse was true for ITP+ISG participants; those completing the CES-D at 12 months had a lower baseline K10 level than non-completers. There were no significant differences between completers and non-completers for caseness (CES-D&#x0003e;16), self-reported history of depression or current levels of depression or for whether they had experienced disability due to depression (unable to work or lowered productivity last 30 days). However, ITP CES-D completers at post, 6 months and 12 months were more likely to indicate at baseline that they had sought help for depression and a similar pattern was obtained for ISG CES-D completers at post and 6 months. The majority of demographic comparisons demonstrated no difference in dropout. In particular, there were no significant differences between the age of completers and non-completers or their location of residence (rural versus metropolitan). However, men were more likely to drop out of the ITP condition at each assessment point and out of the ISG condition at 12 months. Those with a tertiary education were less likely to drop out of the ITP condition (trend at post; 6 months, 12 months). Finally, for the ISG condition participants who completed the CES-D at 6 months were more likely to be unemployed (a similar trend was observed at 12 months, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.064) and the Control condition completers at 6 months were more likely to be married than non-completers.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053244-t006">Table 6</xref> shows the number of persons meeting criteria for depression needing to be treated for one person to be subthreshold at the endpoint of the intervention and at 6 and 12 month follow-ups. While the values of these indices generally followed the pattern of the intention to treat analyses, they were based on the smaller group of persons meeting threshold at baseline and, accordingly, power to declare an NNT index as significant was lower. Thus, although the NNT for the ISG alone condition appeared to decline across measurement occasions, falling to 5.4 at 12 months, the indices failed to achieve significance. The remaining findings were consistent with the intention to treat analyses. ITP alone had a low and statistically significant NNT of 5.05 at the end of the intervention but effectiveness was lost at follow-up. The combination of interventions resulted in low, stable and statistically significant NNT indices over all occasions of measurement.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0053244-t006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0053244.t006</object-id><label>Table 6</label><caption><title>Numbers needed to benefit from treatment in participants who met criteria for diagnosis at baseline (95% CI)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt108">&#x02020;</xref>.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0053244-t006-6" xlink:href="pone.0053244.t006"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ITP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ISG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ITP+ISG</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Endpoint</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.05 (2.84&#x02013;31.73)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.86 (4.51&#x02013;&#x0221e;&#x02013;&#x02212;10.05)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.94 (2.40&#x02013;13.52)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 month f/up</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.86 (3.20&#x02013;&#x0221e;&#x02013;&#x02212;32.21)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.30 (3.0190&#x02013;&#x0221e;&#x02013;&#x02212;41.51)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.49 (2.54&#x02013;29.37)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 month f/up</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.43 (3.92&#x02013;&#x0221e;&#x02013;&#x02212;8.23)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.39 (2.69&#x02013;&#x0221e;&#x02013;&#x02212;50.48)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.34 (2.40&#x02013;53.73)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt108"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>Confidence intervals may include infinity and extend to numbers needed to be harmed, which are represented by negative values.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study raises the possibility that over the long term an online peer-to-peer support group may be an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms among members of the community with elevated depressive symptoms and a self-reported history of depression. There was no change in depressive symptoms relative to the control condition after 3 months exposure to the ISG. However, both the Internet support group alone and the Internet support group combined with an automated Internet depression training program did show a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The training program alone was effective relative to control at post-test but the effect was not significant at 6 months. Adding an ISG reduced rather than improved adherence to the training program. The Control group was provided with the opportunity to access the automated depression training program after the 6 month follow-up; at 12 months there was no significant difference between this group and the group which received the training program from the outset.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of an online peer-to-peer support group for reducing depressive symptoms and the first to compare the effect of such a group with the effectiveness of an Internet-based automated psychotherapy intervention for depression. The intervention was associated with minimal human guidance with reminders to undertake the program being primarily delivered by automated email. Further, the study employed a credible Internet-based control condition which was associated with a high level of adherence. However, there were limitations. Uptake of the trial invitation was lower than anticipated and long term attrition was high. Given the high costs of the recruitment technique employed, it was not feasible to recruit the intended sample size. In addition, as has been frequently documented in other studies <xref rid="pone.0053244-Christensen2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053244-Lintvedt1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, dropout and lack of adherence during the intervention and immediate post-intervention phase of the trial was higher among the intervention groups than for the Control group and higher in the combined intervention group than in either groups alone. It is possible that the effort required to participate in these interventions varies and with it the level of adherence and attrition. Further, some participants either withdrew prior to baseline or failed to complete the CES-D measure thus providing no data to be incorporated into the planned intent to treat analysis. In addition, the presence of outliers, including large between occasion changes, in the data necessitated the dichotomisation of the primary outcome measure. Finally, although the baseline characteristics of the completers and non-completers were broadly similar, including for the outcome measure, dropout from the training program was greater among some participants (men, those with less education, those who had previously sought help) which may affected the generalisability of the findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weakness in relation to other studies</title><p>The findings of this RCT are consistent with evidence from a previous quantitative depression ISG study reported by Houston and his collaborators <xref rid="pone.0053244-Houston1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In a 12-month follow up study, they found that members of a public depression ISG who participated frequently in the online group achieved a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than those who infrequently posted after controlling for initial severity of depression. However, the design used in the latter study had the potential to yield biased outcomes since participants self-allocated to the low and high frequency groups. In contrast, the current study employed a randomised controlled trial methodology including a purpose constructed plausible, web-based attention control. To our knowledge, the only other directly relevant quantitative evaluation of the effect of a depression ISG, involved the <italic>Control</italic>-arm of an RCT of a CBT-based Internet intervention for depression <xref rid="pone.0053244-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The Control group activity comprised participation in a research ISG for approximately 3 months. As in the current study, there was no significant reduction in depressive symptoms among ISG participants immediately after participation in the ISG. However, the longer term effect of ISG use could not be evaluated in this study because Control participants were given access to the online CBT intervention after 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications</title><p>While inviting replication, the findings of the current study have substantial practical implications for consumers, clinicians and policy makers. They suggest that ISGs may be of benefit for people with a history of depression and with current depressive symptomatology. Thus, clinicians might consider referring interested clients to such groups and policy makers have a stronger basis for funding and promoting depression ISGs. The findings further suggest that there may be value in combining standard Internet training programs with an Internet support group since the effect of the ITP occurred immediately post-intervention and tapered off and the effect of the ISG was delayed and increased over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Future research</title><p>Further research is required to confirm the outcomes, to determine who might benefit most from an ISG and to identify methods for increasing participation in ISGs. There is also a need to investigate the reliability and nature of the delayed improvement effect. Participants did not log onto the ISG boards frequently following the intervention. Thus, the mechanism underlying the delayed improvement in depressive symptoms is unclear. It is possible that participants developed communication skills that they then transferred to and practised in face-to-face situations which in turn resulted in a delayed reduction in depressive symptoms. It is also possible that participation in the ISG prompted subsequent formal help seeking. Alternatively, frequency of logins may not be the only or most important indicator of participant use of the board. For example, it is possible that simply reading posts is beneficial for this group. Finally, the current study employed an ISG founded and developed for the specific purposes of the project. The culture, mechanisms of action and effectiveness of well established public ISGs may differ from that of a research ISG. Such public depression ISGs are the most widely employed and accessible services for consumers. Accordingly, we are currently undertaking a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of an ecologically valid, established depression ISG.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053244.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053244.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053244.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053244.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Alison Parsons, Anthony Bennett, Russell Reid, Julia Reynolds, Michelle Banfield and Jennifer Norton, Lisa Barney and Sarah Vassallo for their contributions to the study or paper.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0053244-Fox1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Fox S (2009) The Social Life of Health Information.
