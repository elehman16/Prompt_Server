Because of biological heterogeneity and neoantigens resulting from each patient&#x02019;s mutanome, autologous tumor may be the best source of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) for vaccines. Ex vivo loading of autologous dendritic cells with TAA may be associated with superior clinical outcome compared to injecting irradiated autologous tumor cells. We conducted a randomized phase II trial to compare autologous tumor cell vaccines (TCV) and autologous dendritic cell vaccines (DCV) loaded with autologous TAA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Short-term autologous tumor cell lines were established from metastatic tumor. Vaccines were admixed with 500 micrograms of GM-CSF and injected weekly for 3&#x000a0;weeks, then at weeks 8, 12,16, 20, and 24. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary objectives were identification of adverse events, and results of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to intradermal tumor cell injections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Forty-two patients were randomized. All were followed from randomization until death or for five years; none were lost to follow-up. DCV was associated with longer survival: median 43.4 versus 20.5&#x000a0;months (95% CI, 18.6 to &#x0003e;&#x02009;60 versus 9.3 to 32.3&#x000a0;months) and a 70% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.304, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0053, 95% CI, 0.131 to 0.702). Tumor DTH reactions were neither prognostic nor predictive. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate local injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms; but grade 2 treatment-related adverse events were more frequent with TCV. Serum marker analyses at week-0 and week-4 showed that serum markers were similar at baseline in each arm, but differed after vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This is the only human clinical trial comparing DCV and TCV as platforms for autologous TAA presentation. DCV was associated with minimal toxicity and long-term survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. DTH to autologous tumor cells was neither prognostic for survival nor predictive of benefit for either vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Clinical trials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clnicaltrials.gov/NCT00948480">NCT00948480</ext-link> retrospectively registered 28 July 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40425-018-0330-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metastatic melanoma</kwd><kwd>Patient-specific vaccines</kwd><kwd>Dendritic-cell vaccines</kwd><kwd>Tumor-cell vaccines</kwd><kwd>Autologous tumor cell lines</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Relevance of therapeutic vaccine research</title><p id="Par23">During the past decade introduction of new therapies has been associated with increased survival for patients with metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These have included oral enzyme inhibitors of signal-transduction driver pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and monoclonal antibodies that block immune checkpoint inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, even with combination checkpoint inhibitors as initial therapy, the 3-year survival rates are less than 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therapeutic vaccines might add to the survival benefit of such patients. First, animal models suggest that anti-tumor vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors are complementary therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Second, the mechanism of action for the anti-programmed death-1 (PD1) checkpoint inhibitors is blocking the suppression of an existing immune response, but many patients show no evidence of an existing immune response in their tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Third, therapeutic vaccines have been associated with survival benefit in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fourth, dendritic cell vaccines can induce or enhance immune responses to patient-specific neoantigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For these and other reasons, vaccine research is still relevant for melanoma treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Autologous tumor cells as sources of tumor-associated antigens</title><p id="Par24">Because of biological heterogeneity and neoantigens resulting from each mutanome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], autologous tumor may be the best source of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) for vaccines. Short-term tumor cell lines derived from metastatic lesions is one source of TAA that could be used for patient-specific vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They can express all TAA, including unique patient-specific TAA expressed only on self-renewing, proliferating autologous tumor cells that may represent tumor initiating stem cells and/or early progenitor cells. Using tumor cells from a short-term cell line assures lack of contamination with viable normal cells or immune suppressor cells such as regulatory T cells, or myeloid derived suppressor cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Whole tumor cell vaccines versus dendritic cell vaccines</title><p id="Par25">Two potential therapeutic approaches with short-term tumor cell lines include (1) injecting irradiated tumor cells (ITC) in a manner similar to many anti-viral vaccines, and then relying on endogenous antigen-presenting cells to process TAA and induce anti-tumor immune responses; and (2) loading antigens from such cells ex vivo into autologous dendritic cells (DC) and vaccinating with these cells. Patient-specific tumor cell vaccines (TCV) derived from autologous short-term tumor cell lines were used to treat 74 metastatic melanoma patients. TCV was well-tolerated, associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 9%, progression free survival (PFS) of 4.4&#x000a0;months, and when all patients were followed to death or for 5&#x000a0;years from enrollment with none lost to follow-up, median overall survival (OS) was 20.5&#x000a0;months, and 5-year OS 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Subsequently 54 metastatic melanoma patients were treated with patient-specific dendritic cell vaccines (DCV) consisting of autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with TAA by incubating DC with 10 million ITC derived from autologous tumor cell lines. DCV was well-tolerated, associated with an ORR of 0%, PFS of 4.2&#x000a0;months, median OS greater than 5&#x000a0;years, and projected 5-year OS of 54% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When all patients were followed to death or for 5&#x000a0;years from enrollment with none lost to follow-up, 5-year OS was 50%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Significance of current report</title><p id="Par26">A randomized trial (MACVAC) to compare these two approaches was initiated in October 2007, and is still the only human trial that has addressed whether a DCV is superior to a TCV. The trial was stopped prematurely due to discontinuation of financial support by the sponsoring hospital in April 2011. By then 42 patients had been randomized; all had initiated treatment per randomization assignment. Preliminary results were reported at a time when all patients had completed therapy; so minimum follow up was six months, median follow up was less than two years, maximum follow up less than four years, and 21 patients were deceased. OS was better in the DCV arm with projected 2-year survival rates of 72% versus 31% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The most important observation in this study is that DCV was associated with a doubling of median OS and a 70% reduction in the risk of death compared to TCV. The median survival of 20.5&#x000a0;months in the TCV arm suggests that TCV may also have anti-tumor activity. The results in each arm of this randomized trial are quite similar to results previously reported for single arm trials of TCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and DCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The lack of correlation between PFS and OS was also observed in the earlier trials, and has been observed for other immunotherapies that may provide long-lasting immune benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Patients in both arms of the study were injected with vaccines that contained the patient-specific TAA from about 10 million tumor cells that were self-renewing in cell culture. The clinical study, including all leukapheresis procedures and treatment administration took place at a single institution, but patients were referred from all over the United States for this trial and remained under the clinical management of their referring physicians. Weaknesses of this trial are the small patient numbers, which was caused by the premature closure. Not only did this result in a much smaller population of subjects than originally planned, but also in an imbalance in the numbers of patients assigned to each treatment arm, and some imbalance in baseline prognostic factors. The imbalance in the treatment arms was due to the randomization of patients within each stratification, and the lack of blocking to assure approximately even randomization at any point in time. The imbalance in prognostic factors was slightly biased against the DCV arm. This also resulted in very small numbers of patients for exploratory subgroup analyses (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), but this data was presented because of frequent questions from clinical other investigators regarding outcomes in these subgroups. Double-blinding was not used in this trial because it was a phase II trial, and because of the extra cost, inconvenience, and risks associated with leukapheresis procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">DTH tests to autologous tumor could be predictive of an effective anti-TAA immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Comparisons of baseline samples and changes from week-0 to week-4 after the first three injections showed that the patterns of changes in cytokine levels differed between DCV and TCV. This data is included only to address the question raised by several investigators as to whether there was any evidence that there was a difference between the study arms in terms of changes in in any biological measurements after the first three weekly injections. Much more extensive evaluation would be needed to better understand the association between these changes and the clinical benefit observed in the DCV arm, especially in terms of immune effects on T cells and their recognition of tumor cells. Such experiments have not been performed because the cell samples obtained during this trial are no longer the property of the investigator.</p><p id="Par53">The data regarding success in establishing tumor cell lines, and the time needed to establish them, is important for understanding the complex logistics involved in clinical trials of such patient-specific cellular products. Successful commercial application of autologous tumor cell lines would likely require a higher and faster rate of success in obtaining autologous tumor cells as a source of TAA in order to treat more patients, and to decrease potential differences in mutations between tumor cells growing in vitro and tumor cells growing in vivo. The objective of tissue culture was to increase the representation of self-renewing tumor cells (perhaps early progenitor cells) as the source of TAA rather than terminally differentiated tumor cells that predominate in a fresh tumor sample, However, this means that immune responses may be directed against only a small subset of cells in any tumor mass, which may explain why this approach is not associated with rapid regression of measurable tumor.</p><p id="Par54">All attempts to establish dendritic cells were successful. In the DC arm no effort was made to standardize the number of DC injected, but the range of 3 million to 30 million cells among patients may be relatively narrow from a biological perspective. However, theoretically there could have been up to a 100-fold difference in the density of TAA per DC per patient. The potential impact of this is unclear given the autologous origin of the tumor cells and their unique neoantigens. Analyses failed to show any dose/survival relationship related to the number of dendritic cells injected among the 18 patients treated in this trial, and among the 54 reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Since MACVAC was conducted, enzyme-targeted BRAF inhibitors and monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors, have become standard therapies for patients with metastatic melanoma, and are associated with improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Based on their complementary mechanisms of action, there is a good rationale for combining vaccines that present autologous TAA with these newer agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There is also evidence that such patient-specific vaccines increase the survival benefit associated with the immune stimulating cytokine interleukin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Ex vivo loading of TAA onto DC outside of the immunosuppressive tumor environment may be especially advantageous in patients who have normal expression of major histocompatibility antigens, but have no infiltration of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in tumor biopsies. Pre-existing TAA recognition by the endogenous immune system is a prerequisite for possible benefit from anti-checkpoint therapy. DCV is worthy of further study combined or sequenced with these other agents. Other dendritic cell vaccines and patient-specific vaccine approaches already are showing promise in combination with checkpoint inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">This is the only clinical trial that has compared dendritic cell and whole tumor cell vaccines as platforms for autologous TAA presentation. DCV was associated with superior survival compared to TCV and induced different changes in serum cytokines than did TCV. DCV was associated with minimal toxicity. As a potential biomarker, DTH to autologous tumor cells was neither prognostic for survival nor predictive of benefit from DCV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
