Exercise and pain coping skills training (PCST) can help reduce the impact of persistent knee pain, however, access to health professionals who deliver these services can be challenging. With increasing access to the Internet, remotely delivered Internet-based treatment approaches may provide alternatives for healthcare delivery. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial will investigate whether an Internet-delivered intervention that combines PCST and physiotherapist-guided exercise (PCST + Ex) is more effective than online educational material (educational control) in people with persistent knee pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will recruit 148 people over 50&#x000a0;years of age with self-reported persistent knee pain consistent with knee OA from the Australian community. Following completion of baseline questionnaires, participants will be randomly allocated to access a 3-month intervention of either (i) online educational material, or (ii) the same online material plus an 8-module (once per week) Internet-based PCST program and seven Internet-delivered physiotherapy sessions with a home exercise programs to be performed 3 times per week. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months and 9&#x000a0;months with the primary time point at 3&#x000a0;months. Primary outcomes are average knee pain on walking (11-point numeric rating scale) and self-reported physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscale). Secondary outcomes include additional measures of knee pain, health-related quality-of-life, perceived global change in symptoms, and potential moderators and mediators of outcomes including self-efficacy for pain management and function, pain coping attempts and pain catastrophising. Other measures of adherence, adverse events, harms, use of health services/co-interventions, and process measures including appropriateness and satisfaction of the intervention, will be collected at 3, 6 and 9&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings will help determine the effectiveness and acceptability of Internet access to a combination of interventions that are known to be beneficial to people with persistent knee pain.

In the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], knee OA, together with hip OA, was ranked as the eleventh highest contributor to global disability with a global age-standardised prevalence of knee OA estimated at 3.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At the individual level, persistent pain due to knee OA can be debilitating. It leads to loss of function, reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and psychological disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many people with knee OA experience co-morbidities such as obesity, depression and cardiovascular disease that add further burden to the disease. With an aging and increasingly obese world population, that are projected to increase the prevalence of knee OA pain, there is an urgent need for accessible and effective treatments that improve patient symptoms and function, while minimising the costs to both patients and society.</p><p>Interventions that foster self-management, such as exercise, are considered fundamental to managing knee pain due to knee OA. Considerable evidence supports the use of strengthening exercises to reduce pain and improve function in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Exercise is universally recommended by clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] regardless of age, disease severity, pain intensity, functional levels and co-morbidities. Meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] consistently report benefits of all types of exercise compared to education or no treatment and exercise programs that combine strengthening, flexibility and aerobic exercise seem to provide the best benefits for improving pain and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Importantly, exercise is regarded as a safe intervention in patients with knee OA with few contraindications or adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although regular exercise can reduce physical impairments and improve participation in everyday life activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], meta-analysis has consistently revealed it produces relatively modest improvements in pain and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, some patients experience increased pain when they start exercising leading them to discontinue this treatment. Exercise primarily targets biomedical factors that can influence pain and does not directly address psychological factors such as self-efficacy for pain control, adaptive pain coping skills and overly negative thinking about pain (pain catastrophising). As low self-efficacy and ineffective pain coping strategies are common in chronic pain populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], interventions that target these key psychological factors in addition to biomedical factors may provide more powerful benefit. Accordingly and consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain management, there has been growing interest in interventions that combine exercise and psychological treatments.</p><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy is the most frequently studied psychological intervention for pain control in individuals with arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Growing evidence supports the use of pain coping skills training (PCST), an approach based on cognitive behavioural principles, to improve pain and psychological functioning in chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More recent evidence shows that PCST combined with exercise, delivered by specially trained physiotherapists, is effective in people with knee pain due to knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Despite the advantages of using an intervention that combines exercise and PCST, access to specialised health professionals to deliver this combined intervention is not readily available. As PCST is currently in the domain of specialised psychologists, people with OA knee pain are not always able to access specialised health professionals to deliver this combined intervention, especially if they live in rural and remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The Internet has been increasingly used as a time efficient and convenient method to deliver health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is estimated that around 34% of the world&#x02019;s population (roughly 2.4 billion people) use the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Its use is growing in all segments of our society, including within the home, where there has been a 566% increase in worldwide use over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, older adults are the age group with the fastest growing Internet usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, the Internet represents a viable delivery mode to allow interventions to reach a large number of individuals, including older adults living in remote areas.</p><p>Members of our research team (CR, FK) recently developed an automated, Internet-based PCST program called PainCOACH to improve access to PCST for people with persistent OA pain. This program is likely to be more cost effective than face-to-face PCST because it eliminates the need for trained professionals to lead weekly face-to-face sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It also has the potential to be more convenient than face-to-face PCST because people with OA can use it at home at a time that suits them. Similarly, teleconferencing and Internet-based telerehabilitation have been used as alternative methods for delivering physiotherapy and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These methods have been found to be useful for people with persistent knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and are comparable to conventional face-to-face physiotherapy for people following knee joint replacements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, both health professionals and patients using Internet-based methods reported levels of satisfaction that were no different than those reported by health professionals and patients using traditional consultation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, the combination of delivering both PCST and physiotherapy over the Internet has not yet been rigorously evaluated in people with persistent knee pain consistent with knee OA.</p><p>The primary objective of this pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether an Internet-based intervention that combines PCST and physiotherapist-guided exercise (PCST + Ex), is more effective than online educational material (educational control) in people with persistent OA knee pain. We hypothesise that PCST + Ex will be more effective in reducing pain and improving self-reported physical function after 3&#x000a0;months than the educational control intervention. Secondary hypotheses are (i) the PCST + Ex will be more effective in reducing pain and improving self-reported physical function after 9&#x000a0;months than the educational control intervention; and (ii) there will be greater improvements in health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes, as well as a better participant-perceived response to treatment in the PCST + Ex after 3&#x000a0;months and 9&#x000a0;months than the education control intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>Parallel-design 2-arm pragmatic RCT, with a 3-month intervention and outcomes assessed at 3 and 9&#x000a0;months from baseline.

Additionally, participants will complete log books to capture adherence and adverse event data. These will be either transcribed by participants to an online survey or mailed back to researchers, as preferred by each participant. Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 1339459). All participants will provide written informed consent.

Computer generated randomisation will be conducted by random permuted blocks of size 2-8 stratified by gender (male or female) and residency (metropolitan or rural), prepared by our study biostatistician (MS). To conceal randomization, consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be prepared by a researcher with no other involvement in the study. The envelopes will be stored in a locked location and will be opened in sequence within each stratum to reveal group allocation.</p><p>All primary and secondary outcome data will be completed online and thus will be automatically entered into a database. By necessity, participants and physiotherapists will be unblinded to group allocation; however, participants will remain blinded to research hypotheses.

Participants in the control group are encouraged to access the education material at their own leisure and pace.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>PCST + Ex condition</title><p>Participants in the PCST + Ex group will receive three inter-related interventions that are delivered via the Internet. First, they will receive the same specific URL-link to access the same online educational material as the educational control group. Second, they will receive access to PainCOACH, which includes eight 35- to 45-minute modules that each teach a pain coping skill shown to help people manage persistent OA pain. The modules are designed to be completed at the rate of one per week. Participants will also receive seven physiotherapy consultations delivered over the Internet using a video telephony service, Skype&#x02122;. The initial session will be 45-minutes, followed by 30-minute sessions thereafter. During these consultations, participants will be prescribed an individualised home-based exercise program to be performed three times weekly. The weekly PainCOACH sessions will occur during the 3-month intervention period in Weeks 1-8, with a booster session at Week 11. The physiotherapy sessions will occur in Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the 3-month intervention period. Participants will receive further monthly PainCOACH boosters during the 6&#x000a0;months following the intervention period, where they will be encouraged to review the final module of the program as well as revisit useful/meaningful modules. They will also receive monthly email reminders to encourage them to continue their exercises at home and practice their pain coping skills.</p><p>Prior to beginning the intervention, participants will receive Skype set-up training, including instructions on how to set up their web-camera and their exercise environment. They will also be given an instructional manual and password access to PainCOACH from the researchers. Any equipment required for the exercises (e.g. elastic bands, ankle weights, web camera if required, and pedometer if required) will be mailed to participants before the intervention commences.</p><p><italic>The PCST component</italic> will be delivered using the PainCOACH program, which translates key therapeutic components of face-to-face PCST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] for delivery in eight highly interactive, automated training sessions (i.e., it does not require interaction with a therapist). The program&#x02019;s eight modules provide interactive training in a cognitive or behavioural pain coping skill. Module 1 provides an overview describing the PainCOACH program, PCST, and a therapeutic rationale to explain how pain coping skills can help people manage OA pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This overview is followed by training in the first pain coping skill: progressive muscle relaxation. Modules 2-7 teach brief relaxation skills, activity-rest cycling, pleasant activity scheduling, cognitive restructuring, pleasant imagery, and problem solving. Module 8 consolidates learning and teaches strategies for long term skill use. A summary of the content and flow of PainCOACH modules is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Consistent with a face-to-face PCST protocol, participants are asked to practice each new skill they learn.

In addition, theoretically-based methods drawn from social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], adult learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and principles of multimedia instruction [e.g., 48] are used to reinforce skill learning and mastery. The overall approach is consistent with research suggesting that certain combinations of text, audio, animation, and graphics can enhance learning e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>In addition, PainCOACH includes supplementary features to support use of new skills. For instance, <italic>COACHtrack</italic> promotes self-monitoring by allowing participants to review and change practice goals, record practices and &#x0201c;coping confidence&#x0201d; (self-efficacy), view graphic summaries of their progress over time, and manage automated practice reminders. Another feature, called <italic>COACHchat</italic>, allows them to read about others&#x02019; experiences using PCST and to submit descriptions of their own experiences. It was designed to provide benefits of observational learning that people get in face-to-face PCST groups. Finally, <italic>MyCOACH</italic> provides information about the program, the study, and actions to take in a medical or mental health emergency. A companion workbook provides instructions for using PainCOACH, an overview of its modules and features, and worksheets and practice logs.</p><p>Finally, participants allocated to the intervention group will receive a <italic>physiotherapist-guided home-based exercise program</italic> primarily designed to strengthen lower limb muscles. It will be progressed over the program to maintain a moderate intensity. Exercises will be prescribed based on our own previous exercise program used for face-to-face interventions in people with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. They have been shown to improve pain and physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and reflect current clinical practice (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Participants will be prescribed a minimum of five and a maximum of six exercises. These will include two knee extensor strengthening exercises, one each of a hip abductor, hamstring, and calf strengthening exercise and one additional exercise (from a limited list) chosen by the physiotherapist based on assessment. Participants will be directed to online instructions and video demonstrations of the home exercises to help guide the exercises set by the physiotherapist. They will also be encouraged to increase their overall level of physical activity and will receive written information about ways to do so as well as the option of using a pedometer as a motivational tool.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

Progression of exercises will be provided by varying the type of exercise as well as the number of repetitions, load or degree of difficulty within an exercise. The prescribed resistance will aim to approximate a 10-repetition maximum level and a patient-rated level of effort experienced during each strengthening exercise of at least 5 out of 10 (hard) on a modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion CR-10 scale designed specifically for strengthening exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>In order to minimise burden of exercise, only the study knee will be the focus of treatment and evaluation.

Participants will be taught how to determine whether pain levels are acceptable or not during and for a short time after the exercises. If a specific exercise is aggravating the participant&#x02019;s pain, then the physiotherapist will reduce the resistance, dosage and/or level of challenge within the exercise until the pain flare settles or change the exercise completely if it remains pain provoking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>Eight experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists (4 female, 4 male) in 7 locations around metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria have been selected and trained to deliver the study exercise intervention.

The findings of this study will help determine if a PCST and exercise intervention that is delivered using the Internet over 3&#x000a0;months can improve self-reported pain and physical function when compared to an educational control.</p><p>Identification of feasible healthcare models that improve outcomes in people with persistent knee pain and knee OA has important implications for clinical practice. Our study will provide new information about the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel clinical practice model for the delivery of interventions that are known to be beneficial to people with persistent knee pain. Findings could therefore have the potential to guide clinical practice towards innovative modes of healthcare provision. This does not diminish the importance of usual methods of delivery of health care, such as face-to-face visits when access is available, however this model could be of particular benefit to people in regional and remote areas who may not be able to access face-to-face care.</p><p>In order to maximise translatability, this study was intentionally designed to test a service delivery model that could be easily implemented. Use of a limited number of physiotherapy contacts similar to usual care, a home-based exercise program, and the Internet as a vehicle to deliver the intervention, which is becoming more widely accessible and acceptable to this patient population, will assist this endeavour. If the results of our proposed study support the benefits of Internet-based PCST + Ex, the components of this intervention could be easily implemented into clinical practice.</p><p>Strengths of this RCT study design are the pragmatic nature of treatment delivery by practising physiotherapists as well as the reproducibility of both the physiotherapy and pain coping skills programs. These features will improve the ability to translate the findings into a range of health care settings and enable future researchers to replicate the intervention. Importantly, the physiotherapy-guided home exercise program is individualised with regard to the content, and the intensity level of the exercises are individually monitored, progressed or stepped back throughout the intervention according to participant feedback. Additionally, physiotherapists will support and reinforce the participants&#x02019; use of the pain coping skills during the exercise sessions so as these skills can not only be integrated into the exercise program, but also encouraged within daily life. The inclusion of participants regardless of their geographic location will further enhance the generalisability of results. The study is adequately powered for our primary outcome measures.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="12891_2014_2219_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AQoL</term><def><p>Assessment of quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSQ</term><def><p>Coping strategies questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p>Minimal clinical important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p>Numeric rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCST</term><def><p>Pain coping skills training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p>Western Ontario McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The Internet-based pain coping skills program (PainCOACH) which will be used in this study was co-developed by two of the study investigators (FK, CR).
