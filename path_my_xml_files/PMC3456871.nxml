In some patients, local anesthesia was used and it was given after keeping the patient in lithotomy position. When the patient was assured, gloved index finger was gently introduced into the rectum and a suitable metallic probe was passed through the external opening of the fistula. The probe was forwarded along the path of least resistance to reach into the lumen of anal canal through the internal opening, guided by the index finger of the other hand inserted in to the rectum and the tip of probe was finally directed to come out of the anal orifice. In case of externally blind fistula, the tip of the probe was pushed to make the proximal opening in the anal orifice. Then a suitable length of <italic>K.S</italic>. was taken and threaded into the eye of the probe. Thereafter, the probe was pulled out through the anal orifice, to leave the <italic>K.S</italic>. in situ i.e. in the fistulous tract. The two ends of the <italic>K.S</italic>. were tied together with keeping the gap of index finger outside the anal canal. This procedure is termed as &#x02018;primary threading&#x02019;.

The persons are casual to this problem because it starts with a minimal discomfort in anal region. In this study, 87.88% patients were males, which go hand in hand with a study conducted in a large population which concluded that the prevalence rate is double in males compared to female.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] 48.49% patients were from rural areas and 51.51% patients were from Urban Areas which showed almost equal prevalence rate in the rural as well as urban populations. 72.73% patients were vegetarians in this study. The high percentage of disease occurrence in vegetarian populations suggested their dominance in the Gujarat state and may be due to the oily and spic y vegetarian dominated diet of the locality. 63.64% patients had the habit of tobacco chewing, a common habit observed among the people of Saurashtra region. 51.52% of the patients had the habit of consuming <italic>Viruddahara</italic> as they consumed salted <italic>Khichadi</italic> with milk. 57.56% patients had <italic>Madhyama Koshtha</italic> this factor cannot be ignored because the nature of <italic>Koshtha</italic> depends on the nature of <italic>Agni Bala</italic> which may play an important role to disturb the <italic>Dosha</italic> and its related disorders [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>In preoperative assessment one patient was found HIV-positive and two patients were found to be HBsAg positive and they were excluded from the study. This showed the importance of preoperative screening before <italic>K.S</italic>. treatment. In this study it was observed that 30.31% patients had the chronicity of 1-2 years and 20.20% patients were afflicted from the disease for 2-3 years. The shyness of the patient delays the consultation and treatment particularly in cases of anorectal disorders.The disease in initial stage presents only with mild aching pain with some discharge and if neglected at this stage, it may turn to be high anal fistula with multiple tracts. 64.70% patients were diagnosed as low anal fistula and 35.30% patients were of high anal category. Maximum number of patients i.e., about 70% had the external openings at the posterior perineal triangle (5, 6, and 7&#x02019;o clock), as gravity causes the pus to get collected in the most dependent area, which in turn leads to the formation of abscess and ultimate fistulous opening at that particular region.</p><p>The adjuvant drugs were prescribed to achieve better outcome of the surgical management in all the groups. <italic>Triphala Guggulu</italic> helps in the post operative wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] During the entire trial period maximum for 5 months use of <italic>Triphala Guggulu</italic> was recorded and did not cause any adverse effect. <italic>Gandhaka Rasayana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] was found equally effective in preventing the infection as the chances of infection is high because there is presence of discharge from the tract till the thread is in situ. The specially designed Ano rectal chair was used for <italic>Avagaha Sveda</italic> (Sitz Bath). <italic>Avagaha Sveda</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] using <italic>Sphatikadi Yoga</italic> helped in maintaining the hygiene of the perineal part and reduced the <italic>Shotha</italic> (inflammation) as well as pain. <italic>Matra Basti</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] of 10 ml <italic>Jaati Kalpa Taila</italic>, daily helped in <italic>Shamana</italic> of the aggravated <italic>Vata</italic> and provided soothing effect to ano rectum from pain with easy evacuation of stools.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Discussion on results</title><p>There are several factors, which affect the Unit Cutting Time (UCT) as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>UCT is less in submucosal, subcutaneous and low anal fistulae.</p></list-item><list-item><p>UCT is high in cases of fibrosed/tough scar tissue which generally created after the previous operation done for fistulae in ano and in cases of high rectal fistulae and trans-sphincteric fistulae.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Presence of infection and inflammation delays the UCT.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>When the UCT of all three groups were evaluated, the UCT of <italic>Ksheera Sutra</italic> was comparatively lower (7.42 days) to standard <italic>Apamarga</italic> group i.e., 8.82 days. But abscess was formed at the 2<sup>nd</sup> week in four patients of this group. The patients of this group also complained of burning sensation in the post operative period and successive change of the thread for few hours. The <italic>Snuhi Ksheera Sutra</italic> (Group-A) can be effectively used in the cases of fibrosed and recurrent cases of fistula as the tough scar of the previous operation is likely to offer resistance in the process of cutting and delay the process of healing as well. <italic>Snuhi Ksheera Sutra</italic> was not found much effective in reducing the pain scores compared to the standard group whereas, <italic>Snuhi Ksheera Sutra</italic> (Group-A) produced much discharge in the postoperative period compared to the other two groups i.e., Group-B and Group-C.</p><p><italic>Tilanala K.S</italic>. (Group-B) showed a comparatively higher UCT of 9.76 days but it did not produce any complications like burning sensation and abscess in the postoperative period. Although <italic>Kshara</italic> is <italic>Tridoshaghna</italic> and due to <italic>Visheshakriyaavacharanaat</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] the <italic>Tilanala K.S</italic>. can also be used in <italic>Pittaja Prakriti</italic> patients effectively. <italic>Tilanala K.S</italic>. (Group-B) reduced the pain scores effectively compared to <italic>Snuhi Ksheera Sutra</italic> (Group-A). <italic>E. coli</italic> was found responsible for the infection which was proved in the pus culture report of the majority of patients and was effectively controlled by <italic>Tilanala K.S</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>K.S</italic>. threading is a minor procedure and could be carried out at OPD level. The expenses required for this modality are quite low and there is no need to hospitalize the patient for longer duration. It is a boon to the sufferer of this notorious disease &#x02018;<italic>Bhagandara</italic>&#x02019; particularly who may not be able to access high-tech hospitals which requires much expenses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
