Despite these advances, sustained improvements in glycemic control are still associated with hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia (SH). The 12-month risk of SH associated with seizure or loss of consciousness was recently reported at 11.6% in adults and 9.9% in youth, rising to 18.6% in adults with type 1 diabetes for &#x0003e;40 years (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The cause of death for individuals with type 1 diabetes has been examined in several longitudinal studies, indicating that between 4 and 10% of deaths can be attributed to hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), providing a stark reminder of the risks of tight glycemic control with insulin alone. Recent data also indicate that approximately one-third of patients are worried about hypoglycemia and a similar proportion purposely maintain a hyperglycemic state seeking a &#x0201c;safety margin&#x0201d; from hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, &#x0223c;30% of patients with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. are obese (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and &#x0223c;50% of patients have metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There is a clear need for the development of new adjunct therapies to insulin that can improve glycemic control in this population without weight gain or an increase in the risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>Highly selective inhibitors of sodium&#x02013;glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2, the transporter primarily responsible for renal glucose reabsorption, are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and under exploration in patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). SGLT1 is the primary transporter for absorption of glucose and galactose in the intestine (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Sotagliflozin is a novel, orally delivered, small-molecule dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 that was designed to reduce glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract via SGLT1 inhibition and renal glucose reabsorption via SGLT2 inhibition (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Sglt1 knockout mice given a meal challenge containing glucose exhibit decreased blood glucose, increased delivery of glucose to the distal small intestine and cecum, and increased GLP-1 release indicating a potential utility for inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Homozygous knockout mice maintained on a diet containing glucose and galactose also exhibit unformed watery stools, decreased food intake, and reduced weight, findings consistent with glucose and galactose malabsorption, a condition characterized by severe diarrhea, in infants with mutations in SGLT1 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). With this in mind, most pharmaceutical discovery programs focused on selective SGLT2 inhibitors to avoid potential GI side effects. However, heterozygous Sglt1 knockout mice also exhibit increased delivery of glucose to the distal small intestine and cecum and increased GLP-1 release after a glucose-containing meal challenge but have normal stools, normal food intake, and normal weight gain when maintained on a diet containing glucose and galactose (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, it has been reported that most individuals in a large family cohort of patients with galactose malabsorption at birth could tolerate a normal diet by the age of 20 years, suggesting that severe reduction in SGLT1 activity is compatible with relatively normal GI function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These data were consistent with a &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; for achieving glycemic efficacy with potent SGLT2 inhibition and partial SGLT1 inhibition, thereby avoiding the GI side effects of complete SGLT1 inhibition. Sotagliflozin fulfilled these criteria with 20-fold selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 with SGLT2 half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.0018 &#x003bc;mol/L and SGLT1 half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.036 &#x003bc;mol/L (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Inhibiting SGLT1, the major intestinal glucose transporter, holds promise to improve glucose control by reducing postprandial glucose peaks and stimulating release of GI peptides, such as GLP-1 and polypeptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), that assist in glycemic and appetite control (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Preclinical and clinical studies conducted to date have confirmed the effects of sotagliflozin on postprandial glucose, GLP-1, and PYY (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In patients with type 2 diabetes, sotagliflozin treatment lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub>, reduced body weight, and lowered blood pressure with a low risk of hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In a dose-ranging study in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction nearly doubled as sotagliflozin dose increased in the absence of additional increases in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) supporting meaningful intestinal SGLT1 inhibition (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In a recent study in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15&#x02013;59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), sotagliflozin produced a significant decrease in PPG excursion and an increase in GLP-1 secretion (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This difference was preserved in the patient subgroup with more severe renal impairment despite the expected reduction of UGE suggesting that, unlike the effects of SGLT2 inhibition, the effects of intestinal SGLT1 inhibition are maintained as kidney function declines.</p><p>We hypothesized that in type 1 diabetes, sotagliflozin would improve glycemic control while concomitantly simplifying the insulin regimen without weight gain. In contrast to selective SGLT2 inhibitors, the additional inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin was predicted to lower postprandial glycemic excursions and decrease bolus insulin, thereby lowering the potential for postprandial hypoglycemia. Here, we present the results of a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind evaluation of sotagliflozin treatment in adults with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes as adjunct therapy to usual insulin delivery method: either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple dose injection (MDI).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind evaluation of sotagliflozin in adult patients with type 1 diabetes using their previous insulin delivery regimen: either CSII or MDI.

Days 1 and 2 of the study were conducted in an inpatient setting to allow supervision of initial insulin dose adjustments and to obtain multiple pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) samples. The first treatment dose (day 1) was administered before a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) prior to breakfast with no bolus insulin administered. Basal insulin was continued unchanged. Subsequently, investigators adjusted the suggested dosage of short-acting insulin at each meal with guidance from an algorithm based on treat-to-target blood glucose goals consistent with current standard of care (fasting and preprandial: 80&#x02013;130 mg/dL [4.4&#x02013;7.2 mmol/L], postprandial: &#x0003c;180 mg/dL [10 mmol/L], and bedtime/overnight: 100&#x02013;180 mg/dL [5.6&#x02013;10 mmol/L]). On day 2, patients were discharged and insulin doses were to be adjusted as determined by the patient and investigator assessment of scheduled self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). With standard American Diabetes Association dietary recommendations, patients were instructed to resume their regular routines. Blinded CGM data were collected on all patients throughout the study with the Enlite subcutaneous glucose sensor (Medtronic, Inc., Northridge, CA). On day 28, patients returned to inpatient for &#x0223c;36 h for end-of-treatment MMTT (with usual insulin dosing) and to obtain multiple PK and PD samples; patients were then discharged and followed for an additional week.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was the treatment effect on change from baseline of total daily bolus insulin dose during the outpatient treatment period.

The secondary outcomes pertaining to glycemic control included assessing the effect of sotagliflozin on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glucose excursion during the 3-h period after an MMTT as measured by area under the curves (AUCs).

During the study period, patients continued their usual insulin delivery regimens while attempting to achieve American Diabetes Association&#x02013;recommended glucose targets goals and maintaining their usual activity levels and diet. Treatment with 400 mg sotagliflozin given once daily before breakfast resulted in significant reductions in bolus insulin dose while improving glycemic control by multiple measures including lower mean daily glucose, a higher percentage of time spent in target range, less time spent in hyperglycemic ranges, and lower HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p><p>Sotagliflozin also produced significant pre- and postmeal improvements in glucose levels by CGM. Improvement in postprandial glucose was also demonstrated by favorable effects during the MMTT, where compared with placebo, sotagliflozin produced a statistically significant decrease in 3-h plasma glucose AUC at the end of treatment. The primary effect of SGLT1 inhibition is reduction in postprandial glucose (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and, of note, occurred with significantly lower bolus insulin used by patients on sotagliflozin. This contrasts with trials of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, selective SGLT2 inhibitors, in type 1 diabetes that did not show any significant reductions in bolus insulin use (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Further work is required to clarify the extent to which this discrepancy is driven by the SGLT1 inhibition of sotagliflozin versus differences in trial design. Importantly, the favorable effects on daily glycemic control and insulin use were accompanied by a 0.55% reduction of HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 29 days of treatment with sotagliflozin. In an 8-week open-label study in patients with type 1 diabetes, empagliflozin produced a 0.4% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>The reduction in bolus insulin use could contribute to a lower risk for postprandial hypoglycemia, and it is interesting to note that hypoglycemic events PPD were numerically lower than baseline for both treatment groups when measured by either SMBG or blinded CGM. Based on these findings, sotagliflozin provided clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control without increased hypoglycemic events. Patients treated with sotagliflozin also demonstrated significant improvements in measures of glycemic variability based on 24-h CGM analysis during the treatment period. These measures included the 24-h SD, 24-h glucose interquartile range, HBGI (a predictor for hyperglycemia), mean daily sensor glucose, and MAGE.</p><p>Patients treated with sotagliflozin demonstrated weight loss (&#x02212;1.7 kg) compared with a weight gain (0.5 kg) for the placebo group. The systolic blood pressure decrease in the sotagliflozin group (&#x02212;4.9 mmHg) was similar to the placebo group (&#x02212;3.9 mmHg). Consistent with the SGLT1 inhibitory effects of sotagliflozin, postprandial GI hormone PYY was significantly increased and sotagliflozin&#x02019;s SGLT2 inhibitor effect was reflected by increased UGE. These parameters provide confirmation of sotagliflozin&#x02019;s dual mechanism of action of SGLT1 inhibition in the GI tract and SGLT2 inhibition in the kidney.</p><p>Four patients in the sotagliflozin group reported an AE of nausea compared with one patient in the placebo group, an effect possibly associated with increased GLP-1 activity. One case occurred 3 days after cessation of treatment. The three cases that occurred during treatment were early in onset, mild in intensity, and of short duration (2 days or less). No patient on sotagliflozin reported any genitourinary infections, while one patient on placebo reported cystitis in the posttreatment follow-up period. There were no cases of SH reported, and numerically less hypoglycemic events PPD in the sotagliflozin-treated group compared with placebo. Two patients in the sotagliflozin group reported an event of DKA, which was attributed (by the investigators) to insulin pump therapy. Both cases were associated with high laboratory blood glucose readings (&#x0003e;350 mg/dL [19.4 mmol/L]) at presentation, a finding expected in DKA. Nonetheless, given the serious nature of such events, DKA will be closely monitored in all future type 1 diabetes trials. Notably, two cases of DKA were reported in patients with type 1 diabetes receiving the selective SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, but in both cases the patients presented with blood glucose levels lower than typically associated with DKA (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>This initial study of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes had several limitations. With the known effects of sotagliflozin on reducing glucose absorption, bolus insulin administration was closely monitored in an inpatient setting during the first 48 h of the study, and guidance for insulin dosing upon first dosing with sotagliflozin was conservative with an emphasis on patient safety in an effort to lower the theoretical risk for episodes of SH. This could have introduced bias in the results favoring a reduction of bolus insulin use compared with basal over the outpatient treatment period. Finally, highly significant reductions in insulin doses achieved in some patients may have led certain participants or caregivers to believe they were effectively unblinded during the study, introducing behavioral biases that could have impacted the results given the small numbers of patients enrolled in this study.</p><p>Although insulin provides a lifesaving therapy for individuals with type 1 diabetes, the challenges and burden of managing the disease with insulin therapy alone remain daunting. As work continues to develop disease-modifying treatments such as the artificial pancreas, &#x003b2;-cell transplantation, and immunomodulatory therapy to protect &#x003b2;-cells, efforts must also be made to identify adjunct therapies that could be used in combination with insulin to improve glycemic control, lower the burden of disease, and improve quality of life. After 29 days&#x02019; treatment, sotagliflozin, a next-generation dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, significantly reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, daily bolus and total daily insulin dose, postprandial blood glucose, and body weight, with no increase in hypoglycemia risk. In addition, sotagliflozin significantly improved time spent in the glucose range as measured by the following CGM glucose indices: mean daily glucose; percent time spent between 70 and 180 mg/dL, &#x0003e;180 mg/dL, and &#x0003e;250 mg/dL; and glucose variability (mean SD, MAGE, and HBGI). Sotagliflozin as an adjunctive treatment to insulin improved both glucose control and glycemic variability. Larger studies of a longer duration are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec>
