A meta-analysis<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> reviewed 5 studies and showed that there were no difference in death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and angiography-guided PCI using bare-metal stents, other studies,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> showed that IVUS use could reduce adverse clinical events compared with angiography guidance.

A recently published study<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> demonstrated that survival free of MACE at 3 years was higher in the IVUS group, and the incidence of stent thrombosis was lower in the IVUS group. However, the recent studies did not focus on the elderly, which are a sector of the population that is increasing in China. The elderly patients with unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) generally have multi vessel disease and several risk factors. Due to the influence of culture and faith, these patients would choose PCI rather than coronary artery bypass graft in China. Does IVUS provide clinical benefit for these elderly patients? There are no controlled randomized trials to answer this question. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate whether the IVUS-guided PCI is superior to the angiography-guided PCI during the long-term clinical follow-up in the elderly patients with ULMCA.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Between October 2009 and September 2012, in Qinhuangdao First hospital, Hebei Province, China, 123 consecutive elderly patients (age &#x0003e;70) with ULMCA were randomized to the IVUS group (61 patients) or the control group (62 patients). Patients in the IVUS group underwent intervention with IVUS guidance and patients in the control group underwent intervention with routine angiography guidance. Unprotected left main coronary artery was defined<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as at least 50% stenosis by visual assessment in the LM vessel without bypass grafts to the left anterior descending artery or left circumflex artery. Exclusion criteria were severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &#x0003c;30%), cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, carcinoma.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of Qinhuangdao First Hospital, and a written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to the procedure. This study was performed according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Coronary angiography and PCI were performed in the 2 groups via a transradial or transfemoral approach. Minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and lesion length were measured with the quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis system (Centricity CA1000, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA).</p><p>In the control group, the intervention strategy was decided based on the location of the lesion. Single stent technology was used in ostium or trunk LM disease without bifurcation lesions. Lesions involving the distal segment of the LM or bifurcation were treated with T-stenting, provisional T-stenting or the kissing-balloon technique. In the IVUS group, the stenting technology was decided based on both angiographic finding and IVUS finding.</p><p>Two types of drug eluting stent (DES) were implanted as follows: 1) Sirolimus-eluting stents (Firebird-2, Microport, Shanghai, China). 2) Sirolimus-eluting stents (Excel, Jiwei, Shandong, China). Patients were loaded with 300 mg clopidogrel before procedure and remained on a 75 mg dosage daily for at least one year. Aspirin was administered 300 mg daily during the first month and 100 mg daily after the first month. Procedural success was defined as lumen stenosis &#x0003c;30% by final coronary angiography.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intravascular ultrasound</title><p>Intravascular ultrasound was performed in patients of the IVUS group. After the intracoronary administration of 200 ug nitroglycerin, the IVUS catheter (Eagle Eye; Volcano Corporation, Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) was positioned at more than 10 mm beyond the lesion and was pulled back automatically (0.5 mm/s) to the opening of LM. Intravascular ultrasound images were examined by 2 experienced technicians using computerized planimetry (EchoPlaque, INDEC Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Minimal lumen diameter, minimal lumen area (MLA), reference lumen area, and plaque burden were measured. The cross-sectional luminal area was defined<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> as the integrated area central to the intimal leading edge echo. Plaque burden<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> was calculated as (EEM CSA-lumen CSA)/EEM CSA.</p><p>After the procedure, IVUS was repeated to ensure adequate stent expansion. The expansion ratio<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> was calculated as minimum stent CSA / (proximal reference lumen CSA + distal reference lumen CSA) &#x000d7; 1/2. Successful stent expansion<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> was defined as lumen area 90% or greater of the average reference lumen area pre-intervention. Patients with stent underexpansion underwent post-dilation to gain adequate stent expansion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Clinical follow-up was performed at one month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Mean follow-up time was 23.26&#x000b1;7.24 months. Angiography follow-up was performed 9-12 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint was the 2-year incidence of MACE. It was defined as death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Target lesion revascularization<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> was defined as a new intervention (percutaneous or surgical) on a previously implanted stent, or within 5 mm of that stent. Deaths were classified as either cardiac or non-cardiac. Deaths that could not be classified were considered cardiac according to the Academic Research Consortium definitions.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Myocardial infarction<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was diagnosed by an elevation of serum creatine kinase or troponin 3 times the upper limit of normal, together with chest pain lasting more than 30 minutes.</p><p>The safety endpoint was stent thrombosis.

This beneficial result was mainly driven by the decreased rate of TLR. But the IVUS guidance could not reduce mortality and myocardial infarction. As we know, IVUS may confirm the presence of significant LM disease and guide selection of stent size. Also IVUS helps us to detect PCI complications including the presence of edge dissection, stent under expansion, as well as the need for post-dilatation. Some studies,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> both in the bare metal stent (BMS) era and in the DES era, found that IVUS guidance could reduce the risk of major adverse cardiac events in patients with ULMCA. In a meta-analysis of 2972 patients,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> IVUS-guided BMS implantation showed a reduced risk of binary restenosis, repeat revascularization and MACE, without significant benefits in death or myocardial infarction. In the MAIN-COMPARE study,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> 975 patients with ULMCA underwent PCI under the guidance of IVUS or angiography alone. In 201 matched pairs, there was a tendency of lower risk of 3-year morality with IVUS guidance compared with angiography guidance. In particular, patients receiving DES had significantly lower mortality rates with IVUS guidance, but IVUS guidance did not reduce mortality rate in patients receiving BMS. However, these studies were not focused on the elderly, who represent a large portion of admitted patients with ULMCA. Although some studies<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> demonstrated that LM stenting was safe in the elderly, there is still no randomized trial to compare IVUS guidance and angiography guidance in these patients. The current study demonstrated that IVUS use was safe in the elderly, and it was an independent predictor for freedom from MACE. Intravascular ultrasound was beneficial in the elderly with ULMCA.</p><p>In this study, angiography follow-up revealed that the IVUS guidance patients group had tendency toward lower restenosis rate than the angiography guidance patients. It is known that stent under expansion is the most important mechanical cause leading to DES restenosis. Patients without stent under expansion had higher MACE-free survival rates. In this study, IVUS findings showed that 23 patients had stent under expansion. For these patients, post-dilation was performed to gain adequate stent expansion. Our findings suggest that the IVUS guidance may have a trend to decrease restenosis in ULMCA intervention.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it was a single-center study, the sample size was small. We could not perform a sub-group analysis to investigate whether diabetes or bifurcation lesions influence the beneficial results of IVUS. Second, pre-procedure and post-procedure of LCX pullback were not checked in most single stent cases, so we did not gain IVUS imaging of LCX in these patients. Third, patients with myocardial infarction were excluded, comprising a large portion of ULMCA in the real world.</p><p>In conclusion, IVUS use during ULMCA intervention with DES may improve clinical outcomes in the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
