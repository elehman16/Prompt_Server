To probe the role of stage 2 non-REM sleep (NREM2) in this process, we used a conditioning protocol in three different groups of participants who either received an odor during initial training on a motor sequence learning task and were re-exposed to this odor during different sleep stages of the post-training night (i.e., NREM2 sleep [Cond-NREM2], REM sleep [Cond-REM], or were not conditioned during learning but exposed to the odor during NREM2 [NoCond]). Results show that the Cond-NREM2 group had significantly higher gains in performance at retest than both the Cond-REM and NoCond groups. Also, only the Cond-NREM2 group yielded significant changes in sleep spindle characteristics during cueing. Finally, we found that a change in frequency of sleep spindles during cued-memory reactivation mediated the relationship between the experimental groups and gains in performance the next day. These findings strongly suggest that cued-memory reactivation during NREM2 sleep triggers an increase in sleep spindle activity that is then related to the consolidation of motor sequence memories.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Targeted reactivation of a motor sequence memory through re-exposure with a conditioned olfactory stimulus during the night reveals the specific role of stage 2 non-REM sleep and spindles in the consolidation process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>There is ample evidence that sleep contributes to the consolidation (from a labile to a robust state) of a memory trace formed through learning of a new motor sequence, such as piano-playing. Sleep, however, is a complex neurophysiological state comprising several phases, and the role that each phase plays in this memory process remains controversial. To address this issue, we used a conditioning paradigm with human volunteers in which an odor was first associated (or not) with the practice of a motor sequence learning task. The odor was then presented again in one of two different sleep phases&#x02014;rapid-eye movement (REM) or stage 2 non-REM (NREM2)&#x02014;during the second half of the night, as a means of facilitating reactivation of the memory trace. As predicted, we found that participants cued with the odor during NREM2 showed greater gains in performance (reflecting better consolidation) the following morning compared with those who were cued during REM sleep or who had not previously been exposed to the odor during training. We also observed that reactivation during NREM2 sleep prompted significant changes in a type of brain activity known as sleep spindles. We conclude that NREM2 sleep&#x02014;and spindles in particular&#x02014;contribute critically to the consolidation of motor sequence memories.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Grant received by JD from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR, Grant number: MOP-97830; URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html</ext-link>).

This type of procedural memory, known as motor sequence learning (MSL), depends initially on repeated practice but is also enhanced offline after initial training. During this latent post-learning phase, the memory trace of a given motor experience is thought to be transformed into an enduring state, a process called memory consolidation [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A plethora of studies has shown that sleep is critical for consolidating the memory trace of newly acquired motor sequences, especially when the sequence of movements is known explicitly prior to the training phase [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>While some authors investigating the existence of a relationship between sleep stages and the consolidation of motor memories using implicit [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or explicit [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] sequential tasks proposed that consolidation was linked to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, there is now increasing evidence that the consolidation of sequential motor memories is associated with changes in non-REM (NREM) sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and to alterations in characteristics of sleep spindles, in particular [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sleep spindles are short (&#x0003c;2 s), synchronous bursts of activity between 11 and 17 Hz. They are found throughout NREM sleep but are particularly numerous in NREM stage 2 (NREM2) sleep. Importantly, animal studies have shown that neurons activated during a motor task are reactivated during subsequent NREM sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and that these task &#x0201c;replays&#x0201d; during sleep coincide with slow-wave and spindle events [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although a link between sleep spindles and consolidation of sequential motor learning has also been observed in many experiments in humans (for review, see [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), most findings reported so far have been correlational in nature, hence precluding the determination of whether their role in consolidation is causal or not.</p><p>To address this limitation, researchers have recently investigated the effects of manipulating sleep-specific brain oscillations (e.g., slow oscillations [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) or neurotransmitter systems (e.g., noradrenaline [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) in order to probe the tenets of reactivation and consolidation mechanisms of memory, thereby getting closer to testing for causality [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Others have employed conditioning experimental designs, also called targeted memory reactivation (TMR) paradigms, which are thought to target the processing of specific memory representations during sleep through reactivation with an external olfactory or auditory stimulus that was previously associated during training [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The use of this innovative technique has demonstrated that it is possible to enhance performance on declarative [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], complex/cognitive procedural [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and, more recently, MSL tasks [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] by cuing subjects during their sleep with olfactory [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and/or auditory stimuli ([<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; see reviews [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).</p><p>More specifically in the procedural memory domain, the TMR approach has been employed in four studies to investigate the contribution of specific sleep stages in the consolidation of MSL. First, in a seminal study, Rasch and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] used a rose-like odor as a context cue while participants performed two successive tasks (visuospatial and MSL) and re-exposed subjects to the olfactory cue either during SWS or REM sleep. They hypothesized that re-exposure to the olfactory stimulus in REM sleep would improve consolidation of this type of learning. Contrary to their prediction, however, subjects did not show any difference in motor memory consolidation after re-exposure to either sleep stage. Although conjectural, one reason for the lack of a significant effect may be that subjects were cued during SWS and REM, but not during NREM2 sleep. As sleep spindles are thought to be implicated in the consolidation of MSL, it is possible that an improvement in post-sleep performance on the motor task might be observed if the conditioned stimulus is presented instead during NREM2, a sleep stage during which spindles occur most often [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since the same odor was used as stimulus for both types of task, it is also possible that the context-association of one task interfered with the other, hence reflecting the presence of improvements on the declarative but not the MSL task.</p><p>Other investigators have used tones and melodies associated to the learned motor task as cues for memory reactivation during the post-learning night, and have demonstrated overnight improvement in performance on an MSL task the morning after [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the latter three studies, procedural learning as well as enhanced motor sequence consolidation were assessed using versions of the serial reaction-time task (SRTT), and auditory cuing condition was administered either during slow-wave sleep (SWS) [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or during the night without distinction to the sleep stage [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Overall, their results revealed that re-exposure to auditory cues associated with learning during sleep, and more precisely SWS, improved motor memory consolidation. This boosting in performance was also specific to cued-memory reactivation performed during sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and, remarkably, to the finger transitions that were cued [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as no performance enhancement was observed when cued-memory reactivation occurred during a wake period [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], when part of the sequence was not cued [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or when subjects were tested in a no-cuing condition [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Importantly, correlations were also found between sleep spindles ([<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but see [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for a different pattern of findings), and gains in performance on the sequence task, suggesting again that sleep spindles play a role in the reactivation of the motor memory trace. Yet despite the fact that these TMR studies provide correlational evidence of a link between sleep spindles and motor sequence consolidation, none have reported changes in spindle activity, which were then associated with better motor memory consolidation. Furthermore, in both studies that found correlations between sleep spindles and performance, cuing of the conditioned stimuli was carried out during SWS, and not NREM2 sleep. If sleep spindles are crucial in the consolidation process, one would expect that cuing during NREM2 sleep would be most effective in modulating spindles, irrespective of the type of conditioned stimulus. Finally, only one of the previous studies using a TMR approach compared cuing conditions in two different sleep stages, hence limiting somewhat one&#x02019;s interpretations regarding the specificity of the sleep stage during which reactivation of the memory trace optimizes motor sequence consolidation.</p><p>In the present study, we thus investigated the contributing role of NREM2 sleep&#x02014;in particular, via the action of sleep spindles&#x02014;on MSL using an olfactory TMR paradigm design similar to the one used by Rasch et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Following an MSL training session in which we exposed participants to a rose-like odor, subjects were then re-exposed to the same olfactory stimulus during NREM2 or REM sleep occurring during the second half of the post-learning night (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This approach did not only enable us to compare the effect of these two olfactory stimulation conditions during similar portions of the night, but also to compare sleep spindle activity before and after stimulation in order to test directly whether cuing resulted in an increase in sleep spindles and their characteristics (e.g., amplitude, duration, frequency, and density) associated with performance gains. We also tested a third group that was not conditioned to any odor during training, but was exposed for the first time to the odor during NREM2. The latter group allowed us to ensure that our results would not be biased due to changes in NREM2 sleep and spindle characteristics induced by mere exposure to the olfactory stimulation during sleep.</p><fig id="pbio.1002429.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002429.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>(A) <bold>Overview of the experimental design</bold>. The odor was first presented while participants performed the MSL task. They were then re-exposed during sleep to the associated olfactory cue. This type of manipulation, called targeted memory reactivation (TMR), is thought to reactivate part of the memory trace previously associated to the cue. The effect of the manipulation was assessed by comparing performance between the evening training and morning retest sessions. (B) <bold>Experimental groups, exposure, and cueing protocol</bold>. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Both Cond-NREM2 and Cond-REM groups were exposed to the odor during the evening training session and re-exposed to the same stimulus during their respective sleep stage. By contrast, the NoCond group wasn&#x02019;t exposed to the odor while training, but received olfactory stimulation during NREM2 sleep. All groups were exposed to the odor during the second half of the night and were retested the next morning. (C) <bold>Description of the segmentation of sleep periods</bold>. The Pre-stimulation and from-stimulation periods were defined for each participant using the onset of exposure to the odor during sleep. The during-stimulation period represented the period during which the odor was presented to the participants while in their target sleep stage. The pre-matched period consisted of a period of sleep that corresponded to the exact same length as that of the during-stimulation period, and that occurred just before the onset of the olfactory cuing. (D) <bold>Olfactory delivery method.</bold> Odor delivery followed an ON/OFF block design. During ON blocks, the odor was sent during 1 s (in pink) every 3 s, while OFF blocks consisted of periods without odor delivery. For the MSL training session, the ON blocks consisted of the period during which subjects were practicing the sequence, while the OFF blocks corresponded to the periods of 30 s of rest in-between. During the targeted stage of sleep, the odor was delivered on a 30 s ON/30 s OFF block design for a maximum of 60 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1002429.g001"/></fig><p>Each group was retested in the morning to measure the subjects&#x02019; level of consolidation as reflected through gains in performance. We conjectured that each group would consolidate the MSL task during sleep as shown by gains in performance during the retest session. In addition, we hypothesized that cuing in the post-training night to a conditioned olfactory stimulus during NREM2 sleep, as compared to re-exposure during REM or exposure during NREM2 with no prior conditioning, would produce greater gains in performance on the MSL task the next day, hence demonstrating that re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus associated with the motor memory trace during NREM2 enhanced the consolidation process. Finally, consistent with the literature showing that sleep spindles are involved in motor memory consolidation, we proposed that re-exposure to the conditioned olfactory stimulus during NREM2 sleep would significantly increase spindle activity for the group conditioned and re-exposed during NREM2 sleep only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MSL Consolidation as a Function of Odor Manipulation</title><p>Offline gains in performance in the MSL task were assessed in 76 participants using a global performance index (GPI) corresponding to a measure of performance that takes into account possible speed and accuracy trade-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002429.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for detailed information on separate measures of speed and accuracy).</p><fig id="pbio.1002429.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002429.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Behavioral results.</title><p>(A) <bold>MSL learning curves</bold>.

The analyses based upon this smaller subset of subjects (i.e., <italic>n</italic> = 64) yielded a similar (albeit not identical) pattern of results.

More importantly, however, when looking at both sets of subjects, the significant differences in offline gains between groups did not change, hence demonstrating that the cuing procedure was effective. Finally, it is important to note that the pattern of results described above could not be due to poor control of olfactory cuing because stimulation in targeted sleep stages was successful (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002429.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

As expected, all experimental groups showed offline improvements in their performance on the motor sequence task after a night of sleep, highlighting again the influence of sleep on the consolidation of this type of motor learning. More importantly, however, the TMR paradigm allowed us to demonstrate that post-training cuing during NREM2 sleep with a conditioned olfactory stimulus significantly increased sequential motor performance, while cuing during REM sleep or exposing the participant to an unconditioned stimulus during NREM2 did not. Our results also show that cuing during NREM2 sleep produced an increase in a variety of spindle characteristics, and that such changes were found only over parietal areas. Finally, we demonstrate that the increase in sleep spindle frequency over parietal regions mediated the difference between the MSL performance of the conditioned versus unconditioned group. Altogether, the results of the present study reveal that NREM2 sleep is crucial for sequential memory consolidation, and that part of this effect may be explained by a specific modulation of sleep spindles.</p><p>As expected, sleep had a positive impact on MSL consolidation in all three groups. The fact that the non-conditioned control group improved at retest is consistent with a large number of studies that have reported that a night of sleep is sufficient to trigger a consolidation process, which in turn produces gains in performance ([<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; but see [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for a discussion of possible confounding factors). Furthermore, our pattern of results demonstrates that stimulation with the conditioned stimulus during REM sleep does not elicit greater behavioural improvement over and above the effect of sleep. This replicates the findings from Rasch et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], who did not report any significant changes in performance on a very similar TMR protocol using the motor sequence learning task after presentation of a conditioned olfactory stimulus during REM or SWS. Although findings from Rasch et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and ours do not appear to support prior studies, which suggested that the process mediating motor sequence consolidation is dependent upon REM sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we argue that it was likely because of cognitive demands associated to the task employed (i.e., probabilistic serial reaction time task, mirror tracing task) and that it underlines the possibility that REM sleep might be implicated in other aspects (i.e., more cognitively demanding processes) of motor memory consolidation. Yet our results and those from other recent investigations [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] indicate that the consolidation of a newly acquired explicit and cognitively simple motor sequential skill is particularly dependent on NREM sleep.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>NREM2 Sleep Promotes Motor Memory Consolidation</title><p>More importantly, and as expected, our results show that participants conditioned to an olfactory stimulus during training to a novel MSL task, and re-exposed to that same stimulus during NREM2 sleep, experienced a significant enhancement in performance the next day compared to the two other groups. The latter finding is in accord with previous studies, which found that performance at retest on an MSL task is correlated to the amount of NREM [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and to NREM2 sleep more specifically [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is also consistent with evidence that pre-sleep training on a motor task increases the time spent in NREM2 sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but that deprivation of post-training SWS or REM sleep does not produce any decrease in motor task performance at retest [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], hence supporting further the conclusion that NREM2 sleep plays an important role in the motor sequence memory consolidation process (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for a review).</p><p>It is important to note that previous TMR studies that investigated the implication of sleep in MSL learning found greater gains in performance when subjects were cued during SWS [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The current study extends these findings and provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that possible reactivation of the motor memory trace during NREM2 sleep does facilitate offline consolidation processes capable of producing increases in sequential motor performance when tested again the next day. Our results are also in line with a recent integrative model proposed by Genzel and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which states that such memory trace reactivations occur particularly (but not exclusively) during the so-called light NREM sleep. Although still conjectural, this model put forward the notion that such an active memory consolidation process, possibly due to exchange of information between the striatum and motor related-cortical regions [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], would take place during this light NREM phase because it offers the most optimal conditions for global brain interactions. Thus consistent with Genzel&#x02019;s model, our behavioral results strongly suggest that mnemonic processes occurring during NREM2 sleep are involved in sequential motor memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Changes in Spindle Characteristics Associated with Motor Sequence Consolidation</title><p>Over and above the changes in performance as a result of cueing during NREM2, the present olfactory TMR protocol induced changes in sleep spindle characteristics (i.e., amplitude, duration, and frequency) only for the group conditioned and re-exposed during NREM2 sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these changes were not caused by differences in sleep architecture or spindles present prior to the stimulation, but were prompted specifically through re-exposure to the conditioned odor during NREM2 sleep. Previous TMR studies investigating the role of SWS in motor memory consolidation have reported correlations between gains in performance and the number or density of sleep spindles, but no change in spindle characteristics per se [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The reasons for such differences with our own findings may be two-fold. First, it is possible that because sleep spindles are more numerous in the stage we targeted (NREM2) than in SWS, predominance of spindles between these two stages could account for the increases in several characteristics shown in our own study. Second and most importantly, however, the protocol employed here offered the unique opportunity to compare the effect of reactivation during cuing compared to a baseline period recorded during the same night prior to any re-exposure. Thus, this enabled us to compare non-cued segments that were uncontaminated by previous cuing trials to cued segments of NREM sleep, allowing us, for the first time, to detect changes in sleep spindle characteristics in a TMR study on MSL consolidation.</p><p>Interestingly, the present study also revealed that re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus produced significantly greater increases in sleep spindle amplitude and frequency, and that this change was present at Pz for the group cued during NREM2, compared to the non-conditioned group. These results are in line with reports, as those from Schabus and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], suggesting that changes in spindle characteristics may be more important than an increase in spindle density for consolidating memories. They are also in accord with some known properties related to the underlying physiology of sleep spindle oscillations. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that sleep spindles of higher frequency had higher amplitude and, interestingly, greater rate of cortical propagation [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Since sleep and spindle burst activity are thought to provide favourable conditions for synaptic plasticity ([<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], see [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] for a review), it is thus possible that, without the need for a larger number of spindle events, the increases in frequency and amplitude found in the present study allowed for a more efficient potentiation of long-term synaptic changes and increased synchrony in the thalamocortical loop, hence facilitating consolidation of the memory trace.</p><p>Further analyses on spindle frequencies at Pz showed that, in the conditioned NREM2 group only, the number of spindles increased in a distinct range of frequency (13.5&#x02013;13.99 Hz), while there was a decrease in a lower frequency range (11&#x02013;11.49 Hz). This pattern of results is even more revealing that the NoCond group did not show any change in either of the frequency bins, but revealed instead an overall normal pattern of decrease in mean frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002429.s007">S3 Table</xref>) that is usually observed during an undisturbed night of sleep in normal subjects [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In sum, since parietal spindles in the 13.5 Hz to 13.99 Hz range are generally considered fast spindles, our results in the Cond-NREM2 group are thus consistent with previous studies that have reported increases in fast spindle density [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and higher sigma band (13 Hz) activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] over parietal regions following MSL training.</p><p>The reason why changes in spindle characteristics were found in the parietal regions only is speculative at this point. Yet it is now known that the early stage of MSL is characterized by the acquisition of two different sequence representations (motor, spatial), which are associated with plastic changes in different motor-related networks and that are depending differently on sleep for consolidation [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Learning the motor representation of the sequence relies, in part, on activation of the striatum, motor cortex, and cerebellum (see reviews [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). By contrast, acquisition of the spatial representation depends mainly upon the hippocampus as well as the prefrontal and parietal regions [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Results from studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the consolidation of the latter type of memory trace is related to spindle activity during NREM sleep [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, TMR studies investigating the effect of sleep on declarative memory using visuospatial memory tasks have previously shown that cuing during SWS with an olfactory stimulus produced increases in fast spindle density over parietal regions [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, in light of past studies and our present results, it is possible that the olfactory cue reactivated preferentially the spatial representation of the motor sequence during sleep, which in turn was enhanced via spindle activity in parietal regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Spindle Frequency as a Mediator of the Effect of Olfactory Cuing on Performance Improvements</title><p>In the present paper, we show that the change in sleep spindle frequency over parietal regions mediated the relationship between cuing and offline gains. These results indicate that the experimental manipulation (i.e., cuing the memory of a motor task with an odor, or not) can predict both the level of offline gains as measured at retest and the increase in parietal spindle frequency before versus during stimulation. This mediation effect implies that, regardless of the presence of a conditioned stimulus or not, spindle frequency variations over the parietal region predict the level of gains in performance the next morning. Thus, the present findings provide the first evidence of a mediator effect of sleep spindles on the relationship between a TMR protocol and MSL offline gains. Taken together, the combination of the TMR experimental design used here, the specific increase in spindle characteristics yielded by cuing, and the mediating effect of spindle frequency on offline gains suggest that NREM2 sleep spindles are instrumental to sequential motor learning consolidation.</p><p>Again, it is difficult to explain why an increase in spindles of higher frequencies is particularly important for consolidating the memory trace associated with a newly acquired sequence of movements. As such changes were observed over Pz, the latter finding is in accord with the fact that sleep spindles detected over central and parietal regions are characterized by higher frequencies (called fast spindles) [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and that these events have often been found to be associated with motor memory consolidation [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, our results are consistent with those of innovative studies using combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)/EEG recordings during sleep by Tyvaert and collaborators [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], who have shown a link between spindle activity and increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the putamen, as well as others, who have reported that fast spindles are associated with increased activity in cortical motor regions and the hippocampus [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]&#x02014;all structures that have been shown to play a significant role in motor learning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although it is important to note that the present TMR study does not prove causality, as we did not manipulate directly the occurrence of sleep spindles, we believe that our results and the experimental design used here offer, to our knowledge, the first evidence toward an instrumental role of NREM2 sleep in the consolidation of motor sequence memory through the increased activity of sleep spindles over parietal regions. We show that cuing during NREM2 not only increases posterior spindle frequency, but also that these changes predict future performance on a motor sequence task. Based on the present findings, and those of other groups of investigators, we thus propose that NREM, and NREM2 sleep in particular, through the specific neuronal activity of sleep spindles, play a critical role in the consolidation process of a motor memory trace generated through practice of a new sequence of movements. More specifically, the increases in spindle amplitude, duration, and especially frequency observed during the stimulation phase (hence possibly facilitating the reactivation process) lead to a better consolidation process and ultimately to higher sequential motor performance the next day. However, further combined sleep/imaging studies are needed to investigate the neural correlates of the spindle-related reactivated memory trace from the enhancement through cuing of a conditioned stimulus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Participant Recruitment and Selection</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Preselection</title><p>To be included in the study, eligible participants had to be right-handed, between 20 and 35 y old, and had to have no previous formal training playing a musical instrument nor any training as a professional typist, in order to control for pre-existing experience in tasks requiring highly coordinated finger movements.

They were instructed to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the experiment. Subjects were asked to keep a strict sleep/wake schedule: go to bed between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 am, wake up between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., and abstain from taking naps during the day. To ensure that the participants adhered to this sleep/wake schedule during the week separating screening and experimentation nights, they were asked to wear an actigraph on their wrist (Actiwatch 2, Phillips Respironics). Complementary to the actigraph, participants were also asked to complete a sleep diary. Individuals who did not follow this strict sleep/wake schedule were not enrolled in the study and did not participate in the experimental night. Out of the 135 eligible individuals, eight were found to have at least one type of sleep disorder (e.g. bruxism, sleep apnea, periodic limb movement), 20 did not reach the 80% sleep efficiency threshold, six did not follow instructions regarding the sleep/wake cycles (following inspection of the actigraphy data), and nine voluntarily dropped out of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Experimental session</title><p>Thus, after completing the screening night, a total of 92 participants were selected and enrolled in the study. Importantly, participants&#x02019; assignment into the experimental group took place after all eligibility criteria were applied and participants were screened out. Of the 92 enrolled participants, 18 were subsequently discarded from the analysis for the following reasons: seven were excluded due to low sleep efficiency (&#x0003c;75%) during the experimental night, three were due to technical problems (e.g., issue with the response box or the olfactometer), four were because they did not properly follow the instructions during the motor sequence task, and four were because their performance on the MSL task was considered as outlier. Thus, 76 participants were included in the behavioral analyses of the MSL task. They were distributed as follows: 25 subjects were included in the Cond-NREM2 group (mean age: 25.42 &#x000b1; 4.4 y, 11 females), 23 in the Cond-REM group (mean age: 24.77 &#x000b1; 4.2 y, nine females) and 28 in the NoCond group (mean age: 24.60 &#x000b1; 4.9 y, 11 females). Of these, 12 participants were further discarded from the subsequent sleep and spindle analyses due to poorly recorded PSG data. Consequently, 64 participants were included in the sleep EEG analyses and were distributed as follows: 21 subjects were included in the Cond-NREM2 group (mean age: 25.5 &#x000b1; 4.5 y, eight females), 21 in the Cond-REM group (mean age: 25.13 &#x000b1; 4.2 y, nine females) and 22 in the NoCond group (mean age: 24.18 &#x000b1; 4.4 y, ten females).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Overall Experimental Design and Procedure</title><p>A week after the screening session, participants were invited again to the laboratory for the experimental night. Following proper installation of the EEG electrodes for polysomnographic recordings and the olfactometer apparatus, participants were randomly assigned to either of the three experimental groups (see next section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p>Prior to carrying out the MSL task, participants completed the Standford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] to assess their subjective levels of sleepiness. Around 10:30 pm, they were then trained on the motor task, during which, depending on their experimental group, they were exposed or not to a rose-like odor through a nasal cannula. Overnight PSG recording began immediately following the training period. To increase sleep efficiency, exact timing for initiating the MSL training and for allowing subjects to sleep was adjusted according to each participant&#x02019;s natural sleep onset preference. After 4 h of sleep recording time, participants were re-exposed to the rose-like odor during the subsequent episodes of the targeted sleep stage for a maximum of 60 min. To achieve maximum exposure time, several bouts of stimulation were necessary. Following the olfactory stimulation period, participants were allowed to complete their night of sleep until they reached 8 h of recording time. Participants were then retested on the SSS and MSL task 2 h after waking to reassess their performance after enough time to allow for sleep inertia to dissipate.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Experimental Groups</title><p>Three groups of subjects participated in this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The Cond-NREM2 and Cond-REM groups received the olfactory stimulus during the training session. This procedure allowed participants to establish a strong association between learning of the novel motor task and the rose-like smell. These two groups were then re-exposed for a maximum of 60 min to the same odor during either NREM2 or REM sleep in the second half of the night in order to determine the sleep stage during which optimization of the consolidation process takes place. One additional group, which was not exposed to the odor during the training session (even though a nasal cannula was in place), but was nevertheless exposed to the olfactory stimulus during NREM2 sleep, was included to control for the presence of odor during the encoding stage and the possible nonspecific effects of exposing subjects to an olfactory stimulation during NREM2 sleep (NoCond group). None of the subject was aware of his or her experimental group assignment, nor had any knowledge of these procedural differences.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Motor Sequence Learning: Finger Sequence Task</title><p>Motor sequence learning was tested with an adapted version of the sequential finger tapping task first developed by Karni et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Subjects were asked to practice an explicitly known eight-item sequence of finger movements (2-4-1-3-4-2-3-1, where 1 stands for the index finger and 4 for the little finger) using a procedure employed previously in the laboratory (e.g., [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), except that subjects were asked to complete 24 blocks of practice of the sequence during the initial training session and eight others during the retest session. In order to verify that participants had explicitly memorized the motor sequence prior to training, participants were required to repeat the sequence until they were able to reproduce it three times in a row without error. During training, participants were required to practice the sequence by executing the finger movements as quickly as possible while making as few errors as possible, without looking at their hand. To do so, participants had to use a response box comprising four buttons, and press one button at a time with fingers of their left (non-dominant) hand. They had to practice the sequential movements for as long as a green cross (3 x 3 cm<sup>2</sup>) was displayed at the center of a computer screen. Unknown to subjects, the green cross was displayed until 80 finger movements were recorded (one block; ideally corresponding to the production of ten correct sequences). No information about the sequence or performance feedback was given to the participants during the task. During pre-sleep training, 24 blocks of motor sequence practice were interspersed with 30 s periods of rest, during which a red cross was displayed at the center of the screen. The retest session was exactly the same as the training session, but comprised only eight blocks of motor sequence practice and took place the following morning. The task was coded using the Cogent2000 toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php">http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php</ext-link>) and implemented using MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Sherbom, MA).</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Performance Assessment and Analyses of the GPI</title><p>Behavioral performance at a sequence motor learning task is often reported as speed (e.g., time between key presses, time for correct sequences, time per block) and/or accuracy (e.g., number of correct key presses per block, number of correct sequences).

However, these small differences in accuracy at the individual level might reflect differences in motor strategy. For example, some participants might prioritize accuracy at the expense of speed while others might prefer to be faster even if it implies making more mistakes. Furthermore, the instructions provided to participants were explicitly to perform the sequence as quickly as possible while making as few errors as possible. Thus, in order to reflect these requirements and to account for individual strategy differences, we measured the subjects&#x02019; performance using a GPI.</p><p>Similar to indexes in previous research [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], the GPI was built based upon the following measures of speed and accuracy:

First, the olfactometer itself was kept in a separate location from the testing and sleeping rooms. Second, the manipulation of olfactory stimuli was always conducted outside the testing room. Finally, delivery of the stimulus was carried out using an ON/OFF block design procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). During the ON blocks, the odor was sent for 1 s every 3 s. For the MSL training session, the ON blocks consisted of the period during which subjects were practicing the sequence, while the OFF blocks corresponded to the periods of 30 s of rest in-between. During the targeted stage of sleep, the odor was delivered on a 30 s ON/30 s OFF block design for a maximum of 60 min.</p><p>A solution of phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA&#x02014;concentration: 6.31 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> [% v/v]) and heavy mineral oil (solvent&#x02014;USP/FCC) was used as the odorant source. PEA has a pleasant rose-like smell and is known as a pure odorant, that is, a chemical substance that stimulates the olfactory nerve exclusively, as opposed to a mixed olfactory/trigeminal odorant that could lead to unpleasant sensations (e.g. burning, itching, cooling, etc.) [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Importantly, several studies have shown that the presentation of an olfactory stimulus during sleep does not wake up subjects [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The 125 ml emulsion was stored in an air-tight 750 ml glass container connected to an olfactory delivery system using Teflon-coated tubes (Tygon SE-200, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics) to deliver the odor to the subject via a Teflon-coated nasal cannula. Teflon does not easily bond to PEA molecules, thus maintaining a constant concentration of PEA in the airflow [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>Although odorant concentrations did not vary between subjects, the length of exposure during sleep did vary due to inter-individual differences in sleep architecture. Therefore, analyses were conducted on both sets of participants (all subjects included in behavioral analyses [<italic>n</italic> = 76] and those included in PSG analyses [<italic>n</italic> = 64]) in order to verify that there was no significant difference in amount of stimulation between groups. One-way ANOVAs were performed on wake duration during cuing (within-subjects factor) and groups (between-subjects factor) to test for any differences between groups. We also investigated, with a similar analysis, the duration of cuing during REM sleep between groups. Finally, one-way ANOVAs were conducted on total exposure and duration of cuing during NREM2 sleep durations, within and between groups. Results from post-hoc univariate tests between Cond-NREM2 and NoCond groups were reported to verify that there was no difference.</p><p>The PEA concentration in the odorant solution was exactly the same for each participant. However, there were inter-individual differences in terms of their olfactory threshold. Each participant&#x02019;s threshold was identified with the Sniffin&#x02019;sticks test (Burghart Medizintechnik, Germany).

This analysis allowed us to determine whether all participants reached an asymptotic performance (main effect of block). It also provided information about the learning rate (block x group interaction) and level of performance (main effect of group) between groups.</p><p>The level of consolidation was assessed through a repeated-measures ANOVA conducted with the two sessions (training and retest) and eight blocks (i.e., the last four blocks of training and the first four blocks of the retest session) as repeated within-subjects factors and groups as the between-subjects factor. Four blocks used to calculate gains in performance were selected because it has been shown in several studies that there is a warm-up effect occurring during the first block of retest [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The physiological basis of the so-called warm-up effect are not well understood yet, but it is recognized that it tends to drastically inflate inter-key-press time during the first retest block. Thus, averaging four blocks reduced the inter-subject variance in performance and allowed for the inclusion of the first retest block. As it is highly possible that the duration of exposure to the olfactory stimulus and the olfaction threshold of each participant would have played an important role in the experimental manipulation occurring overnight, the latter analysis was carried out controlling for the subjects&#x02019; olfactory threshold (as measured with the Sniffin&#x02019;sticks test) and the duration of exposure to the odor during sleep. Finally, as a post-hoc analysis, we conducted a one-way ANOVA on the difference in GPI between the morning and evening sessions between the three groups and carried out planned contrast analyses assessing the specific differences between groups.</p><p>Finally, the same behavioral analyses were also performed with participants who were only included in the EEG and spindle analyses in order to ensure that the results from the entire groups of participants did not differ from the sub-set who had good EEG data.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>PSG Recording</title><p>PSG recordings were acquired using a 16-channel, V-Amp 16 system (Brainamp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) from ten scalp derivations (F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, P4, Oz) referenced to linked mastoids (A1, A2).

Peak amplitude (max peak-to-peak value, in &#x003bc;V), duration (offset&#x02013;onset, in seconds), and peak frequency (max peak-to-peak distance, in Hz) were calculated from the original EEG signal filtered from 11 Hz to 16 Hz. Peak frequency and amplitude were extracted, for each individual sleep spindle, using fast Fourier transforms, as indicated by the power spectrogram. This represents the frequency and amplitude that had the greatest power for each spindle. Spindle density was also calculated based upon the number of spindles per minute.

To do so, we used the onset of each spindle as a marker to determine their primary localisation. For each detected spindle, time-lapse windows were created on the two other derivations before and after a spindle onset (200 ms for adjacent sites, e.g., Pz and Cz; 400 ms for nonadjacent sites, Fz and Pz). Spindles were systematically categorized into two groups. First, as pure spindles&#x02014;that is, when an event (a spindle) occurred in only one derivation within the given time window. Second, multi-site spindles were events with occurrence on at least one other electrode within the time frame. Taken together, these spindles were considered as a single event detectable from other recording sites and formed multi-site groups of spindles. Spindles from the latter class were again divided into two subcategories: source or rejected. Source spindle were defined by their onset as the first ones to occur in a multi-site group and were categorized by recording sites. Finally, the rejected spindles were multi-site spindles that occurred on other derivations after the source spindle and weren&#x02019;t included in the analyses. Importantly, although some recorded events were rejected, no spindle was totally discarded per se, as source spindles were kept for analyses. The identification and classification of spindles was carried out using software coded in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Sherbom, MA).</p><p>Several studies have previously utilized a fast/slow spindle classification in order to investigate the function of spindles.

In contrast to the latter approach, the present technique is based solely on the spindle&#x02019;s derivation. This method was used, in part, because it reduces the risk of losing information from slower spindles occurring in parietal regions and faster spindles in frontal regions. To observe changes produced based upon the categorization on sleep spindle distributions, we reported the percentage of rejected spindles originally detected on Fz, Cz, and Pz sites, and then analyzed with paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests the spindle frequency median changes of the distribution caused by the filtering on Fz, Cz, and Pz. Furthermore, we investigated the categorization algorithm effect on Pz spindle frequency, by comparing the median and mean, in pre-matched and during-stimulation sleep periods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002429.s008">S1 Text</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>EEG Analyses</title><sec id="sec031"><title>Sleep spindle analyses and stimulation period</title><p>Statistical comparisons of spindles were carried out on Fz, Cz, and Pz derivations. For each derivation, peak amplitude, duration, peak frequency, and density of sleep spindles were analysed. Given that stimulation during sleep was carried out toward the end of the night and that most participants had little or no SWS at the beginning of the re-exposure period, spindle analyses were conducted using NREM2 sleep only.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to be able to compare between periods with and without stimulation, a period of sleep of the same length as during-stimulation was selected from the pre-stimulation period for each subject. Starting from the last epoch of NREM2 and going backward in the recording of the pre-stimulation period, the same number of epochs as in the during-stimulation period was selected for each subject. This period was defined as pre-matched. It served as a baseline and permitted us to compare the events during the stimulation closest to the previous periods of NREM2 sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002429.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p><p>Given that one of our main hypotheses was that cuing during NREM2 sleep would induce changes in sleep spindles, we used one-way ANOVAs to assess the differences in spindle characteristics (within-subjects factor) between groups (between-subjects factor), first in the pre-matched period to ensure that all groups were similar before cuing, and second in the during-stimulation sleep periods. We also investigated the effect of cuing by measuring and analyzing difference (&#x00394;) in spindle characteristics between two sleep periods: pre-matched (baseline) versus during-stimulation (cuing). This differential score was calculated by measuring the percent change for each spindle characteristic between the two periods of interest. One-way ANOVA analyses were used to investigate the pre-matched versus during-stimulation differences (within-subjects factor) between the Cond-NREM2 and NoCond groups (between-subjects factor). We also assessed the nature of changes in spindle frequency probed by the stimulation by analyzing changes in specific bins of 0.5 Hz (11&#x02013;17 Hz) between the pre-matched and during-stimulation periods for both the Cond-NREM2 and NoCond groups with Chi<sup>2</sup> analyses (Bonferroni-corrected for the number of bins). This analysis provided information about the specific ranges of frequency that were modified by the manipulation.</p><p>In order to provide a better and unbiased estimation of the group differences regarding various spindle characteristics (frequency, amplitude, duration, density), we performed a bootstrap analysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Specifically, for each spindle characteristic (e.g., frequency) and for each group, we generated 5,000 data samples (sampling with replacement), equal in size with the original sample in both groups (<italic>n</italic> = 21 for Cond-NREM2 and <italic>n</italic> = 22 for NoCond; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002429.s008">S1 Text</xref> for more details about this procedure). To control for multiple independent comparisons, a Bonferroni correction for 12 comparisons (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004) was applied on the bootstrap results (3 electrodes x 4 spindle characteristics).</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Mediation analyses</title><p>Finally, we conducted mediation analyses, using change between sleep periods in spindle characteristics as a mediator, experimental conditions as an independent variable, and gains in performance as the outcome measure, using PROCESS, an SPSS add-on module [<xref rid="pbio.1002429.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].
