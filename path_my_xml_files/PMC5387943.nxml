The estimated prevalence among adults in the UK is 11.1%, including major depressive disorder in 3.3% and mixed depression and anxiety in 7.8%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It can lead to chronic disability, poor quality of life, suicide in some cases and high levels of health service use and economic costs. The King's Fund have estimated that 1.45 million people will have depression in England by 2026, and total societal costs will be &#x000a3;12.2 billion per year, including healthcare, social services and lost employment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) depression guidelines recommend different interventions for moderate to severe depression than for mild depression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, general practitioner (GP) clinical assessments of the severity of depression vary and are often inaccurate when compared with validated measures.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Consequently, some GPs do not accurately target treatment to patients most likely to benefit,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> reducing the cost-effectiveness of treatment, which needs to be optimised given the impact of depression.</p><p>As a result of these findings, NICE recommends that health professionals consider using validated questionnaire measures of severity at diagnosis to help target treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Between 2006 and 2013, the UK GP contract Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) paid GPs to use symptom questionnaires as part of their assessments of depression severity at the outset of treatment for patients with a new diagnosis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Symptom questionnaire assessments at follow-up of treated patients were also incentivised through the QOF between 2009 and 2013, to promote follow-up reassessment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Some patients value using symptom questionnaires to assess treatment effectiveness and monitor their progress,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and some GPs also value them for monitoring patients' progress. The likelihood of antidepressant treatment and/or referral for psychological therapy is significantly associated with higher symptom questionnaire scores at diagnosis,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and decisions to change treatment are significantly associated with changes in scores at follow-up.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>However, the use of symptom questionnaires is disliked by some GPs, who worry they intrude in sensitive consultations and undermine professional autonomy and, doubting their validity, prefer using clinical judgement to assess severity and response to treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In 2012, a NICE-commissioned systematic review concluded that the evidence supporting questionnaires was not strong enough to require their use in QOF depression indicators.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Current QOF guidance suggests formal assessment questionnaires can be used to measure severity at reviews 10&#x02013;56&#x02005;days after diagnosis, but this is optional rather than required to receive payments for the reviews.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The QOF depression symptom questionnaires are an example of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), the use of which has been promoted in recent years to increase patient involvement in their own care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A recent Cochrane systematic review of the use of PROMs in the treatment of common mental health disorders (CMHDs) including depression found some evidence of benefit for patients identified as having a lack of improvement early on in treatment, but the research was generally of low quality.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> More research is required, particularly in primary care where most CMHDs are treated.</p><p>If using symptom questionnaires and other PROMs is beneficial even to a modest extent, they are likely to be cost-effective given their low cost, and the benefits at a population level would be considerable in public health terms, given the high cost to the nation of depression. Randomised trials of using PROMs to monitor patients' progress in primary care are however needed to inform practitioners definitively whether their use is beneficial, given their justifiable doubts about the validity of the approach.</p><p>We decided a feasibility study was needed first, to determine whether practices in England would agree to use PROMs with patients during consultations for the assessment of depression at diagnosis and follow-up. It was also needed to determine whether a trial randomised at patient level would be preferable to cluster-randomising whole practices, which might need a bigger sample size, depending on the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) between practices, which could also be estimated through a feasibility trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aim</title><p>To test the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled of PROMs for monitoring outcomes for patients with depression in primary care.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>To determine key elements of the best design for a trial, including:

Eight practices were recruited to the study in the first month as planned. Four of them were cluster randomised to intervention or control arms, and in the remaining practices, patients were individually randomised. However, two of the original sample of practices failed to recruit any patients within the first 3&#x02005;months. We therefore replaced these practices with two which recruited patients more quickly, but due to slower than desired recruitment among some of the other participating practices, we also agreed an amendment to our protocol with the Research Ethics Committee (REC) to recruit from a ninth practice, in order eventually to achieve recruitment of 47 of our target of 48 patients. One of the three replacement practices was cluster randomised to replace a cluster-randomised practice which had dropped out, and in the other two, patients were individually randomised.</p><p>Three practices recruited six patients within 8&#x02005;weeks, while three failed to recruit six in a year, and three were intermediate recruiters. Two of the three practices that failed to recruit had individual mitigating circumstances. One was recruited to the study late, with only a 1-month time frame, so did well to recruit three patients. Another decided to stop actively taking part in all research and did not continue to recruit patients. Feedback from the third practice suggested that greater clarity on study eligibility criteria and guidance to promote the study during consultations was needed to prompt recruitment.</p><p>From the nine practices, a total of 78 patients agreed to discuss participation, of whom 47 (60%) were randomised (37 (79%) recruited in consultations and 10 (21%) through mail-outs). Practice logs showed that fewer than 10% of patients identified as eligible and mailed information about the study returned reply slips indicating whether or not they were interested in participating. Of the 31 patients (40%) who were not recruited, 18 (23%) were uncontactable at baseline and 13 (17%) declined after initial contact. The main reasons for declining were no longer being interested in taking part or having competing commitments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016015266F1">figure 1</xref>, consensus statement on reporting randomised trials (CONSORT) flow diagram of patient participation).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016015266F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of patient participation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016015266f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 47 recruited patients, 29 (62%) were women, 46 (98%) were white and 31 (66%) were in employment.

We present a brief summary only in this paper.</p><p>Fourteen patients were interviewed. Overall, in relation to the feasibility of the study, patients were happy to be randomised (even when randomised to the control arm), were supportive of the use of PROMS (seeing potential benefits for understanding their illness) and reported them relatively easy and quick to complete. There were some difficulties found in discussing the results of PROMS with their practitioners which would need attention in a definitive trial. Some were unable to see the same practitioner for follow-up, and some expressed disappointment at not having feedback on the PROM scores from participating practitioners. Some would have liked a record of changes in scores over time to show their progress.</p><p>Interviews were carried out with 10 GPs, one PN and two practice managers. In relation to feasibility practitioners overall considered the use of PROMS to be feasible. Positive feedback on using PROMs included: help with communication, encouraging patients to feed back on symptoms, feel listened to and taken seriously (particularly the PSYCHLOPS); help with treatment planning, confirming decisions, and measuring progress; providing structure in a consultation which could save time; and not missing anything (especially the PHQ-9). Negative feedback included: PROMS are too simplistic (especially the Distress Thermometer), could be difficult for patients to complete (due to insufficient health literacy, sensitive questions or wanting to give the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; answer), take time to complete in consultations and may depersonalise interactions. Important areas that would need to be improved to smooth their use in practice included further clarification of patient inclusion criteria, choosing measures that are easy for patients to complete, and more guidance on what to do with the PROM results once completed.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Methodological changes</title><p>Several changes were needed to overcome difficulties in recruiting and following up patients.</p><p>As response rates to the practice mail-outs were lower than 10%, we obtained ethics approval to send a revised patient information leaflet which used varied font sizes and coloured text to be more eye-catching, and for PNs to telephone non-responding participants 2&#x02005;weeks after mail-outs to follow them up more actively (this did not apply to those who had responded to say they were not interested, only those who had not responded at all). However, in the event, the telephone calls did not yield any more participants.</p><p>The follow-up research assessments were originally intended to be completed face to face, but we obtained ethics approval to send the research assessment questionnaires by post if patients failed to attend follow-up after two requests. We also obtained approval to send patients a &#x000a3;10 high street shopping gift voucher with the follow-up questionnaires sent by post. These changes between them helped improve follow-up rates by around 10%.</p><p>Another change was approved to facilitate active follow-up of non-responding patients. If they did not complete follow-up questionnaires in person or by post, the study team was permitted to try to contact them and complete the primary outcome measure (BDI-II), and two other key outcome measures (WSAS and EQ-5D-5L), over the telephone. However, in the event, no non-responders could be reached by telephone.</p><p>Finally, approval was given for an additional practice administrative staff review of the medical records of recruited participants at the end of their participation, as we were able to gather only limited information on service use through the patient questionnaires. These record reviews provided extra information on prescribed medication, number of visits to GPs, PNs and community-based staff, secondary care contacts, hospital admissions and length of hospitalisation where appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Principal findings</title><p>It is feasible to carry out a randomised trial of PROMs for the assessment and follow-up of depression in primary care in England, although recruitment rates and follow-up rates, particularly in the control arm, would need improving significantly for a larger, definitive trial. Intervention arm patients were happy to complete the PROMs and research outcome questionnaires and valued seeing the results. Differences between arms suggest PROMs may reduce depressive symptoms, yet also reduce patient satisfaction, perhaps because GPs appeared not to value using PROM results to influence management.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The trial was pragmatic, with few exclusion criteria, and readily generalisable to UK primary care, although the small number of patients recruited in some of the practices raises the question of how representative the sample was of all patients with new episodes of depression. Practices were able to recruit patients in GP/PN consultations and through staff mail-outs to patients, but two practices had to be dropped because of non-recruitment after several months, and difficulties in recruitment in other practices meant we recruited only 47 of the target of 48 patients.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to intervention or control, with concealment of allocation from patients until after informed consent had been obtained and baseline measures had been completed. However patients, practitioners and assessors could not be blinded to allocation during the trial given the nature of the intervention, although the use of self-report research outcome measures should have prevented observer rating bias.</p><p>The study was necessarily small in keeping with testing feasibility, but in spite of this, we did find a difference in the primary outcome measure between arms at 12&#x02005;weeks follow-up, favouring the intervention. The adjusted difference between arms at 12&#x02005;weeks as a percentage of the score in the control group was 5.8/19.22=30.1%, which is greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of a 17.5% reduction in scores from baseline found to correspond to patients' global reports of significant improvement.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> We did not determine how many practitioners actually gave feedback on the PROMs to their patients, but our patient interviews suggest not all practitioners did. This might have influenced the clinical outcome of the study, yet some benefit was identified nevertheless.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>The results are in keeping with a US primary care-based controlled trial of feeding back PHQ-9 scores to family practitioners at diagnosis and follow-up, which demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes over 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The difference in outcome could not be explained in terms of any significant differences in management, but the benefits of feeding back scores seemed to arise from increasing patients' awareness of their symptoms and their ability to report relevant changes.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> That may explain why our patients may have derived benefit from using PROMs even when their GPs did not seem to use the results to inform their care.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Implications for clinicians, policymakers and research</title><p>The implications are mainly for the design of a definitive trial rather than for practice at this stage, although clinicians, policymakers and research funders might be persuaded of the need for a more definitive trial on the basis that short-term differences in outcome favouring the use of PROMs were identified even in this small sample.</p><p>To facilitate recruitment, and ensure as representative a sample of patients as possible, a definitive trial should aim to recruit more patients per practice from a smaller number of more committed practices, rather than fewer patients each from a larger number of practices. Depressed patients are often viewed as in need of protection by GPs, who may feel introducing research is intrusive.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A lack of skills in introducing research could be addressed through more training in a smaller group of practices.</p><p>Follow-up at 12&#x02005;weeks of 82% was sufficient in the intervention arm, but needs to be improved from 72% in the control arm, and follow-up at 26&#x02005;weeks needs to be improved from 68% and 60%, respectively, through taking steps to maintain better contact with patients, obtaining mobile phone numbers, postal and email addresses, and permission to post, text, telephone or email them, as a significant proportion failed to meet face-to-face or complete and return the measures sent by post. Participating practitioners should also be trained to remind patients of their involvement in the study when they attend review appointments. It is possible that some of the apparent benefit of the intervention was due to the extra attention patients received, so it is important to have similar follow-up rates in the two arms.</p><p>Current demands on practices, and the expansion of less than full-time working, make it increasingly difficult to provide continuity of care, which may explain why participating patients sometimes found it difficult to get follow-up appointments with the same GP. Therefore, it will be important to recruit practices where all GPs and PNs in the practice agree to be involved in the study and to be trained in recruiting, consenting and following up all eligible patients, and looking at the results of PROMs for all those in the intervention arm. In a definitive trial, practices should be cluster randomised to streamline recruitment and follow-up, so all patients in each are treated the same, by whichever GP or PN they see.</p><p>Cluster randomisation tends to require a larger sample due to clustering by practice (the design effect), although the increase in sample size necessary appears likely to be small based on this study. There was no evidence of clustering at baseline, but the study may not have been large enough to permit an accurate estimation of the true value of the ICC and it would be sensible in a larger trial to make an allowance for clustering. After controlling for baseline and randomisation group, the ICC for the BDI-II at 12&#x02005;weeks was 0.03. The ICC for the BDI-II from a previous trial of antidepressants for mild to moderate depression in primary care was 0.02;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> therefore, an ICC of 0.03 might be appropriate to use to calculate the design effect if the definitive trial is cluster randomised. This is a relatively small ICC, but if a smaller number of practices each recruiting more patients is recruited, the design effect will be greater as it increases with increasing cluster size.</p><p>Practice logs and recruitment rates in the better recruiting practices show the numbers of eligible patients per group practice will allow for more than six patients to be recruited per year, given greater commitment. Having a relatively smaller number of practices recruit more patients each will be more efficient in terms of travel to practices by the research team, and allow greater contact to be maintained with participating staff in each, to optimise practice commitment.</p><p>Administration of PROMs needs to be streamlined, and GPs provided with more guidance on how to assess the results, to avoid disappointing patients by not using the PROMs to inform care. Patients may benefit from being provided with a record of their PROM scores so they can monitor their progress.</p><p>The study team needs to spend more time at participating practices training them in the recruitment process and assisting them with setting up database searches. Practices should complete a trial recruiting period to assess their commitment, and practice research costs should be reimbursed on a per-patient/per-mail-out basis rather than paying them a lump sum at the beginning of the trial, to incentivise recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Even in this small sample, the findings suggest that the use of PROMs may be beneficial in the short term, although maybe not in the longer term. It provides support for our plan to take forward a larger, definitive trial. Before we proceed however, we need to do some more work with potential participants, to identify the most promising PROM. Given that some practitioners found them time consuming and wanted more guidance on how to take account of the results in their treatment decisions, encouraging more practitioners to use PROMs requires identifying relatively brief measures which can potentially change management.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Rachel Ryves <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/rachelryves">@rachelryves</ext-link>, Christopher Dowrick <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/cfd1951">@cfd1951</ext-link> and Tony Kendric k@tony_kendrick</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TK, BS, GML, AWAG, LY, CD, GL and MM made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work.
