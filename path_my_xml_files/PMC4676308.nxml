cells in this disease. We examined the clinical and immunological response patterns of 100 subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving 3 different intravenous dosing regimens of the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab (1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;mg/kg or 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mg/kg on Day 1, or 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mg/kg on Days 1, 15 and 29) or placebo in a phase 2 trial. Baseline biopsies revealed typical features of active psoriasis, including epidermal accumulation of neutrophils and formation of microabscesses in &#x0003e;60% of cases. Neutrophils were the numerically largest fraction of infiltrating cells containing IL-17 and may store the cytokine preformed, as IL-17A mRNA was not detectable in neutrophils isolated from active plaques. Significant clinical responses to secukinumab were observed 2&#x000a0;weeks after a single infusion, associated with extensive clearance of cutaneous neutrophils parallel to the normalization of keratinocyte abnormalities and reduction of IL-17-inducible neutrophil chemoattractants (e.g. <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CXCL8</italic>); effects on numbers of T cells and CD11c-positive dendritic cells were more delayed. Histological and immunological improvements were generally dose dependent and not observed in the placebo group. In the lowest-dose group, a recurrence of neutrophils was seen in some subjects at Week 12; these subjects relapsed faster than those without microabscesses. Our findings are indicative of a neutrophil&#x02013;keratinocyte axis in psoriasis that may involve neutrophil-derived IL-17 and is an early target of IL-17A-directed therapies such as secukinumab.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IL-17A</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>secukinumab</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Several key mechanisms have been proposed as initiating and maintaining psoriasis, including the activation of dendritic cells by complexes of self-DNA and the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37, the presentation of putative auto-antigens to T lymphocytes, and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-23, tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) and IL-17A, leading to the activation of keratinocytes, which close the loop by producing antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37, chemoattractants and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-defensins <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. A central element in current disease models is the T-helper type-17 cell subset (Th17). Consistent with this concept, IL-23 (believed to mediate the crosstalk between dendritic and Th17 cells) and IL-17A (a key effector cytokine released from Th17 cells) have emerged as attractive targets for the development of new therapies for psoriasis. The clinical efficacy of ustekinumab &#x02013; an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-12 and IL-23 &#x02013; and antibodies directed against IL-17A and the IL-17 receptor A chain has been taken as evidence that the IL-23/Th17 axis is indeed central to the pathophysiological cascade of psoriasis <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. More recently, inflammatory cells other than Th17 &#x02013; in particular, neutrophils, a numerically important component of the infiltrate in active psoriasis &#x02013; have also been suggested as sources of IL-17A <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. IL-17A not only contributes to the epidermal abnormalities typical of psoriasis, but also induces the expression of chemokines in keratinocytes such as GRO-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (<italic>CXCL1</italic>) and IL-8 (<italic>CXCL8</italic>), which orchestrate the recruitment of neutrophils to psoriatic lesions <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>To further dissect the role of different sources of IL-17A in psoriasis, this study investigated serial biopsies taken from active plaques at Baseline and treatment Weeks 2 and 12 during a phase 2 trial in which subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis received 1 of 3 induction regimens with the IL-17A-selective antibody secukinumab. Two weeks after a single intravenous infusion of secukinumab, IL-17-containing neutrophils had almost completely disappeared parallel to a striking normalization of psoriatic epidermal changes and reduction of keratinocyte-derived, IL-17-inducible neutrophil chemoattractants. Our findings suggest that IL-17A is&#x000a0;not only part of an adaptive immune circuit involving specific T-cell subsets, but also part of an innate axis between neutrophils and keratinocytes that serves as an early target of anti-IL-17A antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>A total of 130 subjects were enrolled at 14 sites in the United States and Canada between December 2008 and July 2009. Subjects aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years were eligible if they had chronic plaque psoriasis for &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months, coverage of &#x02265;10% of their body surface area with plaques, an Investigator&#x02019;s Global Assessment score &#x02265;3 (scale of 0&#x02013;5) and a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score &#x02265;12. The study consisted of a 12-week induction period and a follow-up period up to Week 56 after the first dose of study drug. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 regimens of intravenous secukinumab (AIN457; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), a fully human immunoglobulin-G1<italic>&#x003ba;</italic> monoclonal antibody selective for IL-17A, or placebo in a 3:3:3:1 ratio (details regarding sample size calculation, randomization and blinding are provided in the Supporting Information). There were low- and mid- single-dose cohorts who received secukinumab 3 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg, respectively, infused on Day 1 (with placebo administered on Day 15 and Day 29) and a high-dose cohort who received three infusions of secukinumab 10&#x000a0;mg/kg at 2-week intervals. Infusions were given over 2&#x000a0;h. The primary objectives were to compare the change from Baseline in PASI score at Week 12 between cohorts and to determine the proportions of subjects who did not relapse at any time through Week 56.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportions of subjects with &#x02265;50%, &#x02265;75% and &#x02265;90% improvements from Baseline in PASI (PASI50/PASI75/PASI90), and changes in Investigator&#x02019;s Global Assessment and Dermatology Life Quality Index scores. One study site with 30 subjects was terminated prematurely because of data-quality concerns; the efficacy and safety data for 100 subjects (excluding those from the terminated site) are presented in this analysis. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the central independent ethics committees or institutional review boards in the participating countries. All study subjects provided written informed consent for their participation.

All 100 subjects included here had Baseline biopsies taken and biopsies from Weeks 2 and 12 were available from almost all subjects for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S1</xref>). One part of each biopsy was immediately embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek&#x000ae; O.C.T.&#x02122; Compound, Sakura Finetek, Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands), stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C and later processed for RNA extraction, while the other part was fixed in paraformaldehyde and used for histology and immunohistochemistry. All biopsies were handled and analysed by personnel blinded to treatment and time points.

In contrast, numbers of T lymphocytes and CD11c-positive dendritic cells decreased more slowly, and elevated levels of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells persisted at Week 12 (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2e</xref>, f). Thus, the kinetics of the effects of secukinumab on neutrophils paralleled the rapid epidermal improvement, in contrast to the more steady improvement observed for T lymphocytes and dendritic cells.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labelling for IL-17 and myeloperoxidase with a widely used affinity-purified polyclonal IL-17 antibody <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> revealed that epidermal neutrophils were the numerically predominant cell type containing IL-17 in active plaques. Blocking experiments with recombinant human IL-17A and IL-17F confirmed that the anti-IL-17 polyclonal antibody primarily detects IL-17A, with some possible cross-reactivity with IL-17F (see Supporting Information and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>). IL-17 was detected in Munro&#x02019;s microabscesses (accumulations of neutrophils in the stratum corneum) and spongiform pustules of Kogoj (accumulations of neutrophils in the stratum spinosum), as well as in single neutrophils in the dermis (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3b</xref>). Small subsets of lesional T cells (CD3 positive) and dermal mast cells (tryptase positive; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S5</xref>) were also found to contain IL-17, in line with earlier findings <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Unlike neutrophils, however, mast cells remained essentially unchanged in number in response to IL-17A blockade (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3a</xref>, S6c).</p><p>IL-17A mRNA could be detected in T cells, but not in mast cells or neutrophils by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of sorted cell preparations from psoriatic lesions, and IL-17A mRNA was also absent in peripheral blood granulocytes isolated from subjects with psoriasis (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3c</xref>, d).

No consistent effects on histological or molecular parameters were observed in the placebo group.</p><p>In light of the rapid clearance of neutrophils after infusion of secukinumab, which occurred in parallel to the improvement of epidermal changes and clinical signs of psoriasis, it was speculated that reoccurrence of these cells may contribute to early clinical relapse. The finding that epidermal and dermal neutrophils, as well as neutrophil-attracting chemokines, became detectable in the low-dose cohort in about a third of the Week-12 biopsies in association with an increase in clinical disease activity between Weeks 10 and 12 supported this hypothesis (Figs<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2c</xref>, d, h). Indeed, subjects in the low-dose group with detectable epidermal microabscesses at Week 12 had a shorter time to relapse than those without epidermal neutrophils (14.0 vs 28.0 weeks; <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.04; Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).

Treatment with secukinumab led to dose-dependent improvements of psoriasis during a 12-week period, with PASI75 (PASI90) response rates of 40% (10%), 75% (54.2%) and 82.6% (75.9%) achieved in the low-, mid- and high-dose cohorts, respectively. Particularly in the high-dose cohort, this effect was long-lasting (no relapse in half of the patients through Week 40 with the last dose received at Week 4). The clinical efficacy and safety profile observed was consistent with the findings of two phase 3 trials [FIXTURE (Full&#x000a0;year Investigative eXamination of secukinumab vs eTanercept Using two dosing Regimens to determine Efficacy in psoriasis) and ERASURE (Efficacy of Response And Safety of two fixed secUkinumab REgimens in psoriasis)] using subcutaneous doses of secukinumab <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.

Th17 cells produce, among other cytokines, different members of the IL-17 family, such as IL-17A and IL-17F, which are overexpressed in active plaques <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, and their differentiation and maturation is thought to critically depend on IL-23 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Within this paradigm, the principal interpretation of the high levels of clinical improvement of psoriasis in response to treatment with ustekinumab (which targets the p40 molecule shared by IL-12 and IL-23), as well as of the emerging data indicating even higher response rates for antibodies against IL-17A (blocking IL-17A homodimers and IL-17A/F heterodimers) and IL-17 receptor A (potentially blocking IL-17A, IL-17AF, IL-17F, IL-17C and IL-17E), has been that these therapies antagonize major effector cytokines related to the IL-23/Th17 axis <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Until now, this view has remained largely unchallenged despite the identification of other cellular sources of IL-17, in particular mast cells and neutrophils <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Neutrophils have not been a primary focus of recent models of psoriasis pathophysiology, although they represent a numerically dominant and characteristic component of the inflammatory infiltrate in this disease. In fact, the epidermal accumulation of neutrophils and formation of Munro&#x02019;s microabscesses are histological hallmarks of psoriasis and likely reflect the presence of innate immune mechanisms within the psoriasis inflammatory cascade.</p><p>Based on the investigation of large numbers of biopsies, the present study confirms earlier findings of smaller studies <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> that the number of IL-17-containing T cells in active psoriasis is small (&#x0003c;10% of CD3-positive cells) and that neutrophils, especially when Munro&#x02019;s microabscesses are present, are the numerically dominant cell type with IL-17 detectable by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>There has been some discussion of whether neutrophils only release preformed IL-17 or actually synthesize IL-17 mRNA and protein in the skin. In the present study, IL-17A mRNA was detected in T cells, but not in neutrophils isolated from psoriatic plaques (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3d</xref>); thus, these findings would favour an IL-17 protein storage model. Expression of IL-17A mRNA in conjunction with ROR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>t co-expression and release of IL-17 by extracellular trap formation was, however, observed in epidermal neutrophils in a recent investigation of 2 models of human skin inflammation <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The ability of neutrophils to produce IL-17A mRNA and protein under control of ROR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>t in response to IL-6 and IL-23, both of which are overexpressed in psoriatic plaques <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, was also demonstrated in another study investigating human and mouse neutrophils <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Based on these different findings, it is not fully clear at present whether IL-17 found in cutaneous neutrophils in active psoriasis is newly synthesized <italic>in loco</italic> or is contained preformed in neutrophils entering the skin, similar to what has been observed for other neutrophil-derived mediators such as TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>
<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. While available data from other studies and the data presented here suggest that neutrophils are a relevant source of IL-17 in psoriasis, further work is required to clarify whether, and at which stage of their development, or under which conditions, the synthesis of IL-17 in neutrophils actually occurs.</p><p>Based on our findings on the kinetics of changes in T cells, CD11c-positive dendritic cells, neutrophils and keratinocytes, as well as the expression of key cytokines and chemoattractive mediators following treatment with secukinumab, some relevant conclusions can be drawn: The most prominent observation 2&#x000a0;weeks after a single infusion of the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab was a significant reduction in psoriatic epidermal abnormalities (hyperparakeratosis, acanthosis and hyperproliferation), together with strongly decreased mRNA expression levels of keratinocyte-derived chemokines GRO-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (<italic>CXCL1</italic>) and IL-8 (<italic>CXCL8</italic>) and an almost complete clearance of epidermal IL-17-positive neutrophils. Secukinumab may therefore interfere with the influx of neutrophils into psoriatic lesions indirectly by abrogating the effect of IL-17A on keratinocytes and other cells (e.g. endothelial cells) involved in neutrophil recruitment <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In addition, secukinumab may target direct effects of IL-17A on neutrophil survival and activation, as previously described <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Early normalization of the epidermal microarchitecture could help explain the magnitude of the clinical improvement observed at Week 2, with &#x0223c;60% of subjects treated with the highest dose of secukinumab achieving a PASI75 response at that time point; a similar response pattern was observed for the anti-IL-17A antibody ixekizumab <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. It should also be noted that there was a substantial early reduction of mRNA expression levels of IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, and especially IL-17A and F, but not of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2g</xref>). As we could detect IL-17A mRNA only in T cells isolated from psoriatic lesions, which are also regarded as the main source of IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, a possible explanation is an early inhibition of T-cell cytokine production by anti-IL-17A treatment.</p><p>At Week 12, secukinumab had also reduced the number of lesional CD11c-positive dendritic cells and T cells similar to what has been proposed to coincide with more final disease resolution during treatment with other targeted therapies for psoriasis <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Following the early effects on epidermal changes, neutrophil influx and cytokine synthesis, this normalizing effect of secukinumab on relevant cells and mediators of adaptive skin immunity likely contributes to the observed sustainability of the clinical response, with disease control maintained in many subjects for &#x0003e;30 weeks after the last infusion of the drug.</p><p>Taken together, the results of the present study strengthen the view that neutrophils are a potential source of IL-17 in psoriasis and newly identify these cells as an early cellular target of the novel class of IL-17-directed therapies. Although blockade of IL-8 and neutrophil apheresis have shown some effects in pustular variants of psoriasis <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, it is unlikely that targeting of neutrophils or single neutrophil-chemotactic factors alone will be a successful therapeutic approach in plaque-type psoriasis. We propose a model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S7</xref>) in which the early response to anti-IL-17A antibodies such as secukinumab involves the interruption of a neutrophil&#x02013;keratinocyte crosstalk in which IL-17 derived from T&#x000a0;cells, and potentially neutrophils, stimulates the epidermal production of chemokines that, in turn, orchestrate the further influx of neutrophils into psoriatic lesions, while the full and long-term clinical response is associated with the reduction of lesional dendritic cells and T cells. The observed rapid epidermal clearance of neutrophils is considered to be an important element of IL-17A inhibition in psoriasis as these cells &#x02013; through the release of mediators such as TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, LL-37 and IL-17A &#x02013; perpetuate and enhance the abnormal defense programme characteristic of the disease <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This trial and publication were funded by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.
