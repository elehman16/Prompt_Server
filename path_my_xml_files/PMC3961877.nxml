However, it leads to unavoidable toxicities in the form of systemic alterations and local lesions such as mucositis, loss of taste, decreased salivation, microbial colonization, dysphagia, and osteoradionecrosis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The local toxicities clearly outweigh the systemic complaints both in severity and difficulty in management.</p><p>Annually, there are approximately 400,000 cases of treatment-induced damage to the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Oral mucositis is the most frequently occurring painful and dose-limiting side-effect of therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Conventional fractionation schedules cause grade 3 and grade 4 mucositis in approximately 25% of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] whereas, accelerated regimes like concomitant boost or hyperfractionation increase the same to 50%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Addition of concomitant chemotherapy during the radiotherapy further aggravates these lesions leading to significant morbidity, odynophagia, dysguesia, and subsequent dehydration and malnutrition.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Furthermore, modifications and dose reductions in the treatment schedule, more so with concurrent chemotherapy, to allow for resolution of these lesions can directly compromise patient survival. Different interventions are currently practiced with varying benefits, but there is no consensus on the most effective way to prevent or treat this most distressing complication.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In several animal species, glutamine was shown to be the major respiratory fuel for the intestinal tract.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Moreover, reduction of plasma glutamine levels by administration of glutaminase caused edema and ulceration of the intestinal mucosa as well as patchy areas of necrosis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Glutamine may help decrease mucous membrane injury induced by radiation by altering the inflammatory response. Glutathione, a byproduct of glutamine metabolism protects against oxidant injury.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Glutathione is an antagonist to prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production, which is a strong inflammatory mediator. Klimberg <italic>et al</italic>. used a rat breast cancer model to show that glutamine-supplemented rats with mammary tumors had greater glutamine and glutathione concentrations, and decreased PGE<sub>2</sub> production than rats that received no glutamine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In another study, PGE<sub>2</sub> levels from the tissues obtained by serial mucosal biopsies from dogs experiencing acute radiation effects increased with increasing inflammation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In patients with cancer, marked glutamine depletion develops over time; cancer cachexia is marked by massive depletion of skeletal muscle glutamine. This can have a negative impact on the function of host tissues that are dependent upon adequate stores of glutamine for optimal functioning.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, the extent of normal tissue damage from radiation or chemotherapy may be influenced by the presence of adequate tissue glutamine stores. Both of these facts suggest a possible therapeutic role for glutamine in the prevention of host normal tissue toxicity during cancer treatment.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>A recent pilot trial by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that oral glutamine suspension may significantly reduce the duration and severity of objective oral mucositis during radiotherapy. It may also shorten the duration of &#x02265; grade 3 mucositis. Similar observations were made by Dr. Silvermann in his review article on oral mucositis.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, an adequately powered randomized clinical study required to establish these findings has not been carried out so far, to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>Oral administration of glutamine is a convenient way of providing nutrients to patients with the preserved oral intake. Therefore, we proceeded to perform this study where the utility of glutamine was tested in head neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy at our clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized, prospective single institutional case control study was performed between April 2012 and November 2012 comparing the influence of oral glutamine on radiation induced mucositis in head and neck malignancy patients. Adult subjects with biopsy-proven malignant neoplasms of the head and neck region, who were assigned to receive radical radiotherapy and performance status not worse than 50% according to the Karnofsky performance status scale, were included. Patients who had received prior radiotherapy, or in whom the intent of radiotherapy was palliative were excluded. Permission from the Institutional Ethical Committee was obtained. After obtaining informed consent, 70 patients with head and neck cancer receiving definitive or adjuvant radiation therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive either oral glutamine suspension daily 2 hours before radiation; study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water) (<italic>n</italic> = 35) or nothing before radiation; control arm (<italic>n</italic> = 35). Glutamine crystalline powder in sachets, each containing 10 g, 1 sachet dissolved in 1 liter of water was consumed daily within 2 hours before radiation. Patients were instructed to swish their mouths first with the glutamine solution and then swallow within 2 hours before radiation treatment 5 days/week on treatment days only. Patients who took upto 800 ml of glutamine solution on an average were also accepted. Radiation was administered at 2 Gy/fraction daily, 5 days a week. We evaluated the grading of oral mucositis every week during external beam radiotherapy. We stopped radiation when the patients developed grade 3 or grade 4 mucositis.</p><p>Prior to allocation, the patients were stratified by Radiotherapy (RT) treatment field (facial, cervical, and cervico-facial) and by age (&#x0003c;60 and &#x0003e;60 years). Age stratification was used because at age 60 years, around 40% of the population reported xerostomia,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which was an important factor for mucositis.</p><p>Mucositis was scored weekly using the World Health Organization method as follows: Grade 1, soreness and erythema; grade 2, erythema or ulcers but can eat solid-foods; grade 3, ulcers, can take liquid only; and grade 4, cannot swallow even liquids.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Weekly grading of mucositis, onset and duration of mucositis were recorded and compared. Gender, race, tumor histology, tumor stage, tumor treatment modality, and RT area were analyzed as categorical variables; significance was tested by Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and by <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables. Frequencies and Fisher exact tests were used to analyze contingency outcomes by an independent variable and by patient characteristics.
