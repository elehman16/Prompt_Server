Behavioral mechanisms may activate physiological mechanisms.</p><p>Literature suggests that antidepressant medicines (ADMs) may also affect CVD risk factors and outcomes either negatively or positively. Some ADMs, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Findings on the association between other widely used ADMs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin&#x02013;noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and cardiovascular outcomes are mixed.

Here we assessed the temporal dynamics of elevated depression symptoms and ADM use with selected CVD risk factors during the first 4 years of Look AHEAD. Our specific aim was to determine whether elevated depression symptoms or ADM use were independently associated with subsequent elevated CVD risk factors over trial years 1&#x02013;4, controlled for baseline characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, history of CVD, and diabetes duration, as well as CVD risk factor status in the prior year.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Look AHEAD is a randomized clinical trial of 5,145 overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes designed to assess the long-term effect (up to 14 years) of a comprehensive behavioral weight loss intervention on cardiovascular and other health outcomes. Participants were randomized to an ILI or to a diabetes support and education (DSE) treatment arm. The ILI included goals for diet modification (1200&#x02013;1800 kcal/day based on initial weight and physical activity (175 min of moderate physical activity per week), designed to induce at least 7% weight loss at year 1 and to maintain weight loss in subsequent years. ILI participants were seen weekly for the first 6 months and 3 times per month for the next 6 months. During years 2&#x02013;4, participants were seen individually at least once a month and contacted another time each month by telephone or e-mail. DSE participants were invited to three group sessions each year. Sessions followed a standard protocol and covered diet, exercise, and social support, without addressing behavioral strategies.</p><p>Their personal physicians provided medical care for all participants. These physicians made changes in medications, with the exception of changes in diabetes medication made by Look AHEAD physicians when an ILI participant was losing substantial weight.

The BDI lists 21 symptoms, with responses scored from 0 to 3 in ascending symptom severity, and total scores ranging from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more symptom burden.

These significant associations were most common for ADM use in the ILI treatment arm, but the analyses reported here were not designed to explicate treatment arm differences in these associations. Thus, the available data do not allow us to determine the reasons for these findings.</p><p>We assessed CVD risk factors in the five domains of glycemia, lipids, blood pressure, smoking, and BMI, all of which are well-documented risk factors for CVD morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We found that at least one indicator from each of these domains was increased in the presence of elevated depression symptoms or ADM use. Overall, there were more significant associations of CVD risk factors with ADM use than with depression symptoms.</p><p>We found little evidence for a temporal relationship between elevated depression symptoms and subsequent increases in positive CVD risk factor status. Others have reported that depression is associated with physiological abnormalities that could contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including abnormalities that are likely associated with depression per se, because they are observed in depressed patients who do not have CVD. These abnormalities include increased inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal platelet activation, elevated catecholamine levels, high sympathetic tone, and hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Of these abnormalities, we assessed only hypercholesterolemia, with mixed findings, as reported above.</p><p>We note that elevated depression screening scores are often more reflective of general emotional distress than major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and in patients with diabetes, they may reflect diabetes-related distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Although depression-screening tools like the BDI have acceptable psychometric properties for detecting major depressive disorder, they often yield high rate of false-positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>All CVD risk factor measures for which we found statistically significant associations with prior ADM use, except for HDL-cholesterol, have well documented associations with CVD morbidity and mortality. The current study does not allow us to assess the possible mechanisms that may account for the association between ADM use and subsequent CVD risk factor&#x02013;positive status. Future research should assess these mechanisms:</p><p>First, individuals taking ADMs may have had a history of more severe, chronic, or recurrent depression.</p><p>Second, some individuals may have a propensity to take medicines, including ADMs and medicines that would qualify them for elevated CVD risk factor status.</p><p>Third, ADMs may contribute directly to CVD risk. TCAs are known to contribute to hyperglycemia, elevated TG levels, and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Findings on the association between TCA use and BP levels are mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Most SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline) appear to have no substantial effect on glycemia, lipid levels, BP, or weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Among the SSRIs, fluoxetine has been associated with lower levels of glycemia and TG, and with weight loss, especially in the first 6 months of treatment, whereas paroxetine has been associated with the opposite effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Bupropion, a noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, has been associated with effects on glycemia, TG levels, and weight similar to fluoxetine, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine) and noradrenaline-serotonin specific agonists (mirtazapine) have been associated with effects on glycemia similar to paroxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). We found essentially the same pattern of associations between ADM use and subsequent CVD risk factor&#x02013;positive status for all ADMs and for non-TCA or tetracyclic ADMs. In the current study, about 80% of participants who were taking ADMs were taking non-TCAs or tetracyclic ADMs. The literature on the effects of ADMs on CVD risk factors does not provide a clear explanation for our findings. Future research should be designed to clarify the association between ADM use and CVD risk and the mechanisms that might account for this association, if any, is found.</p><p>The Markov models that we used introduce temporality into analyses to assess relationships that markers of depression in the prior year had with current CVD risk factors once the associations that prior risk factor status had with current status were controlled. Thus, the ORs that we report express the degree to which current CVD risk factor status is associated with prior markers of depression beyond what would be predicted by prior risk factor status alone. Current positive risk factor status can result from maintaining positive status from the prior year or from transitioning from prior negative status to current positive status. This approach offers insights that cannot be gained from the cross-sectional associations we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and strengthens the evidence for depression measures as drivers of CVD risk.</p><p>In general, our ancillary analysis findings confirmed the robustness of our original models. We found that the associations of depression symptoms and ADM use with CVD risk factors were independent of one another. We also found that the association of elevated BDI and continuous BDI with the CVD risk factors was equally strong. An analysis using log-transformed BDI scores also generated results very similar to our main analysis, as did tests for interactions of age with BDI scores and ADM use. The association between SSRI (or any non-TCA or tetracyclic) use and CVD risk factors was essentially the same as the association between all ADM use and CVD risk factors.</p><p>The ancillary analysis that controlled for weight change during the study provides additional insight into the possible effects of elevated depression symptoms and ADM use on CVD risk factor status. This ancillary analysis reduced the number of significant associations, especially with elevated depression symptoms, but many associations, especially those with ADM use, remained significant. This suggests that factors other than weight change account for some of the associations we found and that these factors must be better understood.</p><sec id="s13"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>This is the first study of which we are aware to simultaneously assess the independent association of two depression indicators&#x02014;symptoms and ADM use&#x02014; with subsequent CVD risk factor status in people with type 2 diabetes. Other study strengths include the large, multiethnic population and that depression symptoms, ADM use, and a broad range of cardiovascular risk factors were assessed systematically. Moreover, most CVD risk factors were assessed objectively rather than relying on self-reporting. Further, the design of the study, assessing depression indicators in the year prior to assessment of CVD, permitted us to draw inferences about directionality that are not possible in cross-sectional studies. The longitudinal design included assessment of depression indicators and CVD risk factors at multiple time points, enhancing the robustness of the findings.</p><p>The study also has important limitations. It was not a controlled trial assessing the effects of depression symptoms or ADM use on CVD risk factors; thus, we cannot draw definitive causal inferences. We did not study a comprehensive array of CVD risk factors, and factors such as inflammatory markers, endothelial cell dysfunction markers, and markers of kidney damage and oxidative stress were not included. Future studies of the relationship between depression indicators and CVD events will provide a more definitive picture of effects on overall CVD risk.</p><p>Another limitation is that we did not confirm that all patients took ADMs because of depression rather than for other indications, such as smoking cessation, neuropathic pain, or other psychiatric conditions, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This information was not collected.</p><p>Further, we had no information about the dosage or duration of treatment with ADMs before the start of the study. Also, some participants might have failed to disclose that they were taking ADMs, whereas others who reported that they were not taking ADMs at baseline might have discontinued them very recently. However, these possibilities would mitigate the likelihood of finding an association between ADM use and CVD risk factors; therefore, they would bias the estimated associations toward the null hypothesis. Finally, we were able to identify associations only with classes of ADM, not with specific ADM.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Research and clinical implications</title><p>Future research should include more robust assessment of depression symptoms and of the reason ADMs are used (i.e., for major depressive disorder or for other conditions).</p><p>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative population of adults with diabetes conducted in 1999&#x02013;2000, found that only 7.3% of respondents attained recommended levels of A1C, BP, and TC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). If elevated depression symptoms or taking ADM add to the challenges of achieving CVD risk factor control, clinicians should be especially attentive to the fact that these patients may need more aggressive treatment to control CVD risk factors. Although the clinical relevance of the associations we report is difficult to assess, we found a dramatic increase of 24 to &#x0003e;50% in the odds of positive status for some CVD risk factors in study participants who had elevated depression symptoms or who were taking an ADM in the preceding year. This finding warrants serious attention.</p><p>In conclusion, among Look AHEAD participants, elevated self-reported depression symptoms and ADM use in the prior year were each independently associated with some but not all CVD risk factors during the first 4 years of the trial; significant associations for elevated risk were most consistent for ADM use. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a potential causal link between ADM use and worsening of some CVD risk factors. Importantly, Look AHEAD will permit examination of the relationships between depression indicators and actual CVD outcomes, providing a fuller picture of the depression-CVD outcome relationship. In the meantime, more aggressive monitoring of CVD risk factors among depressed individuals and those using ADMs may be warranted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
