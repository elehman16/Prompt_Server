Midazolam, often in combination with opioids, is the current gold standard drug. However, as it is a far-from-ideal agent, clonidine is increasingly being used in children. This drug is prescribed off-label for this indication, as many drugs in paediatrics are. Therefore, the CLOSED trial aims to provide data on the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of clonidine for the sedation of mechanically ventilated patients in order to obtain a paediatric-use marketing authorisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The CLOSED study is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled non-inferiority trial with a 1:1 randomisation between clonidine and midazolam. Both treatment groups are stratified according to age in three groups with the same size: &#x0003c;28 days (n=100), 28 days to &#x0003c;2 years (n=100) and 2&#x02013;18 years (n=100). The primary end point is defined as the occurrence of sedation failure within the study period. Secondary end points include a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship, pharmacogenetics, occurrence of delirium and withdrawal syndrome, opioid consumption and neurodevelopment in the neonatal age group. Logistic regression will be used for the primary end point, appropriate statistics will be used for the secondary end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents/caregivers. Verbal or deferred consent will be used in the sites where national legislation allows. The study has institutional review board approval at recruiting sites. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and shared with the worldwide medical community.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>EudraCT: 2014-003582-24; Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02509273; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sedation</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>criticalillness</kwd><kwd>paediatrics</kwd><kwd>pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The dosing scheme being used in this trial is based on detailed pharmacokinetic&#x000a0;(PK)/pharmacodynamic modelling data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pain and sedation are measured using a standardised assessment scheme&#x02014;(COMFORT-B score)&#x02014;across all participating units.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Besides information on the efficacy and safety of clonidine in critically ill children, this trial will provide population-based PK information in this specific patient population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age-specific formulations are being used in this trial, which can be marketed afterwards.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A previous similar trial indicated challenging recruitment, this could be a potential threat to this trial.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Unlicensed and off-label drug use</title><p>In Europe, &#x0003c;30% of marketed drugs include results from paediatric clinical trials and other information on paediatric use in their documentation (Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) or Product Leaflet).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This results in widespread off-label use in paediatrics, especially in the case of old drugs that have never received a paediatric authorisation. Off-label paediatric use (including all the uses not listed in the SPC<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) in Europe accounts for 45%&#x02013;60% of the total number of prescriptions, with rates of up to 90% in patients admitted to neonatal&#x000a0;(NICU) or paediatric intensive care units&#x000a0;(PICU).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>The entry into force of the Paediatric Regulation in 2007<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> gave an important stimulus to support the development of medicines for children by introducing a specific measure to favour work on off-patent medicines, the so-called Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA). A PUMA application should include the submission of paediatric data in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).</p><p>According to article 40 of the Regulation, the European Commission (EC) reserved funds &#x02018;to develop off-patent medicinal products with recognised therapeutic interest for children and included in a &#x02018;Priority List&#x02019; adopted by the European Medicines Agency&#x000a0;(EMA) through its Paediatric Committee (Seventh Framework Programme for Research HEALTH&#x02014;(2007&#x02013;2013) Programme area&#x02014;topic 4.2&#x02013;1). Among 20 projects approved,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the CLOSED project was granted with the aim to develop an age-appropriate formulation of clonidine for sedation in PICU, in line with the EMA &#x02018;Revised Priority List for Studies into Off-Patent Paediatric Medicinal Products&#x02019; 2012.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In order to specifically meet this therapeutic need, a comprehensive development plan in the form of a PIP was submitted to the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in July 2012 and approved in January 2013. In March 2015, a modification of the PIP was proposed after the finalisation of the clinical study protocol. This modification was approved by the PDCO in August 2015.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Analgosedation in PICU</title><p>Approximately 2% of all paediatric patients admitted to hospital require treatment in PICU.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Most PICU admissions are unplanned emergencies, mainly in the context of congenital heart diseases (40%), respiratory diseases (20%), major trauma (15%) and neurological problems other than trauma (&#x0003c;10%).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Often, mechanical ventilation is required for facilitating recovery after major surgery or for treating respiratory failure. In most of these cases, analgosedation using potent opioids and sedatives is mandatory to reduce metabolic rate and oxygen demand, assist mechanical ventilation, avoid inadvertent self-extubation and lower anxiety and distress.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> To this effect, a variety of agents are used in NICU and PICU, such as opioids, GABA-receptor agonists, N-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor&#x000a0;(NMDA)-receptor antagonists and &#x003b1;2-receptor agonists.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Opioids</title><p>The main opioids used in PICU and NICU are morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil. Opioids bind to the &#x003bc;-receptor in the central nervous system (CNS), and provide analgesia as well as sedation.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>GABA-receptor agonists</title><p>GABA receptors have an inhibitory effect on the CNS. Benzodiazepines agonise these receptors and therefore have sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. Disadvantages are paradoxal reactions (agitation and confusion) and tolerance and withdrawal after prolonged use.</p><p>Propofol is a unique agent with GABA-ergic properties as well as anti-NMDA and sodium channel blocking effects. Propofol is not suitable for long-term sedation, due to the perceived risk of propofol infusion syndrome, a metabolic derangement accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hyperlipidaemia, rhabdomyolysis and organ failure, associated with an increased risk of mortality.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Midazolam</title><p>Midazolam is the most widely used sedative agent in PICU. It is a short-acting benzodiazepine (T<sub>max</sub> of 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;min after intravenous injection) with a half-life of 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;hours (up to 12&#x02009;hours in neonates). Besides sedation and anxiolysis, midazolam also provides anterograde amnesia, thus minimising children's recall of unpleasant experiences after a PICU admission.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Midazolam is mainly metabolised to the equipotent metabolite 1-OH-midazolam&#x000a0;(1-OH-MDZ), and then glucuronidated to the renally excreted 1-OH-MDZ-glucuronide. Its main adverse effects include tolerance, dependence and withdrawal syndrome following discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Clonidine</title><p>Clonidine agonises the &#x003b1;2-adrenergic receptor. The reduced sympathetic outflow<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in the CNS results in sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Because of its analgesic properties, it has been used as an adjunct in surgical procedures as premedication or as a supplementary agent in regional anaesthesia.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The reduction of sympathetic outflow associated with clonidine may have specific benefits in critically ill children. A2&#x000a0;agonists can improve neurological outcome associated with ischaemic cerebral injury,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> the mechanism of action of which is unclear but may be due to suppression of extracellular glutamate and aspartate release during energy failure.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Recent data have also demonstrated that preconditioning before the insult can both reduce infarct size and improve neurological outcome after the insult.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Surgery and critical illness are associated with a variety of stress responses, which can result in organ dysfunction:<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> renal function deteriorates after both adult and paediatric cardiac surgery, and this effect is due in part to the increase in sympathetic outflow and the rise in circulating vasoconstrictors such as norepinephrine, vasopressin and angiotensin.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Clonidine has been demonstrated to suppress these responses and prevent the associated decline in renal function after adult cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, clonidine has independent local effects on tubular function which promote both diuresis and natriuresis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In terms of cardiovascular responses, reduction in stress responses by &#x003b1;2-agonists have been shown to reduce perioperative myocardial ischaemia in adults undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As the mechanism of action of clonidine is very different from the GABA-agonist midazolam, the hypothesis is postulated that it may be less associated with paediatric delirium and withdrawal syndrome. Moreover, clonidine is one of the agents used for the treatment of withdrawal syndrome.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1g"><title>Previous clinical trials</title><p>Clonidine is commonly used off-label in paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. Its use is recommended for the sedation of critically ill children in PICUs by the UK and German consensus guidelines<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 30</xref> and local hospital guidelines across Europe. Unfortunately, despite this widespread use of clonidine, there are limited data on efficacy, dose requirement and safety when used for sedation on PICUs.

An example of this is when a critically ill baby is delivered by caesarean section, the mother may still be under anaesthesia while another parent/legal guardian of the child may not be present. Therefore, given the nature of the trial, especially considering that ICU patients are often admitted as a result of emergency, deferred consent/assent, as described in Article 35 of the new European Regulation on clinical trials (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> is foreseen if allowed by local legislation, as described in section &#x02018;Ethical considerations&#x02019;.

A plasma clonidine concentration of around 2 &#x003bc;g/L gave adequate sedation combined with morphine infusion in ventilated PICU patients,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and 2 &#x003bc;g/L clonidine concentration also drops the Bispectral Index to 71 in adults.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Clonidine has a long elimination half-life (16.9&#x02009;hours in neonates, 11.4&#x02009;hours in infants and 7.4&#x02009;hours in children<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), so loading doses are proposed. It was therefore decided that loading and maintenance doses aimed at achieving steady-state concentrations of around 2 &#x003bc;g/L would be aimed for, and this scheme was designed by a PK/pharmacodynamic&#x000a0;(PD) expert working group within the CLOSED consortium. Based on these doses, a similar dose scheme of midazolam was designed that would maintain double blinding.</p><p>The agreed dosing scheme consists of 15&#x02009;min loading doses followed by a maintenance infusion rate. Increases or decreases, based on the evaluation of COMFORT-B and Nurses Interpretation of Sedation Score&#x000a0;(NISS) score, in infusion rate are permitted, and preceding any increase, a loading dose over 15&#x02009;min is specified. There are also compulsory lock-out times between each dose escalation or de-escalation to allow for&#x000a0;new steady-state conditions to be approached.

In V.1.0 of the protocol, dose reduction should be performed when a child is oversedated. After 30&#x02009;min, a new sedation assessment should be performed and acted on the same. In an oversedated child, this could lead to a child being without IMP after 90&#x02009;min (three dose reductions). This is certainly not a desirable situation, but not unthinkable as the half-life of both drugs are longer than 90&#x02009;min. Therefore, a 6-hour observation period has been implemented. After a dose reduction, it is recommended to wait for 6&#x02009;hours before the next dose reduction.</p><p>In this same amendment, another problem has been mitigated. Version 1.0 did not provide clear information about increasing the dose again after a prior decrease. In the amendment, it has been made clear that subjects having a decrease of maintenance infusion to&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1&#x02009;unit/kg/hour will return to 1&#x000a0;unit/kg/hour, irrespective of the current infusion rate. If the decrease has been made while increases before have led to a maintenance infusion rate of&#x000a0;&#x02265;1&#x02009;unit/kg/hour, reincrease will be following the precedent step (eg, if a decrease has taken place from 1.5 to 1 unit/kg/hour, reincreasing will return the rate back to 1.5 unit/kg/hour).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Pharmaceutical development</title><p>To overcome the potential for administration errors associated with commercially available clonidine ampoules, three different strengths of clonidine HCl&#x02014;low (250 &#x003bc;g/50&#x02009;mL), medium (500 &#x003bc;g/50&#x02009;mL) and high (2500 &#x003bc;g/50&#x02009;mL)&#x02014;have been developed.

</p><p>Based on clinical experience and the limited data available regarding the use of clonidine as a sedative agent in PICU, it is assumed that the sedation success rate for clonidine is higher than for midazolam.

Failure is defined as inadequate sedation with no further dose increases allowed in the dose titration scheme. This will be assessed by a nurse or physician using the COMFORT-B sedation assessment and, if appropriate, NISS. These assessment scales are open to a degree of subjectivity and it is therefore considered essential to have a double-blind study design to minimise bias due to knowledge of treatment group by the assessor.</p><p>In order to define the effect size, the expected success rate for midazolam was needed.

The sample size calculation is based on a logistic regression for the primary efficacy end&#x000a0;point of sedation success, with adjustment for study arm, age category and baseline COMFORT-B score. Non-inferiority of clonidine requires that the lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% CI for the OR of sedation success using clonidine (vs midazolam) is at least 0.583, which is equivalent to a 10% non-inferiority margin in case of a sedation success rate of 80%.

The sample size of 300 subjects also provides at least 70% power to prove non-inferiority with respect to sedation success rate for each age subgroup (&#x0003e;90 subjects per age subgroup). Since the sample size for the age subgroup analyses is limited, a 15% non-inferiority margin at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 is used, with an assumed sedation success rate of 80% in the midazolam group and 85% in the clonidine group.

The risk-benefit assessment has been carefully addressed considering IMP-related risks (including pharmacological properties and proposed dosing regimen of the IMP, information on use in target population, IMP development, IMP management) and expected benefits, the trial design (including study population inclusion and exclusion criteria), study-related procedures, qualification of the study team and host sites, rights of patients (including informed consent and assent procedures and data protection and confidentiality). Minor increase over minimal risk is anticipated for the CLOSED trial, as the study deals with a novel treatment modality in vulnerable paediatric patients and carries minor risk based on the available information about the study drug as well as randomised controlled trial (RCT)-related procedures. Important benefits for PICU population as a group are anticipated, since the study will provide clinically relevant and directly applicable results, expected to influence future standard of care.</p><p>The informed consent and assent process in this trial is in line with the applicable relevant regulatory documents, including Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Directive 2001/20/EC,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> the EC Detailed Guidance 2006,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Directive 95/46/EC,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects CIOMS-WHO (2002),<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> the Additional Protocol to the Oviedo Convention (2005),<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> ICH Topic E11 and the EC 2008 Paediatric Recommendations.

Midazolam has several advantages, but is by far not the ideal agent for longer-term sedation. Other agents have made their off-label entry into PICU, mainly based on adult practice. One of these agents is clonidine, which could have some specific advantages over midazolam. It is being used increasingly, but is still off-label. This study design allows for data collection on safety, efficacy, PK, pharmacogenomics and to a lesser extent neurological outcome. This multimodal approach generates data that is very useful for licensing clonidine for sedation in children. Moreover, application of different formulation strengths, allows for easier paediatric clinical implementation as the current available formulation (Catapresan) has only been developed for adults.</p></sec><sec id="s9b"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Despite the careful design of this trial, some limitations exist. First, we have chosen a non-inferiority design for this trial because, based on clinical experience and limited available data, we estimate the difference in sedation success rate will be very low. This would mean that showing superiority of clonidine requires a large sample size and thus compromising feasibility. This design, however, means that we cannot demonstrate possible superiority of clonidine. However, if equal efficacy is shown under safe circumstances, clonidine can be licensed for sedation in&#x000a0;PICU.</p><p>Second, the recruitment window has been set on 72&#x02009;hours. This could lead to confounding as having a large time window could increase the risk of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. A smaller recruitment window may reduce these risks but parents need some time to consider participation and not every study site has 24/7 research nurse availability.</p><p>Third, this trial has an extensive list of exclusion criteria. This could compromise the external validity of the results and could complicate implementation of the results in new guidelines. This is a known limitation of almost any controlled trial.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> However, these exclusion criteria are based on expected elements affecting both primary outcome and patient safety. Our primary end&#x000a0;point is based on a validated behavioural scale. Therefore, any disease status that can cause many fluctuations in behaviour (such as neurological injury) needed to be excluded from this trial for the results to be valid. The same holds for safety end&#x000a0;points such as cardiovascular stability. The decision to allow for inotropes/vasopressors in the second amendment is a big step towards generalisability of the results.</p></sec><sec id="s9c"><title>Role of researcher-driven studies, Seventh Framework Programme-funded projects</title><p>CLOSED is one of the 20 projects approved in the framework of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research that should specifically meet both criteria for scientific excellence and regulatory standards for high-quality paediatric research, as prescribed by the Paediatric Regulation, in order to put paediatric drugs on the market.

</p><p>In fact, paediatric clinical trials are often multinational and researchers need to know and apply rules from the regulatory, legal and ethical frameworks, acting both as investigators and as sponsor and/or other concerned parties. This is not simple considering the lack of harmonisation of clinical trial procedures among countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26037896">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26037896</ext-link>) and makes it necessary to prepare, agree and apply guidelines based on the EU rules.</p></sec><sec id="s9d"><title>Challenge to perform a trial compliant with GCP and other regulations</title><p>Clinical trials must follow the same rules, notwithstanding if sponsored by industry or non-profit organisations, from GCP to the new clinical trials regulation<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> to recommendations and guidelines.</p><p>Accordingly, the new regulation<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> recognises that a large proportion of clinical trials are conducted by non-commercial sponsors, frequently supported by public funds or charities and that these trials should be encouraged.</p><p>However, this means a heavy work from researchers and a deep knowledge of both EU and national rules. This issue is aimed to be overcome by the international public-private cooperation between different stakeholders foreseen by EU-funded projects (researchers, clinicians, regulatory and ethical experts, clinical research associates). On the other hand, it seems that the paediatric Consortia generated by the FP7 paediatric projects are conducting these studies and trials using a limited amount of money in comparison with the recognised cost of paediatric trials in an approved PIP which is estimated to be three to four times higher.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

However, a careful assessment of possible study-related risks has been performed. In general, side effects of IMP are the major cause of study-related risk. As midazolam is the gold standard treatment, the side effects do not contribute to an increased risk in this study. For clonidine, bradycardia and hypotension are the most clinically relevant side effects and are likely to occur most often during the loading doses and the early starting phase.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, a loading dose will be given as a 15&#x02009;min infusion instead of a direct bolus. Moreover, the setting where patients are being monitored consists of five well-equipped and experienced PICUs. Treatment of hypotension and/or bradycardia is common practice in the study population and should therefore not increase the risk to subjects dramatically.</p><p>Rebound hypertension could also be a side effect after sudden discontinuation of clonidine. In a comparable trial,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> this was observed once in 64 patients and resolved quickly without any intervention. Monitoring of blood pressure up to 72&#x02009;hours after IMP cessation has been included in the study protocol with the recommendation to treat hypertension according to local common practice.</p><p>Blood sampling is a possible risk to small children participating in drug research.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> In this study, the amount of sampled blood will not exceed the 3% of patient's plasma volume, which is a general limit of study-related blood sampling.</p><p>In general, as most elements of this study are similar to current clinical practice, the study-related risk to patients is deemed low.</p></sec><sec id="s9g"><title>Pharmacogenetics</title><p>This study incorporates a pharmacogenetics assessment of recruited patients.

</p><p>It is likely that in the participating centres with excellent research facilities, multiple trials are being performed at the same time. Children are not allowed to participate in multiple intervention studies, so we recommend to have a thorough look at the inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies and set up clear agreements about patient allocation.</p><p>Early extubation in cardiac surgery patients is now common practice, and estimations of recruitment rates have excluded these patients. However, it is likely that ventilation strategies will change over the coming years. We have recognised the increasing use of non-invasive ventilation such as Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). As these patients may still need continuous sedation, we will include these in the study. In general, patients on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) do not need additional sedation, thus these will be excluded.</p><p>Parental issues are to be expected in any clinical trial in the PICU. Parents having their child admitted to an ICU are under high stress and may therefore be reluctant to participate. In the calculations of estimated recruitment, a high refusal rate (approximately 40%&#x02013;50%) should be taken into account, based earlier experience with other trials. Also, a parent organisation is involved in the trial and they will provide information to parents from their perspective. We anticipated to include 300 patients within 18&#x02013;24 months in total. In The Netherlands, deferred consent is used in emergency care trials. The Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, has approved the use of deferred consent in this trial so this could be applied in the largest recruitment centre.</p><p>When faced with a critically ill child, doctors and nurses may tend towards conservatism. At the beginning of the SLEEPS trial, the involved professionals could have been afraid of the cardiovascular side effects of clonidine especially in unstable patients. Their study has shown that its use is relatively safe in critically ill children, as well as other literature.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 58</xref> Moreover, in the CLOSED consortium recruitment centres, a lot of clinical experience with clonidine has been built so caregivers may be less hesitant to support this clinical trial.</p><p>Research nurse time is always an issue, especially in the 24/7&#x000a0;business of an ICU. In the larger centres, dedicated researchers/nurses have been identified and trained adequately to perform this trial. In the smaller centres, Principle Investigators&#x000a0;(PI)s may be able to coordinate the lower amounts of participants.</p><p>During the first months of patient recruitment in two centres, no patients could be included. In the majority of cases, exclusion criteria made the screened patients ineligible. No consent was given in the very few eligible patients.

<italic>Use of clonidine in the last 7 days.</italic> As clonidine has a long half-life, patients would be excluded if they have received clonidine for any indication in the previous 7 days.

This has now been introduced for clonidine as well in the second protocol amendment.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A delay in study start has been encountered in the CLOSED study. Several obstacles, such as obtaining the appropriate licenses for handling, importing and exporting controlled drugs, have caused a significant delay in recruitment start. A second major issue has also been an amendment of the dose reduction scheme (see&#x000a0;the &#x02018;Study treatments&#x02019;&#x000a0;section). A third issue has been the generation of robust quality data that is sensitive enough to support a future PUMA application as well as the&#x000a0;Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier&#x000a0;(IMPD) and clinical trial application.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>
</p><p>Compliance with the protocol was a significant issue in the SLEEPS trial, as they provided a strict sedation regimen. Therefore, the CLOSED sedation regimen merely reflects clinical practice, although some important aspects may cause difficulties in clinical practice. The lock-out periods, for example, are not according to clinical practice and special attention needs to be paid by the research nurses and other investigators to keep the protocol compliance as tight as possible. When problems are recognised, the possibility of amendments should be discussed early. Early recognition is facilitated by implemented monthly investigators&#x02019; teleconferences.</p><p>Also, there will be an ongoing evaluation of the COMFORT-B scale training of the nurses in the participating centres. Good interobserver reliability is defined by a Cohen's kappa&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0.65&#x02009;and nurses in all centres have received training by trained nurses.</p><p>In summary, many known challenges should be managed by appropriate measures taken. However, there could always be unknown challenges and it is therefore crucial to have regular contact between principal investigators of each recruitment site.</p></sec><sec id="s9i"><title>Reflection</title><p>After 9 months of recruiting, we included far fewer children than anticipated. Therefore, two amendments have now been added to potentially increase the number of eligible patients. Unfortunately, recruitment did not improve. Even though we had been warned by the early discontinuation of the SLEEPS trial,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> we faced other challenges. For example, many postoperative neonates do not need any additional sedation to intravenous paracetamol and continuous intravenous morphine. Also, parents are reluctant to participate. Either they think their child is not stable enough, or their child is finally stable and therefore changes in treatment for study purposes are not welcomed.</p><p>Also, the anticipated recruitment rate was based on the number of admitted ventilated patients in previous years. However, this turned out to be a significant overestimation, a phenomenon also known as Lasagna's Law.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 62</xref> These challenges have a big impact on the feasibility of the trial and force us to consider alternative options. We will open (at least) two new recruitment sites, Bari (Italy) and Tallinn (Estonia). Furthermore, we need to rethink the primary objective of this study and may change it to a PK/PD study for which 50 patients in each arm are sufficient instead of the original 150 patients per arm.</p><p>The lessons from both the SLEEPS trial and this trial are important for further investigations in paediatric critical care and careful preparation is warranted for any trial performed in this population. This preparation should at least include adequate piloting over a longer period. In our experience, we monitored eligible patients over one&#x02009;month in one centre and expected no significant recruitment problems. This monitoring was performed during winter time, when many patients with respiratory viral infections in need of mechanical ventilation were admitted. This caused our expectations of eligible patients to be high; if we had performed this during summer time, we may have been warned earlier.</p><p>Other aspects to enhance the number of included patients are adequate staff training and motivation, collaboration with investigators having experience in paediatric critical care trials and keeping the exclusion criteria of a trial to a minimum.</p></sec><sec id="s9j"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started enrolling subjects in the summer of 2016 in Rotterdam and Erlangen, where ethical approval is available. To date, five patients are included. Recruitment in other sites will follow when ethical approval becomes available. The second amendment including changes of the exclusion criteria have been submitted to the ethical and regulatory institutions and approval has been obtained in Rotterdam and Erlangen. The current study protocol, including the second amendment, is V.3.0, dated 21 October 2016. In Rome, Prague and Stockholm, approval has only been given for protocol V.2.0, dated 22 February 2016. Approval for V.3.0 is expected in the first half of 2017.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e421" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016031.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e422" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016031.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AN and DT are the initiators of the study.
