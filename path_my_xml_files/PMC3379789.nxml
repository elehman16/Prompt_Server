The N&#x00101; Mikimiki (&#x0201c;the active ones&#x0201d;) Project is designed to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity over 18 months among multiethnic women with infants 2&#x02013;12 months old. The study was designed to test, via a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of a tailored telephone counseling of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity intervention compared to a print/website materials-only condition. Healthy, underactive women (mean age = 32 &#x000b1; 5.6 years) with a baby (mean age = 5.7 &#x000b1; 2.8 months) were enrolled from 2008&#x02013;2009 (N = 278). Of the total sample, 84% were ethnic minority women, predominantly Asian&#x02013;American and Native Hawaiian. Mean self-reported baseline level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 40 minutes/week with no significant differences by study condition, ethnicity, infant's age, maternal body mass index, or maternal employment. Women had high scores on perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and environmental support for exercise but low scores on social support for exercise. This multiethnic sample's demographic and psychosocial characteristics and their perceived barriers to exercise were comparable to previous physical activity studies conducted largely with white postpartum women. The N&#x00101; Mikimiki Project's innovative tailored technology-based intervention and unique population are significant contributions to the literature on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in postpartum women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>postpartum</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>ethnicity</kwd><kwd>motherhood</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Becoming a mother is a significant transition in a woman's life. While this is a positive experience for most, significant decrements can occur in several health promoting behaviors, including physical activity (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Olson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Haas et al., 2005</xref>). In women, demographic factors associated with inactivity or reductions in physical activity over time include having a child and being employed outside the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brown &#x00026; Trost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Scharff et al., 1999</xref>). Results from a survey of multiethnic postpartum women living in Hawaii indicated that 68% were more inactive or irregularly active following childbirth, with no differences by race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>). However, many studies have found ethnic minority women (mostly African-Americans) to be at higher risk of inactivity or at lower levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than whites during pregnancy and postpartum periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">He &#x00026; Baker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, as young adult women, especially ethnic minorities, transition into parenthood, they are at high risk for physical inactivity or significant reductions in previous levels of PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brown &#x00026; Trost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Leslie et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Several intervention studies have encouraged the initiation and maintenance of regular physical activity in postpartum women, some in combination with diet modification, to achieve weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fahrenwald et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fahrenwald &#x00026; Walker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ostbye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Miller, Trost, &#x00026; Brown, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). As the majority of previous studies have been conducted with white or African-American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fahrenwald et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Miller, Trost, &#x00026; Brown, 2002</xref>), little is known about the effectiveness of physical activity interventions for postpartum women from other races/ethnic minority backgrounds.</p><p>The behavioral intervention developed for this study was based on theoretical constructs derived from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), which have been used in many home-based and self-management programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Miller, Trost, &#x00026; Brown, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Albright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Marcus, Ciccolo, &#x00026; Sciamanna, 2009</xref>). In addition to incorporating theoretical constructs, the intervention incorporated findings from qualitative (<italic>n</italic> = 79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>) and quantitative pilot studies (<italic>n =</italic> 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2009</xref>) conducted with mothers of infants living in Hawaii. These preliminary studies provided insight into multiethnic mothers&#x02019; barriers to physical activity, such as lack of spouse support for childcare and their receptivity to intervention strategies (i.e., goal setting). Results indicated that women were receptive to scheduled telephone calls, used e-mail daily, and were very familiar with the Internet (e.g., visited websites to obtain information about their own health, to correspond/learn from other new mothers, and to obtain health and childhood development information about their babies). Telephone (including text messages) and Internet contacts have been effective components of interventions for increasing PA in a range of populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lawler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Wantland et al., 2004</xref>). They are particularly effective and convenient for populations that are unable or not interested in joining exercise groups, such as new mothers who may be too busy to join a group exercise program, do not have childcare, or do not want their infants exposed to infectious agents. The authors used the findings from a pilot study and results from other mediated physical activity intervention studies with postpartum ethnic minority women to design a multi-component intervention that was tailored to meet the needs of multiethnic mothers of infants less than 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ostbye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the authors in this study (named &#x0201c;The N&#x00101; Mikimiki Project,&#x0201d; translated as &#x0201c;the active ones&#x0201d; in Hawaiian) was to test the effectiveness of an 18-month tailored telephone counseling and technology (TCT) PA intervention designed to initiate and maintain MVPA compared to a PA print/website materials-only (P/WM) comparison condition.

Psychosocial measures are listed in Appendix 1 with the questions tailored to new mothers highlighted in gray.</p><p>Self-efficacy was assessed using an instrument designed to assess self-confidence to overcome barriers to PA (e.g., bad weather, etc.). A higher score represented a higher level of self efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Garcia &#x00026; King, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Albright et al., 2005</xref>). The original 14-item instrument was modified to include nine additional questions. Five questions were based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2009</xref>) and addressed issues such as: self-efficacy to exercise when no one is available to care for her infant/children or to exercise when the infant/children are sick. Four of the questions were from an Australian PA intervention study with mothers of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Miller, Trost, &#x00026; Brown, 2002</xref>). The internal consistency for the modified instrument (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.93, which was comparable to the alpha of 0.89 for the original 14-item survey.</p><p>Perceived barriers and benefits of PA were assessed using scales developed for previous PA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heesch, Masse, &#x00026; Dunn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sallis et al., 1999</xref>). A higher score represents a higher frequency for which a barrier prevented MVPA (e.g., lack of time) and a stronger agreement a respondent had that a specific benefit would be achieved by regular MVPA. Both scales were adapted by including benefits such as sleeping better at night and having fun with baby/children while exercising, and barriers such as exercising when her baby/children were sick and living in a neighborhood that had no sidewalks to accommodate a stroller (Appendix 1).</p><p>The original barriers instrument had five subscales: (1) aversiveness&#x02014;containing five questions to measure responses such as &#x0201c;exercise is boring;&#x0201d; (2) excuses&#x02014;comprised of four questions to measure responses such as &#x0201c;lack of time;&#x0201d; (3) demands&#x02014;with three questions gauging work/family demands; (4) worries&#x02014;containing six questions measuring responses such as &#x0201c;self-conscious about looks;&#x0201d; and (5) inconveniences&#x02014;comprised of nine questions gauging answers such as &#x0201c;no sidewalks.&#x0201d; A factor analysis showed that the excuses and demands questions loaded onto one factor, and the motherhood questions loaded onto the inconvenience and worries subscales. Cronbach's alphas for these subscales ranged from 0.64 to 0.77 with an overall alpha for the entire scale of 0.86, which is comparable to the scale without the motherhood-specific questions (i.e., 0.84).</p><p>Factor analysis of the revised benefits questions showed two subscales of physiological benefits (e.g., gain muscle) and psychological benefits (e.g., improved self-esteem), as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Heesch, Masse, &#x00026; Dunn, 2006</xref>). The Cronbach's alphas were 0.93 for the physiological scale and 0.85 for the psychological scale, an improvement from 0.75 for the original subscales.</p><p>Social support was assessed using an adapted version of the Sallis family/friend support for participation in exercise scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sallis et al., 1987</xref>). Participants reported support on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 5 = <italic>very often</italic>), the mean of all items was calculated, with higher values indicating more social support. Based on previous work with postpartum women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2009</xref>), this scale was modified to include items such as providing childcare so mother could exercise (3 questions in Appendix 1). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.88 for the modified scale and 0.89 for the original scale.</p><p>Participants rated positive and negative components of their environment by reporting exercise equipment used at home, and specific features of the built environment that facilitate/hamper efforts to be physically active in their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sallis et al., 1997</xref>). Home equipment was measured using the sum from a list of 18 dichotomous (<italic>yes/no</italic>) items (e.g., exercise videotapes/DVDs). Neighborhood environment included perceptions of how safe it was to walk in the mother's neighborhood (1 = <italic>very unsafe</italic>, 5 = <italic>very safe</italic>), and perceived household income of her neighborhood. Neighborhood built environment features included <italic>yes/no</italic> responses about whether specific infrastructures or facilities, such as sidewalks, were available in her neighborhood. Previous research has shown the perceived environment scales to be adequately reliable (test&#x02013;retest r = 0.68&#x02013;0.89) and related to self-reported physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sallis et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">King et al., 2006</xref>). Again, based on previous research with this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albright, Maddock, &#x00026; Nigg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2009</xref>), the scale was modified by adding equipment that would assist a new mother's ability to be physically active, including strollers, infant carrier, etc. The Cronbach's alphas for these subscales were lower (0.52&#x02013;0.63) largely due to the considerable diversity of facilities for physical activity across neighborhoods on Oahu.</p><p>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess postpartum depression symptoms using 10 questions (range 0&#x02013;30). It has been shown to have good sensitivity (86%) and specificity (78%) with a positive predictive value of 73% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cox, Holden, &#x00026; Sagovsky, 1987</xref>). A score &#x02265;10 indicates possible postpartum depression. It has been tested in low-income and minority women and found to be a practical and efficient tool for identifying women at risk for postpartum depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hanna, Jarman, &#x00026; Savage, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The Ethnocultural Identity Behavioral Index was used to assess cultural identity via participation in ethnocultural traditions (e.g., dances, language: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Yamada, Marsella, &#x00026; Yamada, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Marsella et al., 1998</xref>). Respondents identified the ethnocultural group they most strongly identified with and then rated on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>never, 7 = always</italic>) how often they followed that group's customs and cultural practices.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>SAS software (version 9.1) was used for all analyses. Characteristics of the study sample were summarized using descriptive statistics, such as means, medians, standard deviations, and inter-quartile ranges for continuous measures and frequency distributions for categorical measures. The authors used exploratory principal components analyses to check subscale structure for multidimensional instruments, examined scree plots to determine the number of principal components, and used orthogonal rotation to determine item loading. After identifying subscales, the authors assessed the internal consistency of the items using Cronbach's alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nunnally &#x00026; Berstein, 1994</xref>). Differences between the randomized conditions were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Pearson's chi-square test of independence. In addition, multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to test for differences between study conditions after adjusting for baby's age, number of children (1 vs. &#x0003e;1), and BMI. Sociodemographic variables were adjusted for if they differed significantly between study conditions or if they were identified a-priori as being important potential confounders. The authors used a Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test and Pearson correlation to examine the relationship of MVPA with demographic characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s16"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 138 women were randomly assigned to the TCT-tailored condition and 140 to the P/WM&#x02013;materials only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). No significant differences were observed in baseline sociodemographic characteristics between the two randomly assigned conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><sec id="s17"><title>Baseline Physical Activity Level</title><p>Differences between conditions in self-reported minutes per week of PA at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) were not statistically significant and the adjusted results from linear and logistic regression analyses were consistent with the unadjusted results. Median time spent walking was 30 minutes per week, and the median for all activities combined was 40 minutes per week. Few women (14%) met national recommendations for MVPA; however, because active women were ineligible for the study, no women were expected to meet recommendations at baseline. It is possible that the discrepancy for these 14% was caused by differences in women's responses to the brief telephone screening questions compared to the more detailed baseline MVPA written survey questions.

The N&#x00101; Mikimiki Project was designed to test the efficacy of a PA intervention designed to be culturally sensitive to minority women in Hawaii and tailored to meet the needs of women who had an infant between 2 and 12 months of age.</p><p>Over 18 months, recruitment mailings were sent to over 3,500 KP members and almost 1,000 members were telephoned who had an infant 2&#x02013;12 months in age. By conservative estimates, almost 10,000 additional women were reached with print/media advertisements. Thus, considerable time and effort was made to reach, recruit, and randomize 278 eligible new mothers into a PA study. However, as in most research studies, the new mothers who volunteered to join an 18-month PA study and agreed to complete complex study assessments, may have stronger motivations to become more active than new mothers who did not volunteer.</p><p>The N&#x00101; Mikimiki Project is one of only three physical activity intervention studies to include a significant proportion of ethnic minority post-partum women, with two of these three studies (Mothers in Motion: MIM, and Active Mothers Postpartum: AMP) recruiting primarily African-American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ostbye et al., 2009</xref>). The proportion of African-Americans in these samples (52% and 45%, respectively) was considerably lower than the proportion of minority women (largely Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders) in the N&#x00101; Mikimiki sample (84%). The N&#x00101; Mikimiki sample was similar to samples in other studies for age of mother, marital status, percent primiparous, and number of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ostbye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Norman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, these studies differed in factors that could be associated with new mothers&#x02019; motivation to be more active, including lactation, working status, educational attainment, BMI, and infant's age. The rates of lactation ranged from 36% for AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>) to 80% in N&#x00101; Mikimiki, the highest proportion of the published physical activity studies. About one third of the sample (36%) was unemployed, which was similar to the proportion in MIM (41%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>). However, it was lower than the unemployed rate in the Australian Mobile Mums study (67%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>) and higher than in AMP (18%: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, the present sample's education distribution was most similar to that of the AMP sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>), but it was higher than the educational level in MIM, which was a sub-sample recruited from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program for lower socioeconomic status women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The mean BMI of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in this sample was similar to that reported in Mobile Mums (27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) but lower than that reported in AMP (33 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>). The percentage of the sample with BMI &#x0003e; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was 33.8% in N&#x00101; Mikimiki, which is lower than in AMP (47%); but the latter was a weight loss study that only recruited women with a BMI &#x0003e; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> prior to pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The AMP sample had the youngest infants (entry age of 6 weeks: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>) and MIM had the oldest mean infant age of 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>). With the exception of Moms on the Move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fahrenwald &#x00026; Walker, 2003</xref>), this study and the other four studies recruited women with infants who were unlikely to be walking independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Norman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang, Nitzke, &#x00026; Brown, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the measurement of baseline physical activity level varied, minutes of walking/MVP A appear to be similar across postpartum PA studies. Mobile Mums reported a median of 40 minutes of walking per week for one of their study conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fjeldsoe, Miller, &#x00026; Marshall, 2010</xref>). AMP reported a mean of 39 minutes of MVPA per day (273 minutes MVPA per week) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>), and the results of the present study were 30 minutes per week of walking and 40 minutes per week of total MVPA.</p><p>Three physical activity intervention studies have used the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression measure at baseline. The mean value of 6.3 was comparable to that reported in AMP (6.6), and both were lower than the mean (7.4) reported in Norman's study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Norman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ostbye et al., 2008</xref>). In general, the prevalence of postpartum depression as defined by the Edinburgh survey is comparable with that reported in other studies of healthy, postpartum women that have used this instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Horowitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Austin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ross et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s20"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present sample of postpartum women may not be representative of all new mothers in Hawaii or the United States, given that this sample consisted of women who were interested in becoming more active. Also, it is very difficult to compare/contrast the sample's characteristics with other women in Hawaii or the United States, because the authors could not obtain demographic data on postpartum women from the Hawaii census or American Community Survey, especially background information on those who do not currently exercise regularly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s21"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The time and effort to recruit 278 eligble new mothers into the study was substantial; however, the women who enrolled were very compliant to baseline assessments. This sample of multiethnic women face similar barriers to being physically active as have been reported in previous studies with postpartum women.</p><p>The N&#x00101; Mikimiki Project's innovative use of tailored technology (website, e-mails) combined with theoretically-derived telephone counseling and</p><p>its unique population composed of minority women who have, to date, been under-represented in previous PA intervention research (i.e., Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and women with a mixed race heritage) is a significant contribution to the literature on PA in postpartum women. The study's final results include both objective and subjective measures of PA, and determine which key sociodemographic and psychosocial factors are related to change in PA over an initial 12-month period and maintenance of change over 6 months.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial Registration: Clinical <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Trials.gov">Trials.gov</ext-link> number NCT00810342.</p></fn><fn><p>The project described was supported by NIH Award Numbers CA115614 and CA115614&#x02013;03S1 from the National Cancer Institute.
