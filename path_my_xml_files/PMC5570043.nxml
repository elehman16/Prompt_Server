Despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, more than 50% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to demonstrate an adequate response to first-line treatment. Switching to another antidepressant or treatment augmentation (i.e., adding a second agent) are commonly used pharmacologic options for patients demonstrating inadequate treatment response; however, although successful for some, not all individuals experience improvement in their depressive symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Fleurence et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The orexin signaling system, which originates in the lateral hypothalamus, plays an important role in sleep-wake control and may have additional functions, for example, regulation of stress, reward, and mood (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Berridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Gotter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Kukkonen and Leonard, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Winrow and Renger, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Yeoh et al., 2014</xref>). Prior studies carried out in humans and animals provide a mixed picture as to what effects orexin antagonists would be expected to have when administered to patients with MDD. However, several of these studies are consistent with the possibility that orexin antagonism might improve depression. These studies include animal models of depression where elevated orexin neuron activity was found (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Mikrouli et al., 2011</xref>), that treatment with the orexin receptor antagonist almorexant had antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test, elevated plus maze, and resident-intruder task (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Nollet et al., 2011</xref>), and that in a human study, orexin A CSF levels were found to be elevated in patients with depression and were lowered by treatment with the antidepressant sertraline (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Salomon et al.. 2003</xref>), although another study failed to find an elevation in CSF orexin A in depressed patients (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Filorexant (MK-6096) is an orally bioavailable potent and selective antagonist of orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors (i.e., it is a dual orexin receptor antagonist) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Winrow et al., 2012</xref>). In humans, filorexant has a short half-life of 3 to 6 hours and has been shown to promote sleep onset and maintenance in patients with insomnia (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Connor et al., 2016</xref>). Given the sleep-promoting properties of filorexant and the potential involvement of the orexin pathway in depression, it was hypothesized that filorexant may have a role in the treatment of MDD.</p><p>This proof-of-concept study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a sleep-promoting 10-mg dose of filorexant administered each night at bedtime compared with placebo for treatment augmentation in patients with MDD. The rationale for the dose selection in the current study was based on data from a study where patients with primary insomnia showed significant improvements in sleep with filorexant 10 mg nightly without the marked next-day somnolence in most patients (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Connor et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the orexin receptor antagonist mechanism in MDD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Treatment</title><p>This was a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1), parallel-group study conducted between June 2012 and September 2013 at 61 sites within Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United States (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01554176).</p><p>The study comprised a screening period (&#x02264;2 weeks), a 6-week double-blind treatment period, and a 2-week double-blind, run-out period for patients who completed the treatment period. During the treatment period, patients were randomized (1:1) to receive oral filorexant 10 mg once nightly (at bedtime) or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by severity of depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD-17) (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton 1960</xref>) total score (&#x02264;20 vs. &#x0003e;20) and extent of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] total score &#x02264;14 vs. &#x0003e;14) (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bastien et al. 2001</xref>). During the run-out period, patients initially randomized to filorexant received either filorexant or placebo, and patients initially randomized to placebo continued to receive placebo. Patients continued to take their prescribed pretrial antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or bupropion) throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were required to have a current primary diagnosis of recurrent MDD, without psychotic features, with a current moderate or severe depressive episode, as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association 2000</xref>) and as confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan et al. 1998</xref>) and clinical assessment. Male and female MDD patients (aged 21 to &#x0003c;65 years) were eligible for inclusion if they were partial responders to antidepressant therapy, defined as persistence of moderate to severe, nonpsychotic depressive symptoms, despite an adequate trial (dose and duration of treatment) of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or bupropion monotherapy. Patients were excluded if they had an inadequate response (investigator's opinion) to more than three adequate antidepressant trials for treatment of the current depressive episode. Severity of depressive symptoms was based on the investigator&#x02019;s clinical assessment, including the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Asberg 1979</xref>), and on patients&#x02019; assessment of their depressive symptoms using HAMD criteria. The HAMD-17 was completed by patients at screening and baseline in the clinic using an interactive voice response system (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2006</xref>). The threshold for study entry was initially based on a HAMD Bech subscale (consisting of HAMD-17 items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13) score of &#x02265;10 (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bent-Hansen and Bech, 2011</xref>); this was later changed to &#x02265;9 due to enrollment difficulties and feedback from study sites and external consultants. Both patients and sites were blinded to the HAMD threshold required for study entry in an attempt to minimize assessment bias and reduce placebo response. Patients were excluded if they were at imminent risk of self-harm, based on clinical interview and responses to item number 10 of the MADRS or on the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Posner et al. 2011</xref>), or if they reported suicidal ideation with intent, with or without a plan (i.e., MADRS item 10 &#x02265; 5 and/or Type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS), in the past 1 month or suicidal behavior in the past 6 months. Patients were also excluded if they were using anxiolytic or sedative-hypnotic agents chronically. Patients with narcolepsy were excluded.</p><p>All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The study protocol (Protocol 022) was approved by the relevant Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and in compliance with all local and/or national regulations and directives.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Efficacy Endpoints</title><p>Patients were evaluated in the clinic at the end of week 3 and week 6 of the treatment period and again at the end of the run-out period (week 8). Patients also received follow-up phone call 1 and 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication.</p><p>The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the MADRS total score. Planned secondary endpoints included: change from baseline to week 6 in the MADRS total score, excluding the sleep item; change from baseline to week 6 in the HAMD Bech subscale score; change from baseline to week 6 in the HAMD-17 total score; and HAMD-17 remission rate (i.e., HAMD-17 total score &#x02264;7) at week 6. Exploratory endpoints were also planned, including change from baseline in HAMD-17 total score and ISI total score.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Safety and Tolerability</title><p>Safety was assessed based on the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). Prespecified events of clinical interest (ECIs) included suicidal ideation and/or behaviors, selected AEs associated with potential for abuse, overdose, complex sleep-related behaviors, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, sleep-onset paralysis, cataplexy, and falls. Vital signs, body weight, electrocardiogram, physical and neurological examination, and laboratory evaluations were also assessed and the C-SSRS was completed (baseline, week 3, week 6, and run-out period).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The study was originally designed to include 326 patients (163 per treatment group) to provide 80% power to detect a 3.5-point difference between treatments (based upon a 2-sided 5% level test) for the primary endpoint. This assumed a SD of 9.6 points and a 21% dropout rate and accounted for a planned interim futility analysis (not conducted due to early termination). This difference corresponds to a standardized effect size of 0.4.</p><p>Efficacy analyses were conducted using the full-analysis-set population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study treatment and had at least one evaluable endpoint measurement, including those patients who only had a baseline measurement). Efficacy endpoints (i.e., change from baseline in MADRS total score, MADRS score excluding sleep item, HAMD-17 total score, and HAMD Bech subscale score) were assessed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, including terms for treatment, time, time-by-treatment interaction, severity of disease at baseline (HAMD-17 &#x02264;20 vs. &#x0003e;20), and insomnia at baseline (ISI &#x02264;14 vs. &#x0003e;14) as categorical terms. This model assumes a common mean across treatment groups at baseline and a different mean for each postbaseline time point. Time is treated as a categorical variable so that no restriction is imposed on the trajectory of the means over time. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</p><p>The all-patients-as-treated population was used for safety analyses (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study treatment).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 129 patients, 40% of the originally planned population (129/326), were randomized to treatment. Study treatment was administered to 128 of these patients and 116 patients completed the treatment period (Supplementary Figure 1). The study was terminated early because of low recruitment resulting from enrollment challenges. If the study had been designed with a sample size of 65 patients per treatment group (i.e., the approximate observed sample size), based on the assumptions already described, the study would have been underpowered (&#x0003c;50%) to detect a treatment difference in MADRS.</p><p>Patient characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Supplementary Table 1), with patients predominantly female (63.3%) and white (86.7%). Mean age was 48.8 years. The majority (~80%) of patients had baseline insomnia (ISI total score &#x0003e;14). Mean baseline HAMD-17 total scores were ~24, consistent with moderate to severe depression.</p><sec id="s9"><title>Efficacy</title><p>Results for change from baseline in depression endpoints are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. There was no statistically significant difference on the primary endpoint of mean change from baseline to week 6 in MADRS total score with filorexant vs. placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The estimated treatment difference (filorexant&#x02013;placebo) was -0.7 (95% CI: -3.8, 2.5; <italic>P</italic>=.679), with a negative difference corresponding to numerical improvement compared with placebo. This difference corresponds to a standardized effect size of -0.1. In addition, no significant difference between filorexant and placebo was observed in change from baseline to week 3 in MADRS total score. There were no significant differences between treatments on other change from baseline depression endpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The percentages of patients with remission (HAMD-17 total score &#x02264;7) at week 6 were 12/56 (21.4%) for filorexant vs. 6/61 (9.8%) for placebo (estimated odds ratio = 2.5 [95% CI: 0.8, 7.3], <italic>P</italic> = .097).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of Change from Baseline Depression Scores at Week 3 and Week 6 (Full Analysis Set)</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

None of the AEs of suicidal ideation (nine patients in total) were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. No suicidal behaviors or ideation with a plan or intent were reported. All but one patient had a prior history of suicidal ideation. Two patients reported the same level of ideation at each visit throughout the study (filorexant, n=1; placebo, n=1), and 2 patients reported suicidal ideation at the randomization visit only, before taking the first dose of study medication (filorexant, n=1; placebo, n=1).</p><p>No clinically relevant mean changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs were observed during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study hypothesis, that filorexant would be superior to placebo as augmentation therapy in patients with MDD, could not be adequately tested because of low enrollment (40% of planned). The size of the observed, nonsignificant difference on the MADRS primary endpoint (0.7-point reduction/-0.1 standardized effect size) was considerably smaller than the difference the study was powered to detect (3.5-point reduction/-0.4 standardized effect size), suggesting that even if the study had run to completion a significant effect would not have been found.</p><p>Our results argue against a direct antidepressant effect of orexin receptor antagonism in this population. As noted in the Introduction, the prior evidence supporting a direct antidepressant effect of orexin receptor antagonism is limited. It is interesting to consider whether an orexin receptor antagonist could indirectly help relieve depression through improving sleep. Although the majority (80%) of patients in our study had some degree of insomnia at baseline, improvements in insomnia symptoms were not observed with a dose of filorexant known to improve sleep in insomnia patients (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Connor et al., 2016</xref>). It is unclear whether this lack of effect was due to underpowering or would have been impacted by features of the study population. As baseline insomnia was not required for inclusion, it is possible that effects of filorexant might differ in a cohort of depressed patients specifically selected based on insomnia symptoms. Had a significant effect on depression been demonstrated, it would have been important to distinguish whether the treatment effect was primarily due to an improvement in depression or attributable to an improvement in insomnia with secondary improvement in depression. However, this was not explored due to the limited sample size and the observed results. Future studies might consider evaluating the effects of orexin receptor antagonists in patients with comorbid insomnia.</p><p>The low enrollment in our study suggests that the inclusion/exclusion criteria were too &#x0201c;restrictive.&#x0201d; However, our intent was to exclude treatment-refractory patients. To be less restrictive would have resulted in a more heterogeneous population, which would have led to difficulties in interpreting the results.</p><p>Another factor that complicates interpretation of the results was the need to administer filorexant at bedtime to avoid daytime sedation resulting from its known hypnotic effect (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Connor et al., 2016</xref>). It is unknown whether pharmacological activity during wakefulness would be required for the orexin receptor antagonist to provide a benefit on symptoms of depression. It is also possible that a higher dose of an orexin receptor antagonist is necessary to treat depression than insomnia, although administering a higher dose would likely not be clinically tenable due to the potential for increased next-day somnolence.</p><p>The observed safety profile of filorexant in depressed patients was generally similar to that reported with compounds in the same class, such as suvorexant and almorexant, in healthy subjects and insomnia patients (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bettica et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hoever et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cruz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Michelson et al., 2014</xref>), with somnolence being the most common adverse event. Not surprisingly, given the depressed population, suicidal ideation was reported more commonly in this study than in studies of primary insomnia patients (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Michelson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Herring et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>K.
