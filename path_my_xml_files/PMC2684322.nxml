The method of randomization was every alternate patient (1:1 ratio) undergoing buccal mucosal harvesting assigned to group 1 or 2. Demographic patient profile, stricture related characteristics like etiology, site, length of stricture and type of surgery performed were noted. Buccal mucosa was harvested from inner cheeks and lower lip depending upon the length required.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique of bmg harvest</title><p>Naso-tracheal intubation is ensured and a retractor is used for keeping the mouth wide open. The parotid duct opening is identified and protected. The submucosal plane is infiltrated with 1% xylocaine and adrenalin solution (1 in 100,000). The site is marked with a scalpel, stay stitches were taken on buccal mucosa and then the flap of buccal mucosa is dissected from underlying buccinator muscle with fine scissor. After the graft is harvested, perfect hemostasis is achieved with bipolar electrocautery and an adrenalin soaked gauge piece is left over the harvest site for about 4 to 6 h.</p><p>Graft harvest site was either closed (group 1) or left open (group 2) depending on which group the patient was assigned to. In group 1, patients the mucosal edges were approximated with continuous interlocking sutures using 3 &#x02018;O&#x02019; vicryl. Patients were given self made questioners to assess pain, mouth opening and loss of sensation at graft site. Pain score was recorded for initial 5 days once daily using visual analog score (see Appendix). Return to liquids, solid diet and any salivatory difficulty in post operative period starting from day 1 were also noted. Same parameters were noted at follow up at 3 and 6 months. Statistical analysis was done using non parametric Mann Whitney test and a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 50 patients (25 in each group) were studied, from July 2003 to July 2005, with a mean age of 35.2 years (range 17-72) in group 1 and 35 (range 18-64) years in group 2.

None of these patients from either group had significant bleeding, hematoma or wound healing problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Buccal mucosa urethroplasty has been more popular in the last few years, after recognition of its feasibility and very good outcome as well as its low morbidity at the reconstruction site.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] Advantages of buccal mucosa as a free graft are that it is hairless, has a thick elastin rich epithelium making it tough and easy to handle and also having thin and highly vascular lamina propria that facilitates inosculation and imbibition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] Buccal mucosa is most commonly harvested from the cheek, unilateral or bilateral, depending upon the length of graft required. Cheek is the preferred site in most of the studies as it provides wide and long grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] An alternative to cheek is mucosa from the lower lip but its width limits the size of the graft, so it is used along with cheek mucosa when required length is more. Kamp <italic>et al</italic>, reported that harvesting the buccal graft from the lower lip resulted in a significantly greater long-term morbidity, which resulted in a lower proportion of satisfied patients. This seems to be due to a long-lasting neuropathy of the mental nerve.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] Closure of lip mucosa may also lead to eversion of vermilion and lip contracture. In our series, mucosa from the lower lip was used in six cases, all of which required graft length more than 13 cm and harvest site was left open in all six cases. There were no cosmetic deformities or long-term morbidity noted.</p><p>Conventionally the donor area used to be closed after the graft harvesting mainly because of concerns about the hemostasis and adequate healing of the raw area. Closure of the donor area may result in increased pain due to the stretching of the mucosal edges and poor cosmesis especially in lower lip. There is only one prospective study which has reported the effect of non closure of graft harvest site on post operative morbidity compared with a group of patients in which graft harvest site was closed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>In our prospective randomized study, pain was the most common symptom in the post operative period and was maximal at first post operative day in both the groups. Mean pain score was significantly higher in the group 1 in which donor site was closed i.e., 3.5 as compared to 2.7 in group 2. This is in spite of the fact that the mean area of the graft harvested in group 2 was significantly more than in group 1 and six patients in group 2 had the graft harvested from lower lip also. This shows that not suturing the donor area leads to lesser pain whether larger grafts were harvested or graft harvested from lower lip. In the prospective study by Wood <italic>et al</italic>, the mean pain score for patients with donor site closure was significantly higher than that for patients without donor site closure (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.01).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] Patient in whom donor site is closed may complain of more pain due to tight approximating sutures.</p><p>Restriction of mouth opening was most bothersome in the first week after surgery. It was seen in almost all the patients and resolved completely by three weeks except for two patients in group 2 who had persistent problems at six months. Similar observations have been made by others as in one series, 12 out of 14 patients had initial difficulty with mouth opening which resolved completely by 3 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Dublin <italic>et al</italic>, reported that 32% patients undergoing buccal mucosal harvesting had restriction of mouth opening at the end of 20 months, where the buccal mucosal harvest site was closed in all patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] In our study, only two patients in group 2 and none from group 1 had difficulty in mouth opening at 6 months. Both patients in group 2 who had persistent problem with mouth opening at 6 months had panurethral strictures and underwent buccal mucosal harvest from both the cheeks and lower lip.</p><p>Perioral numbness is related to a reduction in sensation in the region of the graft harvest and is an unavoidable consequence of excision of mucosa. In our study, six patients in group 1 and 4 patients in group 2 complained transient perioral numbness which had improved in majority of the patients at 1 week and only 2 patients from group 1 and 1 patient from group 2 had persistent perioral numbness at 6 months. No patient suffered any damage to nerves and no change in sensation along nerve territories was reported. Dublin <italic>et al</italic> from a retrospective study of 30 patients (all patients had donor area closed), reported that 16% of patients had oral numbness for a mean duration of 13.6 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>Immediate resumption to liquid diet was seen in all except one patient in group 1. Eighty percent of patients in group 1 and 93% patients in group 2 were able to resume normal diet by the end of third post operative day. Similar observations have been reported by others.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the complications like salivatory problems, mucous retention cysts occurred in very few patients transiently which resolved spontaneously at 6 months. Similarly in the study reported by Wood <italic>et al</italic>, 11% of patients reported changes in salivation and 2% had mucous retention cyst that required excision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>Other problems related to graft harvest like hematoma at harvest site, persistent bleeding requiring revisit to operation theatre or packing or any wound healing problems were not seen in our series. It shows that once perfect hemostasis is achieved the donor area can be left open without causing additional problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Pain appears to be worse in the immediate post operative period after suturing the harvest site.
