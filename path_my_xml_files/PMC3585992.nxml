Recent elucidation of the complex cell signaling pathways that are disrupted in tuberous sclerosis indicates that rapamycin may be successful in alleviating the appearance of these lesions. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the safety of topically applied rapamycin in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and to determine its potential effectiveness in treatment of facial angiofibromas.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Study subjects were recruited from the patient populations at the University of Texas Tuberous Sclerosis Center of Excellence. All subjects were over the age of 13 years and had a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex. Subjects were excluded if they were using any form of rapamycin or if they were pregnant. Study subjects applied the study product to their facial angiofibromas nightly for a duration of 6 months. The investigational product contained one of three doses of rapamycin compounded with Skincerity&#x000ae;: (i) no rapamycin; (ii) 1 mg of rapamycin per 30 cc (0.003%); or (iii) 5 mg of rapamycin per 30 cc (0.015%). Plasma rapamycin concentrations were measured monthly to test for systemic absorption. Complete blood counts were performed monthly to test for anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. Upon completion of the trial, subjects were asked if the formulation had improved the appearance of their facial angiofibromas.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-three subjects completed the study.

Facial angiofibromas appear as red or pink papules over the central face, especially on the nasolabial folds, cheeks, and chin,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] in people with TSC. Lesions arise in early childhood and are present in up to 80% of TSC patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] In some patients, the lesions become confluent and can result in severe disfigurement. Although multiple treatments have been developed to alleviate the appearance of facial angiofibromas &#x02013; curettage, cryosurgery, chemical peels, dermabrasion, shave excisions, and laser therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] &#x02013; these are uncomfortable and need to be repeated at periodic intervals to treat recurrence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p><p>In patients with TSC, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is aberrantly activated in fibroblast-like cells located within the dermal layer of the skin. These cells produce an epidermal growth factor, epiregulin, which stimulates epidermal cell proliferation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Epidermal cells are produced at a faster rate than the ability to slough the dead cells from the skin surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] This overproduction of skin cells, in conjunction with angiogenesis, results in the initial appearance and continued progression of facial angiofibromas over time.</p><p>Recent elucidation of the complex signaling relationship between the tuberous sclerosis 1 (<italic>TSC1</italic>) and tuberous sclerosis 2 (<italic>TSC2</italic>) gene products and mTOR has led to an explosion of research related to the use of mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, in TSC. These mTOR inhibitors are showing promise in treating multiple tumor types, including renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p><p>Rapamycin is a naturally occurring antifungal macrolide, first isolated from <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic> in 1965.

It is characterized by abnormal skin pigmentation and tumor formation in multiple organ systems. Facial angiofibromas are benign skin tumors found on the faces of patients with TSC, and the angiofibromatous lesions appear as red or pink papules distributed over the central face, most notably on the nasolabial folds, cheeks, and chin. Lesions appear in early childhood and are present in up to 80% of TSC patients, creating considerable cosmetic morbidity.</p><p>Since the initial descriptions of facial angiofibromas in the 19th century, multiple treatments have been developed, attempting to alleviate the appearance of these lesions, including curettage, cryosurgery, chemical peels, dermabrasion, shave excisions, and laser therapy. Although the majority of these treatments are initially effective, they are uncomfortable, and over time the lesions recur.</p><p>Recent case reports and small case series have demonstrated that a topical rapamycin formulation might be efficacious,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] but prior reports have consisted of small series without placebo arms. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether our topical formulation of rapamycin was safe for topical use in the treatment of facial angiofibromas in patients with TSC. The study was designed to see if application of the investigational product resulted in detectable systemic absorption of the rapamycin. The secondary goal of this study was to evaluate whether the topical product decreased the appearance of the facial angiofibromas after 6 months of usage, as self-reported by the subjects. Twenty-three study subjects applied either a placebo or the investigational product nightly to their lesions for 6 months. The study results showed that there were no serious adverse events related to the study product and there was no detectable systemic absorption of the rapamycin during the study period. This study was not powered to reach statistical significance, and although it did not, almost twice as many subjects in the combined treatment arms reported subjective improvements (73%) when compared with the placebo arm (38%). The observed effect could result from a treatment effect of the vehicle itself, but these results suggest that topical application of our study product is effective in improving the appearance of facial angiofibromas in people with TSC. Future studies will include more detailed monitoring of efficacy, including standardized photography and monthly quality-of-life questionnaires.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, Cheniere Energy, Inc., the Sponsors of Kirk and Meg Gentle of the Cheniere Race Across America Team, the University of Texas Medical School at Houston Department of Pediatrics, and the University of Texas Tuberous Sclerosis Center of Excellence at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.
