Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS) has potential antitumor properties as a natural product while the related mechanisms remain unclear. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is associated with inflammatory activity of aneurysm and may be affected by miR-29b. Thus, inhibitory function of AOS on aneurysms was explored by measuring the important molecules in TLR4 signaling. After EVAR, a total of 248 aortic aneurysm patients were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: AOS group (AG, oral administration 10-mg AOS daily) and control group (CG, placebo daily). The size of residual aneurysms, aneurysm recurrence, and side effects were investigated. Aneurysm recurrence was determined by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis. After 2 years, eight and two patients died in the CG and AG, respectively. The sizes of residual aneurysms were significantly larger in the CG than in the AG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The incidence of aneurysm recurrence was also significantly higher in the CG than in the AG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). AOS treatment reduced the levels of miR-29b, TLR4, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), interleukin 1 (IL-1) beta, and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Overexpression and silence of miR-29b increased and reduced the level of TLR4, phospho-p65 NF-kappa B, phospho-p38 MAPK, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation analysis shows that the level of miR-29b is positively related to the levels of TLR4, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Thus, AOS represses aneurysm recurrence by indirectly affecting TLR signaling via miR-29b.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>alginate oligosaccharide</kwd><kwd>outcome assessment</kwd><kwd>aortic aneurysms</kwd><kwd>minimally invasive endovascular repair</kwd><kwd>toll-like receptor signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>anti-inflammatory agent</kwd><kwd>microRNA-29b</kwd><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aortic aneurysm (AA) is a major and emerging threat to public health.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has been developed as a minimally invasive therapy.

AOS was prepared from alginate sodium according to an earlier report using alginate lyase,<xref rid="b31-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which depolymerizes alginate sodium. Briefly, 1 kg sodium alginate was depolymerized in 100 L tap water with 10 mg alginate lyase at 39&#x000b0;C for 2 h. The lyase was denatured at 100&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The amounts of unsaturated saccharides were measured at 234 nm in a UV-2100PC UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The degrees of polymers (DP) were further determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The hydrolysate was transferred to a carbograph column to remove salt, and then concentrated, dried, and resolved in 1 mL methanol. Two-microliter supernatant was injected into a LTQ XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Austin, TX, USA). AOS was detected in a positive-ion mode: ion source, 5 kV; capillary temperature, 280&#x000b0;C&#x02013;310&#x000b0;C; tube lens, 260 V; sheath gas, 35 arbitrary units.

The following excluding criteria were used: a family history of AA and dissection; malignancy; psychological disorders.</p><p>A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the selected patients were revealed with TAA and/or dissection. Finally, 248 patients were selected for the present study and received modified EVAR. The Zenith TX2 TAA Endovascular Graft with Pro-Form is a two-piece cylindrical endovascular graft with proximal and distal materials (COOK Medical Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA). The proximal parts can be either nontapered or tapered. The stent grafts are made of full-thickness woven polyester fabric sewn to steel Cook-Z stents with polyester and monofilament polypropylene. The Zenith TX2 TAA endovascular graft with ProForm is fully stented to provide stability and the expansible force to open the lumen of the graft during deployment. All endovascular grafts with Pro-Form are two cylindrical endovascular grafts with proximal and distal materials. The proximal parts can be either nontapered or tapered. The diameter and length of each stent-graft was identified preoperatively with use of multislice CT or diagnostic imaging via a catheter with a marker. The graft diameter was &#x0003e;10% than normal size associated with the diameter of the nondiseased segments of aorta under the aneurysm. The length of graft was equal to the distance from the transection site to the nondiseased size of the descending aorta below the aneurysm.</p><p>After surgery, all the patients were randomly and evenly assigned into two groups: AOS group (AG), 124 AA patients received 10 mg AOS daily and control group (CG), 124 AA patients received a 10 mg placebo daily.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>Outcome criteria were established according to a previous report for thoracic EVAR.<xref rid="b34-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The end points included early morbidities (stroke and paraplegia), respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, need for dialysis, aneurysm-related death, and reoperation.

Based on 248 patients who underwent EVAR, there was no significant difference for early mortality and neurologic complications between the CG and AG. According to late outcomes, the overall survival rate was higher in the AG than in the CG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The results suggest that AOS contributes to AA repair. The reintervention rate and continued presence of complications were higher in the CG than in the AG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). There were significant differences for being free from aneurysm-related death after two-year therapy between the groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>AA therapy is still a challenge although a less invasive method can be commercially available for treating AA. Since introduction of EVAR, it is a safe and feasible alternative to conventional open repair. However, the surgery still has some side effects. Respiratory failure is a major complication, which affects postoperative morbidity and mortality and results in prolonged hospitalization. In addition to thoracotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia inducing an inflammatory reaction also attribute to postoperative respiratory failure.<xref rid="b38-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Because of their less invasive methods, respiratory failure was relatively rare in EVAR. In the present study, more patients developed respiratory failure in the CG than in the AG (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). AOS reduced these side effects significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>EVAR has been quickly developed because of its improved perioperative mortality and morbidity. However, high reintervention is still linked with EVAR.<xref rid="b39-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Here, a significantly lower rate of recurrent AA was associated with AOS treatment (16 patients in CG and 6 patients in AG). At cell levels, AOS is demonstrated to reduce the levels of miR-29b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-dddt-11-2565">Figure 9A</xref>), TLR4, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-dddt-11-2565">Figure 10</xref>), while the overexpression and silence of miR-29b will increase and reduce the levels of TLR4, phospho-p65 NF-kappa B, phospho-p38 MAPK, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12-dddt-11-2565">Figure 12</xref>). NF-kappa B contains sites for phosphorylation, which is important for activating TLR4 signaling pathways.<xref rid="b40-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Phosphorylated MAPK also plays an important role in regulating TLR4 signaling.<xref rid="b41-dddt-11-2565" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The reasons for reducing recurrent AA cases may be caused by AOS, which reduced the level of serum miR-29b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dddt-11-2565">Figure 4</xref>) and resulted in the reduction of TLR4, phospho-p65 NF-kappa B, phospho-p38 MAPK, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12-dddt-11-2565">Figure 12</xref>). On the other hand, there is a strong positive relationship between miR-29b and the levels of serum TLR4, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dddt-11-2565">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest that AOS treatment reduced the level of serum TLR4, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 by reducing the level of miR-29b.</p><p>AOS treatment seemed to be associated with the reduction of long-term mortality rates. The midterm follow-up of patients revealed a significant benefit in cumulative survival rates. There were eight deaths in the CG and two deaths in the AG related to aortic disease. All these results provide a potential use of the natural products of marine algae for the therapy of AA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13-dddt-11-2565">Figure 13</xref>). Retrograde dissection and endoleak were significant complications, resulting in the death of patients. These significant complications contributed to an aneurysm-related death rate after EVAR. However, the late aneurysm-related deaths occurred in patients who underwent EVAR in the first 2 years at our hospital. AOS treatment improved EVAR at our institution because aneurysm-related death rates were decreased when compared with the CG. As described above, there are advantages in using the combined technique, including 1) the reduction in the incidences of AAs by AOS; 2) the reduction in infection rates; 3) the reduction in the number of deaths; 4) fewer complications such as bleeding, pneumothorax, and stroke; and 5) the reduction due to AOS in other side effects caused by repair materials.</p><p>Certainly, there were some limitations for the present work: 1) four main AOS fractions (DP3, DP4, DP5, and DP6) were isolated. We wanted to use one bioactive component for subsequent experiment. However, single component cannot be prepared at a scale suitable for a patient population at the moment. On the other hand, oligosaccharides are complex carbohydrate molecules and the purity will reflect the product quality, so the components were analyzed here. In any way, to confirm the function of specific component, further work is highly demanded in the future; 2) lack of a negative CG, such as open surgery repair; 3) the effects of AOS on most inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant enzymes were not explored here; 4) present findings demonstrate that AOS inhibits the growth of ECs, which is still difficult to be associated with the clinical use of aneurysm therapy. We aimed to control aneurysm growth by inhibiting ECs activation via AOS because the ECs were isolated from aneurysm. To further confirm the result, animal test will be needed in the future work. The epigenetic mechanism of phosphorylation of TLR4 was not studied. In any way, further studies will be required to confirm the therapeutic effects for using AOS. The prospective multicenter data are still needed to confirm the present findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that AOS represses the growth of residual aneurysms and reduces aneurysm recurrence by indirectly affecting TLR signaling via miR-29b. AOS treatment can be an adjuvant method for AA repair and control its subsequent development. AOS offers an adjuvant method for minimally invasive endovascular repair of AA and dissection. AOS reduced recurrent AA and its side effects, such as wound infection rates. To use AOS better, further work is still needed to be done to confirm the present therapeutic results in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work was supported
