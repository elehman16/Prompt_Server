Moreover, it is also indicated for some patients with chronic pancreatitis. Postoperative morbidity has been reduced by centralization at high-volume centers, advances in surgical techniques, and perioperative management but still ranges between 40 and 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most frequent surgical postoperative complications are development of a pancreatic fistula (POPF), delayed gastric emptying (DGE), and postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The development of a POPF is one of the most complex complications after PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incidence of POPF still ranges between 20 and 30% after pancreatic resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most serious sequela of an established POPF is the erosion of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) stump by pancreatic juice or local inflammation, leading to delayed and potentially lethal PPH. Erosion hemorrhage occurs with the usual delay of a few days up to several weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Late PPH is predominantly caused by erosion or pseudoaneurysm formation of the GDA or hepatic artery (HA) (&#x0003e;24&#x000a0;h after the index operation). According to the literature, the incidence ranges between 3 and 6% or even higher in single-center studies and is associated with a significantly increased mortality of 16&#x02013;20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In recent years, technical efforts have been undertaken to lower the incidence of erosion hemorrhage or POPF, i.e., covering of either the skeletonized and divided arteries or the pancreatojejunostomy with the round or falciform ligament or with an omental flap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A promising surgical technique for covering the GDA stump is to wrap the pedicled falciform ligament around the skeletonized HA and the GDA stump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This procedure is frequently practiced in Asia, although its routine use lacks solid evidence and is rarely used in Europe or the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are no reports on randomized controlled trials investigating the prophylactic use of the pedicled falciform ligament for prevention of erosion hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For this reason, the presented randomized controlled multicenter trial was initiated to assess whether the use of the pedicled falciform ligament wrap can significantly decrease the incidence of postpancreatectomy erosion hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Administrative information</title><p id="Par16">The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02588066) on October 27, 2015.

Further inclusion criteria are as follows: male and female patients, age equal to or older than 18&#x000a0;years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score I&#x02013;III, and a completed written informed consent form. Exclusion criteria are as follows: potential conditions/circumstances after previous abdominal surgery with resection of the falciform ligament (e.g., status post liver resection), no creation of a pancreatojejunostomy (e.g., pancreatogastrostomy, total pancreatectomy, or non-resectability), and simultaneous arterial resection or reconstruction (e.g., hepatic or splenic, or superior mesenteric artery).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Surgical technique</title><p id="Par29">The standard technique of PD and surgical instruments may vary in several aspects.

Fixation is then performed with two to three stitches using polydioxanone (PDS) 5-0. The last step is to ensure a proper pulsation of the HA after completion of the wrap. The covering of the divided and skeletonized arteries (GDA stump, hepatic artery) by the pedicled falciform ligament patch is a quick and safe surgical procedure for experienced pancreatic surgeons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par39">Patients will be screened for eligibility considering the inclusion criteria (see above) on the day of admission (usually the day before the surgery). After obtaining the written informed consent, the randomization will be performed intraoperatively after proving the exclusion criteria. The randomization is designed as block randomization (via envelopes), with fixed block sizes in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The envelopes were prepared by an authorized trial coordinator at the center in Dresden and distributed to the participating sites as needed. It is mandatory to check all eligibility criteria before opening of a randomization envelope by authorized trial personnel only. The investigator has to consecutively assign the envelopes to the patients. He is requested to document the assignment carefully in the patient identification log.</p><p id="Par40">The details of the randomization will be kept safe and confidential. Subjects withdrawn from the trial retain their identification codes (e.g., randomization number). New subjects receive a new identification code.</p><p id="Par41">The randomization sequence was generated using the established R statistics software package (R version 3.1.3, the R Foundation for Statistical Computing). The block size will be kept confidential until completion of recruitment. Eligible patients will be randomized intraoperatively to one of the two groups (control group or intervention group) after the surgeon has confirmed resectability and the availability of the pedicled falciform ligament. In cases when exclusion criteria (e.g., no performance of a pancreatojejunostomy or total pancreatectomy) are met after randomization, the respective patients were withdrawn from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study visits and data collection</title><p id="Par42">The trial includes a total of five study visits during the operation or the postoperative period.

Further, the amylase concentration in abdominal drains on the respective postoperative day (POD 3 and 10 or on the day of an intervention, e.g., CT-guided drainage) is recorded for identification and grading of a POPF. If no abdominal drains were inserted intraoperatively, the grading of a POPF is confined to the clinically relevant grades B and C (secondary endpoint) depending on the respective intervention or clinical status of the patient.</p><p id="Par44">According to protocol, a CT scan of the abdomen or a CT angiography is not routinely performed during the study period. These diagnostic exams are indicated by the responsible physicians in each of the participating centers based on a medical rationale (e.g., suspected intra-abdominal fluid collection or hemorrhage, elevated liver enzymes or white blood cells/serum C-reactive protein). This management is considered standard in a certified pancreatic center. Further, symptomatic cardiorespiratory complications (e.g., pneumonia or myocardial infarction) are recorded based on routine diagnostic tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Documentation and data management</title><p id="Par45">All protocol-required information collected during this trial will be entered in the CRF. The completed CRFs will be reviewed, signed, and analyzed by the investigator or by a designated sub-investigator.

This also serves as a quality assurance for the study intervention. There is no mandatory photo documentation of the critical surgical study intervention (coverage of the GDA stump with the falciform ligament wrap) in all cases, because a standard image of the anatomic GDA site cannot reliably guarantee the complete and effective coverage of the GDA. However, the critical surgical steps (see &#x0201c;Surgical technique&#x0201d;) for performing the falciform ligament wrap and master photographs of completed wraps are taught by the head of the clinical trial during the study initiation. At least one intraoperative photo of the pedicled falciform wrap is obtained from each of the participating centers to check whether the applied technique is in line with the protocol. In addition, the anatomic and surgical characteristics of the falciform ligament wrap are requested in the intraoperative CRF (e.g., length of the ligament pedicle [&#x0003c;10 or &#x02265;10&#x000a0;cm], type of GDA stump closure [per protocol or other], and length of the artery stump [&#x0003c;8 or &#x02265;8&#x000a0;mm]).</p><p id="Par47">There is no data monitoring committee (DMC) because the risk of the surgical intervention is considered very low according to the available literature.

As a result, no prospective studies were identified which investigated a prophylactic round or falciform ligament wrap on the GDA stump for prevention of PPH. One retrospective study with a historical control group showed a significant reduction of postpancreatectomy bleeding by covering with an omental flap (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.021; OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.151; 95% CI, 0.030&#x02013;0.751 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). The best available data on the falciform ligament wrap comes from China and was published in 2014. Xu et al. recently published a retrospective controlled review involving 140 patients per group, using the falciform ligament wrap as preventive intervention to reduce erosion hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There was one event in the intervention group, compared with nine events in the control group (incidence, 0.7 vs. 6.4%). The incidence of 6.4% seemed high, but an in-depth analysis of the own cohort supported that incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The sample size estimation for the present trial was therefore based on the reduction of erosion hemorrhage rate from 6.4 to 0.7%. We used a two-tailed Fisher exact test for sample size calculation. To achieve an 80% power with a two-sided <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05, a group size of 174 patients is required.

Creation of a falciform ligament wrap is a simple surgical technique with low associated morbidity. In the past, the falciform ligament has been used in hepatic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or for perforated duodenal ulcer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. More recently, it has been assessed for prevention of POPF after distal pancreatic resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The latter technique is at present analyzed by the randomized, controlled &#x0201c;DISCOVER&#x0201d; trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Compared with POPF, delayed erosion hemorrhage occurs less frequently but carries a high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The substantial mortality is closely related to the incidence of a POPF, formation of a pseudoaneurysm, delayed PPH, and soft pancreatic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, pseudoaneurysm formation of the visceral vessels may be favored by the radicality of vascular dissection and lymphadenectomy, as well as by the length and closure of the GDA stump.</p><p id="Par55">Before initiating the present trial, we performed a retrospective analysis of our own experience in using the pedicled falciform ligament wrap for patients undergoing PD. The study confirmed the high mortality of erosion hemorrhage (39%) and the feasibility of the technique. However, only 39 patients with the wrap were retrospectively identified, and the difference compared with cases without the wrap was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We then continued with a systematic literature review and found that the overall reported rate of erosion hemorrhage after PD and pedicled falciform ligament wrap is low (0.9%). In comparison, the median rate of erosion hemorrhage in studies which reported outcomes of PDs without the use of a wrap was 4.1 (interquartile range, 3.7&#x02013;4.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">The analysis of the own cohort also taught us that an exact differentiation of the site of erosion hemorrhage (GDA stump vs. HA) was not achieved in all cases, which is the reason why the definition of the endpoint of the randomized trial includes both sites in close vicinity. A further, recently published systematic review analyzed both the omental and the pedicled falciform ligament wrap to decrease the rate of POPF and PPH after PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The majority of the 12 included studies examined an omental flap for covering the visceral vessels or the pancreatic anastomosis. Only two (uncontrolled) studies were focused on the pedicled falciform ligament wrap for prevention of erosion hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Consequently, the authors of the review concluded that randomized data are warranted to establish statistical evidence. Another retrospective questionnaire-based study from Japan reported that wrapping techniques with the omentum or falciform ligament did not reduce complications such as POPF and PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the study has several limitations, such as the &#x0201c;survey&#x0201d; design of the study and the fact that the omental and falciform ligament wraps were not evaluated separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It still remains unclear whether there are different effects of the omental or falciform ligament wrap. For this reason, a prospective randomized trial should consider only one defined technique.</p><p id="Par57">We decided to use the falciform ligament wrap, because more data are available for this technique and the creation of this wrap is easy to standardize. The pedicled falciform ligament flap is usually performed in 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min. Longer operating times, which were observed in our own retrospective cohort of patients with wrap, were interpreted as a measure of the more complex cases with higher risk for POPF and PPH.</p><p id="Par58">In conclusion, we outlined the potential importance of a prophylactic falciform ligament wrap to prevent erosion hemorrhage. We further summarized the paucity of the available data by performing a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. The initiation of the presented trial is the next logical step to generate increased evidence for evaluation of the effectiveness of the wrap in PD patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par59">Recruitment is ongoing.
