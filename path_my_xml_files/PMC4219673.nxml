Factors contributing to shorter TL may potentially explain why HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of age-related complications.</p><p>Telomerase is a DNA polymerase responsible for the maintenance of TL. It is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex containing a critical telomerase reverse transcriptase (RT) subunit which is required for addition of hexameric nucleotides to the telomeric regions. Nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) that inhibit HIV RT also inhibit telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>

NRTIs could therefore potentially accelerate ageing in HIV-infected patients. In a cross sectional study of HIV-infected patients on ART, we recently demonstrated that a longer duration of NRTI treatment was associated with significantly shorter TL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) <xref rid="pone.0109718-Leeansyah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The MONET trial <xref rid="pone.0109718-Arribas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> recruited patients who had HIV RNA less than 50 copies/mL while taking combination ART of two NRTI with either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The patients were taking different NRTI at the screening visit &#x02013; the most common were tenofovir (TDF), abacavir (ABC) or zidovudine (ZDV), typically taken in combination with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC). Patients were randomised to either continue their NRTI in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, at the 800/100 mg once daily dose) or to switch to DRV/r monotherapy, for up to 144 weeks.</p><p>The telomere sub-study of the MONET trial was designed to answer two questions: (1) whether, at the baseline visit, TL and telomerase activity correlated with the duration of prior NRTI treatment and (2) whether a switch to DRV/r monotherapy was associated with smaller reductions in TL over 144 weeks, compared to continued treatment with NRTI in the control arm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The design and main results of the MONET trial have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0109718-Arribas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Briefly, 256 patients with HIV RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL on combination ART (2 NRTI plus PI or NNRTI) were randomised to DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily, either as monotherapy (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;127) or with 2 NRTIs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;129) for up to 144 weeks. All patients signed written informed consent at screening, and the trial was approved by local and national ethics committees. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00458302).</p><p>The sub-study to measure TL and telomerase activity was conducted on stored samples after the trial had been completed. We measured TL and telomerase activity in PBMCs from 130 of the 256 randomised patients who had stored samples available. Six of the patients in the DRV/r monotherapy arm received NRTI during the study and were therefore excluded from the eligible population (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;124) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109718-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0109718-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0109718.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MONET trial- Telomere sub-study patient disposition.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0109718.g001"/></fig><p>We used the same methods for sample analysis as previously described <xref rid="pone.0109718-Leeansyah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Telomerase activity was measured using a real-time quantitative telomerase repeats amplification protocol (RQ-TRAP). Each patient was tested at baseline and at their last visit (either Week 48, Week 96, or Week 144).</p><p>All data on telomerase activity were log<sub>10</sub> transformed, given the positive skew in the data. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify factors predictive of TL and telomerase activity at the baseline visit. We included the following predictive factors: treatment arm, age, sex, and years of prior NRTI treatment and use of a PI or NNRTI at baseline.</p><p>Given that patients had their last visit at different follow up times (either Week 48, 96 or 144), we calculated the annual change in TL and telomerase activity. The change from baseline in TL and log<sub>10</sub> telomerase activity was analysed by treatment arm and for patients taking different NRTIs in the control arm &#x02013; either TDF, ABC or ZDV.

As expected TL was influenced by both age and sex <xref rid="pone.0109718-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>This was the first prospective study to assess change in TL and telomerase activity following cessation of NRTI. Although this study was performed as a retrospective sub study of the original parent study, the study was randomised which is a strength. All previous studies assessing the relationship of TL and telomerase activity to NRTI in HIV infection have either been cross sectional <xref rid="pone.0109718-Leeansyah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or not specifically examined the effects of NRTI as a component of ART <xref rid="pone.0109718-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109718-Pathai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, the true contribution of NRTI to TL and telomerase activity has never been defined.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for our findings. First, any change in TL or telomerase activity following NRTI treatment may be non&#x02013;reversible. Second, decrease in TL could be slow and therefore we could have been underpowered to detect a difference given the duration of follow up. Third, measurement of TL and telomerase activity in total PBMC may have remained stable while there may have been changes in the TL in specific T-cell subsets or the proportion of different T cell subsets such as memory and effector CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Finally, it is possible that those randomised to the monotherapy arm of DRV/r could have potentially had greater residual virus replication in tissue sites such as lymph node <xref rid="pone.0109718-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> which may have led to a reduction of telomere length and therefore would have obscured any beneficial effects of cessation of NRTI.</p><p>The relationship between telomerase activity and NRTI was different in this longitudinal study was different to our previous report <xref rid="pone.0109718-Leeansyah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> where we showed in a cross sectional study of HIV-infected patients receiving ART, that telomerase activity was significantly higher in patients who were receiving a regimen that didn't include an NRTI. In our previous study, patients had been off an NRTI for a median of 48 weeks, a similar duration to the follow up period off NRTI in the current study. The different findings to the current study may be because the prior study was a cross sectional analysis and there may have been other confounders that were not accounted for in the two patient groups. However, it is interesting to note that in the previous publication, we quantified TL and telomerase in a small number of patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) who had matched longitudinal samples ie prior to and following cessation of an NRTI, and in these patients we saw no significant change in telomerase (or TL) as we describe in this current study.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, the sample size was limited but only 130 of the 256 patients in the MONET trial had stored samples available for analysis of TL. Therefore, the inability for us to detect a difference between the two arms may have been a consequence of the sample size and consequently the limited power to detect differences between the treatment arms <xref rid="pone.0109718-Altman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Second, the overall duration of prior NRTI treatment was recorded in the database, but not the time that the patient was taking each individual NRTI. If the NRTIs had different effects on TL, as suggested in vitro <xref rid="pone.0109718-Leeansyah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, this could not be measured in the current analysis. Third, there was a baseline imbalance in TL between the treatment arms which was not accounted for by differences in sex. Finally, the duration of follow up differed for the participants but we adjusted for this by expressing TL and telomerase activity as a change over time.</p><p>In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate a difference in annual decline in TL or telomerase in HIV-infected patients who had received long term NRTI-based ART and then ceased NRTI. Further studies are required to determine the complex relationship between NRTI, HIV and TL in vivo and the association of TL with age-related complication in HIV infection.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0109718-Freiberg1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
