Serum samples from the 350 participants who provided a full series of blood samples (at all the sampling points) within the 2-year period were collected.

These titres subsequently increased to 423.1, 659.0, 545.0, and 321.9, respectively, at 540 days post-immunization (d.p.i.), and similar levels were maintained at 720 d.p.i. Higher IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4-specific responses to the C4 genotype of EV71 and cross-neutralization reactivity against major EV71 genotype strains were observed in the vaccine group compared to those in the placebo group.

The effective prevention and control of HFMD epidemics is widely recognized as an essential public health issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the two major pathogens causing HFMD. Of these two viruses, EV71 infection is associated with a higher death rate and is primarily responsible for fatalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Attempts to develop inactivated EV71 vaccines have made significant progress over a short period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a published report of a 1-year phase III clinical trial, an inactivated EV71 vaccine derived from a C4 genotype strain (the predominant strain circulating on the Chinese mainland) displayed adequate safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy, showing an efficacy of 97.4 % and geometric mean titres (GMTs) of 224.4 and 118.0 at 56 and 180 days post-immunization (d.p.i.), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the long-term effects of a vaccine on immunity (specifically, its cross-protection against circulating strains of various genotypes) are generally considered critical characteristics for its licensing and clinical application.</p><p>Herein, we report the results of a continued evaluation of the immunogenicity, immune memory effects, and efficacy of this EV71 vaccine in a sub-cohort of subjects. Initially, 1,100 subjects were selected for the random administration of either the vaccine or a placebo, and 350 subjects provided a complete series of blood samples within the 2-year study period. In the present study, we performed a cross-neutralization assay with nine individual EV71 strains of genotypes A, B (B3&#x02013;B5), and C (C1&#x02013;C5), using 160 serum samples obtained from the 350 subjects from the immunized and placebo groups, in a 1:1 ratio. The results show the efficacy of the immune response induced by the inactivated EV71 vaccine and provide substantial data on the potential utility of this vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Vaccine and vaccination</title><p>The inactivated EV71 vaccine was developed in a good manufacturing practice-compliant facility at the Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and was tested at the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control before this study. The vaccine was prepared from the EV71 FY-23K-B strain of sub-genotype C4, cultured in a human diploid cell line (KMB17) for proliferation, and then purified and inactivated. Each dose of the vaccine contained 100 U of inactivated EV71 viral antigen adsorbed onto 0.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide, suspended in 0.5 mL of buffered saline. Both the vaccine and placebo were administered intramuscularly at 0 and 28 days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The primary outcome of this trial was the determination of the efficacy of an inactivated EV71 vaccine, and the secondary outcome was the evaluation of the long-term immune persistence of this vaccine over a 2-year observation period. The study was conceived and performed with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohort and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01569581 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The study was proposed by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangxi Province in association with a professional statistics group from the Fourth Military Medical University, and was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and an independent ethics committee of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A subset of 1,100 children, whose legal guardian provided written informed consent (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), from the 12,000 subjects of the phase III trial undertaken in the Guilin region of Guangxi Province, China, were eligible for enrolment and randomly selected based on the inclusion criteria for participation (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The subjects were grouped according to age: 6&#x02013;11 months (n = 350), 12&#x02013;23 months (n = 350), 24&#x02013;35 months (n = 300), and 36&#x02013;71 months (n = 100). The subjects within each age group were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or the placebo, in a ratio of 1:1. To measure the immune responses, blood samples were collected from each available subject at baseline and at 56, 180, 360, 540, and 720 d.p.i., administered between March and April 2012. A suspected case of HFMD was defined as having a febrile illness (&#x0003e;37.5 &#x000b0;C) accompanied by a papular/vesicular rash with the characteristic distribution on the oral mucosa and limb extremities (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A case of EV71 HFMD was defined as a suspected case of HFMD in whom EV71 was detected with a throat swab or stool specimen, using quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#x02013;PCR). A case of severe EV71 HFMD was defined as a suspected case of HFMD with neurological, respiratory, or circulatory complications based on the HFMD diagnostic criteria of the Ministry of Health of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To integrate the identification of active cases across the region, a healthcare center-based surveillance system was established in each county to detect suspected cases of HFMD. SimoonRecord, an independent contract research organization, assessed all clinical data at the end of each year. The surveillance method and the processing of suspected cases have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because the vaccine is not yet licensed, the trial cohort was monitored under the same disease surveillance system after unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measurement of the persistent immune response</title><p>Serum samples from the 350 participants who provided a full series of blood samples (at all the sampling points) within the 2-year period were collected. These 350 subjects were investigated for the 2-year study according to per-protocol analysis. The samples were assayed for EV71-specific neutralizing antibodies with a micro-neutralization assay on Vero cells grown in 96-well plates and a standard viral strain (C4) provided by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Susceptible participants, who showed a level of neutralizing antibodies against the C4 genotype of EV71 of &#x0003c;1:8 (the threshold of detection) before immunization, were assigned a value of 1:4.</p><p>Overall, 160 individuals (40 individuals in each age group: 20 individuals in the vaccine group and 20 in the placebo group, all of whom provided a full series of blood samples within the 2-year study period) were randomly selected using the RAND function in the EXCEL software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Their serum samples were collected at 0, 56, and 360 d.p.i. for the cross-neutralization assay. Nine strains of the EV71 virus (genotypes A, B3, B4, B5, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) were used in this assay (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Of these strains, all but genotype A were isolated from epidemics occurring in various areas within the Asian-Pacific region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The viral strains, grown on Vero cell monolayers, were harvested after the typical cytopathic effect was observed, and the titres were determined. Three hundred cell culture infectious doses of all the viruses were used for the neutralization test.</p><p>A total of 40 blood samples (10 samples from each age group: five samples from the vaccine group and five samples from the placebo group) were selected randomly from the 350 subjects who had provided a complete series of blood samples within the 2-year study period. The serum samples collected at 720 d.p.i. were used in interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays (Mabtech AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The ELISPOT assays were performed as previously described. Briefly, a 96-well polyvinylidene-difluoride-backed plate was pre-coated with anti-IFN-&#x003b3; or anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody, incubated overnight, and blocked for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. The wells containing a predetermined density of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a stimulatory peptide (10 mg/mL; amino acid sequence: STAETTLDSFF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for another 24 h. The cells were then removed and the colors were developed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The colored spots were counted with an automated ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technology Limited, OH, USA). The spot-forming cells were EV71 epitope-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis of this observational study was begun in March 2012, and the follow-up by professional statisticians from the Fourth Military Medical University is ongoing. Based on the fact that a 0.7 % HFMD morbidity was observed in children aged 6&#x02013;72 months in Guangxi Province, China, in 2009&#x02013;2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and that 55&#x02013;72 % of HFMD cases were identified as being infected by EV71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 6,000 subjects per arm were required to detect any difference in vaccine efficacy between the vaccine and placebo groups with a statistical power of 90 % and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05. Because a 20 % dropout rate was considered probable within the 12 months after vaccination in the phase III trial and at least 2 years were required to obtain adequate data from which to estimate the long-term efficacy of the seroprotection induced by the EV71 vaccine, we specified 1,100 children as the recruitment target for this study. This sample size represents approximately 10 % of the 12,000 total subjects in the phase III trial, and comprised 550 subjects per arm, in a ratio of 1:1 for the vaccine- and placebo-treated groups. A difference was detected in the neutralization antibodies induced in the vaccine and placebo groups, with a statistical power of 90 % and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to compare the vaccine efficacy, and the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> method was used to assess the differences in the two groups. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (when the data were not normally distributed) was used to assess the dimensional outcomes, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (when the data were sparse) was used to assess the dichotomous outcomes. Both types of outcomes were evaluated in a two-tailed manner. In the statistical analysis of the antibody titres, the values were converted to logarithms to facilitate the assessment of the GMTs. The SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute) was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Clinical phase III trials have shown that inactivated EV71 vaccines are effective in the control and prevention of HFMD caused by EV71 infection in child populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The present study was based on four individual age groups in a sub-cohort comprising 1,100 subjects who had been included in a previous clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The major vaccinated cohorts in these groups were at a susceptible age for the development of HFMD, according to epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], because understanding the dynamic profiles of anti-EV71 antibodies in children vaccinated during this period of life is essential to prevent disease development.</p><p>In the present study, 1,100 participants in the four age groups were allocated to either the experimental or control groups, in a 1:1 ratio (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). According to the primary design, the phase III trial was initiated in March 2012 and ended after a 1-year follow-up period. However, a long-term experiment using this sub-cohort was continued for 2 years. Throughout the 720-day study period, the overall drop-out rates, for any reason, were 72.0 %, 67.6 %, 68.3 %, and 56.0 % in the 6&#x02013;11 month, 12&#x02013;23 month, 24&#x02013;35 month, and 36&#x02013;71 month age groups, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The high drop-out rates, which included some individuals who moved away and some who refused to provide samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), predominantly reflected the relocation of families, which has been occurring more frequently in rural and urban areas in recent years. After drop-out, 350 subjects remained in this sub-cohort (161 participants in the immunized group and 189 in the placebo group), and participated in an immunological study at all 56, 180, 360, 540 and 720 d.p.i. time points according to per-protocol analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the phase III clinical trial of an inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccine.

These clear differences suggest the effective immunogenicity of the vaccine. However, the antibody titres of the vaccinated children subsequently decreased to 71.2 (95 % CI, 54.2&#x02013;93.5), 96.2 (95 % CI, 66.2&#x02013;139.8), 110.8 (95 % CI, 70.6&#x02013;173.8), and 138.5 (95 % CI, 63.0&#x02013;304.1), respectively, at 180 d.p.i., and similar levels were observed at 360 d.p.i.

This probably reflects the normal dynamic decay of the immune responses induced by viral antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, the antibody levels increased to 423.1 (95 % CI, 276.2&#x02013;648.1), 659.0 (95 % CI, 426.9&#x02013;1017.0), 563.0 (95 % CI, 368.2&#x02013;860.8), and 321.9 (95 % CI, 139.5&#x02013;742.7), respectively, at 540 d.p.i. and to 443.4 (95 % CI, 274.2&#x02013;717.0), 402.4 (95 % CI, 249.5&#x02013; 648.9), 545.0 (95 % CI, 344.7&#x02013;861.4), and 202.7 (95 % CI, 88.4&#x02013;465.0), respectively, at 720 d.p.i. The antibody titres of the placebo control subjects also increased in the older age groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>), but with only slight variations observed in younger age groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). The GMTs of the placebo subjects were 97.3 in the 24&#x02013;35 month age group and 119.70 in the 36&#x02013;71 month age group at 720 d.p.i., considerably higher than those in the 6&#x02013;11 (17.07) and 12&#x02013;23 (32.63) month age groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results suggest that older children more easily contract the circulating virus than younger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Strikingly, the serum conversion rates in the children of all age groups observed at different time points were typically greater than 95 % in the immunized cohort (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These data suggest that higher serum antibody conversion rates and neutralizing antibody GMTs with protective significance were maintained in the cohort immunized with the vaccine 2 years earlier.

Previous animal experiments and phase II trials primarily measured the effective immune memory, based on the IFN-&#x003b3;-specific ELISPOT response of PBMCs to stimulation with EV71 antigen in infant populations within 2 months of immunization with two doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To evaluate the variations in the immune memory elicited in the immunized population over an extended period of time, specific anti-IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 ELISPOT assays were performed on PBMCs collected at 720 d.p.i. from 40 (10 from each age group, with five from the immunized group and five from the placebo group) of the 350 subjects to determine the response to stimulation with a specific EV71 antigen using a synthesized VP1 peptide. The results showed significant IFN-&#x003b3;-specific ELISPOT responses to EV71 antigen stimulation in the immunized children aged 6&#x02013;11 months, 12&#x02013;23 months, and 36&#x02013;71 months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The IL-4-specific ELISPOT responses in these groups were also significantly greater than those in the placebo control groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the IFN-&#x003b3;- and IL-4-specific responses in the children aged 36&#x02013;71 months were unexpectedly lower than those in the other immunized groups, probably reflecting the limited sample size (only five samples from each group). Therefore, these findings require further investigation. Notably, in addition to the unexpected responses in the immunized group aged 24&#x02013;35 months, an enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; response was observed in the placebo control group, induced by an unidentified cause (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Although further clarification of these unexpected events is required, these data suggest the maintenance of an immune memory response and the induction of an antibody response by the vaccine, which might have been affected by virus circulating in the environment, through an as-yet-unknown pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>EV71 antigen stimulated specific IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from volunteers immunized with either the vaccine or placebo.
