reality-based balance training on balance of the elderly. [Methods] The subjects were 32
healthy elderly people aged between 65 and 80, who were divided into a VR (virtual
reality) training group (n=17) and a control group (n=15). The VR training group engaged
in a 30-minute exercise session using Wii Fit three times a week for eight weeks, while
the control group received no intervention. The balance of the two groups was measured
before and after the intervention. [Results] According to the Romberg Test conducted to
examine the effects of the training on balance, both the area covered by the body&#x02019;s center
of pressure movement, and movement distances per unit area of the body&#x02019;s center of
pressure envelope significantly decreased in the VR training group. Moreover, the two
groups showed significant differences in balance. [Conclusion] Virtual reality training is
effective at improving the balance of the healthy elderly. Thus, virtual reality training
can be proposed as a form of fall prevention exercise for the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Virtual reality training</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>About 30% of the elderly aged 65&#x02005;years or older experience a fall at least once a year, and
15% fall twice or more per year<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A fall can result in serious injuries, such
as fracture or dislocation, as well as minor injuries, such as contusion and sprain. Many
elderly people who sustain a severe fracture do not recover to their prior functional level
and some even die<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, a fall
restricts elderly people&#x02019;s activities of daily living, leading to loss of independence,
hospitalization, increased medical costs, and a greater economic burden<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent technological advances have led to the introduction of new virtual reality-based
exercise methods for performing diverse tasks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Flynn et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
observed that virtual reality provides interest and fun and motivates the user. Clark et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> and Yamada et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the reliability of virtual
reality-based exercise regimes has been proven. Research on virtual reality is ongoing.
Interactive virtual reality is defined as a tool for interaction between a user and his or
her computer. Virtual reality makes it possible to perform a much larger range of activities
and to create more diverse movements than in actual situations. Via virtual reality, users
interact with created scenarios or environments through diverse sensory channels<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sensory feedback (auditory, vision, and
proprioception) can be provided in virtual environment exercise training programs, and the
program can be tailored to each individual by changing the level of exercise according to
the individual&#x02019;s degree of adaptation to the training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adamovich et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that the rapid development of virtual reality technology
raised the possibility of developing new exercise strategies.</p><p>Many previous studies have examined the use of virtual reality in treating various
conditions, such as stroke<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, cerebral
palsy<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and traumatic brain
injury<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study
investigated changes in the balance ability of healthy elderly people following
virtual-reality balance training for the prevention of falls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 32 healthy elderly people aged between 65 and 80&#x02005;years who were randomly
assigned to either a virtual reality training group (n=17) or a control group (n=15). The
virtual reality training group received training three times per week for eight weeks with a
Nintendo Wii Fit program, while the control group received no intervention. Those whose
score on the Korean mini-mental status exam was lower than 23 and who had been diagnosed
with an orthopedic disease, such as fracture, within the previous six months were excluded
from this study. Additional exclusion criteria were the presence of any visual or auditory
abnormality; the consumption of drugs, such as opiates or alcohol; the consumption of
strepto antibiotics affecting balance prior to the examination; and the presence of a
progressive disorder or neurological disturbance (e.g., Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Alzheimer&#x02019;s
disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or stroke). All included patients understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>Subjects&#x02019; balance with their eye open and closed was measured using the Romberg test on a
Bio-rescue (RM INGENERIE, France). For the starting position, the subjects placed their
second toe on a diagonal line drawn on the foot plate, put their heels together, and
maintained an angle of 30 degrees between the feet. Measurements were taken with the
subject&#x02019;s eyes open for 60 seconds, and with their eyes closed for 60 seconds.</p><p>The Nintendo Wii Fit device used in the virtual reality training consists of a balance
board and a CD. When a subject mounts the balance board, an avatar appears on the screen and
imitates the subject&#x02019;s movements. The equipment not only provide visual and auditory
feedback, but also tactile feedback through vibration the Wii remote control. The following
balance games were used in this study: ski slalom, table tile, and balance bubble. The
subjects took part in each of the programs for 10 minutes. When the subjects performed each
program, they had to move their center of gravity without changing the position of their
feet on the balance board.</p><p>The means and standard errors of all variables were calculated using SPSS 20.0 KO (IBM, IL,
USA). The independent t-test was carried out to determine statistical variations between the
groups. In addition, the paired t-test was conducted to verify changes within each group
prior to and after the virtual reality training. Statistical significance was accepted for
values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparison of the general characteristics of the two groups showed no significant

reality training for the elderly is safe and economical, and that it may encourage user
interest. Interventions using virtual reality may improve the balance and gait of patients
and develop their fine motor function, gross motor function, and coordination<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, virtual reality training is
a safe and useful tool for enhancing the sensorimotor functions of Down&#x02019;s syndrome
patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and for improving stroke
patients&#x02019; balance and gait during rehabilitation treatment. It is an effective alternative
to physical therapy at home<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance training is considered to be an important aspect of a fall prevention program.
Balance training has been shown to improve the different aspects of postural control<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. balance training is effective
individually or in combination with other types of treatment approaches. Specific balance
training alone has been reported to result in a significant reduction in the rate of falls
among the elderly<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. A meta-analysis of
exercise interventions for fall prevention also recommended exercises that challenge the
balance<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance control or normal
postural control is essential for mobility as well as stability during functional
activities. Deficits in balance can lead to falls by the elderly, limiting their activities.
Therefore, balance assessment is very important for older adults, and balance training
should be an integral part of the management of older adults.</p><p>The total area over which the center of pressure moved was reduced after the virtual
reality training, suggesting that the balance ability of the subjects had improved. The
deviation of the center of pressure depends on proprioceptive information, the vestibular
system, and visual signals<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. For a
person to maintain balance without swaying in a standing position, the center of mass of the
body must remain within the base of support established by the movement of the center of
pressure<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural stability in a
static standing position may be quantified using the movement of the center of pressure, the
point of the vertical component of the ground reaction force, on the base of support. In the
virtual reality programs used in the present study, feed-forward strategies are used to
control the movements of the avatars. The subjects in the virtual reality training group
showed center of pressure excursion decrease, a result reflecting an improvement in
feed-forward strategies achieved through adjusting the avatars by moving weight from one leg
to the other. In a study by Van Ooteghem et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, the subjects&#x02019; excursion of center of mass also decreased on a
platform while vibration continued. This result is consistent with that of the present
study. The subjects who participated in the virtual reality training learned postural
control responses by observing their avatar on a screen. According to the results of the
measurements of the subjects&#x02019; balance with their eyes open and closed, the virtual reality
training improved their balance ability, both with and without visual information . Balance
requires the integration of proprioception, and vestibular system, and visual information.
In the elderly, postural stability and balance may not be functioning properly due to
problems with visual feedback<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Subjects&#x02019;dependence on visual input for balance decreases because of age-related eyesight
degeneration<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
eyesight deterioration did not seem to be a major factor in balance impairment. Regular
exercise by the elderly, whose physical functions decline as they grow older may be
effective at preventing falls. When regularly used, the Nintendo Wii-fit program represents
an accessible, fun, and economical method which can help to improve the balance of, and
prevent falls by the elderly.</p><p>Some limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results of the present study.
First, the control group did not engage in any training for 8 weeks. Therefore, the
effectiveness of virtual reality training was not evaluated against other balance training
methods. It is possible that simply doing any form of training was better than doing none
for these older adults. However, the main goal of this study was to assess whether the
virtual reality training would be effective at improving the balance control of older
adults. Second, we did not compareresults among the age groups, for example, 65&#x02013;69, 70&#x02013;74
and 75&#x02013;80. These two things should beresearched in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Loughlin</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Robitaille</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Boivin</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Incidence of and risk factors for falls and injurious
