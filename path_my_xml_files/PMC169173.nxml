The area under the pain relief versus time curve over four to six hours was dichotomized using validated equations to derive the proportion of patients with treatment and placebo with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours and calculate the number-needed-to-treat (NNT).

The NNT for one patient to have at least 50% relief over four to six hours with parecoxib 20 mg IV and 40 mg IV was 3.0 (2.3 to 4.1) and 2.3 (2.0 to 2.6) respectively. Mean time to remedication (weighted by trial size) was &#x0003e;24 hours with valdecoxib 40 mg, 8.7 hours with parecoxib 40 mg IV and 1.7 to 1.8 hours with placebo.

Known as 'coxibs', these drugs specifically inhibit only one of the two cyclo-oxygenase isoforms inhibited by older NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. and are thought to provide comparative efficacy but fewer gastrointestinal adverse events in chronic dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A systematic review of rofecoxib demonstrated that a 50 mg dose was effective in treating acute postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Not only did rofecoxib 50 mg show four to six hour efficacy at least equivalent to ibuprofen 400 mg and diclofenac 50 mg, but also a much longer duration as measured by time to next analgesia. This duration of analgesia was seen primarily in the context of third molar extractions, and, of course, reflects the high single dose of rofecoxib in acute pain of 50 mg &#x02013; twice to four times the daily chronic pain dose, reflecting an increased safety of coxibs over older NSAIDs. Other coxibs have yet to be evaluated in this way for acute pain.</p><p>Valdecoxib is an orally administered coxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Parecoxib is the sulphonamide-based pro-drug of valdecoxib and, for the moment, the only parenterally administered coxib available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There is no evidence that injected NSAIDs provide any greater degree of pain relief than the same drugs administered orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Parenteral preparations may, however, be particularly useful in the immediate postoperative period when patients are unable to take oral medication or are nauseated and vomiting.</p><p>Random chance poses a threat to the accuracy and precision of efficacy estimates from individual trial reports. Although single clinical trials can demonstrate statistical superiority of analgesic over placebo, random variation means that, if small, they provide a poor estimate of effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Combining results from appropriate trials in a meta-analysis means that more patients are included, giving a more accurate and reliable estimate of the extent of analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Individual trials in acute dental, gynaecologic and orthopaedic pain suggest that valdecoxib and parecoxib are both efficacious and well tolerated. The aims of this systematic review were to combine appropriate data to quantify the efficacy, duration of analgesia and associated adverse effects for single dose valdecoxib and parecoxib in the treatment of acute postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>QUORUM guidelines were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Possible studies for inclusion were sought through searching PubMed (Dec 2002) and the Cochrane Library (2002 issue 4) using parecoxib and valdecoxib as free text terms. Pfizer and Pharmacia were asked to provide copies of relevant abstracts and posters. Reference lists and review articles were examined for possible additional references, and in-house databases also checked for papers.</p><p>Abstracts were examined for possible inclusion if they were randomized trials conducted in an acute pain setting and used valdecoxib or parecoxib and a matched placebo (with or without an active comparator). Criteria for inclusion were: randomized controlled trials which included single dose treatment groups of valdecoxib or parecoxib, double blind design, baseline postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity, patients over 15 years of age, at least 10 patients per group, and the pain outcome measures of total pain relief (TOTPAR) or summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 4&#x02013;6 hours or sufficient data provided to allow their calculation. Posters and abstracts were accepted provided all criteria could be met. Pain measures allowed for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were a standard five point pain relief scale (none, slight, moderate, good, complete), a standard four point pain intensity scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) or a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain relief or pain intensity. The dichotomous information from the number of patients reporting 'good' and 'excellent' on a standard global scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent) were also accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Also of interest was information on the time to remedication. For adverse events, the primary outcome sought was the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event, with secondary outcomes of patients experiencing particular adverse events.</p><p>Each report which could possibly be described as a randomized controlled trial was read independently by at least two authors and scored using a commonly-used three item, 1&#x02013;5 score, quality scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Consensus was then achieved. The maximum score of an included study was 5 and the minimum score was 2. Authors were not blinded because they already knew the literature.</p><p>For each trial, mean TOTPAR, SPID, VASTOTPAR or VASSPID values for the first dose from each drug group were converted to %maxTOTPAR by division into the calculated maximum value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using valid equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The number of patients with at least 50%maxTOTPAR was then used to calculate relative benefit and NNT for treatment versus placebo. The same methods were used for adverse events.</p><p>Relative benefit and relative risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using a fixed effects model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Heterogeneity tests were not used as they have previously been shown to be unhelpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] though homogeneity was examined visually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Publication bias was not assessed using funnel plots as these tests have been shown to be unhelpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The number needed to treat or harm (NNT and NNH) with confidence intervals was calculated by the method of Cook and Sackett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] from the sum of all events and patients for treatment and placebo.</p><p>Relative benefit or risk was considered to be statistically significant when the 95% confidence interval did not include 1. NNT or NNH values were only calculated when the relative risk or benefit was statistically significant, and are reported with the 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance of any difference between numbers needed to treat was assumed if there was no overlap of the confidence intervals and statistically quantified using the z test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel 2001 on a Power Macintosh G3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Valdecoxib</title><p>Two fully published reports of three trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and one poster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] were included in the analyses.

Including active comparators there were 859 patients included across the four trials; 101 patients were treated with valdecoxib 20 mg, 279 with valdecoxib 40 mg and 194 with placebo. Comparator analgesics were rofecoxib 50 mg (183 patients in two trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].) and oxycodone 10 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg (102 patients in two trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]).

Compared with placebo the NNT for at least 50% pain relief with a single dose of valdecoxib 40 mg over six hours was 1.6 (1.4 to 1.8) and 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) for valdecoxib 20 mg. There was no significant difference in efficacy over 4 to 6 hours between valdecoxib 20 mg and 40 mg, though the 40 mg dose provided a longer duration of action (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The NNT for parecoxib 40 mg IV was 2.2 (1.8 to 2.7) and 3.0 (2.3 to 4.1) for parecoxib 20 mg IV. These differences in efficacy were again not significant and the 40 mg IV dose resulted in a slightly extended duration of action (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The difference between pain models was based on one dental trial compared with one laparotomy and two orthopaedic trials, and while a statistically significant difference was obtained, little weight can be given to this result without substantially more data. Adverse effects did not occur any more frequently with valdecoxib or parecoxib than with placebo however these results do not necessarily extrapolate to other scenarios, particularly chronic dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The methods of this review are well-established and clinical homogeneity assured by the inclusion criteria. It is therefore legitimate to compare these results with reviews of other oral and parenteral analgesics conducted in the same way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Both doses of valdecoxib had slightly lower (better) NNTs than other oral comparators (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The extended duration of analgesia, afforded particularly by valdecoxib 40 mg after third molar extraction, would seem worthwhile and exceeds that of other oral comparators (the weighted median time to remedication for ibuprofen 400 mg is 7.4 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the weighted median time to remedication for diclofenac 50 mg is 6.7 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). Parecoxib 20 mg IV had a lower (better) NNT than ketorolac 30 mg IM, parecoxib 40 mg IV had a lower (better) NNT than morphine 10 mg IM. Again, extended duration of action would seem to be a potential benefit. Parecoxib 20 mg IV was comparable with ketorolac 30 mg IV but the duration of parecoxib 40 mg IV exceeded that of ketorolac 30 mg, providing an additional three to four hours pain relief (though the duration of analgesia with ketorolac 60 mg IV was not available for further comparison).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>NNT League table showing valdecoxib and parecoxib alongside other analgesics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Oral analgesics</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Drug and dose</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Number of patients in comparison</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>NNT (95% CI)</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Valdecoxib 40 mg</td><td align="center">473</td><td align="center">1.6 (1.4 to 1.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Valdecoxib 20 mg</td><td align="center">204</td><td align="center">1.7 (1.4 to 2.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Rofecoxib 50 mg<sup>1</sup></td><td align="center">675</td><td align="center">2.3 (2.0 to 2.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diclofenac 50 mg<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">738</td><td align="center">2.3 (2.0 to 2.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ibuprofen 400 mg<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">4703</td><td align="center">2.4 (2.3 to 2.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Parenteral analgesics</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Drug and dose</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Number of patients in comparison</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>NNT (95% CI)</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Parecoxib 40 mg IV</td><td align="center">349</td><td align="center">2.2 (1.8 to 2.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Morphine 10 mg IM<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">946</td><td align="center">2.9 (2.6 to 3.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Parecoxib 20 mg IV</td><td align="center">346</td><td align="center">3.0 (2.3 to 4.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ketorolac 30 mg IM<sup>4</sup></td><td align="center">359</td><td align="center">3.4 (2.5 to 4.9)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>1.

One reason for this longer duration of action is that doses of coxibs used to achieve this are between one and four times the usual daily dose (usually 10 mg or 20 mg for valdecoxib, and 12.5 mg or 25 mg for rofecoxib). Compare this with, say, diclofenac, where an acute pain dose might be 25 mg or 50 mg, some one-sixth to one-third of the maximum daily dose of 150 mg. There should also be a note of caution. Clearly the very long duration of action after third molar extraction &#x02013; up to 24 hours with valdecoxib 40 mg &#x02013; is better than older NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. After other types of surgery the same long duration was not achieved to the same extent. Duration of analgesia may relate both to dose and specific clinical circumstance.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest advantage of meta-analysis is that by combining appropriate data the threat of random chance associated with small patient numbers is reduced. Methodological research has demonstrated that data from about 200 patients will be needed for credible estimates when the NNT is 2 and about 1,000 patients when the NNT is 3 to be 95% confident that the NNT is true &#x000b1; 0.5 of the observed value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>](The numbers of trials (and patients) included in the other analyses, though small compared to other published systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], is large enough to justify a certain degree of confidence in the conclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The comparisons between valdecoxib and parecoxib are important and address potentially significant methodological issues for pain research around the coxibs. Valdecoxib is a highly effective oral analgesic with an extended duration of action in dental pain. Parecoxib is also highly effective with a duration comparable with older NSAIDs. The difference between the two drugs is in target usage. Valdecoxib is more efficacious and has a longer duration of action than other oral NSAIDs and coxibs; parecoxib brings the benefits of an injectable coxib drug to the peri-operative and immediate post-operative period as well as to patients who are unable to swallow or are nauseated and vomiting.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>RAM &#x00026; HJM have consulted for various pharmaceutical companies.
