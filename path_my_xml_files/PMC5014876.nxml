Growing evidence links motor skills and physical activity to self-regulation. This study examined the efficacy of a motor skills intervention (i.e., the Children&#x02019;s Health Activity Motor Program, CHAMP) that is theoretically grounded in Achievement Goal Theory on motor skill performance and self-regulation in Head Start preschoolers. A sample of 113 Head Start preschoolers (M<sub>age</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;51.91&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.5&#x02009;months; 49.5% males) were randomly assigned to a treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68) or control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45) program. CHAMP participants engaged in 15, 40-min sessions of a mastery climate intervention that focused on the development of motor skills over 5&#x02009;weeks while control participants engaged in their normal outdoor recess period. The Delay of Gratification Snack Task was used to measure self-regulation and the Test of Gross Motor Development-2nd Edition was used to assess motor skills. All measures were assessed prior to and following the intervention. Linear mixed models were fit for both self-regulation and motor skills. Results revealed a significant time&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;treatment interaction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). In regard to motor skills, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons found that all children improved their motor skills (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), but the CHAMP group improved significantly more than the control group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Children in CHAMP maintained their self-regulation scores across time, while children in the control group scored significantly lower than the CHAMP group at the posttest (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). CHAMP is a mastery climate movement program that enhance skills associated with healthy development in children (i.e., motor skills and self-regulation). This efficacy trial provided evidence that CHAMP helped maintain delay of gratification in preschool age children and significantly improved motor skills while participating in outdoor recess was not effective. CHAMP could help contribute to children&#x02019;s learning-related skills and physical development and subsequently to their academic success.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>motor skills</kwd><kwd>motor</kwd><kwd>school readiness</kwd><kwd>delay of gratification</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7105"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Head Start is the largest federally sponsored early childhood education program in the United States and historically was developed to reduce socioeconomic disparities in school readiness (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, the percentage of children living in poverty has increased in the United States (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and conditions associated with living in poverty (e.g., lack of desirable housing, family stress, and exposure to community violence) significantly contribute to poor school adjustment (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Statistics also suggest that a growing percentage of American children, mainly those from families living in poverty, enter kindergarten lacking the skills (e.g., low self-regulatory skills) necessary for school success (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These children are unprepared for the behavioral and learning demands of the classroom, and often experience poor academic outcomes that contribute to grade retention, early school dropout, and conflictual relationships with peers and teachers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Educational programs or interventions that target specific competencies, like self-regulatory skills, could positively influence school readiness outcomes in preschoolers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There is a need to support high-quality early childhood experiences or interventions that could contribute to school readiness, especially for children in low-income families (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Although self-regulation appears to be critical in predicting a range of outcomes, research in this area has been somewhat constrained by inconsistencies in how self-regulation has been defined. In general, self-regulation refers to the voluntary control of attentional, emotional, and behavioral impulses in accordance with a long-term goal (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Specifically, self-regulation measures a child&#x02019;s ability to sustain his/her concentration and behavioral control while engaging in challenging tasks. More recently, self-regulation has been described as two distinct but related processes, including cognitive skills that facilitate working memory, response inhibition, planning, and attention shifting (i.e., executive functions) and behavioral skills that predispose individuals to more impulsive and immediately rewarding behaviors, including reactive under-control, sensation seeking, and delay of gratification (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There is also some evidence to suggest that while young children possess all of these cognitive and behavioral skills, the skills act in a unified manner during early childhood and do not differentiate into distinct processes until later in childhood (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Regardless of the exact definition used, self-regulation involves weighing a more appropriate response that typically aligns with an individual&#x02019;s long-term goals against a more gratifying response that provides immediate satisfaction (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Self-regulation has been shown to predict better school outcomes in preschool and elementary school (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), secondary school (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and college (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). There is also a growing body of work linking self-regulation in childhood with health behaviors and health outcomes later in life (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Evidence supports that children growing up in poverty and ethnic minority children, typically exhibit lower inhibitory control and delayed gratification along with increased problems associated with attention and working memory (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, efforts to support the development of self-regulation skills for these children are particularly critical.</p><p>Self-regulatory skills develop rapidly between the ages of 2 and 5&#x02009;years, as children enter preschool settings (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Teachers consistently report that children are not entering kindergarten with the basic social&#x02013;emotional skills needed to learn (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As a result, efforts to design and test theoretically driven classroom- or curriculum-based programs that enhance these skills have increased dramatically in the past decade. The Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) targeted Head Start teachers&#x02019; classroom management behaviors and was effective in improving attention, impulse control, and executive function of preschoolers. Improvements were associated with better kindergarten readiness skills, including improved reading and mathematic skills as well as reduced behavior problems (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Programs that target self-regulation skills have also been found to lead to better health outcomes including weight loss maintenance (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and healthier food choices (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) among youth.</p><p>Although there is evidence supporting the notion that self-regulation can be improved through interventions, very little research has examined this from a movement perspective. The body and brain work harmoniously together to understand and interpret the world around us, and the preschool years represent a period of rapid growth and development in both cognitive and motor skills. A recent systematic review found a weak-to-strong relationship between processes associated with self-regulation (i.e., cognitive skills) and motor skills in pediatric populations (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Diamond (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) also concluded that preschoolers&#x02019; motor and cognitive skills are related in early learning and development. For instance, Becker et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) found that young children&#x02019;s fine motor skills were related to executive function (e.g., inhibitory control and working memory) and behavioral self-regulation (e.g., Head&#x02013;Toes&#x02013;Knees&#x02013;Shoulders task). This finding supports a connection between motor skills and self-regulation that provides a strong rationale for using movement-based interventions to positively change self-regulation.</p><p>Lakes and Hoyt (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) found that compared to traditional Physical Education, a Tae Kwon Do approach lead to better self-regulation outcomes (working memory and inhibitory control) in elementary students. Palmer and colleagues (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) found that compared to a 30-min sedentary activity, an acute 30-min movement and physical activity-based intervention resulted in preschoolers demonstrating better sustained attention. These findings are promising and support that at least some aspects of self-regulation are malleable and can be enhanced through movement-based interventions.</p><p>This efficacy trial investigated the effect of an mastery climate motor skill intervention, the Children&#x02019;s Health Activity Motor Program (CHAMP), on motor skill performance and self-regulation in Head Start preschoolers. We had two research questions: (a) does participation in CHAMP lead to greater gains in preschoolers&#x02019; motor skills? and (b) does participation in CHAMP lead to improvements or maintenance in preschoolers&#x02019; self-regulation? Based on research documenting the effectiveness of mastery climate motor skill interventions in children (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we hypothesized that children in CHAMP would demonstrate significantly greater gains in motor skills over preschoolers in the control group. In regard to the second research question, we expected that children in CHAMP would exhibit improvements or maintenance in self-regulation over preschoolers in the control group. This hypothesis is based on research documenting the effectiveness of broader interventions that target self-regulation in children (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants and Settings</title><p>All participants were from a single Head Start center in the southeastern United States (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;113, 45 girls, M<sub>age</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2&#x02009;months; 80.5% African-American, 8.8% Caucasian American, 7.2% Hispanic, and 3.5% other).

The TGMD-2 is a criterion- and norm-referenced standardized assessment used to measure fundamental motor skills in children aged 3&#x02013;10&#x02009;years old. The TGMD-2 assesses two broad categories of motor skills: locomotor skills &#x02013; ability to propel the body through space and object control skills &#x02013; ability to propel or manipulate objects with the hands and feet. The six locomotor skills assessed are run, jump, leap, hop, gallop, and slide; the six object control skills are throw, strike off a tee, catch, kick, roll, and dribble. For each skill, three to five performance skill criteria are measured. For example, one performance criterion for running was that &#x0201c;arms move in opposition to legs, elbows bent.&#x0201d; A &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; is awarded if the performance criteria is successfully completed, and a &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; is awarded it the performance criteria is not successfully completed. The highest total raw score a child can receive is a 96 (i.e., a maximum of 48 for both the locomotor and object control skill components). A higher score represents higher motor skill performance, whereas lower score indicates the absence of critical elements (i.e., lower motor skill performance). When testing, children are given a visual demonstration of a skill execution that includes all skill criteria followed by one practice trial and two test trials for each skill. All TGMD-2 test trials were video recorded and later coded by a single coder blind to the study. The coder had previously established inter-rater reliability of 97%. Mean test&#x02013;retest reliability coefficients for the TGMD-2 subscales are 0.96 (locomotor) and 0.97 (object control).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Self-Regulation</title><p>The delay of gratification snack task of the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment was used to measure self-regulation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Delay of gratification is resisting a smaller more immediate reward in order to receive a larger reward later and is related to patience, impulse control, self-control, and willpower. For the delay of gratification snack task, children are instructed to keep their hands flat on the table. The researcher places a single snack object (i.e., goldfish cracker) under a clear cup in front of the child. The child is instructed to wait for the researcher&#x02019;s cue before picking up the snack and placing it in another cup to save for later. This task is repeated four times using different delay periods &#x02013; 10, 20, 30, and 15&#x02009;s. Each time the child is given a numerical score based on their behaviors during the delay period: eats treat (1), touches treat (2), touches cup/timer (3), and waits for researcher&#x02019;s cue before touching the snack (4). Snack task score ranges from 1 to 4, with higher score denoting better delaying capacity. The average scale score across all four delay periods was used in the final analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Children&#x02019;s Health Activity Motor Program</title><p>CHAMP is a mastery focused, evidence-based intervention that enhances motor skills (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), perceived physical competence (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and physical activity (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).

Mastery climates contribute to active engagement in the classroom that is characterized by the application of effective learning and problem solving strategies that could potentially enhance self-regulation.

Thus, it is possible that self-regulation could be enhanced when children engage in mastery-oriented climates. These climates allow individuals to make their own decisions relating to learning tasks, to create goals and strategies, and to implement actions to meet goals within a learning context while managing their emotions, focusing their attention, and planning their actions.</p><p>CHAMP uses as mastery climate approach to provide children the opportunity to navigate a developmentally appropriate movement environment (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). CHAMP is an evidence-based program that draws on effective instructional pedagogies from the physical education literature and principles that focus on critical elements and cue words of motor skills, effective modeling and demonstration, continuous and appropriate feedback, and repetitive cycling of motor skills and tasks. Newell&#x02019;s constraints model is used to appropriately scaffold motor skills to promote motor skill acquisition (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). CHAMP targets children&#x02019;s intrinsic motivation and persistence. Three theoretical tenets of Achievement Goal Theory are crucial to CHAMP: (a) the relationship between effort and personal progress, (b) learners&#x02019; self-selection of tasks, and (c) the environmental climate [Ref. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>); see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for a more detailed description of the alignment of these tenets with the TARGET structures, Ref. (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)].</p><p>CHAMP was implemented by two trained instructors in motor development &#x02013; one Ph.D. researcher with 10&#x02009;years of experience with implementing high-autonomy movement programs in pre- and elementary school settings and one Ph.D. student with 2&#x02009;years of experience. Each session was 40&#x02009;min in duration and consisted of (a) 2-min warm up designed to increase the heart and respiration rate, (b) 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;min of introductory activities where the motor skills were demonstrated, modeled, and the critical elements/cue words were instructed to the learners, (c) 20&#x02013;25&#x02009;min of motor skill engagement that adheres to the TARGET structures, (d) 5&#x02013;7&#x02009;min a large group activity that focused on reinforcing motor skills and increasing heart rate, and (e) 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;min of a closure activity that reinforced the critical elements and cue words of the motor tasks.

Parental consent was first obtained on all children, which was followed by child assent. Children were then randomly assigned to either a CHAMP treatment or control (outdoor/free-play recess) condition. Children in the CHAMP group replaced their outdoor recess with CHAMP 3&#x02009;days/week for 5&#x02009;weeks, and children in the control group did not make any changes in their daily routine. The control condition was the preschool&#x02019;s typical movement program (i.e., outdoor/free-play recess) and was implemented according to the existing procedures within the preschool center. The center&#x02019;s outdoor program consist of outdoor free-play activity on a large playground area with a variety of play structures (e.g., swings, slides, and ladders) that promote gross movement and activity in preschoolers. All movement sessions were 40&#x02009;min in duration. The total dose of the CHAMP intervention was 15, 40-min sessions&#x02009;=&#x02009;600&#x02009;min.

Further evidence also supports that children who receive no formalized instruction demonstrate no improvements in these skills (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>Our first hypothesis aligned with the previous literature (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Specifically, we found that all children significantly improved their motor skills across time but the greatest gains were seen in children who completed CHAMP. CHAMP participants demonstrated a ~42 points improvement in TGMD-2 raw scores while control participants only exhibited an ~8 point improvement. This is a difference of 34 points. As a reminder, the children demonstrated similarly motor skills at pretest and differences were only present following the intervention &#x02013; CHAMP participants exhibited motor skills at the 76th%tile, while the control group was at the 10th%tile. These findings support that motor skills are not naturally occurring behaviors but are skills that need to be taught, practiced, and reinforced with high-quality instruction and feedback.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>CHAMP and Self-Regulation Outcomes</title><p>Self-regulatory skills are also important and aid in healthy child development. These skills allow individuals to monitor and control their behavior, emotions, or thoughts and alter them based on the demands of the current situation. Research supports that these skills predict school success and achievement (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). With self-regulation occurring during the early childhood years, there is a need for effective intervention programs. The theoretical foundation and implementation structure of the CHAMP intervention aligns with both cognitive and behavioral components of self-regulation, making it a potential avenue to simultaneously enhance self-regulation and health outcomes in this population.</p><p>We predicted that the CHAMP participants would exhibit greater gains or maintenance in self-regulation over preschoolers in the control group. The children began the intervention with similar scores on the delay of gratification snack task, but our findings indicate that the control group scored significantly lower than CHAMP participants after the intervention. These findings provide great promise as it relates to the potential use of CHAMP to maintain self-regulation in preschoolers. In this current efficacy trial, it was difficult for the preschoolers&#x02019; delay of gratification scores to increase since they scored close to the maximum at pretest (i.e., ~3.8 out of 4.0). However, the CHAMP participants self-regulation (i.e., delaying capacity) was maintained across the 5-week period. The TARGET structures that were manipulated within CHAMP to create a mastery climate appear to support self-regulatory skills. For example, students were given authority and responsibility to decide how they engaged in the movement environment as it related to the task activities they chose, level of difficulty, time allotment (time management), and grouping (peer interaction). They also had to self-evaluate their own progress/performance and self-manage their behavior (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> provides a detailed description of the TARGET structure and alignment with CHAMP and self-regulation). These behaviors align with the behavioral regulation (i.e., inhibition of an immediate, impulse control, and inappropriate behavior) skills that are necessary to complete the delay of gratification task.</p><p>There could be several reasons why we did not see an increase in self-regulation scores in the current study. Lakes and Hoyt (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) used a Tae Kwon Do treatment during physical education to promote self-regulation in K &#x02013; 5th graders and found positive improvements in working memory and inhibitory control. The intervention dose was a total of 1080&#x02009;min (26, 45&#x02009;min sessions over 3&#x02009;months) compared to the CHAMP treatment that was 600&#x02009;min (15, 40-min sessions over 5&#x02009;weeks). Other early childhood intervention studies that are not movement-based have also seen benefits from a treatment with a larger dose (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first movement-based intervention that addressed this question in preschoolers. Future work examining the impact of movement-based interventions to promote self-regulation outcomes is needed. The CHAMP intervention appeared to be effective in maintaining self-regulation which was a positive finding, but the sample size could have also been another limiting factor.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Limitations and Future Research</title><p>Although the present study supports the preliminary efficacy of a mastery-based movement program, CHAMP, on motor skill performance and self-regulation in preschool age children, there are some limitations. One limitation of this study was that only one measure, delay of gratification snack task, was used to assess self-regulation in the preschoolers. In an ideal experiment, a combination of direct measures, teacher reports, and classroom observations would be used to provide a comprehensive understanding of children&#x02019;s self-regulation skills. Due to the fact that this was an efficacy trial, it was not feasible but future work should incorporate a board range of assessments. Additionally, various constraints within the preschool schedule (e.g., field trip, weather closures, and delays), we were unable to conduct pretest delay of gratification assessments on all of the children which contributed to the smaller sample size. This was beyond our control and a limitation of the efficacy trial.</p><p>One may argue that an outdoor recess (free-play) is not a true control. But, it is quite difficult to withhold the standard practice in an early childhood programs when the intervention is a movement program. There is a vast amount of evidence from the motor development literature that clearly establishes the use of outdoor recess (free-play) as control group for intervention studies due to the fact that children in these groups see no improvements in this motor skills (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), physical competence (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), or physical activity participation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this efficacy trial, the control participants (i.e., outdoor recess/free-play) demonstrated a significant decline in self-regulation when everything in their preschool day was held consistent to their CHAMP counterparts. Therefore, we assume that the mastery climate, CHAMP intervention was a determining factoring that positively affected the children&#x02019;s delayed of gratification.</p><p>Future studies should also consider other aspects of the interventions that could also affect children&#x02019;s self-regulation. For this efficacy trial, no data were assessed on the classroom and home environment. Information regarding the classroom teachers, classroom environment, parenting style, and home environment would have been useful, since these factors have a significance influence on the development of children&#x02019;s self-regulation (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4-4"><title>Practical Implications and Conclusions</title><p>There is a growing priority to promote motor skill competence in children as it contributes to positive health trajectories (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). CHAMP delivers a high-quality movement program in a mastery climate environment. CHAMP is an evidence-based intervention that enhances motor skills, perceived motor competence, and physical activity in children (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This efficacy trial provides evidence that CHAMP also aids in maintaining a key competency that is associated with school readiness outcomes in preschoolers&#x02019; (i.e., delay of gratification). The present study has the potential to shape and inform preschool curricula as a means of integrating movement education and school readiness that will help preschoolers enter school healthy, activity, and ready to learn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LR conceptualized and designed the study.
