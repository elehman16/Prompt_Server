The present study was undertaken to compare continuous femoral nerve blockade (CFNB) with continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) for postoperative pain control in knee surgeries.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The patients belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II scheduled for various knee surgeries under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into two equal groups of thirty patients each. The Group I patients received CFNB and in the Group II patients epidural catheter was placed preoperatively. Postoperatively, continuous infusion with 0.0625% bupivacaine and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml started at 5 ml/h for 72 h in both the groups. Data on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, hemodynamic changes, side effects at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h and requirement of analgesic doses for the first 24 h of the surgery were noted.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In both the groups, pain was well controlled, mean VAS of pain were 0.2, 0.6, 2.47, 2.07, 2.73, 1.5, 1.43, 1.37, and 1.3 for femoral and 0.13, 0.93, 2.57, 2.17, 2.33, 1.6, 1.43, 1.30, and 1.33 for epidural group during 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h which was not statistically significant.

In addition to the physiological ill effects, the presence of postoperative symptoms including pain significantly contributes to patient's dissatisfaction with their anesthetic and surgical experience. It has been proven beyond doubt that inadequately treated postoperative pain may lead to chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Major knee surgery such as total knee joint replacement and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. These lower limb procedures are amenable to regional anesthesia techniques which reduce neuroendocrine stress responses, central sensitization of nervous system and muscle spasms which occur in response to painful stimuli.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The use of epidural analgesia in the management of postoperative pain following orthopedic surgeries has evolved as a critical component of multimodal approach to achieve the goal of pain relief, early mobilization, and improved compliance with physiotherapy resulting in overall improved outcomes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Patients who receive epidural analgesia may have autonomic disturbances, unintended motor blockade, urinary retention, and pruritis (with opioids as adjuvants) as adverse effects and there is increased risk of neurological complications related to anticoagulant therapy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>An alternative regional anesthesia technique is peripheral nerve blockade of the lower limb. One of the most promising of them is the continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNBs) also known as &#x0201c;continuous perineural blocks&#x0201d; which offer tremendous advantage in the perioperative period. CPNB are site-specific and offer superior analgesia and are not associated with the possible side effects of opioid analgesia such as nausea, vomiting, sedation and respiratory depression. There is increasing evidence to indicate that CPNB aid in early mobilization, decrease in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the perioperative period, aid better sleep pattern and decrease the incidence of cognitive dysfunction in the perioperative period.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we aimed to compare continuous femoral blockade with continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) for knee surgeries in terms of efficacy of analgesia, requirement of rescue analgesic agents in the first 24 h of surgery, hemodynamic stability and to determine adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining approval from the ethical clearance committee, this study was conducted over a period of 18 months. The selection of patients was carried out randomly using a computer-generated number. Written informed consent was obtained from all these patients. Patients aged between 18 and 75 years of both genders belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II and undergoing elective knee surgery were included in the study. Patients who refused, had infection at the site of injection or coagulation abnormalities, were hypersensitive to the study drugs, had spinal abnormalities were excluded from the study.</p><p>Premedication was standardized with tablet pantoprazole 40 mg PO night before surgery and 2 h before surgery, tablet ondansetron 4 mg PO night before surgery and 2 h before surgery and tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg PO night before surgery. Patients were explained the procedure of spinal anesthesia and continuous femoral nerve block or CEA for postoperative pain control at the time of preanesthetic evaluation and instructed about the visual analog scale for pain, i.e., 0 = no pain and 10 = Worst possible pain.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into two groups:</p><p>

However, despite advances in the knowledge of pathophysiology of pain, the pharmacology of analgesics and the development of more effective techniques, patients continue to experience considerable pain after surgery.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The emphasis is on total or optimal pain relief allowing normal function without major strain on equipment and surveillance systems or without significant side effects. This could be achieved by adopting combined analgesic regimens. The rationale for this strategy is the achievement of sufficient analgesia due to additive or synergistic effects between different analgesics, with concomitant reduction of side effects. The primary emphasis is made on moderate and severe pain and the use of and need for prolonged, continuous, or intermittent regimens.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Opioids reduce the spontaneous rest pain but their ability to control dynamic pain is limited.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In the last few years, efforts include the pursuit of nonopioid analgesic adjuncts and refining continuous regional analgesic techniques.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Epidural analgesia continues to be the emphasis of anesthesia-based acute pain services. In general, most recent studies continue to demonstrate the advantages of epidural analgesia if LAs are used in combination with opioids.</p><p>Although studies indicate that continuous infusions using lipophilic opioids such as fentanyl administered epidurally or parenterally are equivalent in dosage requirements and quality of analgesia, epidural lipophilic opioids remain popular.</p><p>Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) provide intense, site-specific analgesia and are associated with a lower incidence of side effects when compared with many other modalities of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Continuous catheter techniques provide extended analgesia and improved functional recovery.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These advantages can facilitate an early discharge and achieve significant perioperative cost savings. This is of tremendous value in a modern health-care system that stresses cost-effective use of resources and a continued shift toward shorter hospital stay as well as outpatient surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Paul <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and found that continuous femoral nerve block was far superior to patient-controlled analgesia for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The innervations of the knee by the sciatic nerve component is minimal. The studies have evaluated the equivalent analgesia with or without sciatic nerve blockade for knee surgeries. The femoral-sciatic block may lead to complications because of motor block of the hamstrings added to the femoral block of the quadriceps muscle might increase the risk of falls and there also a risk of developing heel ulcer.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The continuous femoral nerve infusion of LA has been found to provide similar analgesia but fewer side effects than a single dose of intrathecal morphine,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] epidural morphine,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or a continuous infusion of epidural LA.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Our study showed no significant hemodynamic changes in both the groups during the infusion for 72 h, consistent with the study of Dauri <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the intraoperative anesthesia for surgery was subarachnoid block with bupivacaine and fentanyl. The addition of intrathecal fentanyl prolonged the analgesia without the motor block in both the groups during immediate postoperative period, explaining the extended analgesia in the immediate postoperative period.</p><p>The VAS remained within the mild pain range throughout the study period. The efficacy of analgesia in our study is similar to the trend observed by Dauri <italic>et al</italic>. during 36 h postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The VAS at rest during continuous passive motion and during physiotherapy were comparable on postoperative days 1 and 2 and 3 between the two groups. In a meta-analysis by Fowler <italic>et al</italic>., the principal finding is that a PNB technique using femoral nerve blockade provides analgesia, which is comparable with an epidural but with a lower incidence of hypotension.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Patients who complained of pain with corresponding VAS &#x0003e;3 received rescue analgesia (17/19 CFNB/CEA) in the form of injection tramadol 50 mg intravenously. The consumption of analgesic doses among the groups was not significant.</p><p>The patients in CEA had more incidences of pruritis 11 versus 1 in the CFNB group, urinary retention 5 versus 1, dizziness in one patient compare to none in CFNB group, and incidence of headache was similar. In the patients with urinary retention, bladder catheterization was done, one patient in either the group had headache which was treated with reassurance and tablet paracetamol and patients with pruritus and dizziness did not require any treatment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>]. We did not find motor blockade in either group of patients as we used lower concentrations (0.0625%) of bupivacaine and increased the incidence of side effects in the CEI group were probably due to systemic absorption of opioids.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of adverse events among the groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-599-g008"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In our study, we found that both epidural analgesia and continuous femoral blockade provide effective analgesia and CFNB induces fewer side effects than epidural analgesia. CFNB can be recommended as an effective regional component of a multimodal analgesia strategy after knee surgery. Use of CFNB provides prolonged duration of analgesia and is preferable for those who present challenges regarding catheter placement such as with previous lumbar spine surgery and on anticoagulant therapy.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>However, there are insufficient data to provide firm recommendations for virtually all aspects of CFNB analgesia. Future work will need to determine which surgical procedures gain benefit from CFNB, what optimal solutions for each application, and optimal means of delivery for each application. The further trial may need to show advantages beyond improved analgesia and decreased side effects to justify their continued use.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogunnaike</surname><given-names>BO</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Consequences of inadequate postoperative pain relief and chronic persistent postoperative pain</article-title><source>Anesthesiol Clin North America</source><year>2005</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15763409</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Symons</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabato</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Myles</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidural analgesia compared with peripheral nerve blockade after major knee surgery.
