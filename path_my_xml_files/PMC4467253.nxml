On Day 1 of each 4-day period, participants began oral domperidone 10 or 20&#x02009;mg q.i.d., matching placebo q.i.d., or single-dose moxifloxacin 400&#x02009;mg (positive control)/placebo q.i.d. In each period, triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline (30, 20, and 10&#x02009;minutes predose), 8 timepoints after dosing on Days 1 and 4, and predose on Day 4. In mixed effects models, the largest difference for domperidone in least squares means for change from baseline QTcP versus placebo was 3.4&#x02009;milliseconds (20&#x02009;mg q.i.d., Day 4), 90% CI: 1.0&#x02013;5.9, and &#x0003c;10&#x02009;milliseconds at all timepoints for both domperidone dosages. Moxifloxacin response confirmed assay sensitivity. Participants achieved expected domperidone plasma exposures. No significant exposure-response relationship was found for QTc increase per ng/mL domperidone (90% CI of the slope estimate included zero at mean C<sub>max</sub> on Day 1 or Day 4). In summary, domperidone at doses up to 80&#x02009;mg/day did not cause clinically relevant QTc interval prolongation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>domperidone</kwd><kwd>QTc</kwd><kwd>cardiac safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Domperidone, a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist with gastrokinetic and anti-emetic properties,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> has been marketed for over 35 years in more than 100 countries for the relief of nausea and vomiting symptoms, epigastric sense of fullness, upper abdominal discomfort, and regurgitation of gastric contents in adults, and for the relief of nausea and vomiting symptoms in children.

One participant discontinued study drug prematurely due to an adverse event of allergic dermatitis during treatment with moxifloxacin.

Doses exceeding the highest dose approved globally for prescription use of domperidone were not tested in this study because preclinical electrophysiological in vitro and in vivo studies have already shown that domperidone, at very high concentrations, may prolong the QTc interval, without arrhythmogenic or torsadogenic effects at these concentrations.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Historically, in less well controlled studies, when domperidone was given together with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole or erythromycin, drugs that prolong QT by themselves, the upper limit of the 90% two-sided CI for the largest mean difference in change of QTc from baseline versus placebo was shown to exceed 10&#x02009;milliseconds.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Domperidone is metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the C<sub>max</sub> of domperidone has been shown to increase less than three-fold under maximal CYP3A4 inhibition. In those interaction studies, the mean increase in QTc for domperidone 10&#x02009;mg q.i.d. at steady-state was 1.6&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;milliseconds, and for ketoconazole (200&#x02009;mg b.i.d.) and erythromycin (500&#x02009;mg t.i.d.), 3.8 and 4.9&#x02009;milliseconds, respectively. For the combined treatment of domperidone with ketoconazole or erythromycin, the mean increase in QTc was 9.8&#x02013;9.9&#x02009;milliseconds.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, domperidone is not recommended to be administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that also prolong QT.</p><p>Several animal models have been used to investigate the electrocardiographic effects of domperidone. In anesthetized and conscious dogs, safety margins for QT prolongation were greater than 25- and nine-fold plasma concentrations at maximum recommended therapeutic doses, respectively, and in a rabbit proarrhythmia model, no proarrhythmia was observed at concentrations 367-fold plasma concentrations at maximum recommended therapeutic doses. In an isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart model (Hondeghem Screenit&#x02122; system), no effects were found on proarrhythmic parameters at 100&#x02009;nM (17-fold margin). TdP was observed in one of six hearts at 300&#x02009;nM (52-fold margin) and in three of six hearts at 1,000&#x02013;3,000&#x02009;nM (173- to 519-fold margin). A subsequent publication of an extensive validation of this isolated heart test system found comparable results and margins for domperidone.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, publications of more recent experiments using the Screenit&#x02122; system, revised to enhance sensitivity, have shown effects of domperidone at lower concentrations by using a lower concentration range (30, 60, and 100&#x02009;nM), a higher incubation temperature of 37&#x000b0;C, and a longer exposure time of 150&#x02009;minutes.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These changes to the experimental protocol, as well as the absence of concurrent vehicle controls and the lack of blinded validation of the revised model with a series of other drugs with and without known arrhythmogenic liabilities in humans, as was done previously,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> limit the relevance of the testing model for predicting safety and informing the assessment of risk in humans. Furthermore, the relevance of nonclinical studies with domperidone is progressively being outweighed by accruing post-marketing safety information and clinical trial evidence as reported herein.</p><p>In summary, domperidone at doses up to 80&#x02009;mg/day&#x02014;the highest oral dose approved globally for prescription use&#x02014;did not cause clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval in this thorough QT study. No new safety signal was observed in this study based on assessments of ECG morphology, adverse events, or changes in laboratory parameters.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing support was provided by Sandra Norris, Pharm.D. of the Norris Communications Group, LLC and funded by Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC.
