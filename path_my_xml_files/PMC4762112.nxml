The BP lowering effects of most antihypertensive therapies are often greater in the first 12&#x02005;h compared to the next 12&#x02005;h. The Treatment In Morning versus Evening (TIME) study aims to establish whether evening dosing is more cardioprotective than morning dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The TIME study uses the prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) design. TIME recruits participants by advertising in the community, from primary and secondary care, and from databases of consented patients in the UK. Participants must be aged over 18&#x02005;years, prescribed at least one antihypertensive drug taken once a day, and have a valid email address. After the participants have self-enrolled and consented on the secure TIME website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timestudy.co.uk">http://www.timestudy.co.uk</ext-link>) they are randomised to take their antihypertensive medication in the morning or the evening. Participant follow-ups are conducted after 1&#x02005;month and then every 3&#x02005;months by automated email. The trial is expected to run for 5&#x02005;years, randomising 10&#x02005;269 participants, with average participant follow-up being 4&#x02005;years. The primary end point is hospitalisation for the composite end point of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke (cerebrovascular accident; CVA) or any vascular death determined by record-linkage. Secondary end points are: each component of the primary end point, hospitalisation for non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation for non-fatal MI, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation or death from congestive heart failure. The primary outcome will be a comparison of time to first event comparing morning versus evening dosing using an intention-to-treat analysis. The sample size is calculated for a two-sided test to detect 20% superiority at 80% power.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>TIME has ethical approval in the UK, and results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>UKCRN17071; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</kwd><kwd>EPIDEMIOLOGY</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use of technology including an electronic case report form and record linkage to identify potential end points allows efficient data management.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The open-label design provides good external validity.

As the day:night BP ratio increases, cardiovascular risk appears to decrease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> There is also evidence to suggest that antihypertensive drugs taken in the evening rather than in the morning reduce nocturnal blood pressure to a greater extent,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> and might have more benefit in hypertension alone<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and hypertension with diabetes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A recent study that examined the effect on nocturnal blood pressure of drugs taken in the evening in participants with resistant hypertension found that bedtime dosing resulted in significantly lower 24&#x02005;h means of systolic and diastolic BP (by 4.1/1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) and that this difference between groups was driven by asleep BP (9.7/4.4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg lower).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The most recent and most compelling evidence in favour of nocturnal dosing comes from the Monitorizaci&#x000f3;n Ambulatoria para Predicci&#x000f3;n de Eventos Cardiovasculares (MAPEC) study which randomly assigned 2156 hypertensive patients to take all of their antihypertensive drugs on awakening or to take one or more of them at bedtime.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> All patients in this study underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at baseline and yearly, and all wore wrist activity metres to control for the effects of activity on BP and to determine when participants were asleep.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Participants in the study who took one or more antihypertensive drugs at bed-time had 68 cardiovascular events whereas those who took all medication on awakening had 187 events; a relative risk reduction of 64% (p&#x0003c;0.001). Forty-eight-hour ABPM showed lower systolic BP (122.1&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg morning dosing vs 120.8&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg evening dosing p=0.029) with evening dosing and this difference was due to lower asleep systolic blood pressure (116.1&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg morning dosing vs 110.9&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg evening dosing, p&#x0003c;0.001). The MAPEC study was limited in that it was not prospectively powered, the process of randomisation was not reported, and the end points included some unusual cardiovascular events, and were not independently adjudicated.</p><p>Further studies are needed to establish the optimal time of dosing for hypertensive patients.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, the present study aims to substantiate the findings of the MAPEC study and test the hypothesis that nocturnal dosing of antihypertensive medication reduces cardiovascular events compared with conventional morning dosing. Secondary questions will examine whether there are any downsides to nocturnal dosing and if nocturnal dosing is acceptable to patients, for example, whether nocturnal dosing of diuretics causes unacceptable nocturia will be evaluated. Data will also be collected on nocturnal hypotension and its consequences (eg, falls and fractures).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The Treatment In Morning versus Evening (TIME) study is a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) design<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> controlled clinical trial. TIME (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timestudy.co.uk">http://www.timestudy.co.uk</ext-link>) builds on a successful novel methodology to track patient outcome using information technology (IT).

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> End points will be detected by record-linkage to hospitalisation, death certification records and regular email contacts with patients and nominated surrogates. Primary or secondary care records and physicians will be contacted for further data, if required (all patients must consent to their medical records and physicians being accessed or contacted). All end-point adjudication will be blinded to dosing time and original medical records will be retrieved for hospitalisation events to validate end points.

The TIME study underwent a pilot phase between 2011 and 2014 to determine feasibility of a full study. At that time the study was not adopted by the UKCRN and so trial registration was not possible. There were doubts as to the viability of the study being conducted online and whether there would be sufficient recruitment uptake. Once the study was deemed sustainable, funding was in place, and the clinical trials networks adopted the study, it was prospectively registered in ISCRTN and the pilot transferred to the full study.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010313F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010313f01"/></fig><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010313F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>TIME study flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010313f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment strategy</title><p>In an effort to recruit the necessary number of participants, the full study will seek to recruit by advertising to hypertensive patients in the UK from primary care, secondary care and from databases of patients who have previously consented to being contacted about potential research projects.

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> BP-lowering has relatively little impact on the rate of cognitive decline; but most trials used morning dosing only. The main purpose of cognitive testing in TIME will be to detect temporal change, particularly any sustained reduction in performance, associated with time of antihypertensive dosing. We propose to use combined telephone testing with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test and the Trends in Cognitive Sciences<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> to assess cognitive function in consenting participants in the TIME trial.

The IDMC will also have the opportunity to make a recommendation of early stopping because of overwhelming evidence of benefit from evening dosing based on interim analyses after approximately 50% and 75% of the target number of adjudicated study outcomes have been observed. Overwhelming evidence of benefit is defined as evidence of benefit of evening dosing versus morning dosing (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s7a"><title>Steering committee and IDMC</title><p>The TIME steering committee oversees the appropriate scientific and ethical conduct of the trial, provides advice to the Study Sponsor, advises on the conduct and analysis of the study, and approves all publications and substudies.

All data are entered directly by participants, thereby helping to reduce researcher time and costs. Participant's GPs are made aware of their participation in the study but there is no significant workload implication and GPs are not required to submit data. The study allows participants to self-enrol, consent and provide data in a secure online environment. The TIME study has been awarded a grant from the BHF to write to 300&#x02005;000 patients across the UK to achieve its target of randomising over 10&#x02005;000 participants.</p><p>If the TIME study shows definite benefits of dosing antihypertensive medication in the evening rather than the morning, this would represent the most cost-effective advance in the treatment of hypertension and the prevention of CV disease in recent years. TIME will also establish whether participants can tolerate nocturnal dosing and whether there are any AEs of nocturnal versus morning dosing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>British Heart Foundation; British Hypertension Society Research Network; UK Clinical Research Network; Scottish Primary Care Research Network.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The idea was conceived by TMM.
