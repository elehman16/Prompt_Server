Twenty-one healthy male college soccer players (age: 20.14 &#x000b1; 1.65 years; body height: 179.9 &#x000b1; 8.34 cm; body mass: 74.4 &#x000b1; 13.0 kg; % body fat: 9.45 &#x000b1; 4.8) participated in the study. Subjects underwent four different randomized warm-up protocols separated by at least 48 hours. The warm-up schemes were: 1. no conditioning contraction protocol (NCC); 2. dynamic stretching (DS); 3. prolonged intermittent low-intensity isometric exercise (ST); and, 4. ST with an additional external load equal to 30% of body weight (ST + 30% BW). All interventions were preceded by a general warm-up. Results from one-way repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference in countermovement jump (CMJ) at F(3,60) = 10.2, &#x003b7;&#x003c1;<sup>2</sup> = 0.337, p &#x0003c; 0.01. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference in CMJ performance in DS when compared to NCC and ST + 30% BW. No significant difference in CMJ was observed between DS and ST. CMJ scores in NCC, ST, and ST + 30% BW were non-significant. There was a significant difference in speed; F(3, 60) = 6.61, &#x003b7;&#x003c1;<sup>2</sup> = 0.248, p &#x0003c; 0.01. Post hoc analysis revealed significantly better time in DS than NCC and ST. However, no difference in speed was observed between DS and ST + 30% BW. Similarly, speed was similar in NCC, ST and ST + 30% BW. A significant difference in agility performance was also observed; F(3, 60) = 24.1, &#x003b7;&#x003c1;<sup>2</sup>= 0.546, p &#x0003c; 0.01. Post hoc analysis revealed significantly greater performance gains in DS than NCC. No significant difference in agility was observed in DS, ST and ST + 30% BW. In conclusion, a prolonged intermittent low-intensity isometric protocol using bodyweight only showed similar benefits with dynamic stretching in countermovement jump performance. When the same isometric condition with additional load equal to 30% of bodyweight was applied, effects in speed and agility were similar to dynamic stretching.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>post activation potentiation</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd><kwd>conditioning contraction</kwd><kwd>countermovement jump</kwd><kwd>external load</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Warm-up is generally promoted as an ergogenic activity that is believed to assist athletes achieve their full physical potential in training or competition [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Warm-up raises body temperature, increases nerve conduction velocity, elevates muscle enzyme activity, and augments dilation of blood vessels that provide blood flow for better muscle oxidation during work. The aforementioned physiological mechanisms facilitate greater muscle force and power production [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which are important in team sports requiring acceleration, deceleration, or change of direction [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Coaches use different warm-up conditions [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that aerobic warm-up and dynamic stretching are beneficial for sprint, jump, and agility tasks [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. On the other hand, static stretching schemes with intensity at or above a point of discomfort or used with duration not longer than 45 s are scrutinized in performance settings for delivering detrimental effects [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Contrastingly, a cyclic static stretch may seem to reduce the debilitative effects of static stretching [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Some coaches use complex training in warm-up sessions. Complex training involves a set of strength training exercise (isometric or dynamic) followed by a biomechanically similar plyometric exercise [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This concept is based on a phenomenon called post activation potentiation (PAP). PAP is defined as acute enhancement of muscular power output produced by performing a preload stimulus before an actual activity [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is known that any previous muscle activity can trigger both PAP and fatigue mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Contractile history of a muscle is said to have a positive effect on muscle performance, especially in terms of twitch contractions, rate of force development and explosive movements [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This improved muscular performance can be attributed to increased phosphorylation of myosin light chains and increased motor neuron excitability [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies revealed that use of heavy multi-joint resistance training with preload of 1&#x02013;3 sets and 1&#x02013;5 repetitions of 75&#x02013;100% 1RM [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or high velocity exercises with 1&#x02013;3 sets and 3&#x02013;5 repetitions of 10&#x02013; 40% of 1RM [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are effective stimuli for PAP. In a similar vein, isometric conditions using single-joint exercises of 1&#x02013;3 sets with 3&#x02013;10 s of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) 1&#x02013;3 min prior to performance [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or multi-joint isometric exercises of single or multiple sets [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were found to produce PAP.</p><p>Most of the studies in loaded isometric warm-up schemes used a maximum or near maximum load. To the researchers&#x02019; knowledge, no studies have been performed on prolonged intermittent low-intensity isometric exercises in warm-up settings. Such a void in the current literature failed to explain possible mechanisms of isometric exercises as conditioning contractions on performance. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of different warm-up interventions on jump, sprint and agility performance in soccer players using a within-subject repeated measures experimental design. It was hypothesized that low-intensity intermittent isometric exercise as a preconditioning stimulus in warm-up would positively influence the jump, sprint and agility performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-one healthy male college soccer players (age: 20.14 &#x000b1; 1.65 years; body height: 179.9 &#x000b1; 8.34 cm; body mass: 74.4 &#x000b1; 13.0 kg;% body fat: 9.45 &#x000b1; 4.8) with no reported injuries for the past six months agreed to participate in the study. The subjects had been consistently participating in regular soccer training sessions for a total of 10 hours per week and strength and conditioning training for 3 hours per week. Prior to experimentation, they were asked to refrain from strenuous training at least 48 hours and sleep at least 6-8 hours. Tobacco, alcohol and caffeine consumption were also prohibited. The participants were allowed a light meal at least three hours prior to each testing session. Fluid consumption in small amounts was also encouraged during the testing sessions. Players were told they were free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Signed informed consent forms were collected from all players after a detailed verbal and written explanation of the experimental design, purpose of the study, testing protocols, research benefits and potential risks of the study.

On day 1, anthropometric data were collected. Body height was measured to the nearest 0.01 m with a portable stadiometer (Astra scale 27310, Gima, Italy). Body weight, body fat percentage and fat free mass were measured using a bioelectric body composition analyzer (Tanita TBF-300, increments 0.1%; Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). Then the subjects were randomly assigned to experimental warm-up treatments: no conditioning contraction protocol (NCC), dynamic stretching (DS), static squat (ST), and ST with an additional external load equal to 30% of bodyweight (ST + 30% BW). The randomization process continued until all the subjects had performed all the interventions.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>FIG. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JBS-32-1140427-g001"/></fig><p>All experimental protocols were preceded by a 5 min general warm-up (GW).

For the second 4 circles, 25 s per circle was required (speed: &#x02248; 12.4 km/h). 20 s per circle was encouraged in the last 4 circles (speed: &#x02248;15.5 km/h). A 10 min rest period was provided between the end of the running and testing session. NCC was executed without any additional contraction exercises after GW.</p><p>DS was executed 1 min after the GW protocol. The DS consisted of 7 exercises performed in 7 min.

The greatest gains in CMJ after DS can be attributed to higher body temperature that increased nerve conduction velocity, elevated muscle enzyme activity, and increased dilatation of blood vessels and blood flow to the activated muscles, which provided better muscle oxidation during work [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, DS has been suggested to elicit PAP by increasing the rate of cross-bridge formation [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which enabled greater muscle force and power production. On the other hand, previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] supported low CMJ output after NCC. When comparing CMJ in DS with the ST + 30% BW protocol, it can be observed that higher CMJ height was achieved after the DS protocol. The ST + 30% BW protocol may have produced a fatiguing effect that elicited no PAP or masked the potential PAP effect. This can be supported by non-significant CMJ results between DS and ST. In another light, Dunkan and Sapstead [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] implied a longer rest interval for loaded isometric contractions to exhibit PAP. The CMJ results of the current study are difficult to compare with other studies because of the difference in preconditioning contraction stimulus.</p><p>The comparative effects of different preconditioning protocols on sprint performance were similar to those obtained in jumping performance. The DS protocol showed superior effects on sprint performance compared to NCC and ST. This is to some extent in accordance with the results of Fletcher and Jones [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], who reported enhancement in sprint performance after dynamic stretching compared to static stretching. The DS protocol resulted in relatively greater enhancement of sprint time than the ST + 30% intervention, but the difference was not statistically significant. It is possible that the ST protocol with an additional load of 30% body weight produced better neuron-muscular stimulation than ST, which led to PAP after 3.5-4 min of preconditioning contraction. Another possible explanation is that PAP presented by ST only lasted for 2 min after warm-up cessation.</p><p>Preconditioning protocols for agility performance demonstrated significant differences between the NCC and other protocols. Although comparison of DS, ST and ST + 30% BW showed no significant difference in agility, it should be noted that DS produced the best results. This is probably due to the fact that a longer rest period enabled PAP. Existence of PAP after 4 min is in accordance with the results of Lowery et al. [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], who reported that vertical jump height and power increased and peaked after 4 min. In addition, Gouv&#x000ea;a et al. [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported in their meta-analysis that a rest interval of 8 to 12 min can produce a significantly greater PAP effect than shorter rest periods.</p><p>Intensity and rest interval are important factors in PAP. Lowery et al. [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggested that high-intensity workloads may prolong the duration of PAP. Other studies have reported a lower magnitude of PAP with decreased exercise intensity [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, intermittent protocols with a 30 s rest period may also facilitate PAP [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Comparing loaded and unloaded low-intensity intermittent isometric exercise suggests that ST produced lesser fatigue and its effects were observed after a shorter period of time compared to loaded ST. However, ST may have produced a lower magnitude of PAP after a longer period of time. On the other hand, loaded ST delivered higher PAP stimulation but needed a longer rest period to overcome fatigue.</p><p>The findings of the study failed to agree with the current literature involving various mechanical stimuli in PAP. Thus, there is a need for further studies incorporating prolonged intermittent low-intensity isometric exercises with different duration of muscular tension and different post-conditioning rest intervals. Other limitations included non-measurement of body temperature and quantification of muscle activity across interventions, which could help in explaining the underlying mechanisms of PAP and fatigue from experimental protocols. Also, performance tests were not administered in a randomized order, which failed to provide clearer information on how rest intervals affect performance. The hypothesis that low-intensity intermittent isometric exercise as a preconditioning stimulus can positively influence jump, sprint and agility performance was supported by the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Any previous muscle activity can trigger the mechanism of PAP [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although PAP was not directly measured in this study, we can assume that isometric contractions in warm-up most likely influenced PAP and physical performance. However, its magnitude proved to be dependent on isometric load and rest interval. The hypothesis that low-intensity intermittent isometric exercise as a preconditioning stimulus can positively influence jump, sprint and agility performance was confirmed. The present study showed that prolonged intermittent low-intensity isometric protocols improved performance similar to dynamic stretching. This implies that such protocols for the warm-up session can be used as an alternative to dynamic stretching.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the subjects for their kind cooperation during experimentation sessions.
