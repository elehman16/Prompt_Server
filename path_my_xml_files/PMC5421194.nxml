An alternative technique would be intramuscular placement of the pacemaker device, but there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support this approach, which is the rationale for the Placement Of Cardiac PacemaKEr Trial (POCKET).

A concealed allocation procedure is employed, using sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. Pocket site is blinded to the patient and in all subsequent care. The primary endpoint is patient overall satisfaction with the pocket location at 24 months as measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) 0-10. Secondary endpoints are: complications, patient-reported satisfaction at 1, 12, and 24 months (overall satisfaction, pain, discomfort, degree of unsightly appearance, movement problems, and sleep problems due to device).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>POCKET is a prospective interventional RCT designed to evaluate if intramuscular is superior to subcutaneous placement of a bradycardia pacemaker during a two-year follow-up.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="Key Words"><kwd>Arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>Complication</kwd><kwd>Pacemaker</kwd><kwd>Pocket</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Implantation of a cardiac pacemaker may be indicated in patients with a second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, significant sinus node dysfunction, tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, bundle branch block with syncope, and in certain disease states, according to current guidelines (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Annually, around 691 pacemakers per million inhabitants are implanted in Sweden (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the 16 Western European countries, there was a steady increase in implants from 2005, which plateaued in 2009 with 928 units implanted per million inhabitants. The rate of implanted units range from 607 per million in Ireland to 1291 per million in Germany, with an average of 938 throughout Western Europe in 2011 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>A bradycardia pacemaker system consists of one or two leads connected to a device that is implanted below the collarbone (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Vessel access is typically gained on the left side through the cephalic, axillary, or subclavian vein. The pacemaker device is typically inserted into a pocket just above the pectoral fascia (subcutaneously). In very thin patients with little subcutaneous fat, an intramuscular pocket between the pectoral muscular layers may be used. Even though technological advances have decreased the size of pacemakers markedly over time, complications due to superficial implants do still occur (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Occasionally, the device erodes through the skin, necessitating complete extraction of the system (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). More frequently, patients may complain about the device being too prominent, which sometimes requires surgical repositioning (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The device may create discomfort, pain, and an unsightly appearance (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The lateral corner of the device may impede shoulder movement or impair sleep; leads can become tangled or wound up within the pocket (Twiddler&#x02019;s syndrome). Minor branches of the supraclavicular nerves may become damaged, resulting in pain or discomfort. When vessels from the subcutaneous adipose tissue are displaced or distorted, extensive and painful hematomas may result. The development of a large hematoma is a known risk for infection (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In some cases, perfusion in the area of the operation may decrease and the amount of fat covering the device may be reduced to an unanticipated extent. The change-out of a device due to battery depletion can remove even more surrounding tissue. An alternative approach is an intramuscular placement of the device (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This has been advocated by Kistler et al based on personal experience, but there are neither systematic observational studies nor randomized controlled studies to support this approach (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has ever addressed the question about the optimal placement of a bradycardia pacemaker.</p><p>Therefore, this paper presents the rationale and design of POCKET (<bold>P</bold>lacement <bold>O</bold>f <bold>C</bold>ardiac Pacema<bold>KE</bold>r <bold>T</bold>rial), which aims to compare patient satisfaction with intramuscular versus subcutaneous placement of a pacemaker pocket.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>Consecutive patients with an indication for a bradycardia pacemaker have been included starting in October 2016 in Region G&#x000e4;vleborg, Sweden.

Four experienced operators, all cardiologists, enroll patients into the study and perform the implants.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion and exclusion</title><p>Patients, aged &#x02265;18 years, with an indication for a bradycardia pacemaker (DDDR or VVIR) are eligible for the study. Inclusion is restricted to <italic>de novo</italic> bradycardia pacemaker implants and excludes other devices (cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) or device revisions (pacemaker or other devices). Exclusion criteria are severe cognitive impairment, drug addiction, a postal address other than Region G&#x000e4;vleborg at time of implant or other reasons that would prevent patients from being able to participate in follow-up at the clinic. Patients with a malignancy in the last five years (except basal-cell carcinoma) may have impaired healing and shorter life expectancy and are thus excluded from the study. Finally, patients who are extremely thin and deemed to need an intramuscular implant can be excluded from the study by the operator before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethics and registration</title><p>The Regional Ethical Committee in Uppsala approved the study (protocol number 2016/371), which is conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In order to declare the study protocol, including variables and pre-specified research questions, the study was registered at Clinical Trial Registration NCT02931760 and approved 11<sup>th</sup> of October 2016.

The pacemaker systems available are either the Assurity&#x02122; pacemaker and Tenril&#x02122;/Tendril MRI&#x02122; leads (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) or Proponent EL MRI&#x02122; and Ingevity MRI&#x02122; leads (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization of the group allocation sequence was performed in permutated blocks with random block sizes, using stratification based on age (&#x02264;65 years and &#x0003e;65 years) and sex (female, male), creating four strata.

follow-up</title><p>Patients will be evaluated by a pacemaker nurse specialist at 1, 12, and 24 months. During these three clinical visits, a questionnaire will be distributed (see supplementary material available online at www.heart-int.com). The questionnaire asks patients to estimate their satisfaction with the device on a VAS scale (0-10) considering the following aspects: overall satisfaction, chronic pain, discomfort, degree of unsightly appearance, limited movement due to device, and sleep problems due to device. At 24 months, patients are asked to guess if the device was implanted in an intramuscular or subcutaneous pocket in order to validate the overall degree of patient blinding. The pacemaker nurse&#x02019;s evaluation of the unsightly appearance of the pocket (0-10, 10 worst) is blinded to the patient.</p><p>Certain complications might necessitate another surgery: pocket revision, lead dislodgment, hematoma requiring surgery, infection (local, systemic), pneumothorax, pericardial effusion requiring drainage, and other.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>The questionnaire</title><p>We developed a questionnaire to assess the patients&#x02019; pacemaker experience with a special emphasis on the pocket. The pacemaker-related questions were based on input from expert discussions with cardiologists and pacemaker-nurses experienced in the follow-up of pacemaker patients. The questionnaire was tested on lay people for language clarity and layout. It was decided to use a paper-version for the convenience of the patients evaluated. The questionnaire can be downloaded as supplementary material from www.heart-int.com.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is a common procedure and represents lifelong therapy. This implies that potentially chronic problems need to be considered in addition to procedural complications. The pacemaker device has undergone remarkable technological advancements and its weight and footprint have decreased drastically. Those relatively rare device recalls notwithstanding, most pacemakers provide reliable pacing support for a decade or more before the device needs to be replaced (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Since many pacemaker patients are geriatric with comorbid conditions at implant, they may die before the device requires replacement (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In those instances when long-term pacemaker failure occurs, it is often related to lead problems (typically involving either the wire or the insulation), and there can be tissue damage at the lead interface (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although national pacemaker registries report technical data about device system and complications, actual complication rates may be under-reported (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Complications necessitating surgical intervention can be perceived as problematic by the patient, although they can usually be handled without long-term effects. Clearly, device-pocket-related problems may be troublesome for longer periods of time, which may affect patients both physically and emotionally. While pacemakers are usually inserted subcutaneously, intramuscular placement may offer advantages. To handle confounding factors, the RCT is an ideal design to address the question as to whether one approach is superior to the other with respect to different outcome measurements, including possible predictors thereof (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Taking into account the potential global burden of &#x000ad;pacemaker-related problems, the surgical approach to the pacemaker pocket needs to be evaluated. A better understanding of the optimal approach (subcutaneous vs. intramuscular) and its relationship to outcomes may result in improved long-term satisfaction with pacemaker therapy and might reduce the need for pocket revisions.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>This prospective RCT will elucidate whether an intramuscular or subcutaneous pacemaker pocket is preferred by patients and how its appearance is visually judged by a healthcare provider. The sample size has the power to answer the research question about overall satisfaction over the course of a two-year follow-up period.
