These tools target indoor resting and biting vectors, and may select for vectors that bite and rest outdoors. Thus, to significantly impact this residual malaria transmission outdoors, tools targeting outdoor transmission are required. Repellents, used for personal protection, offer one solution. However, the effectiveness of this method hinges upon its community acceptability. This study assessed the feasibility of using repellents as a malaria prevention tool in Mbingu village, Ulanga, Southern Tanzania.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Change in knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in relation to repellent use was assessed before and after the implementation of a cluster randomized clinical trial on topical repellents in rural Tanzania where repellent and placebo lotion were provided free of charge to 940 households for a period of 14&#x000a0;months between July 2009 and August 2010. Compliance, defined as the number of evenings that participants applied the recommended dose of repellent every month during the study period, was assessed using questionnaires, administered monthly during follow up of participants in the clinical trial. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in the same community three years later to assess the community&#x02019;s KAP in relation to repellents and preference to different repellent formats.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, only 0.32% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) households in the intervention arm and no households in the control arm had ever used topical repellents. During follow-up surveys, significantly more households, 100% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;457) in intervention arm relative to the control, 84.03% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;379), (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001) perceived the repellent to be effective.</p><p>Post-study, 99.78% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;462) and 99.78% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;463), (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.999) in the intervention and control arms respectively, were willing to continue repellent use. Mosquito nuisance motivated repellent use. From the FGDs, it emerged that most respondents preferred bed nets to repellents because of their longevity and cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>High repellent acceptability indicates their feasibility for malaria control in this community. However, to improve the community&#x02019;s uptake of repellents for use complimentary to LLINs for early evening and outdoor protection from mosquito bites, longer lasting and cheap formats are required.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1475-2875-13-347) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Repellent</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Attitude</kwd><kwd>Perceptions</kwd><kwd>Practice</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have had a great impact on malaria morbidity and mortality in the past decade in sub-Saharan Africa
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While effective, these tools are intra-domiciliary and predominantly target indoor biting and resting vectors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This favours outdoor resting and biting vectors as IRS and LLINs are less effective against those vectors that exhibit exophily and exophagy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, as malaria moves from sustained control to elimination, new tools that tackle residual outdoor malaria transmission are needed.</p><p>Repellents used outdoors and in the early evenings and mornings, where IRS and LLINs cannot be employed, present one strategy that can be used to push towards the goal of eradication. Topical (skin applied) repellents have been used as a form of personal protection for hundreds of years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and have been shown to protect against malaria in South America (80% reduction)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Southern Asia (60% reduction)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and more recently in Ghana (34% reduction)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Ethiopia (19% reduction)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The major drawback to using topical repellents is compliance. Topical repellent use requires daily use and frequent re-application as their effects is usually short-lived over a few hours and therewith a change in daily routine (personal behaviour). While changing personal behaviour to use new interventions is not impossible as has been demonstrated in bed net campaigns
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], oral hygiene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and hand washing strategies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it is influenced by a number of other factors including: cost, perceived quality of the intervention, accessibility, information and ease of use. An intervention is likely to be used by the community if its affordable, perceived to be effective, the community is aware and has knowledge of its uses and finally, the intervention is simple to apply, i.e. it does not require considerable deviation from daily routine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore to influence behaviour change towards uptake of interventions: the community must be educated to improve information on the appropriate measures to employ to prevent disease e.g. use of bed nets to prevent mosquito bites and hence malaria infection. Secondly, the interventions must be made physically accessible to the community, such as considering the distance to shops where bed nets are sold or re-treated. Third, the cost of the intervention must be affordable and perceived as reasonable among community members to encourage use. Perception of the effectiveness of the intervention will also influence uptake, with the community more likely to use interventions they perceive as beneficial to them, for instance LLINs prevent mosquito bites. Lastly, is the ease of use of the intervention being implemented, as the community is more likely to use interventions that require the least deviation from daily routine, like use of drugs with simple dose regimens compared to those that have complicated regimens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, in an effort to determine the feasibility of using repellents as a mosquito control tool, this study assessed the knowledge/awareness, acceptability, perceptions on effectiveness and preference to different kinds of repellents in a rural community in Kilombero valley, Southwest of Tanzania. The community in this setting has experienced extensive malaria research projects and intervention programmes spanning two decades
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and was expected to be highly knowledgeable about malaria prevention and control. Cooking mainly takes place outdoors and in the early evening, a situation that exposes the community to nuisance mosquito bites and potential malaria transmission before they have employed bed nets. Further, like the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, the study area is experiencing rapid rural development, shifting the spaces and protocols of social behavior. Where once it was customary to retire shortly after sundown, now, owing to rural electrification programmes, residents usually gather in the early evening and stay late into the night at local bars and social centres springing up in the study area, thereby increasing perception of mosquito nuisance and malaria transmission potential at these times.</p><p>The dominant vector in this area is <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that has been shown to shift to early evening and outdoor biting when hosts are unavailable late in the night indoors as a result of high bed net use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The presence of rice fields in the study area, as the community&#x02019;s main occupation is farming, provides for a large breeding site of mosquitoes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The presence of this large breeding site is likely increase mosquito abundance in the study area, and with it potential malaria transmission and nuisance biting.</p><p>Before the start of the clinical trial, the community were sensitised to the potential for repellents as a malaria prevention tool through skits, community meetings and leaflets. Therefore, they are likely to understand the importance of topical repellents in prevention of early evening malaria transmission potentially occurring in the study area before they go to sleep under bed nets, and are therefore more likely to be receptive to this intervention. Secondly, the customary practice of cooking outdoors as well as presence of electricity exposes this community to nuisance biting in the evenings as a result of the extensive rice fields present in the area, a situation likely to encourage use of repellent. Finally, repellents were provided free so the community were likely to use them and form an opinion on their efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and population</title><p>This study was conducted in Mbingu village, Ulanga district, Tanzania, situated 55kms west of Ifakara town at 8.195&#x000b0;S and 36.259&#x000b0;E. There is malaria transmission all year round, with peak transmission occurring in the months of May and June after the long rains. The village experiences an annual rainfall of approximately 1,200-1,800&#x000a0;mm and an annual temperature range of between 20&#x000b0;C and 32.6&#x000b0;C. The village borders an extensive field cleared for irrigation, which provides an ideal breeding site for malaria vectors. The houses in the village are clustered in groups of 3&#x02013;5 households, which mainly belong to one family, but in a few instances the houses may be rented by different families. In July 2009 (at the inception of the clinical trial), the population of the study area was estimated to be 7, 609, with each household having approximately 5 members
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most houses are constructed from mud walls and thatched roof, with one&#x02012;third made from brick walls and corrugated iron roof.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outline of study</title><p>Between July 2009 and August 2010, a placebo-controlled cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted in the study village where 15% DEET (<italic>N, N-</italic>Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) topical repellent and an identical placebo lotion were randomly issued to 940 households in the study village
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The clinical trial participants were also issued with double size LLINs per sleeping space to ensure equity. Treatments were issued to two study arms of 10 clusters with 47 households each. One study arm was issued with topical repellent lotion while the other study arm received a placebo lotion and both arms were followed up for 14&#x000a0;months to assess the malaria incidence between these two groups. Concurrent with the clinical trial, a knowledge, attitude and practice survey (KAP) of the repellents issued during the clinical trial was conducted by administering a questionnaire (Additional file
<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Repellent KAP survey tool) at the baseline of the clinical trial (before/entry survey) to assess community knowledge of repellents; at the beginning of every month when field workers visited the households to replace repellents that had run out (follow-up survey) throughout the study period, to assess the acceptance and compliance of the community to the repellent issued and perceived effectiveness; and at the end of the clinical trial (after/exit survey) to assess willingness to continue use of repellents. A separate Focus Groups study was conducted three years later in June 2013.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Baseline survey</title><p>At baseline, written informed consent was sought from the household heads that were willing to participate in the clinical trial. The household heads gave consent for all household members who were below 18&#x000a0;years. Household members above 18&#x000a0;years were asked to sign their own written consent forms. As the household was analysed as a unit, a structured questionnaire of KAP in relation to repellents was administered to the household head. A unique ID was stapled on the door of each household that was recruited into the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up survey</title><p>To assess acceptability and use, at the beginning of every month after the baseline survey, field workers visited the households recruited in the study to replace the tubes of repellent issued the previous month. A KAP questionnaire was administered during these visits, where the households were asked if they liked the repellent issued and their perceptions on the effectiveness of the repellent. The fieldworkers also administered a compliance questionnaire, where household members were asked if any household member had skipped a day of repellent use in the past month and reasons for missing that day. However, if during the follow up survey there were no household members present to answer the questionnaire on compliance, and continued to be absent for seven consecutive days after the first visit to assess compliance, that household was considered non-compliant to repellent use for that month. If the households reported that any household member did not use the repellent, that household member was removed from follow up time for the period they did not use the repellent. Thus, if all household members reported using repellent each night in the past week and an adult member of the household was present to be issued with new repellent, that household was considered compliant for the previous month. In addition, the number of treatment tubes (repellent and placebo tubes) issued per month was recorded, to determine if there was a difference in the number of tubes issued in each month per treatment group. Differences between recalled and observed compliance were not measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Post-study survey</title><p>At the end of the clinical trial, (August 2010), an exit KAP (post-study) questionnaire to assess perceptions on effectiveness and willingness to pay if repellent was provided at cost was administered. In particular, the respondents were asked what was their perceived cost for the repellent issued during the clinical trial. The were also asked how much they were willing to pay for the tube of repellent they were given during the clinical trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Focus group discussions</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>In-depth discussions</title><p>Seeking an in-depth understanding of the knowledge, attitude, perceptions and practice in relation to repellents as a vector control intervention, a descriptive exploratory study, consisting of seven Focus-Group-Discussions (FGDs) and one Small Group Interview (SGI) was conducted in the study village from 10<sup>th</sup> &#x02013; 28<sup>th</sup> June 2013, three years after the clinical trial. The participants may or may not have participated in the initial clinical study of topical repellents, as prior participation in the previous trial was not an inclusion or exclusion criterion. Several different formats of repellents were provided to participants to measure perceived preferences in delivery formats of repellents among members of a community that had previous familiarity with repellents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sampling of FGD participants</title><p>This study initially used convenient sampling to enrol household heads in the village.

Interview schedules, including convenient interview times and venues were then negotiated between the study investigators and participants and the study commenced from the 10<sup>th</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> of June 2013. The interviews were all conducted in Swahili and lasted between 30mins and 1&#x000a0;hour in the various local settings preferred by the participants. Consent was sought to use a tape recording device for the sessions with all villagers agreeing to be tape recorded prior to commencement of the interviews. First, four FGDs with the four different respondent groups: households that had the males as household heads, households that had females as household heads (widows, divorced, separated etc.), households that had males as households heads but from which their female partners were invited for interviews, and households that had children of school going age (both primary and secondary schools), were conducted where community knowledge (familiarity) and use of repellents as a mosquito control tool was assessed. At the end of these first four FGDs, the respondent groups were issued with different formats of repellents to use for a week. After using the different repellent formats for one week, these respondents groups were recalled for a further three FGDs and a single SGI where experiences of repellent use and preference to different repellent formats were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data management</title><p>Data from the baseline, follow-up, and post-study surveys were linked using the household unique identifier.

<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two households reported burning mosquito coils, five households repelled mosquitoes with a smoky fire and one household reported using repellent plants (data not shown). Most households (95.7%) used bed nets as these had been delivered through various governmental and non-governmental schemes from 1997 onwards. When asked about malaria a similar proportion of the households in the intervention and control arms reported that malaria is a disease: 93.44% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;285) and 95.50% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;284), respectively. When asked about malaria transmission, most households in the intervention arm 99.01% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;302) and control arm 98.59% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;280) reported that mosquitoes transmit malaria. Bed nets were the major prevention tool used in the study village, with a similar proportion of reported bed net use in the intervention 95.14% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;294) and control arm 96.85% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;277). When households that reported bed net use, were further asked why the preferred bed nets to other tools, a significantly larger proportion cited effectiveness relative to other reasons: 56.31% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;174) and 54.03% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;154) in the intervention and control arm, respectively. Other reasons for use of bed nets as well as other mosquito bite protection methods are reported in Table&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. It should be noted that the bed nets reported by the respondents, were not those issued during the clinical trial, but they were reporting on tools they used before the onset of the clinical trial. However, bed nets were given at the start of the clinical trial to ensure equity between the study arms. An equal proportion of households in both the intervention 95.40% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;291) and control 95.40% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;270), arms reported that mosquitoes breed in standing water. The major barrier to repellent use in this community was lack of knowledge on how to use repellents, with 45.27% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;139) households in the intervention and 41.40% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;118), in the control arm reporting that they did not understand how topical repellents were used. Lack of awareness of repellents was also reported as a barrier to repellent use, with 35.50% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;109) and 40.35% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;115) of the households in the intervention and control arms respectively, indicating that they were not aware of repellents as a mosquito control tool. However, when repellents were made available knowledge was no longer a barrier to compliance. All households were willing to use repellents to prevent mosquito bites: 99.67% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;309) of the households in the intervention and 100% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;286), (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.336), in the control arm were willing to use repellents, even though this tool was novel in this community after community sensitization, (Figure&#x000a0;

Compliance in this context is defined as having recalled use of the repellent every night in the past month. However, if during the follow up survey there were no household members present to answer the questionnaire on compliance, and continued to be absent for seven consecutive days after the first visit to assess compliance, that household was considered non-compliant to repellent use for that month. If the households reported that any household member did not use the repellent, the household member was removed from follow up time for the period they did not use the repellent. Reported household compliance with repellent use was not significantly different between the study arms: 81.50% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;379) in the intervention and 78.13% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;361) in the control arm, (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.202) during the study period. Significantly more households liked using the repellent in the intervention arm 99.35% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;462) compared to the control arm, 84.41% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;390), (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001). When asked about effectiveness, significantly more households in the intervention arm, 100% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;465) compared to the control arm 84.03% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;379), (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001), perceived repellents to be effective (Table&#x000a0;

This indicates that relief from mosquito bites was a motivating factor in repellent compliance.</p><p>When the perceptions of effectiveness of repellents was analysed over the study period, it was observed that there was an increase in the number of households reporting the repellent to be effective over time. This trend was also observed for households that reported to like the repellents. Compliance was observed to increase over the study period, with more households reporting repellent use at the end of the study compared to the start of the study.

Travel also lead to non-compliance with 26% of households in the intervention arm and 37.83% of households in the control arm not complying for a month because they had gone to work in the fields.</p><p>When asked why they liked using the repellents, significantly more households in the intervention arm 98.69% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;455) relative to the control arm 45.56% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;208) cited effectiveness, (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001). It is worth noting that all households who mentioned nice smell and smooth feeling on the skin as reasons for using repellents were from the placebo arm of the trial. When asked if anyone in their household suffered from malaria during the trial, significantly more participants from the placebo arm answered yes: 32.9% versus 15.5%, (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p><p>Equal proportions of households were willing to continue using repellents after the clinical trial (Table&#x000a0;

These gaps in knowledge might suggest a bias during implementation of malaria control programmes, so that, rather than promoting community sensitization and education on the objectives of the intervention, the link between intervention and disease, and the benefits of the intervention to the individual and the community, these programmes likely focus more on coverage of the control tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Preference of malaria prevention tools used in the community</title><p>All respondents had used some form of personal protection against mosquito bites even for those who weren&#x02019;t quite sure what malaria was.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], knowledge and utilization of repellents as a malaria control tool is low in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of awareness of repellents as a malaria control tool is one of the major barriers to repellent use in sub-Saharan Africa. As observed from the baseline survey at the start of this study, most respondents had not used repellents before the implementation of the clinical trial. Therefore, use of topical repellents was completely new in this community as similar to several other studies conducted in the African continent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is evident that improving community knowledge and awareness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] as well as retooling interventions to community needs and preferences
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] will improve the acceptability and uptake of interventions being advocated. The most commonly used malaria control tool in the study area was bed net. Social marketing of LLINs started in Kilombero and Ulanga district in July 1997, under the KINET project. At the launch of this programme the community was educated on malaria transmission and control
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This campaign was followed by the launch of the Tanzania National Voucher System (TNVS), implemented by the National Insecticide Treated Nets programme (NATNET), under the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) of Tanzania, from 2004. In 2007, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), collaborating with other partners launched the under five Catch-up Campaign, parallel to the TNVS programme. In 2008, the MoHSW and partners launched the Universal Coverage Campaign (UCC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, if repellents and indeed any other novel tools are to be accepted and used to complement LLINs and IRS, there will be a need for social marketing, community education and sensitization to be employed for a substantial period of time. It is also essential to determine community preferences. Tools that require daily compliance are initially likely to have limited uptake, as the community has to remember to adhere to them on a daily basis. As observed from the FGDs study, ease of use was one of the reasons why the community preferred bed nets to repellents. This was because, once hung, the bed net was used over a long period of time as you simply pull it down when you get into bed, compared to having to remember to apply the repellent every evening. However, ease of use was not the only factor that effected compliance. In the follow-up surveys, it was observed that there was lower compliance in the control arm relative to the intervention arm. Likewise, in the after study, it was observed that more households in the intervention arm relative to the control arm used the repellent because it was effective. This finding demonstrates that compliance to interventions does not only depend on its availability and ease of use but also on its effectiveness.</p><p>In the FGDs it was also observed that even though sisal impregnated sisal strips did not require daily compliance and were easy to use, they were reported to be effective over very short distances, and this discouraged the community from using it.</p><p>These finding demonstrates that to impact compliance, the efficacy of the tools being recommended need to be established. A recent mathematical model demonstrated that the effectiveness of any repellent is extremely dependent on two factors: efficacy and compliance (Moore and Briet, in preparation). The most effective tools are those that have high efficacy and require little user compliance such as house screening
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The major reason for use of topical repellents by the community in Mbingu village is to prevent nuisance biting by mosquitoes. Although a proportion of the community could associate mosquito bites with malaria, the results of this study imply that they used repellents to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes rather than to avoid contracting malaria. These results were similar to a study carried out in a coastal community in Mexico, where 80% of the respondents said they allowed IRS in their households to reduce mosquito bites while only 2% said they allowed IRS to avoid contracting malaria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; and in rural Tanzania, where respondents reported that main reason for using LLINs was to prevent mosquito bites: 73% of the respondents reported they allowed IRS in their households to reduce mosquito bites and only 17% related protection from mosquito bites with reduction of malaria in the family
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These findings demonstrate that tools being advocated as interventions, especially in malaria control should address both short and long-term goals, i.e. address the problem of nuisance biting or mosquito densities (efficacious to enhance uptake) as well as reduce disease prevalence/incidence in the long run (resultant effectiveness). This is likely to encourage uptake and acceptability as opposed to tools whose benefits are realized in the long-term, and highlights the need to test new vector control interventions against nuisance biting insects as well as target vectors during development for a better understanding of how effective that tool will be in the real world for disease control purposes.</p><p>The major reason for not using repellents in this community was reported to be lack of knowledge of repellent use and is similar to findings in other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], where low repellents use was associated with poor knowledge of repellents. Availability of repellents in this community was another barrier to repellents use as observed from the baseline survey.</p><p>Also, in the FGDs, after the clinical trial, when asked why they did not use repellents, the respondents cited availability as a barrier, reporting that they did not know where to access repellents. Observations carried out by the study investigators during the clinical trail and FGDs, indicated that no topical repellents were available in the shops and drug stores the study area. Therefore, despite most households indicating willingness to continue repellent use, and even pay a small fee, access to repellent was a major barrier to repellent use.</p><p>Another barrier to the use repellents was cost
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. During the FGDs, even though all respondents were aware of repellents as a mosquito control tool, they all preferred using LLINs as they reported that repellents were more expensive in the long run because they had to be replaced every end of the month compared to LLINs, which could last up to five years before replacement, if well taken care of. This finding was consistent with outcomes from other KAP studies assessing uptake of interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As seen from the above studies, cost of mosquito control interventions greatly influences the acceptability and uptake in communities where they are to be employed. In rural and urban areas in Tanzania, a 150&#x000a0;ml bottle of 15% DEET repellent costs USD $1.00. On average, respondents were willing to pay $0.32 for a 150&#x000a0;ml tube of repellent that would last one adult less than one month. The current price of repellents is too expensive for the subsistence farmer, who lives on $1.50 USD per day. Therefore, even though incorporation of repellents into malaria control programmes on a community scale, is likely to use a cheaper but efficacious option of repellent, as was the case in Ghana
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it is unlikely that the repellents would be subsidized down to or lower than $0.32. Also, scale up and extensive use of repellents under programmatic conditions as well as emergence of a repellent market is bound to drive the cost of repellents down. However these cost are unlikely to be lower than the cost of delivering a single LLIN, which costs USD $5.30 and protects two people for up to 5&#x000a0;years ($0.50 per person per year)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore if we are to encourage up take of repellents as a malaria control tool, the cost needs to be greatly reduced, potentially through government and non-governmental organizations offering subsidies on repellents following the example of LLINs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The government may also encourage local production of repellents through tax exemption for local repellent manufacturers.</p><p>From the FGDs, it was observed that knowledge on malaria transmission and control was relatively superficial. While most respondents associated mosquitoes with malaria, when probed, few were able to detail processes of transmission, aetiology and prevention in any depth. Therefore, although all respondents from the FGDs reported that they used the repellents issued, it is likely that they did so with only a superficial understanding of the objectives of using repellents. This might have been because the community were more concerned with preventing mosquito bites than contracting malaria, as observed in other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As all respondents reported that they had complied with repellent issued it was not possible to assess the relationship between compliance and level of knowledge of malaria transmission. The superficial knowledge of malaria transmission observed in this community underscores the importance of incorporating community education and sensitization before implementation of any intervention to achieve its desired objective. Social marketing the product, and neglecting key messages regarding how these interventions benefit the communities in which they are being implemented, is likely to negatively effect uptake of that intervention. It is therefore essential for the community to be involved in designing and implementation of intervention programmes so that they have a better understanding of the objectives and use of tools being employed.</p><p>Several studies have shown that there has been better uptake of interventions in communities where awareness and sensitization have been conducted
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Promoting knowledge and awareness also deters any misconceptions that the community may have towards a particular intervention and it is essential for effective implementation of that intervention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. During FGDs for this study, some respondents reported that they had &#x02018;heard&#x02019; that LLINs caused infertility and also claimed that if/when they use repellents then their skin pores will be blocked and they will get sick. However in a KAP study in Rukungiri, Uganda, women who had previous knowledge of the use of ivermectin were more involved in making decisions of how ivermectin should be distributed to the community compared to those women who had no prior knowledge of this drug
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is therefore essential to acknowledge and address the community&#x02019;s misconceptions and misinformation about intended interventions in order to improve acceptability, uptake and effectiveness. Rather than the implementing organizations solely marketing the product to achieve extensive coverage, it is beneficial to also educate the community on the safe use of these interventions and the correlations between their products, the disease and its benefits.</p><p>The respondents&#x02019; preference of LLINs to repellents is attributable to cost effectiveness, convenience of use and availability. The major reason given for non-compliance to repellent use was that the respondents &#x02018;forgot&#x02019; to use it, while ease of use was ranked second among reasons why respondents preferred using bed nets. It was cumbersome to remember to re-apply the repellent after every few hours, unlike simply sleeping under a LLIN. Repellents should therefore be presented in a format that will encourage uptake. As the major occupation in the study area is subsistence farming, most community members bathe in the evening after coming from their farms. Repellents can be incorporated into body lotions so that they are applied after taking the evening bathe. Repellents can also be impregnated in clothing, especially in <italic>kangas</italic> used by women in the evening when cooking outdoors. Development of tools that do not require daily compliance such as long lasting spatial repellents that act over long distance should also be explored
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Respondents also preferred LLINs because it protected them when they were asleep and vulnerable to mosquito bites as opposed to when they were awake and could chase mosquitoes away. The community however preferred to use repellents in the early evenings when sitting outside their houses to have a chat with other family members and friends without being bothered by mosquito bites. This finding is important because it suggests that repellents can be used complimentary to LLINs in the early evening, before LLINs are employed, which was a major objective of this study.</p><p>Perceived irritating odour of DEET topical repellents reduced its use by the community in this study, a finding similar to studies in North Tanzania and Mexico where participants refused to use IRS because of the &#x02018;bad smell&#x02019; of insecticides used
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], emphasizing that interventions should be tailored to be perceived as pleasing by users. PMD was perceived as pleasant as found in several other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The most salient recommendation that came out of this study was that interventions advocated to the community should fit the community needs, such as providing repellents that have a pleasant smell and feels good when applied to the skin. Respondents that were issued with Permethrin impregnated <italic>kangas</italic>, reported that even though effective, it only protected a single individual at a time and suggested that all members in the household be issued with a treated <italic>kangas</italic>, and like LLINs, be issued with the &#x02018;chemicals&#x02019; (insecticides) used for re-treatments so that when the effect of the insecticide was diminished they could treat the clothing on their own. Insecticide Treated Clothing (ITC), has been successfully implemented in other settings
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and therefore this tool would easily be introduced in this community. Another outcome of this study was the effectiveness of the topical repellents that were issued. The respondents found topical repellents to be effective in protecting against early evening biting outdoors. This finding is similar to other studies, where repellents have been used to protect against vectors biting outdoors and by extension reduce the incidence of malaria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Therefore both topical repellents and ITC, if designed to meet the needs and preferences of the community, could offer potential interventions that could be introduced for malaria control and would be readily accepted by the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this setting, the major limitations to use of repellents, similar to those identified from other studies were lack of knowledge, availability of repellent, cost and need to remember to use it every evening or even more than once in a single evening. While the community was highly knowledgeable about malaria, their knowledge was found to be superficial, indicating poor community education and sensitization. Although currently LLINs are the most commonly used and preferred malaria prevention and control tool, their introduction to the community was initially marked by similar limitations emerging from this study such as the need to use it daily and the cost being prohibitive. When repellents were provided free of charge to all trial participants compliance was high. It is therefore likely that uptake will improve if accessibility of repellents is improved through lower costs and greater availability through the commercial sector, comprehensive social marketing and community sensitization on use of repellents, as well as delivery of repellents in formats that respond to community desires. Even though LLINs were the preferred mosquito protection tool, the community saw a benefit in the use of topical repellents in the early evening, especially to prevent mosquito nuisance indicating the potential of using repellents complimentary to LLINs. However, longer lasting repellents are an essential requirement to avoid the need for frequent reapplication that most people find off-putting. The difference in compliance reported during and after the study is likely due to recall bias at the end of the study. Other avenues such as long lasting spatial repellents might be used if they are effective enough to protect the peridomestic space occupied by the family and visitors in the evening.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Limitations to the study</title><p>A ranking of repellent preference had previously been reported in this study, but as there were too few repellents types/formats to issue to each FGD participant, these results were discarded along with some themes that had earlier been reported as they did not represent true results of community preference to different repellent formats.</p><p>As the participants were only issued with one repellent, it was not possible to explore whether the participants would use the repellents complimentary to each other if they had been issued with different formats of repellents. However, findings from the FGDs indicated the community members used the tools complimentarily.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that compliance, during the follow up and post-study surveys, was established by self-reporting of use by the study participants. It was not logistically possible to observe compliance of households to repellents use for each household every evening and therefore observed and reported compliance could not be compared, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec33"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12936_2014_3629_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
