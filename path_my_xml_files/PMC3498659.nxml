They provide a perilaryngeal seal with an inflatable cuff, and are an alternative to tracheal intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The i-gel airway is a novel and innovative supraglottic airway device made of a medical grade thermoplastic elastomer (styrene ethylene butadiene styrene (SEBS)), which is soft, gel-like and transparent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The latest advent of the i-gel airway are its pediatric versions, which are now available in four different sizes &#x02013; 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 &#x02013; on the basis of body weight.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] There are very few studies comparing the size 2 i-gel with ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) and classic laryngeal mask airway (cLMA) of the same size to assess their performance in anesthetised and artificially ventilated children.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the pediatric i-gel airway with the PLMA and cLMA for ease of insertion, oropharyngeal sealing pressure (OSP) and ease of gastric tube placement. We also compared the hemodynamic effects and postoperative complications, including blood staining, sore throat and hoarse cry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee, 90 patients were studied. A randomized prospective study was planned to compare size 2 i-gel (Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) with PLMA and cLMA of the same size.</p><p>The children included in the study were 1&#x02013;6 years of age, ASA physical status I&#x02013;II, weighing 10&#x02013;20 kg and posted for elective surgeries of less than 1 h duration in the supine position including lower abdominal (e.g., colostomy closure), inguinal (e.g., herniotomy, circumcision) and orthopedic procedures (e.g., upper and lower limb surgeries). The following were excluded from the study: (i) patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, (ii) those at risk of gastroesophageal regurgitation and (iii) those with airway-related conditions such a trismus, limited mouth opening, trauma or mass. Ninety patients were equally randomized to one of the three groups (i-gel, PLMA and cLMA) of 30 each for airway management using a computer-generated randomization program.</p><p>Written informed consent was taken from the parents prior to intervention and a standardized protocol for anesthesia was maintained for all cases. All the children were kept nil per mouth as per standard guidelines. They were premedicated with 0.3 mg/kg of midazolam syrup 1 h prior to induction of anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia included sevoflurane in oxygen with standard monitors placed. Anesthesia was maintained with 1&#x02013;2% sevoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen.</p><p>Once an adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved, the supraglottic device was inserted by the standard technique recommended by the manufacturer (introducer for PLMA, single-finger technique for cLMA). We considered easy up-and-down movement of the lower jaw, no reaction to pressure applied to both angles of the mandible and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (EtSev) of 2.5% to indicate the adequate depth of anesthesia for insertion of the device. The technique for placement of i-gel is reviewed on the Web site. Each device was inserted by an experienced anesthesiologist who had performed at least 50 size 2 cLMA or PLMA and 20 size 2 i-gel placements.</p><p>The ease of insertion was graded as very easy, easy or difficult by the attending anesthesiologist. The device was inserted with &#x0201c;sniffing&#x0201d; position. The following manoeuvres were included: (i) chin lift, (ii) jaw thrust, (iii) head extension and (iv) neck flexion. If the device could be inserted without any manipulation, it was graded as &#x0201c;very easy.&#x0201d; If there was only one manipulation required, it was called &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; and any difficulty more than that was graded as &#x0201c;difficult.&#x0201d; The number of attempts was noted, and it was considered a failure if the insertion was not successful in three attempts. The patient was then excluded from the study, and either a different size of the same device was inserted or the child was intubated with an endotracheal tube.</p><p>The device was fixed from maxilla to maxilla, and the cuff was inflated in the PLMA and cLMA groups using a cuff pressure monitor (Mallinckrodt Medical, Germany) to achieve a pressure of 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. This pressure was maintained throughout the surgery by continuous cuff pressure monitoring. A lubricated gastric tube was passed through the gastric channel in the i-gel and PLMA groups. The device was connected to a closed circle breathing system (Fabius<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> plus anesthesia work station, Draeger, Germany) and an effective airway was defined by a square wave capnograph trace, normal chest movements, stable oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) not less than 95% and bilateral auscultation of the chest.</p><p>At the end of the surgery, anesthetic agents were discontinued and the device was removed after the child was awake. Any blood staining of the device or tongue-lip-dental trauma was documented immediately in the post anaesthesia care unit and 24 h later. The parents were also asked about sore throat, hoarse cry or any other discomfort in the child's throat.</p><p>Monitoring devices (IntelliVue MP40&#x02122;; Phillips Medical System, Eindhoven, Netherlands) were attached to the patient, including pulse oxymeter and noninvasive blood pressure.

</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Sample size was based on a crossover pilot study of 10 patients and was selected to detect a projected difference of 30% between the groups for airway sealing pressure for a type 1 error 0.05 and a power of 0.8. The demographic data (age, weight and height) were analyzed by ANOVA. The OSP and hemodynamic data were also compared using ANOVA. The insertion characteristics and complications were analyzed with chi-square test. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the insertion attempts of gastric tube.

It has a channel for gastric catheter placement, except for size 1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The soft, noninflatable cuff fits snugly onto the perilaryngeal framework, mirroring the shape of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, piriform fossae, perithyroid, peri-cricoid, posterior cartilages and spaces. Thus, each structure receives an impression fit, supporting the seal by enveloping the laryngeal inlet. The seal created is sufficient for both spontaneously breathing as well as paralyzed patients. Studies in adults have been promising, showing an easy insertion, high airway leak pressures and low complication rates, with few postoperative complaints.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In this study, we found that insertion of the i-gel was successful on the first attempt in 28 of 30 patients and comparable to 26 of 30 in the PLMA group and 27 of 30 in the cLMA group. A global study involving 50 children undergoing ventilation using the i-gel pediatric device was carried out over 2 months. In that study, the success rate for inserting the device was 80% on the first attempt and 100% after two attempts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Other studies of using the pediatric i-gel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and LMAs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] have shown similar results. The ease of insertion was graded as easy or very easy in all the cases in the i-gel and the cLMA groups and 86.67% (four of 30) in the PLMA groups. This higher number of difficult insertions in the PLMA group may be explained by the relative anatomy of the pediatric orohypopharynx and the bowl of the PLMA. The larger bowl of PLMA is more difficult to insert in the mouth and is more likely to fold over. Particularly, a relatively large tongue, a floppy epiglottis, a cephalad and more anterior larynx and frequent presence of tonsillar hypertrophy may disturb PLMA insertion in pediatric patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] whereas the i-gel and cLMA are easier to insert because of a noninflatable cuff and smaller bowl, respectively.</p><p>Although the size 2 i-gel is supposed to allow a larger gastric tube (maximal 12 Fr) compared with the PLMA (10 Fr), we experienced difficulty in passing a 12 Fr tube through the gastric channel of the i-gel. The number of second attempts for passing the gastric tube (12 Fr) in the i-gel group was significantly higher compared with the PLMA group (10 Fr tube). As the diameter of the gastric channel is equal in both the i-gel and in the PLMA groups, of size 2,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] we believe that a 10 Fr gastric tube would be a better option for the size 2 i-gel.</p><p>Comparisons of pediatric PLMA with cLMA have shown very little differences in the OSP because of absence of dorsal cuff in PLMA. Shimbori <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] found an OSP of 18 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and 19 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with pediatric PLMA and cLMA, respectively, whereas Karippacheril <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] reported 23.11 and 23.26 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for these devices. Goldmann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] measured an OSP of 18.8&#x000b1;4.8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with size 2 PLMA and 15.0&#x000b1;4.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with the cLMA by detecting audible sounds at the mouth. Manometric stability method was used in both these studies. In our study, we observed an OSP of these three devices comparable to Goyal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] This observation is further substantiated by Beylacq <italic>et al</italic>. (25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and Bopp <italic>et al</italic>. (25.1&#x000b1;4.7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of complications (airway trauma and sore throat) was very low in all cases, except for blood staining in a few children in the PLMA and cLMA groups, which was neither clinically important nor statistically significant. Other studies have also reported a similar incidence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Although i-gel inserts less pressure on the perilaryngeal tissue because of its noninflatable cuff, the incidence of sore throat was comparable in all three groups. This observation of our study is supported by the study of Wong <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] where they stated that sore throat could be minimal even with supraglottic devices with inflatable cuff, if the intracuff pressure remains less than 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From our study, we conclude that size 2 i-gel is comparable to PLMA and cLMA of the same size in terms of hemodynamic parameters, ease of insertion and post-operative complications. OSP is the only parameter that is significantly higher in the i-gel group. Size 2 i-gel is equally safe, efficient and cost-effective in children compared with other prototypical pediatric supraglottic airway devices. It has an added advantage of gastric channel, which is found only in PLMA and LMA supreme&#x02122;. Therefore, i-gel should be more frequently used in children in both elective surgeries and in procedures requiring anesthesia outside the operating room.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Verghese</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brimacombe</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Survey of laryngeal mask airway usage in 11,910 patients: safety and efficacy for conventional and nonconventional usage</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1996</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>129</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8712387</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Levitan</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinkle</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Initial anatomic investigations of the I-gel airway: A novel supraglottic airway without inflatable cuff</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2005</year><volume>60</volume><fpage>1022</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16179048</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Userguides/i.gel_users_Guide_English.pdf [Internet]</article-title><year>2010</year><date-in-citation>cited 2012 Jan10</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
