We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT&#x0002b;EAP (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;58) and to EAP alone (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p&#x0003c;0.001, Effect size&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.69, 95&#x00025;CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.44, ES&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15, &#x02212;0.21 to 0.52, and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.50, ES&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02, &#x02212;0.34 to 0.39, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in longer terms. The study was funded by Sekisui Chemicals Co.

It is invariably associated with significant psychological suffering, functional impairment and decreased quality of life <xref rid="pone.0035330-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Rapaport1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Subthreshold depression is also a strong risk factor for major depression both in the short <xref rid="pone.0035330-Cuijpers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and long <xref rid="pone.0035330-Fergusson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> terms.</p><p>Given this high prevalence and significant morbidities, subthreshold depression represents a substantive burden on the society. Its sufferers also report more days absent from work (absenteeism) and less productivity while at work (presenteeism). Taken altogether, the cost of minor depression may be as high as 160 million US dollars per year per 1 million inhabitants, which is only marginally less than 192 million US dollars per year that is due to major depression <xref rid="pone.0035330-Cuijpers2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Of particular note is the fact that 98&#x00025; of this societal cost of subthreshold depression is estimated to be due to lost productivity.</p><p>Management of subthreshold depression is therefore a matter of clinical and society urgency. However, the effectiveness of the customary medical treatment for this condition, namely pharmacotherapy, has recently been called into serious question. A systematic review of drug treatments for minor depression identified six studies (468 patients) and concluded that there is unlikely to be a clinically important advantage for antidepressants over placebo in individuals with minor depression <xref rid="pone.0035330-Barbui1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. An individual patient data meta-analysis of antidepressant trials pooled six studies (five studies of major depression and one of minor depression; 718 patients) and found that patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score below 23 at baseline, either due to major depression or due to minor depression, are likely to show an effect size of only 0.2 or less on antidepressants in comparison with placebo <xref rid="pone.0035330-Fournier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A between-group effect size of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 are traditionally interpreted as representing small, moderate and large effect <xref rid="pone.0035330-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>It is well established that psychological interventions are effective in the treatment of major depressive disorders <xref rid="pone.0035330-Churchill1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A systematic review was recently published that focused on psychological treatments of subthreshold depression. It identified seven trials (700 subjects) and the pooled effect size at post-treatment was 0.42 (95&#x00025;CI: 0.23 to 0.60, p&#x0003c;0.01) <xref rid="pone.0035330-Cuijpers3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. All but one of these interventions utilized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or its variant and compared the intervention against the care as usual. It has recently been suggested, however, that the effect size of CBT may be overestimated due to poor methodologic quality of included trials <xref rid="pone.0035330-Cuijpers4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and to probable publication bias <xref rid="pone.0035330-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Effectiveness of CBT may also be less clear for milder depression, as patients with major depression with HAM-D scores less than 20 at baseline showed only a non-significant small effect size with wide confidence intervals (0.22, 95&#x00025;CI: &#x02212;0.05 to 0.49, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11) when four relevant trials (753 patients) that examined baseline severity as effect moderator were pooled <xref rid="pone.0035330-Driessen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Management of subthreshold depression is therefore in need of a greater number of high quality studies. The present study focused on subthreshold depression in the workplace, targeting both depression itself and associated decreased productivity, through the novel CBT method of delivery using the telephone. Remote CBT using telecommunication technology appears to be particularly suited to the problem of depression <xref rid="pone.0035330-Bee1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and presenteeism in the workplace <xref rid="pone.0035330-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, as it obviates the need to commute and enables wider access to quality-assured psychotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medicine, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00885014).

At the initial screening, the participants were asked to provide their written informed consent to fill in the screening questionnaire (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) and K6. Cf. below) and to answer the telephone interview when invited for the ultimate purpose of participating in the intervention study. Those scoring 9 or higher on K6 were then invited for the telephone interview by a trained interviewer using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, mood and substance sections, and also to fill in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Finally, those without current major depression, bipolar disorder or substance dependence, not receiving any current treatment for a mental health problem, and scoring 10 or higher on BDI-II were asked to provide their final informed consent to participate in the intervention study.</p><p>The participants providing their definitive consent were then randomized 1&#x02236;1 either to (1) telephone cognitive-behavior therapy (tCBT) or to (2) waiting list by an independent clinical research coordinator (CRC) at the central office. The random sequence was generated independently by a study statistician, stratified for depression severity at baseline (BDI-II score &#x02264;19 or &#x02265;20), presenteeism in the past month (HPQ item5 &#x02264;5 or &#x02265;6) and study site. The random sequence within each stratum was blocked with variable length, unknown to the CRC or to the study principal investigators. The random sequence was managed by a spreadsheet program which reveals the allocation only after a participant is registered by the CRC in order to guarantee allocation concealment.</p><p>Those allocated to the tCBT started the telephone sessions immediately, and were asked to fill in the end of treatment questionnaires (HPQ, K6, BDI-II and service satisfaction questionnaire) within one month after completion of the program. Those allocated to the waiting list had to wait for four months, fill in the end of treatment questionnaire and, if they still desired, could receive the tCBT sessions. Those who received these additional tCBT were asked to fill in the follow-up questionnaire after the end of their treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Working men and women with subthreshold depression were recruited at 13 factories and offices of a large manufacturing company (19,742 employees) in Japan.

In order to detect an effect size of 0.40 or greater at an alpha error rate of 0.05 and a beta error rate of 0.20, the estimated sample size was 98 participants per arm. With the anticipated dropout rate of 10&#x00025;, the necessary sample size was 108 participants per arm.</p><p>No interim analysis was pre-planned as this was a small study and we had anticipated no serious adverse event with our psychotherapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>The telephone CBT is a structured, manualized 8-session program adapted from a previously established manual <xref rid="pone.0035330-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Simon2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The program was piloted and rewritten extensively in order to fit the Japanese working population with subthreshold symptomatology.</p><p>The patient manual, to be shared both by the participant and the therapist, contains all the materials to be covered in each session, with ample space for the participant to write in his/her own examples. A separate therapist manual was prepared, which specifies the actual flow of each session, followed by the therapist's session checklist after each session and sample emails to be sent to the participant between sessions. The emails to be sent to the participant a few days before the next appointed telephone session was meant to serve both as a summary of the previous session, prompter for the agreed-upon homework and reminder of the next session. The therapist manual proved to be a valuable resource in the training of new therapists, with explanation of theoretical background of the tCBT program and pragmatic tips in the actual conduct of its sessions. The participant and the therapist also shared a booklet termed &#x0201c;Activity Pocketbook&#x0201d; which bound all the homework worksheets in a small notebook format that the participant could easily carry around with him/her and jot down his/her self-monitoring results, activity results and automatic thoughts on the go.</p><p>Each session was designed for completion in 30&#x02013;45 minutes but actual lengths varied according to participants' and therapists' assessment of need. Sessions were meant to occur at weekly intervals but the scheduling was flexible to accommodate the working population's work schedule, especially in the latter half of the program. Each session began with a brief structured assessment of depressive symptoms with K6, review of the previous session and the homework. The initial session included psychoeducation of the CBT model and provided the rationale of the whole program. Sessions 2&#x02013;4 focused on increasing pleasant activities through personal experiments <xref rid="pone.0035330-Lewinsohn1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Sessions 5&#x02013;7 focused on identifying, distancing from and challenging negative automatic thoughts <xref rid="pone.0035330-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In Session 8 the participant and the therapist together reviewed the cognitive and behavioral skills covered in the program and created a personal self-care plan for self-monitoring, identification and preparation for high risk situations, and self-management. All sessions included a motivational assessment of each participant's degree of interest and confidence in completing homework assignments in their daily lives.</p><p>Telephone counselors were master-level, doctor-level and postdoctoral clinical psychologists, social workers or nurses with at least 1 year of clinical experiences. We initially invited Dr Evette Ludman, who was one of the original developers of the tCBT program <xref rid="pone.0035330-Ludman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, for a two-day workshop, before we developed its Japanese version. After completion of the Japanese worksite version, we required that the telephone counselors receive at least 12 hours of didactic lecture followed by role plays, listen to at least 8 audiotaped sessions, have two clients' therapy (hence 16 sessions) supervised by TAF or MH before they could act as therapists in the current study.</p><p>In addition to the structured, manualized style of tCBT and the specific training as described above that the counselors had to complete, the quality of the administered CBT telephone sessions was assured by on-going supervision and consultation. All the therapists had to have at least 3 out of their 8 sessions per participant supervised on an on-going basis through auditotaped recordings throughout the study. The CRC was also to check client adherence and notify the therapist and his/her supervisor if (i) more than three weeks had elapsed between sessions or (ii) K6 was 10 or greater for any of the session #2 through #4 and 6 or greater for sessions #5 or afterwards. In addition, whenever any question or need arose, they were able to consult TAF or MH. The counselors' meeting to discuss the progress of each participant's treatment was held every two months.</p><p>Participants assigned to tCBT or to the waiting list condition were free to seek assistance through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which was run by a contracted private company, and which included stress diagnostics and reduction program on the web, telephone consultation, and email consultation. Furthermore, they were also free to seek professional help outside the company such as professional counselors and medical doctors.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Beck Depression Inventory-II</title><p>The Beck Depression Inventory, originally published in 1961 <xref rid="pone.0035330-Beck2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, has been the most widely used self-report measure of depression severity. With the advent of the DSM-IV, the time frame and question items have been updated as the 2nd edition of the BDI, and its reliability and validity have been confirmed <xref rid="pone.0035330-Beck3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The reliability and validity of the Japanese version have been found to be excellent <xref rid="pone.0035330-Hiroe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The cutoff of 9/10 was chosen rather arbitrarily in the present study because the normative cutoff for mild depression is 13/14 <xref rid="pone.0035330-Beck3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Hiroe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

In our study, all the participants had been fully employed and working and there was no room for improvement in terms of absenteeism.</p><p>The strengths of the current study include, first, its explicit screening for subthreshold depression. We have screened the potential participants with two screening questionnaires (K6 and BDI-II) to ascertain their depressive symptomatology and excluded diagnoses of major depression and bipolar disorder through structured interviews (CIDI). Secondly, the quality control of the treatments was rigorous. It followed highly manualized procedures, with a detailed textbook and a workbook to be shared by both the therapist and the participants. With the training and supervision provided for this study, the quality of the therapy was well controlled. Thirdly, the attrition from treatment (10.3&#x00025;) and missing follow-ups (5.1&#x00025;) was relatively low in comparison with the previous studies of subthreshold depression or remote CBT which typically ranged around 20&#x02013;30&#x00025;. Lastly, we employed the maximum likelihood mixed effects model and accounted for all the randomized individuals, thus adhering to the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p>There are, however, several weaknesses to this study. First and foremost, the control condition (waiting list with pre-existing EAP services of the company which, however, turned out to be little utilized) was weak. It can control for the regression towards the mean, the natural course and Hawthorne effect but not the placebo effect or the non-specific general psychotherapeutic effect. The present study has therefore established the value of adding tCBT to the usual care but not the specific effectiveness of cognitive or behavioral interventions delivered in tCBT. Secondly, due to the nature of the intervention in question, we were able to blind neither the participants nor the therapist to the allocated intervention. Moreover, all our primary outcomes (BDI-II and HPQ) depended on patients' self-report and may have led to overestimation of the treatment effect. Third, our study was relatively short term (up to 4 months) and, due to our study design using the wait list condition, was unable to examine the effect of tCBT in reducing depressive symptomatology in the long term or in preventing future major depressive episodes. The most up-to-date systematic review barely failed to find a statistically significant reduction in future depression through CBT with subtheshold depression (RR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.70, 0.47 to 1.03, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07). Such effectiveness of CBT is yet to be ascertained. Fourth, our failure to demonstrate statistically significant effect on presenteeism could be accounted for by our lack of statistical power (as the two studies which demonstrated statistically significant improvement enrolled two- to five-times more patients than ours), limited range of improvement possible among our participants (as ours were all fully employed and working), insensitivity of our outcome measure <xref rid="pone.0035330-Kessler5" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and/or true inefficacy of our tCBT in addressing presenteeism among working men and women.</p><p>In summary, remote CBT, including telephone CBT, may be able to provide easy access to quality-assured psychotherapy for people in the work force who may present with subdiagnostic psychological distress and cannot readily visit health care services on weekdays. From the viewpoint of service providers, it also means efficient use of the scarce resource, that is well trained CBT therapists, as the remote CBT enables delivery of their CBT from anywhere to anywhere. The average length of a session in our study (56.1 minutes) was somewhat longer than we had originally anticipated but are in line with some telephone-administered CBT programs <xref rid="pone.0035330-Mohr1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035330-Oslin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Its effect size was large and consistent with previous literature. Whether the effectiveness of remote CBT is durable beyond four months and/or it can reduce incidence of depression in the long term, and whether it can boost subdepressed workers' productivity by a small yet important amount are all important themes for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0035330.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
