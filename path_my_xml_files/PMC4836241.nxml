But it is still not clear whether Kuntai capsule has a good effect on alleviating peri-menopausal symptoms induced by gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Kuntai capsule, on peri-menopausal symptoms in endometriosis (EMS) patients, with postoperative GnRH-a treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Ninety EMS ovarian cyst women with postoperative GnRH-a administration were enrolled in the study, and were randomly divided into Kuntai group, Tibolone group, or blank Control group. The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid,po for 12 weeks after the first GnRH-a injection, while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd, po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group. There was no drug addition in Control group. Climacteric complaints were evaluated by Kupperman menopausal index (KMI) and hot flash/sweating score. Liver and renal functions, lipid profile, serum sex hormone levels and endometrial thickness were measured, and the frequency of adverse events in Kuntai and Tibolone groups was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>(1) Before GnRH-a therapy, the baseline parameter results were comparable in the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). (2) After GnRH-a therapy, KMI and hot flash/sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). At the 4<sup>th</sup> week after GnRH-a therapy, KMI and hot flash/sweating score results were as follows: Control group &#x0003e; Kuntai group &#x0003e; Tibolone group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); at the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week after GnRH-a therapy, KMI and hot flash/sweating score in Control group were significantly higher than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). (3) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). (4) The posttherapeutic serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E2) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). After therapy, serum E2 level in Tibolone group was obviously higher than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), while FSH and LH levels were obviously lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). (5) The incidence of vaginal bleeding, breast distending pain in Tibolne group was obviously higher than Kuntai group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0. 05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative GnRH-a administration to EMS patients, although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone.

The application of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) is very important for reducing EMS recurrence, and it has been most commonly used for the prevention of EMS recurrence.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the employment of GnRH-a could reduce the estrogen level, leading to some peri-menopausal symptoms such as hot flash, colpoxerosis, sexual hypoactivity, and bone loss, which hinders its long-term and extensive application.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] As peri-menopausal symptoms have a seriously negative impact on life quality, some of these patients try to avoid or discontinue such therapy.</p><p>Hormone based &#x0201c;add-back therapy,&#x0201d; was regarded as a good solution to the peri-menopausal symptoms. But long-term use of hormone might lead to liver damage, venous thrombosis, vascular diseases, and increase the risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer, and so on.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] As a result, seeking an effective and safe alternative drug for the add-back therapy has become a priority task, which should be immediately performed. Meanwhile, the interest in traditional Chinese herbal preparations such as Kuntai capsule is increasing.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Kuntai capsule is a kind of Chinese Traditional Medicine product, containing six kinds of Chinese medicine ingredients such as Radix Rehmanniae Preparata, Rhizoma Coptidis, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Donkey Hide Gelatin, Radix Scutellariae, Poria, with the effects of Ziyin/Nourishing Yin, reducing pathogenic fire, stabling mind, eliminating worries and regulating Yin and Yang, which could effectively relieve natural menopausal symptoms, and improve the life quality of peri-menopausal women.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Many studies showed that, Kuntai capsule could improve the peri-menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women, and had no apparent estrogenicity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] But it is still not clear whether Kuntai capsule has a similar effect with Tibolone on alleviating peri-menopausal symptoms induced by GnRH-a treatment, and what the safety profile of this capsule is, all these need to be confirmed by further studies. The aim of the present double-blind, randomized, blank- and Tibolone-controlled clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Kuntai capsule and Tibolone on peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative GnRH-a injection in EMS women, and to provide a new and safe alternative treatment option for &#x0201c;add-back therapy.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 90 EMS ovarian cyst women with GnRH-a treatment after laparoscopic operation were recruited for the study in the Department of Gynecology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and Jintan Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University (China) from April 2009 to December 2013. With the patients&#x02019; informed consents to the study, they were randomly assigned to the Kuntai, Tibolone or Control group.

A few cases scattered in three different groups showed slight skin rash, headache or other symptoms, which disappeared spontaneously during the therapy period, and was not considered to be treatment-related, these data did not enter the statistical analysis. The study revealed that 3 cases in Kuntai and 8 cases in Tibolone group appeared vaginal bleeding or spotting while 2 and 8 cases respectively breast distending pain.

In conclusion, the overall incidence of adverse reaction of group Kuntai (32.0% [8/25]) was significantly lower than that of group Tibolone (72.0% [18/25]) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (Note: Some patients had two or more kinds of adverse reactions).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The recurrence feature of EMS is quite prominent, and it has become a commonly used method for preventing the EMS recurrence to employ drugs to inhibit estrogen synthesis, which induces the ectopic endometrial atrophy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] GnRH-a could effectively inhibit pituitary gonadotropin secretion, leading to a significant decrease of ovarian hormone levels and the atrophy of ectopic endometrium, which might play an important role on the postoperative prevention of EMS recurrence.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, long-term use of GnRH-a can cause low estrogen related peri-menopausal symptoms, which is often the main reason for the patients to give up the GnRH-a treatment. Estrogen based &#x0201c;add-back therapy&#x0201d; combined with GnRH-a administration was proposed to maintain the EMS therapeutic effect after operation, improve the adherence and compliance to GnRH-a treatment, and prolong the treatment time by the scholars.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone preparation, the metabolic products of 3&#x003b1;-OH and 3&#x003b2;-OH derivatives, with estrogenic activity, can relieve hot flash, night sweat and other low estrogen related symptoms. Currently, Tibolone has been widely used in EMS add-back therapy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, as a kind of Chinese Traditional Medicine, the efficacy and safety of Kuntai capsule on peri-menopausal symptoms induced by GnRH-a therapy are not yet entirely clear, which need to be confirmed by the further studies. This study was designed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Kuntai capsule with Tibolone in therapy for peri-menopausal symptoms induced by the postoperative GnRH-a treatment in EMS patients. The results revealed that peri-menopausal symptoms appeared in the three groups of patients with GnRH-a injection. In the groups of Kuntai capsule or Tibolone, the total KMI and hot flash/sweating scores decreased gradually after therapy, while in Control group the total KMI and hot flash/sweating scores increased gradually. At the 4<sup>th</sup> week after GnRH-a injection, KMI and hot flash/sweating scores results were as follows: Control group &#x0003e; Kuntai group &#x0003e; Tibolone group; at the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week after GnRH-a injection, KMI and hot flash/sweating scores in control group were significantly higher than that of Kuntai and Tibolone groups, and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone groups. These results showed that both Kuntai capsule and Tibolone could effectively relieve peri-menopausal symptoms induced by the postoperative GnRH-a treatment in EMS patients. However, the clinical effect of Kuntai capsule might appear a little later than the conventional dose (daily 2.5 mg) of Tibolone, which might be connected with the relatively mild clinical efficacy characteristic of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The reasons and mechanism of this phenomenon need the further studies to clarify.</p><p>It was indicated that the effect of Kuntai capsule on peri-menopausal symptoms might be related to the estrogenic activity of the ingredients of Radix Rehmanniae Preparata and Radix Paeoniaealba.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Studies revealed that Kuntai capsule could increase the E2 level, and make the vaginal cell maturation index right-shifting.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The research of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] demonstrated that in climacteric rat models, Kuntai capsule could elevate ovarian volume, increase uterine wet weight, improve ovarian function, and nourish uterus, but did not cause local stimulatory effects on the endometrium. Chen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] employed Kuntai capsule on the menopausal transition and postmenopausal patients. The results showed that Kuntai capsule could alleviate climacteric symptoms effectively in these patients, and had more obvious efficacy on the patients in menopausal transition period, indicating that the treatment effects of Kuntai capsule on menopausal syndrome might be associated with the improvement of ovarian function, bringing the benefit of the absence of E2-like adverse reaction in Kuntai capsule. Cheng and Wang[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] had reported some molecular mechanisms about Kuntai capsule. They found that Kuntai capsule could increase the peripheral serum mRNA and protein expression of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; in peri-menopausal patients, and their research indicated that Kuntai capsule exerted its effects by several different routes, not only by regulating endocrine system.</p><p>In order to further explore the safety profile, this study compared the following factors&#x02019; variations before and after the treatment of Kuntai capsule or Tibolone, including liver and renal functions, lipid profile, serum sex hormone levels, and endometrial thickness. Compared with the pretherapeutic level, no statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions, and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment. However, the levels of E2, FSH, and LH as well as endometrial thickness decreased significantly after therapy, which was mainly due to the effective inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion by GnRH-a, reducing ovarian secretion of sex hormone drastically. By comparison with Tibolone group, the post-therapeutic E2 levels in Kuntai and Control groups were significantly lower, while FSH and LH levels were higher. These results revealed that, short-term use of Kuntai capsule or Tibolone had no obvious influence on patients&#x02019; liver and renal functions, as well as serum lipid metabolism, and Kuntai capsule had no obvious estrogenic effects. In terms of adverse reactions, certain superiority and advantages were reflected in Kuntai group. The incidence of vaginal bleeding or spotting, and breast distending pain in Kuntai group were significantly lower than that in Tibolone. The overall incidence of adverse reactions of Kuntai group was significantly lower, similar with some previous results.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In summary, the postoperative GnRH-a administration in EMS patients would lead to peri-menopausal symptoms related to estrogen deficiency, which could be effectively alleviated by Kuntai capsule and Tibolone. Although the clear clinical effect of Kuntai capsule might appear a little later than Tibolone tablet, maybe this indicates that Kuntai capsule should be administrated much earlier, even before the GnRH-a injection for EMS patients. Kuntai capsule had no obvious impact on patients&#x02019; liver and renal functions as well as blood lipid metabolism. It might be a safe and effective treatment option especially for the patients with hormone contraindications. Both Kuntai capsule and Tibolone could be successfully applied to the &#x0201c;add-back therapy&#x0201d; for GnRH-a injection in EMS patients, and Kuntai capsule might be a little safer as it had a lower incidence of adverse events.</p><p>However, this study was based on 75 subjects from two hospitals. The relatively small population size might have limited the statistical power of the detected associations. Future research involving more subjects from multi healthy centers should be performed, and more efforts should be put into the experimental research on molecular mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Li-Min Chen</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This work was supported
