Profound psychological trauma may occur due to a variety of factors like separation from parents, unaccustomed environment of the operating area, and insertion of an intravenous cannula prior to surgery, etc. which can result in negative behavioral changes in later life.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Oral midazolam is the pharmacological agent of choice as pediatric premedication. However, an increased incidence of adverse postoperative behavior changes,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] hiccups,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] paradoxical reactions,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and impaired post-operative cognitive function[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] observed with midazolam has resulted into the search for other ideal agents. Clonidine, although less popular, has been shown to produce preoperative sedation and anxiolysis, has analgesic properties, provide perioperative hemodynamic stability, and decreases narcotic and volatile anesthetic requirements.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, several studies on clonidine have revealed controversial results about its usefulness with some favoring its use[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] while others discouraging its usefulness.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we conducted a prospective, randomized observational trial to compare multiple characteristics of oral clonidine and oral midazolam premedication in terms of pre-anesthetic sedation, anxiolysis, palatability, parental separation, effect on hemodynamics, cooperation during venipuncture and face mask application, and postoperative analgesic requirement in children, which otherwise have not been all studied in a single study group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The Local Ethics Committee approved the study and written informed parental/guardian consent was obtained. Sixty children of American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I grade, aged 2-10 years, scheduled for herniotomy, appendectomy or urethroplasty were randomly allocated by a computer-generated list. They received either oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (Group M, <italic>n</italic> = 30) or oral clonidine 5 mcg/kg (Group C, <italic>n</italic> = 30) 60 min prior to anesthesia induction. A pharmacist diluted both drugs to a fixed volume of 5 ml with honey to make it palatable.</p><p>Patients aged less than 2 years or more than 10 year or with physical status ASA-II and above or undergoing emergency operations or with known sensitivity to drugs or gastrointestinal absorption disorders or patients with potential respiratory insufficiency were excluded from the study group.</p><p>The child's baseline behavior was noted during the pre-anesthetic visit as one of the following-calm, apprehensive, and crying or thrashing. Then, according to the group assigned, the child was given either oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) or oral clonidine (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) on the morning of operation. At the time of drug administration, the reaction of the child was evaluated as Drug palatability score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] with score 1, 2 as good, and 3 and 4 as poor scores. Pulse (P), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded every 10 min prior to starting drug administration till 60 min after extubation. The children were separated from their parents after 45-50 min of drug administration, and induced after 60 min of drug administration. Child's anxiety and sedation scores were evaluated before premedication, before and after separation from parents, at the time of induction, in the immediate postoperative period (at 2 hrs), and in the early postoperative period (at 4 hrs). Anxiolysis/apprehension was graded based on four point grading system: 1-no fear, 2-little/minimal expression of fear, 3-moderate/expresses fear/apprehension, and 4-excessive/vocal display of fear/apprehension. The grading of sedation was based on five point scoring system: 1-asleep/not readily arousable, 2-asleep/responds slowly to gentle stimulation, 3-drowsy/readily responds, 4-awake/calm and quiet, and 5-awake/active. In the operation theatre, intravenous cannula was placed over the dorsum of the hand of the child and the reaction of the child to venipuncture was noted as venipuncture score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. General anesthesia was administered in a standardized manner and surgery proceeded. Mask acceptance was assessed using a 4-point scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Vitals (P, SBP, DBP, and RR) were monitored throughout the surgery. Pain assessment was done using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) every 30 min during the first two postoperative hours and then every 2 hours up to 12 hours [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. In the present study, children with CHEOPS score more than seven received rescue paracetamol syrup 10-15 mg/kg. During the recovery period, the occurrence of any untoward effect like vomiting, shivering etc. was looked for. Parents were asked about the night sleep pattern on first postoperative day and based on its quality, night sleep was graded [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. And lastly, the parents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the whole perioperative experience on a scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Scoring of palatability, sedation, anxiety, venipuncture, and mask acceptance was assessed by a second consultant anesthetist who was blinded to the type of premedication.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of midazolam and clonidine (a) Drug palatability (b) Reaction at venipuncture (c) Application of face mask (d) Night sleep pattern (e) Parental satisfaction score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-221-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>CHEOPS scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-221-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (version 15.0; SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) software.

The studies was conducted in children older than two years as cardiac output in neonates depends upon heart rate and clonidine is known to cause bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The doses of midazolam and clonidine used in this study have been established as optimal pediatric pre-anesthetic sedation doses.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We chose to induce children 60 min after drug administration as is used by previous midazolam and clonidine comparative studies[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and to limit the time bias in between the two groups. In this study, the acceptability of oral clonidine was much better as compared to oral midazolam that had bitter taste despite mixing with honey. New commercially prepared oral midazolam formulations are more palatable[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that were, however, not available at our institution.</p><p>Midazolam premedication resulted in a better suppression of apprehension and sedation after separation from parents and at induction in contrast to clonidine. But clonidine resulted in a good level of sedation in the immediate postoperative period (Score 3) and early postoperative period (Score 4) in comparison to midazolam that had poor sedative potential (Score 5). This was in contrast to study results of Almenrader <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Tazeroualti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] where midazolam was less effective in producing sedation than clonidine. The sedative and anxiolytic effects of oral clonidine (4-5 mg/kg) have been found to produce similar degrees of sedation and anxiolysis as oral midazolam (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) in pediatric surgical patients by Lavrich <italic>et al</italic>., and Frank <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Midazolam has been shown to induce satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis within 20 min but clonidine has a prolonged onset time, which requires it to be administered at least 45 min before the induction.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Hence, midazolam provided a better level of anxiolysis and sedation preoperatively, whereas, clonidine provided a better level of anxiolysis and sedation postoperatively in our study.</p><p>Reaction at venipuncture and mask acceptance was better in midazolam group that correlates to the results of Fazi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] But are conflicting to Cao and Shi, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in which score of parental separation and face mask acceptance were significantly higher in clonidine group than midazolam group. In another study by Trevor <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] midazolam provided significantly superior anxiolysis at times of venipuncture and mask application but the overall degree of sedation was greater in the clonidine group children.</p><p>The mean CHEOPS score and the need for rescue analgesics were higher in the midazolam group compared to the clonidine group in our study. Hence, clonidine resulted in a much better level of analgesia compared to the midazolam group both in the immediate and early postoperative period. This was similar to the study results by Tazeroualti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Bergendahl <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] where clonidine decreased the postoperative pain scores. However, conflicting results were obtained regarding analgesic activity with some studies finding a reduction in pain score or analgesic requirements, some failing to find any such differences and some increasing postoperative demand for analgesia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In our study, parental satisfaction and night sleep pattern was much better in clonidine group in comparison to midazolam. Almenrader <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also found oral clonidine superior to oral midazolam in children undergoing minor general surgery in terms of better acceptance of oral clonidine, a trend towards better recovery from anesthesia, and a higher degree of parental satisfaction that was similar to the results of our study but in contrast to our study clonidine had more effective preoperative sedation.</p><p>Clonidine group had a more stable hemodynamic profile both during laryngoscopy, intubation, and during extubation. Our results are in consensus with Mikawa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] where clonidine attenuated the increases in BP and heart rate after tracheal intubation with no significant perioperative hypotension or bradycardia. However, Fazi <italic>et al</italic>., and Cao <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found no clinically significant episodes of bradycardia or hypotension in both the clonidine and midazolam groups.</p><p>Incidence of side effects in Group M were higher than Group C, which was, however, statistically insignificant. Although clonidine can induce hypotension and bradycardia in adults, no serious adverse effects, for example, pronounced hypotension and bradycardia, have been reported in children when using doses of clonidine of less than 10 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Limitation of this study was that pH-based potential alterations in the absorption of drugs by addition of honey and reduced bioavailability by inhibitory effect on organic anion transporting polypeptide activities were not addressed in the study.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Another limitation was the timing of the drug administration. As the timing of onset of drug action of both the drugs is different, we induced the children 60 min after the drugs were given to limit the time difference bias. Satisfactory sedation with oral clonidine can be achieved if it is administered at least 60 min prior to induction, while with midazolam it can be achieved within 30 min of administration.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is possible that we would have got a better result with clonidine had we waited a bit longer before induction as clonidine was not allowed to reach its peak effect. However, this would be a very long time and would be totally impractical in an outpatient setting. Also, in case of midazolam, we might have got better result postoperatively had we induced within 30-45 min of drug administration as 60 min is too long, and for some children, the effect will be wearing off. Another limitation of this study is the use of invalidated three- or four-point scales.</p><p>Hence, sedation and anxiolysis was better in the midazolam group preoperatively, but postoperatively clonidine was more efficacious than midazolam in this regard. The superiority of clonidine over midazolam in the postoperative period was also seen in meta-analysis by Dahmani.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Children in the midazolam group had a better intravenous cannula and facemask acceptance but higher postoperative pain scores based on the CHEOPS scale and larger postoperative requirement of rescue analgesics. Clonidine resulted in a much more stable perioperative hemodynamic profile than midazolam. Night sleep pattern was better and the percentage of parents who were extremely satisfied with the child's perioperative experience was higher in the clonidine group. Children in the midazolam group had minimal untoward effects (non significant). We didn&#x02019;t observe any noticeable side effect in the clonidine group.</p><p>In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam has better efficacy in the preoperative period apart for a few undesirable effects; whereas, oral clonidine provided good palatability, parental satisfaction, stable perioperative hemodynamics, better postoperative analgesia, night sleep pattern without any noticeable side effects. Hence, it can be a promising premedication in the pediatric age group.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
