Background</title><p>Pregnancy has a profound but reversible effect on the thyroid gland and its functions; it is actually a state of excessive thyroid stimulation leading to an increase in thyroid size by 10% in iodide sufficient areas and 20% - 40% in iodide deficient regions (<xref rid="A33477R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Furthermore the physiological and hormonal changes caused by pregnancy lead to an increase of up to 50% in thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and daily iodide requirement along with a decrease in thyrotropin (TSH) levels, especially in the first trimester (<xref rid="A33477R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In an iodide sufficient area these thyroid adaptations during pregnancy are well tolerated, since stored inner thyroid iodide is sufficient; however in iodide deficient areas these physiological adaptations lead to significant changes during pregnancy (<xref rid="A33477R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Thyroid dysfunction is the second most common endocrine disease in females of reproductive age (<xref rid="A33477R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="A33477R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); 2% - 3% of pregnant females are diagnosed with hypothyroidism (0.3% - 0.5% with overt hypothyroidism, 2% - 2.5% with subclinical hypothyroidism), and hyperthyroidism is also reported in 0.1% - 0.4% of pregnant females. Moreover, about 10% - 20% of all euthyroid pregnant females are positive for thyroid antibodies (<xref rid="A33477R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Although the complications of hypothyroidism or overt hyperthyroidism in pregnancy outcomes and neonatal and childhood development are well known (<xref rid="A33477R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="A33477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), there is still no consensus on the association between subclinical thyroid disorders or increasing thyroid antibodies and complications in pregnancy and childhood. Some studies show that subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity are associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes (<xref rid="A33477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="A33477R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and even reported that euthyroid females with abnormally increased serum thyroid antibodies levels are at increased risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy such as spontaneous abortion and premature labor (<xref rid="A33477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="A33477R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A33477R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), whereas others document contrary findings (<xref rid="A33477R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="A33477R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Given the lack of consensus on universal screening and the lack of evidence on the effect of treating subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid TPOAb positive pregnant females for improving pregnancy outcomes, there is still not lock of evidence or guidelines to treat these females; such recommendations need to be developed according to the results of well-designed randomized trials in areas under different statuses of iodine adequacy (<xref rid="A33477R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>To address this need, the present study was designed to determine the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and determine the effectiveness of levothyroxine treatment on pregnancy outcomes in females with subclinical thyroid dysfunctions and autoimmunity.</p><sec id="sec166466"><title>1.1. Type of Study</title><p>The current study consisted of two phases. The first phase of the study was a population based cross sectional study in which pregnant females, attending prenatal clinics (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences) were screened for thyroid dysfunction, by collecting medical history, clinical examination and measurement of serum concentrations of TPOAb, TSH, T4 (TT4) and RT3U; participants were grouped as: normal thyroid status, overt thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), TPOAb positive (euthyroid/subclinical hypothyroidism), and TPOAb negative subclinical hypothyroidism; all groups, except overt thyroid dysfunction, were monitored till delivery and any adverse outcomes of pregnancy were recorded. Those with overt hypo or hyperthyroidism or preexisting thyroid dysfunction were excluded from the present study and referred to endocrinologists.</p><p>Pregnant females with thyroid dysfunction were selected for the second phase of study, a randomized clinical trial, and randomly divided into two groups; the intervention group was treated with levothyroxine, while the other group received no treatment.

Sampling Framework</title><p>Using the cluster sampling method, 2,000 first trimester pregnant females were selected from the ones receiving prenatal care in centers under coverage of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, responsible for monitoring the health of over ten million people in Tehran province (over two thirds of Tehran&#x02019;s population), including northern, western and eastern Tehran and surrounding counties (<xref rid="A33477R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); it is documented that the socio-demographic characteristics of this population does not differ from the total population of Tehran, based on reports of the statistical center of Iran (<xref rid="A33477R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>A stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling method, with a probability in proportion to size procedure, was used. Otherwise, the subjects of the present study were recruited using cluster sampling method from 24 randomly selected prenatal clinics. To select these clinics authors initially divided them to four geographic subgroups, following which six clinics from each subgroup were randomly selected. Subsequently the proportion of samples required in each clinic was calculated based on the total number of pregnant females visited during the previous six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec166471"><title>3.1.3. Study Procedure</title><p>A training course was conducted for those midwives providing prenatal care in the selected centers to explain the objectives and protocol of the study; these trained personnel were in charge of conducting interviews and physical examinations. First trimester pregnant females referred to prenatal care centers were invited to participate in this study after being given a detailed explanation of the study procedure. Signed consent forms were obtained from all eligible females enrolling in the study. Pregnancy age was determined based on the date of the first day of last normal menstrual period; if this date could not be specified, it was determined by ultrasonography at the first prenatal visit. A fasting blood test was obtained and three urine bottles were given to each of the study participants to collect urine samples on three different days of the current week. The serum of the samples were separated by centrifugation and transferred to the laboratory of the research institute of endocrine sciences of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, according to the standard cold chain; serum concentration of TPOAb, TT4, T-uptake and TSH were then measured immediately and the thyroid status of each females was determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl42412">Table 2</xref>). Urinary iodine was measured in three urine samples to obtain the median.

TSH of their offspring was assessed at three to five days after delivery. All study participants received standard prenatal care and were monitored until delivery. All prenatal visits were recorded and each adverse pregnancy outcome was managed according to the standard guidelines. The study checklist was completed at each visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl42413">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec166480"><title>3.2.6. Outcomes</title><p>In the current study the primary outcome was preterm delivery and secondary outcomes included miscarriage, low birth weight, placenta abruption, and serum concentration of TSH of newborn (third to fifth day of birth).</p></sec><sec id="sec166481"><title>3.2.7. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Continuous variables were checked for normality using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test; categorical variables were expressed as percentages, and compared using Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test. Distribution of variables between the two groups was compared using t-test and expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the results was used. Logistic regression, liner regression and ANOVA (repeated measure) were used to compare the two groups and to determine the effect of levothyroxine treatment on the outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software version 18.</p></sec><sec id="sec166482"><title>3.2.8. Limitations of the Study</title><p>Limitations of the study included: 1) starting the prenatal visit at pregnancy age &#x0003e; 14 weeks; </p><p>2) loss to follow-up; 3) no consumption or lack of adherence to levothyroxine by pregnant females in intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="sec166483"><title>3.2.9. Timing</title><p>The study duration was scheduled three years.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec166486"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of thyroid disorders in pregnancy, there is no agreement on optimum approach to pregnant females with subclinical thyroid dysfunction and euthyroid TPOAb<sup>+</sup>. Various scientific societies, including the America thyroid association (ATA), European thyroid association (ETA), and the thyroid society report lack of sufficient evidence and clinical trials on effectiveness of levothyroxine treatments of such pregnant females in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes; they are mostly referred to a single clinical trial conducted by Negro et al. (<xref rid="A33477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) who found that TPOAb<sup>+</sup> pregnant females (euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism) are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage (P &#x0003c; 0.05; relative risk (RR) = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13 - 2.25) and preterm delivery ( P &#x0003c; 0.05; RR = 1.66; 95% CI :1.18 - 2.34). Treatment with levothyroxine had some beneficial effects on these adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref rid="A33477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="A33477R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Also, Lata et al. (<xref rid="A33477R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) reported that following LT4 treatment, there was no difference in prevalence of abortion between hypothyroid and euthyroid TPOAb<sup>+</sup> females, although LT4 treatment was not beneficial in euthyroid TPOAb<sup>+</sup> infertile females undergoing assisted reproduction technologies (<xref rid="A33477R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Generally, the data however was insufficient to recommend for or against routine levothyroxine therapy in thyroid antibody positive euthyroid females during pregnancy.</p><p>Several studies reported that the prevalence of various thyroid risk factors in different countries, depend on the life style and their Iodine status; as a result, clinical trials need to be conducted in various parts of the world among different races with different prevalence of thyroid disorders. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a population-based study conducted among pregnant Iranian females and identify the effectiveness of treatment with levothyroxine on pregnancy outcomes in females with subclinical thyroid dysfunctions and/or thyroid autoimmunity. The results of the study can be useful in decision-making and prioritizing the optimum management of thyroid disorders of pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge their
