Most pediatric dentists believe that pulpotomy is the treatment of choice for vital primary molars compared to the other vital pulp therapy techniques [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pulpotomy is a dental procedure that can be defined as the amputation and removing of coronal part of the pulp tissue followed by covering the radicular pulp tissue with a therapeutic material such as calcium hydroxide (CH), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement and zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This procedure has been advocated for primary molars as well as permanent teeth with open apices that have either carious or traumatic pulp exposures.</p><p>Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that MTA could be named as one of the most suitable materials for pulpotomy in primary molars because of high clinical and radiographic success rate compared to other pulpotomy agents [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CEM cement is a newly introduced biomaterial that has shown promising results and comparable clinical and radiographic success rate with MTA [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. </p><p>One of the important points in performing dental procedures for the children is the amount of pain they may suffer from that whenever the dental pulp has involved. A few investigations regarding prevalence of postoperative pain in pediatric dentistry have been published. The results of these studies have shown that both pulpotomy and stainless steel crown (SSC) placement procedures, are among the most prevalent dental procedures that may cause post-treatment pain in children [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. So far, all studies on vital pulp therapy in primary teeth evaluated the success rate of either the procedure or the capping materials [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, there is no clinical investigation on pediatric dentistry that assessed pain following use of various pulpotomy agents in primary molars. </p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare postoperative pain and number of analgesic consumption following use of two different pulpotomy agents namely MTA and CEM cement in primary carious molars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This split mouth randomized clinical trial study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences in Kerman, Iran (Grant No.: KA/91/267) the procedure was also registered online (Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ID: IRCT2013091914712N1). Considering <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=5% and power of 80%, the sample size of 46 patients was calculated.</p><p>A total of 47 patients aging between 6 to 10 years old from both genders who referred to the postgraduate clinic of the Pediatric Department of Kerman Dental School in Kerman, Iran from October 2012 to March 2013 could participate in this study.</p><p>The patients&#x02019; parents were comprehensively informed about the aim and method of the study and an informed consent has been obtained from all of them. </p><p>The inclusion criteria were: 6-10 year-old patients having bilateral primary molars with carious lesion with restorable crown, no tenderness to percussion and no pain except after eating, teeth without clinical and/or radiographic signs or symptoms of pulp degeneration, presence of sinus tract, no physiologic resorption (less than two-thirds of the root length were affected) and presence of active bleeding at the time of the access cavity preparation indicating a vital pulp [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on the Frankl Behaviour Rating Scale (FBRS) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], all participants were in grade 3 and 4. The common behavioral control methods such as tell-show-do (TSD) were used.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were any systemic diseases that should not receive vital pulp therapy such as leukemia and some types of malignancies, radiographic findings such as internal resorption, widening of periodontal ligament (PDL), furcation and apical radiolucency, and root canal calcifications [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Based on a random selection (by using table of random numbers) each tooth randomly received either one of the pulpotomy agents, MTA (Tooth-colored ProRoot Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK) or CEM cement (BioniqueDent, Tehran, Iran) in a split mouth design. </p><p>After application of local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with 1:80000 epinephrine (Darou Pakhsh, Tehran, Iran) and rubber dam isolation, pulpotomy was performed with a round bur (Tizkavan, Tehran, Iran) by a high-speed handpiece with copious water irrigation. Then the rest of coronal pulp was removed by a sharp excavator. After full pulpotomy the cavity was rinsed with 0.9% normal saline and hemostasis was tried to achieve by a wet cotton pellet [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If the hemostasis could not be achieved for each one of the treated teeth the patient was excluded from the study and pulpectomy was performed for the tooth. In the teeth with successful radicular pulp hemostasis, either MTA or CEM cement was randomly used as the pulpotomy agent for one tooth, while the other cariously involved primary molar was capped with the other material in a separate visit. After setting of the pulpotomy agent, restorative glass ionomer cement (GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was placed over the pulpotomy agent immediately followed by a final SSC restoration(3M ESPE, Norristown, PA, USA) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p><p>All dental procedures including anesthesia, pulpotomy and placement of the SSC were performed by a second year postgraduate pediatric dentistry student. Patients&#x02019; parents were asked to complete a Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale (Wong- Baker FPRS) questionnaire by asking their children&#x02019;s pain and rate their pain intensity up to 7 days after the treatment and bring that questionnaire back after seventh day. The Wong-Baker FPRS consists of a row of 6 numbered faces ranging from &#x0201c;no hurt&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;hurts worst&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical features of the patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="background-color:#8EAADB;" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

According to the mean age and weight of studied children, 325 mg analgesic tablets were preferred to syrup. Moreover, for better statistical analysis, tablets are more precisely evaluated than administrated syrup. The parents were supplied by 325 mg acetaminophen tablets (Daruo Pakhsh, Tehran, Iran) as an analgesic in case of pain and were asked to record the number of analgesic used on the patient&#x02019;s pain questionnaire. The maximum use of analgesic was a tablet every 6 h and the parents were given an emergency phone number if there was any need for consultation in case of severe pain. In order to achieve double blindness, each Wong-Baker FPR scale had a code number to show the pulpotomy agent used.

This was consistent with another study [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Regardless of the pulpotomy agent, the tissue ulceration which happens during the pulpotomy procedure, is the main cause of pain after pulpotomy.</p><p>The reason that MTA and CEM cement had been compared in the present study was the successful outcome of vital pulp therapy investigations that used these biomaterials in primary molars [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Asgary <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in an investigation compared CEM cement and MTA as pulpotomy agents in cariously exposed permanent teeth and reported no significant difference in patients&#x02019; pain following treatment. The results of the present study that used the same pulp capping agents provided the same findings for the primary molars. In the current study, the patients received pulpotomy followed by SSC. Each one of the procedures may result in pain following the treatment. However, according to the previous studies [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], placing SSC might be the major etiologic factor for the post-operative pain. </p><p>In the present study, the trend of pain showed that only during early post-treatment phase the patients experienced pain. </p><p>Therefore, it would be reasonable to give some information to the parents that their children received pulpotomy and SSC treatment regarding a possibility of pain until the third day after the treatment and prescribe on-demand mild analgesic.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Incidence of pain and use of analgesic in two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="iej-12-010-g003"/></fig><p>Fortunately, severe and moderate pain was reported only at the first and the second day following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The authors recommend whenever pulpotomy and SSC have been performed for a child the practitioners should instruct the parents to monitor their kid and use on-demand analgesics. </p><p>The present study was designed as split-mouth randomized clinical trial because each patient received both pulpotomy agents for different primary molars in need of vital pulp therapy. The advantage of split-mouth randomized clinical trial is the fact that each patient served as his/her own control and the results would be more reliable as individual differences had the least effect on the outcome of the study; however, a new investigation could not find significant differences in intervention effect between parallel-arm randomized clinical trials compared to those with split mouth design [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. </p><p>Nowadays acetaminophen is the most common analgesic used in pediatrics in the US. Acetaminophen is an effective safe analgesic for mild to moderate pain relief and for these reasons had been prescribed as the analgesic in the present study [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The importance of recording the number of analgesic used by the patient is understanding the severity of the patients&#x02019; pain [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Pain assessment following pulpotomy and SSC placement could be a limitation for our study. In future, it is suggested to accomplish these two treatments separately so that the precise evaluation of post-operative pain could be readily obtained after each step.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No significant difference was found in pain levels following pulpotomy with either of cements as pulp capping agents in carious primary molars.
