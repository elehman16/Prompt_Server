The presence of tremor suggests a more aggressive course of the disease. Treatment of tremor in MS patients is still very challenging to manage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The results of treatment with currently available medication in previous studies are often frustrating. Levetiracetam is a new antiepileptic and anticonvulsant drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The possible effect of Levetiracetam on MS patients is surveyed in a few previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] However, the efficacy of Levetiracetam in treatment of MS-related tremor still remains controversial.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: Prior use of Levetiracetam; past history of epilepsy; pregnancy or lactation; history of renal failure; any condition that would preclude safe and complete participation in the study; and lack of appropriate adherence to the study protocol. Definite MS for all of the participants was confirmed by two experienced neurologists. Furthermore, all of the patients were assessed for their EDSS and Tremor Rating Group Scale (TRGS) score before starting the intervention. Physical exam was done to prove existence of rubral tremor in participants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>Intervention was begun within 7 days of the screening visit. Eligible patients were given 500 mg Levetiracetam (Bakhtar Shimi Daroo Company Manufacture in Iran) twice a day for 1 week. The drug dosage increased 1000 mg per week until reaching the peak dose of 50 mg/kg. Then there was a 2 week period of washout (administration of Levetiracetam was discontinued for 2 weeks). After the washout period, first phase was repeated until reaching to peak point again (500 mg Levetiracetam twice a day for 1 week and increased 1000 mg per week until reaching the peak dose of 50 mg/kg).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment</title><p>To evaluate tremor rate, we used TRGS (Tremor Rating Group Scale) scale with the total score computed from 0 (no tremor) to 68 (severe tremor, unable to stand without assistance). To determine the disability, we used the EDSS (which ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe disability). We measured the TRGS four times: First, at the start point; second, 3 weeks after reaching to maximum dosage; third, after washout period and, forth, at the end of the study. We assessed participants at the same time of day to regulate food and medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 20.0 shicago) Descriptive analyses were adopted for demographic and clinical characteristics reporting the variables as means &#x000b1; 1SD. Kolmogrove-Smear Nov test were used for normality distribution variables (age, disease duration, EDSS). Differences among groups were assessed using repeated measures of ANOVA with the Tukey <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Pearson correlation was used for the relation between patients EDSS and tremor rate. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered the significance threshold.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study has been approved by the local ethic committee before initiation of the study.

It can be implied that the tremor rate have a declining tendency although it surged again after washout period. Tremor is one of the most challenging issues in MS patients; the treatment of which remains as a matter of debate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] There are a number of previous studies that evaluate efficacy of a range of drugs in treatment of MS related tremor, including primidone,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] gluthetimide,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] intrathecal baclofen,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and isoniazid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The role of Levetiracetam on post-ischemic Holmes&#x02019; tremor has been previously investigated;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] though, there is no convincing evidence on such effects of this drug. Levetiracetam is an antileptic drug which also attrected the attention in MS because of its possible anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In experimental studies, different properties of Levetiracetam have been shown.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Likewise, there is a crossover study on six patients by Solaro <italic>et al</italic>., which showed the effect of Levetiracetam on the modification of kinetic parameters in MS patients. However; it was without functional improvement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] There is also a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study which accomplished by Feys <italic>et al</italic>. in 14 patients with MS who received increasing dose of Levetiracetam. They evaluated the safety and efficacy of Levetiracetam and showed it is safe but ineffective for decreasing tremor severity in MS patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] This is opposite of our findings. It may be because of the difference in inclusion criteria and long term of intervention and washout period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, this study indicated the possible effect of Levetiracetam on treatment of MS related tremor. Our results suggest that Levetiracetam can be considered as an additional option for treatment MS- related tremor. Notably it is well tolerated by MS patients and has a few side effects. The elucidation of the results is limited by small sample size, gender and, short duration of drug intake. Further studies with larger sample size in both genders in long-term duration needed to confirm this preliminary results and the mechanism of Levetiracetam in treatment MS-related tremor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are thankful to patients who co-operate us in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gourraud</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Harbo</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Baranzini</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The genetics of multiple sclerosis: An up-to-date review</article-title><source>Immunol Rev</source><year>2012</year><volume>248</volume><fpage>87</fpage><lpage>103</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22725956</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Labiano-Fontcuberta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Benito-Leon</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>understanding tremor in multiple sclerosis: Prevalence, pathological anatomy, and pharmacological and surgical approaches to treatment</article-title><source>Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y)</source><year>2012</year><fpage>2012</fpage><comment>pii:109</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mbizvo</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hutton</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Marson</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy: An updated Cochrane Review</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2012</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>CD001901</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22972056</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Striano</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Coppola</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pezzella</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ciampa</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Specchio</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Ragona</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>An open-label trial of levetiracetam in severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy</article-title><source>Neurology</source><year>2007</year><volume>69</volume><fpage>250</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17636062</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Striano</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Coppola</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vacca</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Zara</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Brescia</surname><given-names>MV</given-names></name><name><surname>Orefice</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Levetiracetam for cerebellar tremor in multiple sclerosis: An open-label pilot tolerability and efficacy study</article-title><source>J Neurol</source><year>2006</year><volume>253</volume><fpage>762</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16683063</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Striano</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Elefante</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Coppola</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tortora</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Zara</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Minetti</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dramatic response to levetiracetam in post-ischaemic Holmes&#x02019;
