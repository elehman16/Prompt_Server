riding simulator (JOBA, Panasonic Inc. JP) static and dynamic balance of children with
cerebral palsy (CP). [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six children were randomly divided into
two groups: a hippotherapy group that included 13 children, and a horseback riding
simulator (JOBA, Panasonic Inc., Japan) group, which was also composed of 13 children. The
two groups participated in 1 hour of exercise per day, 3 times a week, for 12 weeks. The
subjects&#x02019; static balance ability was measured using BPM (software 5.3, SMS Healthcare
Inc., UK) as the center of pressure sway length while standing for 30 seconds with their
eyes open and looking to the front. Dynamic balance ability was measured using the PBS
(Pediatric Balance Scale). [Results] Both groups showed significant improvements in static
and dynamic balance but significant differences between the two groups were not found.
[Conclusion] The horseback riding simulator could be a useful alternative to hippotherapy
for the improvement of static and dynamic balance of children with CP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Hippotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disease with symptoms that include neurological
disorders or developmental disabilities. Children with CP have spasticity, musculoskeletal
problems, mobility disturbances, and decreased pelvic movements that lead to awkward
movement and sitting posture<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Symptoms also induce unstable posture control, imbalance,
and aberrant control of movement.</p><p>Postural control is the ability to control the body position in space, and it has a
relationship with the sense of balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Hippotherapy and horseback riding have been suggested as interventions for correcting the
balance problems of children with CP<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two
types of horseback riding are available: hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding
(THR). Hippotherapy provides better pelvic, hip, and trunk movement and influences
childrens&#x02019; posture, balance, and coordination<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hippotherapy has short-term beneficial effects on the muscle
symmetry of the trunk and hip, whereas THR has no effect on muscle tone<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of these two types of horseback riding have
been studied in children with CP, and both types have been demonstrated to improve gross
motor function and promote better standing and bipedal balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A horseback riding simulator (JOBA, Panasonic Inc., Japan) imitates the passive movement of
horseback riding. It was developed to overcome the primary limitations of hippotherapy, such
as unavailability and high cost. This device offers an indoor experience of horseback riding
and mimics the rhythmic movement of horseback riding, thereby promoting muscular strength
and improving sense of balance.</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare hippotherapy to the use of a horseback riding
simulator (JOBA, Panasonic Inc., Japan) with respect to their effects on the static and
dynamic balance of children with CP. Our results indicate that a horseback riding simulator
has beneficial effects as an intervention for children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 26 children with CP who were receiving physical therapy at the H
horseback riding center and the N horseback riding center in Kyung-Ki in Korea. The
selection criteria for the subjects were a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) grade less than +1.
Children who could perform more than 10&#x02005;m independent walking and were available for more
than 30&#x02005;min training per day were selected. The parents or guardians of all the participants

children, and a horseback riding simulator (JOBA, Panasonic Inc., Japan) group, which also
had 13 children. The two groups participated in 1 hour of exercise per day, 3 times a week,
for 12 weeks. The hippotherapy group carried out anterior-sitting, posterior-sitting, and
side-sitting exercises for 10&#x02005;min each while horseback riding at a walking pace (6&#x02005;km/h).
The course leader held the reins of the horse and two side-walkers held the child&#x02019;s legs to
assist the child in sitting in the saddle in order to prevent the child from falling and to
help the child to exercise during the horseback riding walk. The horseback riding simulator
group exercised with the same protective equipment and were assisted by the same leader and
side-walkers.</p><p>Both groups received 20&#x02005;min of conventional physical therapy before hippotherapy and
performed stretching on the horse or horseback riding simulator for 5&#x02005;min before and after
the exercise. Three physical therapists, who had more than 3&#x02005;years of experience in
pediatric physical therapy and had received education in the experimental method,
participated in this study.</p><p>The subjects&#x02019; static balance ability was measured using BPM (software 5.3, SMS Healthcare
Inc., UK) as the center of pressure sway length while standing for 30 seconds with the eyes
open and looking to the front. Dynamic balance ability was measured using the PBS (Pediatric
Balance Scale).</p><p>All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was
used for the statistical analysis. Statistically significant differences between the
measurements obtained before and after the intervention in each group were determined using
the independent t-test. Statistical significance was chosen as &#x003b1; =0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We evaluated the static and dynamic balance of 26 children with CP. The children were

that the hippotherapy group and the horseback riding simulator group showed significant
decreases in sway length of 85&#x02005;mm and 80&#x02005;mm, respectively (p&#x0003c;0.05). Both groups showed

three distinct sensory system inputs: visual, somatosensory, and vestibular<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, the dynamic sense of balance
depends primarily on vestibular input on unstable surfaces; however, static balance
primarily depends on somatosensory input. Many studies have investigated balance and
clinical tools for children with CP. A systematic review identified 22 tools that can assess
balance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hippotherapy and THR are types of exercises that affect balance, coordination, and posture,
contributing to the development of sensory and perceptual motor skills<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A horse&#x02019;s
rhythmic movement, velocity, and variations can facilitate righting and equilibrium actions.
During hippotherapy and THR, these facilitations improve muscular co-contraction and
postural balance resulting in improvements in the gross motor function of children with
CP<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies of hippotherapy and THR in children with CP have demonstrated they have
positive effects on postural control and balance. The horseback riding simulator has also
been reported to be beneficial for children with CP, improving their postural control and
global function, and providing enjoyment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Haehl et al. found no significant improvement of in hippotherapy
and THR but indicated that hippotherapy had positive effects on the postural control and
balance of children with CP<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other
studies confirmed that hippotherapy and THR are suitable interventions for children with
CP.</p><p>The horseback riding simulator used in the present study offers several advantages over
hippotherapy. The simulator is free from space limitations, has a low price, is easy to
handle, and is non-affected by weather conditions<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Use of the horseback riding simulator resulted in improved muscle
strength and contraction in elderly people<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study of children with CP reported that use of a
horseback riding simulator significantly improved their postural control and balance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our data indicate that both hippotherapy and use of the horseback riding simulator improved
the static and dynamic balance of children with CP. However, due to the fast learning
characteristics of children, the long-term 12-week exercise program might have been
responsible for the similar results seen in balance improvement. Many factors remain to be
considered regarding exercise for children with CP. Therefore, if other tools or exercises
were utilized, the results might not match the results presented here. Overall, our results
indicate that children with CP may respond equally well to the use of a horseback riding
simulator as they do to hippotherapy in terms of balance improvement.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the number of subjects was small, and second,
only static and dynamic balance were evaluated. In spite of these limitations, our results
show that the use of a horseback riding simulator can be a good intervention for children
with CP. Further studies incorporating larger sample sizes, various CP types, and full
utilization of the programs of the horseback riding simulator might be needed.</p><p>In conclusion, the horseback riding simulator could be a useful alternative to hippotherapy
for improving of static and dynamic balance of children with CP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>van der Heide</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Fock</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Otten</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Kinematic characteristics of postural control during
