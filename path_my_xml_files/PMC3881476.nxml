after neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) treatment. [Subjects] The subjects were 45
healthy young people, who were divided into two groups: a NJF group and a proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) group. The NJF group consisted of 21 subjects (11 males,
10 females), and the PNF group consisted of 24 subjects (11 males, 13 females). [Methods]
Participants in the NJF group received NJF treatment. We measured the maximal flexor
strength and the maximal extensor strength during isokinetic movement of the hip joint
before and after intervention in both groups. The angular velocities used were 60&#x000b0;/sec and
180&#x000b0;/sec. [Results] The NJF group showed significant increases in the maximal flexor
strength and the maximal extensor strength after the intervention at each angular
velocity. In the PNF group, the maximal flexor strength of 60&#x000b0;/sec and the maximal
extensor strength of 180&#x000b0;/sec were significant increases. [Conclusion] These results
suggest that there is an immediate effect of NJF intervention on hip muscle strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation</kwd><kwd>Hip muscle strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Strength training of the hip is often executed as a therapeutic exercise. Osteoarthritis
(OA) is one of the most common joint diseases in adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is a slowly evolving,

used for hip OA and after the total hip arthroplasty to improve patients&#x02019; gait
abilities.</p><p>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a technique which is used to improve the
lower-limb muscle strength and gait function. Neuromuscular Joint Facilitation (NJF) is used
to increase strength, flexibility, and ROM. NJF is a new therapeutic exercise based on
kinesiology. It integrates the facilitation element of proprioceptive neuromusclar
facilitation and the joint composition movement, aiming to improve the movement of the joint
through passive exercise, active exercise, and resistance exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study investigated the change in the hip muscle strength of younger persons

history questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed whether the subjects had a history of
cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, somatosensory, or neurological disorders. If so, they were
excluded from the study. All subjects gave their informed consent to participation in the
study. All experimental procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical
Review Committee of Jilin Dianli Hospital.</p><p>We measured the maximal flexor strength and the maximal extensor strength of isokinetic
movement of the hip joint. A Biodex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical System,
USA) was used for all the measurements. Each participant performed a 3-minute warm-up on a
cycle ergometer followed by stretching exercises for the lower limbs. Subjects lay supine on
the seat with the backrest at a 0-degree angle. Straps were placed over their shoulders and
across the waist to ensure the torso was stable. An adjustable lever arm was attached to the
subject&#x02019;s right leg with a padded cuff, just proximal to the knee joint. The axis of
rotation of the dynamometer arm was positioned just lateral to the femoral epicondyle, and
conventional concentric isokinetic tests were performed on the right lower extremity. During
the test, the subjects continuously pushed the lever arm of the isokinetic device up and
down, through the whole range of motion, between 0&#x000b0; and 100&#x000b0; (0&#x000b0;=straight leg). Each test
consisted of a continuous maximal flexion- extension, and was repeated three times. The
first was performed at 60&#x000b0;/sec, the second one was performed at 180&#x000b0;/sec. A 3-minute rest
was given between tests at each angular speed. To judge the immediate effect, the
measurements were performed before and after the intervention.</p><p>Four hip patterns of NJF were used. The patterns were: hip extension-abduction-internal
rotation, hip flexion-adduction-external rotation, hip extension-adduction-external
rotation, and hip flexion -abduction- internal rotation. Each pattern was performed three
times at random as a passive exercise and as a resistance exercise. In the NJF group
intervention, both proximal resistance and distal resistance were performed. In the PNF
group intervention, only distal resistance was performed. The intervention was performed by
the same physical therapist to avoid individual variations in treatment.</p><p>To determine whether there were differences between the NJF group and the PNF group, the
independent t-test was performed on subject characteristics and each measure before the
intervention. Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons (Bonferroni test) were used to test for
statistically significant differences, and the factors were intervention and group. If a
significant interaction was found, the paired t-test was performed to compare before and
after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of
statistical significant was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the NJF group and the PNF group subject

increased after the PNF and NJF treatments. The functions of the periarticular muscles of
the hip joint were improved by the distal resistance. The resistance, the traction and the
approximation of the facilitation elements were included in the distal resistance in both
groups; therefore, the maximal strength was increased by both the PNF and NJF treatments.
The alignment of the hip joint capsule, the functions of the periarticular muscle of the hip
joint, and the hip rotation function were improved; therefore, the maximal strengths
increased after the NJF treatment. An important difference between the intervention methods
was that, the rotation function of the caput femoris was emphasized in the NJF treatment. In
the NJF resistance exercise, the caput femoris rotation was drawn out using proximal
resistance on the great trochanter of the femur. The results suggest that caput femoris
rotation function can be improved by NJF treatment, and that improvement of caput femoris
rotation contributes to the increase in strength. Our study provides new evidence that NJF
treatment is a more effective exercise than PNF treatment the increasing hip strength. It
may serve as a new form of exercise for improving the function of the hip.</p><p>Future studies are needed to investigate the change in hip strength after a long period of
NJF treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Felson</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Factors associated with osteoarthritis of the hip in the
