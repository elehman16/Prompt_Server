Much research on cardiovascular disease has focused on men, as these diseases occur at younger ages and are more severe in males, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women are relatively understudied. Thyroid disease is predominantly a disease of women and is increasingly being recognised as an adverse cardiac risk factor. Levothyroxine is cheap (costs 5 pence/day), safe and commonly used generic drug (prescribed to 3% of the UK population). The appropriate use of levothyroxine in SCH patients with and without heart disease has the potential to optimise management of hypothyroidism to minimise vascular risk and to improve outcomes of AMI. The myocardium and vascular endothelial tissues have receptors for thyroid hormones and are sensitive to changes in circulating thyroid hormone concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even minor changes in thyroid hormone concentration may impact adversely on the cardiovascular system. Importantly, both mild hypothyroidism (SCH) and hyperthyroidism have been associated with a 20 to 80% increase in vascular morbidity and mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This has huge population significance as a vascular risk factor, since at least 10% of older women have SCH, but this is under-recognised, owing possibly to a lack of commercial exploitability. Small intervention trials of levothyroxine in SCH have shown improvement in left ventricular function, vascular endothelial function and atherogenic lipid particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SCH after an acute cardiac problem has been associated with an up to 3.6-fold increase in cardiac mortality and a 2.3-fold increase in overall death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Following experimental coronary artery ligation in an animal model of AMI, heart failure is associated with reduced thyroid hormone receptor expression in the myocardium, leading to tissue hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, thyroid hormone administration improves cardiac contractility, left ventricular (LV) function, and augments myocardial remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, thyroid hormone regulates angiogenesis, cardio-protection, cardiac metabolism, and myocyte regeneration at a molecular level, changes that can reverse left ventricular remodelling by favourably improving myocyte shape and geometry of LV cavity, thus improving recovery from AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of more than 3,000 participants aged 65&#x000a0;years or older without heart failure at baseline, who were followed up for 12&#x000a0;years in the Cardiovascular Health Study, showed that SCH participants who were treated with levothyroxine had a 72% reduction in heart failure events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Several other studies have shown similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, even mild hypothyroidism following AMI could be an important marker for poor outcome, and one that is ripe for cost-effective intervention if level 1 evidence of efficacy can be shown. In a recent preliminary analysis, we have shown that thrombus area, as measured by a model that simulates <italic>ex vivo</italic> coronary artery blood flow, is higher in people with SCH 7 to 10&#x000a0;days post non-ST elevation AMI despite dual anti-platelet therapy (with aspirin and clopidogrel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In multivariate analysis, serum TSH concentrations were directly associated with thrombus area, with a strength of association similar to other established cardiac risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether levothyroxine treatment in SCH patients after an AMI can improve ventricular function, improve endothelial function and improve blood coagulability and rheology. Therefore, this project aims to provide level 1 evidence to answer these important questions. This programme has two separate yet interlinked studies: ThyrAMI 1 - an observational longitudinal study to assess association of thyroid function at the time of AMI with cardiovascular outcomes, and ThyrAMI 2 - a randomised placebo-controlled interventional study of levothyroxine in SCH patients to evaluate effect on LV function and vascular health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ThyrAMI 1</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this trial is to assess what proportion of individuals with AMI have thyroid dysfunction and whether thyroid function at the time of AMI is related to adverse vascular outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is designed as a prospective longitudinal observational study of unselected patients with AMI who will be followed for 24&#x000a0;months (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) is considered the gold standard for evaluating cardiac volumes and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Gradient echo sequences provide a naturally high level of contrast between intracavitary blood and myocardium, thus allowing an accurate and reproducible determination of LV volumes, mass and calculation of stroke volume and ejection fraction. In this context, additional information can also be drawn from application of the more recent cardiac MR tagging analysis, which represents a noninvasive highly accurate method for direct quantification of regional systolic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Cardiac MR imaging will be performed in the dedicated 3&#x000a0;T MRI centre at Newcastle University.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Secondary outcome measures will include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Left ventricular systolic and end diastolic volumes and myocardial viability: Cardiac MR parameters of both global and segmental LV function measurements will be obtained as per standardised protocols already in place in the Newcastle MR centre using a steady state free precession or fast gradient echo technique.

Nonetheless, since LT4 is being compared to a placebo, additional information is being gathered on the safety and efficacy, and manufacture will involve de-blistering/over-encapsulation; the placebo will be treated as an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) for the purpose of this study, and will be labelled and handled accordingly.</p><p>The study drug will be sourced, assembled and packaged by Newcastle Specials (Pharmacy Production Unit) at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, MIA (IMP) 17136. The LT4 to be used in this study will be generic Levothyroxine 25 mcg and 50 mcg tablets (Amdipharm Mercury Ltd). This will be purchased in blister packs.</p><p>The double-blind will be achieved by de-blistering and over-encapsulation, using a capsule filler of Lactose BP. For doses that are multiples of 50 mcg, we will over-encapsulate Levothyroxine 50 mcg tablets; for the remaining 25 mcg, 75 mcg and 125 mcg dose increments, we will over-encapsulate Levothyroxine 25 mcg tablets. This ensures the capsule size is kept as small as possible for swallowing purposes (DB capsules Size A, colour: Swedish orange; manufacturer: Capsugel). Capsules will be re-packaged into an appropriate bottle container (polypropylene) and labelled.</p><p>As it is not feasible to predict in advance exactly how much IMP must be packaged per study dose, predictions will be based on known current doses as per routine clinical practice; production run(s) will generate surplus stock per IMP dose. The LT4 medication will have a shelf-life maximum of 24&#x000a0;months (less any reduction in expiry due to the shortest expiry date of blister packs purchased). The IMP should NOT be stored above 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and must be stored in the original container to protect it from light and moisture, as per the clinical trial label. A temperature log will be maintained as per local pharmacy procedures, and appropriate IMP storage will be guaranteed until the IMP arrives in patient possession.</p><p>The side effects of LT4 (25 mcg and 50 mcg) are well known and documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

To achieve the desired target TSH levels in the LT4-treated group (target TSH levels 0.4 to 2.5&#x000a0;mU/L), participants will have their TSH levels checked every 4&#x000a0;weeks and concomitant dose of their LT4 altered by 25 mcg daily, if required. The IMP will be provided as 5&#x000a0;week supplies of LT4 or matching placebo (dispensed separately at each visit), packaged into appropriate individual polypropylene bottles. The label on the bottle will not indicate details of the arm of the study to which the participant has been randomised. The label will instead contain a pack number, which will be the link to the relevant dose.</p><p>Study medication will be prescribed by the PI or co-investigator at each site using a trial-specific prescription (documenting the required IMP pack number), and dispensed according to local pharmacy practice.

At the final visit, participants on each arm of the study will stop their IMP and will be referred back to their GP to have their thyroid function checked in 6 to 12&#x000a0;weeks. The GP and the patient will be encouraged to discuss whether there is a need to commence LT4 therapy in these individuals based on the clinical situation. The GP letter (sent once the participant is randomised) and the GP follow-up letter (sent after each participant completes their IMP) outlines the suggestion to recheck TSH levels at 6to 12&#x000a0;weeks for each participant once they have completed their IMP.</p><p>At the end of each visit, participants will be asked to return any surplus study drug in the original packaging to the study team, who will verify and document compliance. All unused study medication and packaging will be sent to the local pharmacy for documentation and destruction as per local policy (following appropriate reconciliation by the Trial Manager).

Despite improvements in reperfusion therapy, the 2020 World Health Organisation projections view the high incidence of post-ischaemic heart failure as the most important cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Limitation of infarct size extent and recovery of dysfunctional contractile segments are the key elements for preventing post-ischaemic left ventricular remodelling. Therefore, despite research into new reperfusion strategies, a new perspective involves studying mechanisms by which myocytes can self-protect at times of stress, which can prevent irreversible cell death. In this regard, thyroid hormones are increasingly being recognised as significant players in the pathogenesis and the recovery and repair period of AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Even mild hypothyroidism, known as subclinical hypothyroidism, is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. The prevalence of SCH is higher than that of type 2 diabetes mellitus (5-10%) and is more common in women and the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Small intervention trials of levothyroxine in SCH have shown improvement in left ventricular function, vascular endothelial function and atherogenic lipid particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Cardiovascular Health Study showed that SCH participants who were treated with levothyroxine had a 72% reduction in heart failure events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, even mild hypothyroidism following AMI could be an important marker for poor outcome. No clinical trial has assessed outcomes of SCH in myocardial infarction and whether treating this state can improve outcomes by increasing left ventricular function, reducing thrombogenesis, improving endothelial function and quality of life. Therefore ThyrAMI 1 and ThyrAMI 2 will be the first trials investigating SCH in myocardial infarction to give a better insight into whether thyroid hormone levels are a key target for improving cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study received National Health Service (NHS) ethics approval on 28 May 2014 (NRES Committee North East - Sunderland), MHRA approval on 30 October 2014, and NHS Trust R&#x00026;D governance approvals are awaited. Recruitment will commence on 22 December 2014 and proceed until May 2016.
