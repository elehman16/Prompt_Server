Therefore, once the adequate recovery occurs, efforts focus on weaning the patient from the ventilator as rapid as possible. Using clinical judgment to identify the proper timing of weaning decision is not always succeeding. For the past three decades, use of one or more bedside weaning predictors is part of the standard care to decide if a patient is ready to breathe spontaneously as the first step to weaning.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Specifically, it has been considered unsafe to discontinue mechanical ventilation if the vital capacity or tidal volume (TV) is reduced, the negative inspiratory force is inadequate, or the respiratory rate (RR) is too rapid, or if a pattern of a fast and shallow breathing is present during a brief trial of spontaneous breathing. Although these weaning predictors have been extensively studied; their direct effects on outcome has never been studied.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Unfortunately, few predictors associated with clinically significant changes in the probability of weaning success or failure. From 1991 to 2009, respiratory shortening breathing index (RSBI) with a sensitivity of 95% was introduced as the best index and in 2009 Nemer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] report a new integrative weaning index (IWI) calculated as the product of static compliance (Cst), arterial oxygen saturation, and the f/TV (IWI = Cst &#x000d7; SaO<sub>2</sub> &#x000d7; RR/TV should be &#x0003e;25). The significant physiologic weaning parameters included in IWI may make it a better predictor than traditional ones.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a prospective randomized controlled observer-blinded study carried out on 120 adult patients of both sexes during the period from January 2014 to April 2015 after approval by the Hospital Ethical Committee.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients required mechanical ventilation for &#x02265; 24 h and considered ready for weaning.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Age &#x02264;18 years, inability to obtain informed consent, expected survival &#x0003c;48 h, intracranial hypertension, neuromuscular disease, pregnancy, hemodynamically unstable patients, or on high-dose vasopressor or inotropes.</p><p>Criteria of readiness for weaning included all the following: Reversal of the condition required ventilator support; oxygen saturation of &#x0003e;90% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003c;50%, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FIO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;200, carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003c;45 mmHg, PH &#x02265;7.3 using (AVL-988), RR &#x0003c;30 br/min, TV &#x0003e;5 ml/kg, minute ventilation &#x0003c; 15 L/min and RR/TV &#x0003c;105 br/min/L with a positive end-expiratory pressure level &#x0003c;8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (Ventilation was performed with [&#x0201c;inspiration&#x0201d; LS Ventilator series e-Vent]), stable neurological status (awake and responsive), require bronchial toilet less than twice in the 8 h preceding the assessment, no need for vasoactive drugs; receiving only minimal or no sedation, serum electrolyte within normal, body temperature between 36&#x000b0;C and 38&#x000b0;C and hemoglobin &#x0003e;7 g/dl.</p><p>The following parameters were recorded before performing the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

Another goal of the proper timing of weaning is the avoidance of premature weaning, which expose patient to severe respiratory, cardiovascular, and psychological stress. The clinical decision is not enough to predict weaning outcome accurately as judgment may be incomplete and require more accurate predictors for successful weaning, in addition to clinical signs.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>More than 50 different weaning predictors have been studied.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These studies have been observational, with predictors measured and then correlated with weaning outcome.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The major findings of the current study are that the use of the IWI shortens the total duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay, weaning success rate was significantly higher in the Group I as compared with controlled Group C while weaning failure rate was significantly lower in the Group I as compared with Group C, and failure of SBT and failure of extubation were lower in Group I as compared to Group C.</p><p>Furthermore, when IWI measured in a retrospective manner in control group, we found 32 patients of total 34 with succeeded weaning had IWI &#x0003e; 25.

In the study of Esteban <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] on use of weaning predictors, it was concluded that among indexes that had been introduced, IWI was the best index for predicting weaning with a sensitivity of 0.97.</p><p>In the study of Nemer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] on use of IWI as a predictor of weaning, 18% of patients who tolerated the SBT were re-intubated. IWI predicted extubation failure in nine out of 10 patients who presented unsuccessful extubation. IWI presented the highest probability of weaning success when the test was positive (0.99) and the lowest probability of weaning success when the test was negative (0.14). According to our results, IWI had higher sensitivity, specificity, positive and NPVs, positive and negative likelihood ratios and accuracy.</p><p>Madani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] assessed validity of IWI for discontinuation from mechanical ventilation in Iranian ICUs, it was studied in six ICU patients with different characteristics, and sensitivity of 94.59, Specificity equal to 66.67, PPV of 97.22, NPV equal to 50, positive likelihood ratio of 2.84, negative likelihood ratio equal to 0.08 and accuracy of 92.5 were obtained; and could prove persistence of successful weaning in a 48-h period with an accuracy above 90%.</p><p>In our study, IWI had better predictive value for weaning patients from mechanical ventilation and by using IWI, intubation, and its complications can be reduced. One limitation of our study is the difficulty in measuring Cst of the respiratory system in the spontaneously breathing patient. Although Cst, rs can be measured during discontinuation from mechanical ventilation,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] it is not an easy to be performed during the weaning process, because the patient's inspiratory effort during the assisted breath could interfere with the inspiratory plateau pressure measurement. In our study, we minimized this limitation by observing the digital display of the pressure-time inspiratory plateau curve thus avoiding respiratory cycles that revealed clear inspiratory efforts of the patients. In our study, the IWI was measured with a fixed FiO<sub>2</sub> of 40% to avoid variations in SaO<sub>2</sub> due to FiO<sub>2</sub> variations. Further studies must be performed to test the IWI accuracy in a wide range of FiO<sub>2</sub> values. Another limitation of this study is combined SBT failure and extubation failure, an approach to be discouraged because the latter often results from distinct causes related to the capacity to protect the airway as stridor or upper airway edema not responding to medical treatment or weak cough reflex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms the usefulness of IWI during the weaning process, being effective in predicting both successful and failed weaning outcome.
