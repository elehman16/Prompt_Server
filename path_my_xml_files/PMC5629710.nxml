There is a pressing need to identify effective interventions to treat established obesity that can be delivered at scale. The aim of the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to a Low-Energy Treatment (DROPLET) study is to determine the clinical effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of referral to a low-energy total diet replacement programme compared with usual weight management interventions in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The DROPLET trial is a randomised controlled trial comparing a low-energy total diet replacement programme with usual weight management interventions delivered in primary care. Eligible patients will be recruited through primary care registers and randomised to receive a behavioural support programme delivered by their practice nurse or a referral to a commercial provider offering an initial 810 kcal/d low-energy total diet replacement programme for 8 weeks, followed by gradual food reintroduction, along with weekly behavioural support for 24 weeks. The primary outcome is weight change at 12 months. The secondary outcomes are weight change at 3 and 6 months, the proportion of participants achieving 5% and 10%&#x02009;weight loss at 12 months, and change in fat mass, haemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months. Data will be analysed on the basis of intention to treat. Qualitative interviews on a subsample of patients and healthcare providers will assess their experiences of the weight loss programmes and identify factors affecting acceptability and adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the National Health ServiceHealth Research Authority (HRA)Research Ethics Committee (Ref: SC/15/0337). The trial findings will be disseminated to academic and health professionals through presentations at meetings and peer-reviewed journals and to the public through the media. If the intervention is effective, the results will be communicated to policymakers and commissioners of weight management services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN75092026.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>weight loss</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cambridge Weight Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study is the largest randomised controlled trial to date of a low-energy total diet replacement programme for weight management in routine primary care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This intervention is based on a model of care where general&#x000a0;practitioners refer patients to a programme delivered in the community by a commercial provider using non-National Health Service staff, which, if successful, could be readily adopted into practice without the need for specialist training for the primary care workforce.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The primary outcome is weight at&#x000a0;1&#x02009;year. Although this is 9 months after the low-energy total diet replacement, epidemiological evidence suggests that any weight lost will continue to be regained beyond 1&#x02009;year.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intention of obesity treatment programmes is to improve long-term health, but this study does not include morbidity or mortality outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Longer term follow-up data would be helpful to better estimate the longer health impact and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of&#x000a0;obesity worldwide has more than doubled since 1980.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the latest estimates from the WHO, more than 1.9&#x02009;billion adults were overweight, of whom 600&#x02009;million were obese, representing 39% and 13% of the world's adult population, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Obesity is associated with premature mortality,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but also substantial morbidity, including significantly increased risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and most non-smoking-related cancers, as well as physical impairments linked to excess weight such as breathlessness, joint problems and back pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Collectively this creates a burden of ill-health and reduced quality of life for individuals, additional treatment costs to the National Health Service (NHS) and reductions in economic productivity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> While high priority must be given to prevent future cases of obesity, in the short term, there is a pressing need to identify effective interventions to treat established obesity. Research has shown that even modest reductions in weight can bring significantly reduced risks of disease. For example, in the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), individuals randomised to an intensive lifestyle intervention lost 7&#x02009;kg by the end of the first year. Although some of this weight was regained, the intensive lifestyle group remained 4&#x02009;kg lighter than the usual care group at 4&#x02009;years, and this reduced the incidence of diabetes by 58% relative to usual care,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> with benefits persisting to at least 15-year follow-up despite weight regain.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Primary care is an important setting for weight management interventions to reduce multimorbidity. However, although a number of interventions have been shown to be effective in intensive research studies, this success has not always been replicated in routine settings. For example, there was no significant reduction in weight when a weight loss programme adapted from the DPP was delivered by primary care teams.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our recent review of interventions suitable for use in routine care<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and a second review, using slightly different inclusion criteria, of interventions specifically delivered in primary care<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> both concluded that behavioural weight management interventions led by primary care practitioners were ineffective. This may relate in part to the complexity of advice needed for successful dietary change and the need for frequent contact to provide support, which exceeds the capacity of routine primary care systems. However, although a number of interventions have been shown to be effective in intensive research studies, this success has not always been replicated in routine settings. General practitioner (GP) referral to a commercial provider offering group-based support is an effective option for weight management in primary care, and our meta-analysis showed a mean reduction in weight of 2.3&#x02009;kg over no intervention at 1&#x02009;year.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, greater weight losses would be expected to bring greater health gains.</p><p>Very low-energy diets (VLEDs) have been used for weight loss over many years in specialist settings. A VLED is defined as a diet providing&#x000a0;&#x02264;800&#x02009;kcal a day, based on the use of specially formulated products designed as the sole source of nutrition during periods of total diet replacement. When used as directed, these formula products meet 100% of the dietary reference values for vitamins, minerals and trace elements for healthy, weight-stable people and are enriched with high biological-value protein. Although most contain some dietary fibre, a fibre supplement may also be recommended. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the available randomised controlled trials showed that behavioural weight management interventions incorporating a VLED led to 3.9&#x02009;kg greater weight loss at 1&#x02009;year compared with intensive specialist-delivered behavioural programmes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, most of the trials included in this review were small, typically including only 50&#x02013;100 participants who were treated by obesity specialists, and many trials had methodological limitations.</p><p>UK guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that VLEDs may only be used for a maximum of 12 weeks in people who have a clinical need to lose weight rapidly, such as prior to a knee replacement surgery or those seeking fertility services, but recommends against their routine use to manage obesity.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Clinical guidance in the USA does not recommend the routine use of VLEDs, but rather suggests that their use &#x02018;<italic>may</italic> be reasonable in limited circumstances, but only when provided by trained practitioners in a medical care setting where medical monitoring and high intensity lifestyle intervention can be provided&#x02019;.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>Nevertheless, there has been growing interest in the potential for routine use of weight loss programmes similar to traditional VLEDs, in so far as they incorporate a period of total diet replacement using specially formulated products as the sole source of nutrition, but where the energy content is more than 800&#x000a0;kcal/day but less than 1200 kcal/day. The NICE guidelines suggest that this type of low-energy diet could be considered for weight management, providing care is taken to ensure they are nutritionally complete.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is one observational report (n=91) on the use of these low-energy total diet replacement programmes in primary care which found that 64% of participants completed the 810&#x000a0;kcal/day dietary programme, defined as either 12 weeks or reaching 20&#x02009;kg weight loss, with a mean weight loss of 16.9&#x02009;kg (SD=6.0&#x02009;kg). One-third of participants starting the programme maintained a weight loss of&#x000a0;&#x02265;15&#x02009;kg at 12 months.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A large randomised controlled trial, the DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) study, is currently underway to investigate whether this type of low-energy total diet replacement programme can be used to treat type 2 diabetes among people who are also overweight.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It will compare the health effects of the current best-available type 2 diabetes care with those achieved through weight management based on a low-energy total diet replacement programme. While this will provide important mechanistic evidence on the links between weight loss and diabetes risk, it will be delivered by NHS staff, whereas the present study will test the effectiveness of referral outside the NHS to a commercial provider.</p><p>To fill this evidence gap, we will conduct a randomised controlled trial to specifically test the effectiveness of a GP referral to a community-based low-energy total diet replacement programme for patients who are obese and likely to benefit from weight loss. It will assess the clinical effectiveness of a weight loss intervention by measuring weight loss and the change in biomarkers of cardiovascular risk at 12 months relative to weight loss advice provided by practice nurses. This comparator is intended to represent &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;, although in practice most patients who are obese are not offered support to lose weight.</p><p>The context for this trial follows the established model for GP referral to community group-based weight loss programmes.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This uses the generic authority and credibility of health professionals to motivate patients to consider weight management and the specialist knowledge of the commercial provider to guide the intervention and offer frequent contact and behavioural support to the patient. If successful, it will provide another option for weight management that can be offered to patients in primary care, and GPs will be able to guide patients towards the treatment that best fits their circumstances and preferences. This trial will specifically test whether a partnership between GPs and providers will allow for the safe provision of low-energy total diet replacement programmes even for patients with multimorbidity who may gain the greatest benefits from such interventions but who may also need clinical oversight and adjustments to some of their medications as they lose weight. It will provide the opportunity for qualitative research to investigate the perspectives of patients and healthcare practitioners on this type of treatment.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to a Low-Energy Treatment&#x000a0;(DROPLET) trial is to determine the clinical effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of referral to a low-energy total diet replacement programme compared with usual weight management interventions in primary care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>The study will take place in general practices in England.

These appointments consist of motivational support, encouragement, reassurance and problem-solving. All counsellors attend a 1-day in-person training course covering screening for suitability, nutrition, behavioural approaches and medical monitoring. They must pass an accreditation examination before they are allowed to deliver the programme in the community. Thereafter, they have a yearly training updates, a nominated sponsor (experienced counsellor) and access to an online chat forum for sharing queries. Cambridge Weight Plan has a healthcare professional available for the counsellors to consult for advice on specific medical and nutritional queries. Counsellors delivering the intervention for the purposes of this trial received short trial specific training before being allocated study participants.</p><p>During the first 12 weeks the participant will meet with their counsellor weekly. Patients will be asked to follow a programme based on using formula meal replacement products (soups, shakes and bars) and milk comprising 810&#x000a0;kcal/day (3389&#x02009;kJ/day). For the first 8&#x02009;weeks, patients will be advised to replace <italic>all</italic> their usual foods and drinks with four of the formula products daily: 750&#x02009;mL of skimmed milk, 2.25&#x02009;L of water or other non-calorific drinks and a fibre supplement (total diet replacement stage). During the first 2&#x02009;weeks, the formula products will be limited to liquid products (soups and shakes), but from week 3&#x000a0;onwards participants will have the option to include meal replacement bars as part of the formula product allowance. After 8&#x02009;weeks there will be a 4-week stepwise reduction in the use of formula meal replacement products and a gradual reintroduction of food-based meals.

We will record AEs following Good Clinical Practice. All serious and non-serious AEs that occur during the first 12 weeks of the study or until the termination of the weight loss programme will be recorded in participants who initiate one of the weight loss interventions. We will also record all AEs that are presumed to be or known to be related to gallstones up to 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Data management</title><p>Data will be recorded in a web-based data capture system (OpenClinica), which is hosted by the Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit of the University of&#x000a0;Oxford. This system is customised and has an audit trail facility. Ranges and programmed validation checks are implemented in the system in order to aid reliable data entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis by an independent statistician. Each continuous outcome will be assumed to follow the normal distribution and be analysed by means of a linear mixed-effects model, adjusted for outcome at baseline. The model will include fixed-effects terms for randomised group, visit, interaction between randomised group and visit, and baseline BMI (for non-weight outcomes only), and random effects to account for repeated measures on the same participant at 3, 6 and 12 months. No adjustment will be made for baseline BMI in the analysis of the weight outcomes due to its strong collinearity with baseline weight. A random effect will also be included for individual practice. An unstructured variance&#x02013;covariance matrix will be specified between repeated measurements on the same individual, and the random effects for patient and practice will be assumed to be independent. The adjusted treatment effect together with the 95% CI and p&#x000a0;value will be reported. The analysis will be performed using PROC MIXED in SAS Version 9.4. The proportion of participants who lose 5% and 10% of their initial weight at 12 months, respectively, will be presented, and the adjusted difference between the&#x000a0;two arms and 95% CI will be reported. The binary outcome will be analysed by means of a logistic mixed-effects model, adjusting for baseline BMI (fixed effect) and practice (random effect). The number needed to treat to achieve 5% or 10%&#x02009;weight loss, defined as the inverse of the absolute difference in proportions, will be reported if the differences between the treatment and control groups are statistically significant. A full statistical analysis plan will be prepared prior to any data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Qualitative substudy</title><p>The purpose of this study is to examine participants&#x02019; views of the programmes. In particular, we aim to examine the features that helped or hindered adherence to the programme and participants&#x02019; views of the behavioural support provided in the respective programmes. We will therefore purposively sample participants based on their responses to the satisfaction questionnaire, reflecting positive, neutral and negative evaluations. Where possible, we will select participants to reflect both genders, socioeconomic status and ethnic group differences. We anticipate interviewing around 20 participants in the intervention group and 10 in the control group, but sampling will continue until saturation is reached, evidenced by no new themes occurring.</p><p>We will develop a semistructured topic guide for the interviews. The interviewer will encourage respondents to discuss their perceptions and experiences freely and in depth. The interview will set the context by asking about previous experience of weight management. Thereafter, we will ask for participants&#x02019; views on which component parts of their treatment they felt were effective and which they felt were not effective; thoughts about ability to continue to manage their weight when treatment has ended; and their views on medication adjustments where these occurred. The acceptability of the weight management treatment programmes and any preference they initially had for the total diet replacement programme or the usual care programme will be explored.</p><p>Data from participants will be collected in a confidential, telephone interview, which will be audio-recorded. All interviews will be transcribed. To examine saturation, analysis will proceed concurrently with interviewing.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Trial Steering Committee</title><p>An independent Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will provide oversight of all matters relating to participant safety and data quality and value to the public. Due to the low risk nature of the DROPLET trial and that it is an open-label trial, the TSC also has the role of the Data Monitoring Committee, in addition to its role as the TSC. However, there are no early stopping rules, and all AEs are evaluated unblinded to allocation by the trial management group as well as the TSC.</p><p>The TSC includes an independent clinician, dietitian, statistician and two patient representatives. The TSC has reviewed the trial protocol, statistical analysis plan and the suitability of the proposed safety data to be collected.

Participants will be sent a summary of the trial findings at the time when the main article is published. If the trial shows this intervention is effective, the&#x000a0;results will be communicated to policymakers and commissioners of weight management services through briefing papers summarising the main findings.
