Obesity is a chronic process which is associated with a range of diseases; thus, special attention should be paid to its prevention. Besides being related to metabolic disorders, excessive weight gain during adolescence is also a risk factor for extreme obesity in adulthood <xref rid="pone.0057498-Brug1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. According to Schmidt et al. <xref rid="pone.0057498-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, recent socioeconomic changes in Brazil have seen a shift towards obesity among the poor, which is probably related to an increased intake of unhealthy foods.</p><p>A National Survey of Schools in Brazil (PeNSE) on food consumption and behavior among adolescents revealed high levels of consumption of unhealthy dietary items such as sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and sweet cookies; this was accompanied by a lower consumption of fruits and vegetables. Thus, there is a need for health promotion activities aimed at young people <xref rid="pone.0057498-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Schools are considered important places for promoting intervention in order to prevent excessive weight gain, mainly among children; a meta analysis revealed that school-based interventions can improve dietary and physical activity behavior in low- and middle-income countries and that 8 of 12 interventions had a statistically significant effect on BMI <xref rid="pone.0057498-Verstraeten1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Conversely, a meta-analysis conducted by Khambalia et al., in 2012 <xref rid="pone.0057498-Khambalia1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> combined the findings of 3 meta-analysis and 5 systematic reviews and concluded that the effectiveness of such interventions was yet to be determined. Previous studies are heterogeneous, but significant weight reductions in children have been observed for long-term interventions that combine diet, physical activity, and a family component <xref rid="pone.0057498-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-GonzalezSuarez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For the school interventions targeting changes in food intake, behavior change is frequently observed. However, few studies have demonstrated the impact of these dietary changes on changes in BMI <xref rid="pone.0057498-Sichieri1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of obesity interventions among children from minorities in the U.S. observed that interventions with a greater number of components had a higher mean effect size <xref rid="pone.0057498-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The participation of parents and teachers also appears to be important in terms of changing adolescent behavior <xref rid="pone.0057498-McLanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the present school-based intervention involving the participation of parents and teachers was to promote healthy eating habits among adolescents. The intervention&#x02019;s ultimate goal was to bring about changes in the BMI of students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1. Study Design and Setting</title><p>We conducted a paired randomized school-based trial in a sample of fifth graders from public schools in the municipality of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study was conducted and reported according to the CONSORT guideline for cluster-randomized trials <xref rid="pone.0057498-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057498.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057498.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>The trial was labeled PAPPAS, which stands for &#x0201c;parents, students, and teachers for healthy eating&#x0201d; in Portuguese. The invention focused on positive messages related to the intake of water, fruits, rice, and beans. It also included messages regarding eating fewer cookies, sugar-sweetened beverages, and savory snacks. These items were chosen because of their importance in the dietary habits of adolescents in Brazil <xref rid="pone.0057498-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Leal1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The municipality of Duque de Caxias (population, 842,686 <xref rid="pone.0057498-IBGE2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) is in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, 27 km from the state capital. It is also one of the poorest areas in Brazil. For this study, we chose one of the Duque de Caxias districts, Campos El&#x000ed;seos (population, 220,000). This district has 35 municipal schools, and we selected 20 schools with fifth grade classes; these were all located in areas not considered high risk for violence. Our sample included most of public schools from Duque de Caxias, and the dropout rate was low.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2. Sample Size and Randomization Procedure</title><p>A sample size of 444 children (222 in each study arm) was calculated based on 80% power and a significance level of 5%, using a standard deviation of 3 units <xref rid="pone.0057498-Vargas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We anticipated a difference in BMI of 0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which corresponded to the increase in the BMI value at the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile from the ages 10&#x02013;11 years <xref rid="pone.0057498-Must1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As the classes contained 25&#x02013;30 children, the sample included 20 classes from 20 schools (1 class in each school). There were 10 classes in the intervention group and 10 in the control group. The paired randomization procedure was carried out with schools based on the prevalence of excessive weight (overweight+obesity) in the year preceding the survey; those schools with the closest excess weight scores were matched and then randomly allocated. Each pair in the ranking sequence was randomly drafted with 1 class being assigned to the experimental group and 1 to the control group, using opaque envelopes, in the presence of three investigators. Although cluster sampling requires a greater sample size, the repetition of 3 anthropometric measurements increased the power of the study <xref rid="pone.0057498-Piantadosi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>3. Intervention Classes</title><p>The intervention focused on encouraging students to change their eating habits and food consumption over 9 months (from March to November) in the school year of 2010. Trained nutritionists gave monthly 1-h sessions in the classrooms. These sessions included playing games, staging of theater sketches, watching movies and puppet shows, and writing and drawing contests.</p><p>The activities were designed to discourage students from consuming sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar as well as getting them to replace snacks based on processed food (especially cookies) with fresh fruits or healthy homemade food. To reinforce the message of the activities carried out with children during the class intervention&#x02019;s nutritional sessions, a set of messages were sent to the families in the form of illustrated booklets and recipes. The families also received small gifts such as buttons and magnets. In addition, teachers were encouraged to work with the children on the topics addressed in each intervention session. Thus, a set of exercises and suggestions for class work were provided to them. Each session included: (1) activities, related to the subject, to be conducted at the school; (2) folders explaining the intervention program and suggesting the participation of the family, such as reducing purchase of sodas and increasing the purchase of fruits, to be sent home; and (3) strategies for reinforcement of themes by the teachers, using exercises prepared for this purpose, such as specific popular histories or math games.</p><p>Briefly, the themes of the intervention sessions were as follows: (1) healthy eating, (2) native Brazilian eating habits, (3) excessive sugar in processed food, (4) marriage of the rice and beans, (5) the beauty of fruits, (6) super water: a super-hero, (7) cookies, (8) mini-market, and (9) food advertisements. A complete description of each session is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nebin.org/artigos/Interventions%20-%20PAPPAS.pdf">http://www.nebin.org/artigos/Interventions%20-%20PAPPAS.pdf</ext-link>.</p><p>The intervention was based on the action-oriented &#x0201c;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&#x0201d; approach developed by the pedagogue Paulo Freire. This approach proposes a new relationship between teachers, students, and society in which individuals learn to cultivate their own growth through situations from daily life that provide useful learning experiences <xref rid="pone.0057498-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. All 9 intervention sessions explained the concepts on healthy and unhealthy eating habits to students. Students were also given information on barriers to eating healthy items, and they were asked to re-interpret situations based on their own experiences. This involved writing advertisements, participating in a puppet theater, writing about different fruits, etc. For example, in the session on the beauty of fruits, a focal group identified the pros and cons of specific fruits, looked at how children generally consumed them, and examined why some fruits such as bananas were not consumed frequently despite their high availability at school.</p><p>The control group received a one-hour section of orientation on general health and advice on healthy eating, at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>4. Measurements</title><p>Although intervention classes were developed over 9 months, data collection consisted of three waves of measurement (baseline, mid-year school (month 6), and post-intervention (end of term). In each of the three waves, anthropometric examination (Body Mass Index and percentage of total body fat) and consumption of food and beverages using a food frequency questionnaire were collected. At baseline and at the end of the study two 24-h recalls were also obtained.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the adolescent body mass index (BMI calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of the height (m). The secondary outcome was the percentage body fat.</p><p>Weight was measured using a portable electronic scale (Tanita BC-558, Japan) with a capacity of 150 kg and a precision of 100 g. Height was measured using a portable stadiometer (Alturaexata, Brazil) with an amplitude of 200 cm and variation of 0.1 cm. A maximum variation of 0.5 cm between the 2 measures was admitted; if the difference exceeded this value, measurements were repeated. The mean value of 2 valid measures of height was used. Subjects were weighed and measured with minimal clothing and no shoes following the recommendations of Gordon et al. (1988) <xref rid="pone.0057498-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The percentage of total body fat (%BF) was estimated by bioimpedance analysis. This measurement was carried out with a multifrequency tetrapolar bioimpedance device (Tanita BC-558), the same instrument used to measure weight. For the measurements, adolescents were barefoot and upright on the machine while holding a handgrip in each hand <xref rid="pone.0057498-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The %BF values displayed by the scale were used. These were defined according to sex and age.</p><p>Anthropometric measures were analyzed by Z-scores of BMI-for-age and sex from the distributions of the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref rid="pone.0057498-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> using the Anthro-Plus software <xref rid="pone.0057498-deOnis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Nutritional status was classified according to WHO-recommended cutoffs <xref rid="pone.0057498-World1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Compliance with the intervention</title><p>The consumption of food and beverages was assessed at the three moments of assessment, with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The items evaluated were the same from a previously validated FFQ for adolescents in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil <xref rid="pone.0057498-Araujo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and included the following intervention items: cookies, sugar-sweetened beverages (including sodas and juices), and beans; it also included several items commonly consumed by adolescents such as fast food (consumed in restaurants or at street stalls) and milk. Further, nutritionists conducted face-to-face interviews with the students at schools to obtain two 24-h recalls (24HR), one at baseline and one at the end of the study; the Multiple Pass Method was used <xref rid="pone.0057498-Moshfegh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>To verify compliance with the proposed intervention, we asked parents/guardians about their stages of motivation in terms of changing food behavior twice, i.e., at baseline and at the end of the study. The 5 options were as follows: (1) I am not thinking about changing my diet; (2) I am thinking about changing my diet, but I am not sure; (3) I have decided to change my diet, and I am thinking about how to do this; (4) I am changing my diet, but I am having difficulties; and (5) I am changing my diet successfully. These responses parallel the 5 stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation, decision, action, and maintenance) in the Transtheoretical Model <xref rid="pone.0057498-Prochaska1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The present study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines, and all procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Social Medicine (State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants&#x02019; parents. Additionally, a short questionnaire containing information on food consumption and the intention to change eating habits was sent to parents/guardians at baseline (with the terms of consent) and at the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>5. Data Analysis</title><p>Because of the paired cluster design used when allocating schools, we used mixed models to perform a random effects meta-analysis technique that included all data <xref rid="pone.0057498-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This analysis took into account both the within-school and between-school components of variance. To carry out this procedure, a school-pair estimator was created and was used in the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS v 9.3 (Statistical Analysis System).</p><p>These mixed models also allowed for the exploration of factors associated with body weight variation in multilevel analysis where the class was on the second level and the measures taken were on the first level. The models used considered both missing data and the cluster effect <xref rid="pone.0057498-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>For the food and drink intake, data were categorical/dichotomous, and the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS was performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 574 students enrolled in this study (281 in the control group and 293 in the intervention group), 478 (83%) returned consent forms signed by parents/guardians at the first follow-up of the study and had their measurements taken.

This is also despite the fact that the intervention group changed their food habits in accordance with the intervention. Thus, our findings are consistent with the results of other school-based interventions, which focused on changes in BMI of adolescents <xref rid="pone.0057498-Puder1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057498-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, we need to ask why proposals aimed at improving eating habits towards healthy items are not successful in reducing excessive weight gain. Our data showed a high baseline intake of sodas and cookies with mean values of approximately 400 mL and 70 g per day, respectively, and although there were statistically significant reductions in the consumption of these items as a result of our intervention, these were relatively small, especially in terms of soda intake. In terms of the proposed increase in the consumption of fruits, the frequency had increased but was still far lower than at least 1 portion of fruit per day. An increase in the consumption of healthy items without a decrease in eating unhealthy items may not lead to reduced energy intake.</p><p>In our study, a higher baseline BMI was observed in the control group. Although such findings are often prone to measurement errors, it is still unclear if the baseline measurement error should be adjusted for in this context. A study based on computer simulations clearly indicated that in randomized controlled trials, adjusting for baseline unbalances leads to bias, whereas the ordinary least squares estimator without adjustment for measurement error is unbiased <xref rid="pone.0057498-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we observe a statistically significant association in the variable change BMI over time when modeling includes baseline imbalanced variables and no association in the modeling without adjustment for baseline measures. These finding are in line with the concern that by forcing a baseline balance, a spurious relationship between treatment and outcome can be observed <xref rid="pone.0057498-Fitzmaurice1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As an example, unbalances towards greater prevalence of overweight in the experimental group would have indicated a greater reduction in BMI in experimental compared to control.</p><p>Our results are consistent with findings of systematic reviews of fruit intake and obesity, which indicate that increased fruit intake does not lead to a displacement of other items, allowing for a reduction in weight gain <xref rid="pone.0057498-Ledoux1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Rolls1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

This was observed even in the absence of major environmental interventions in the scope of the study.</p><p>Among the many programs developed with schools in order to prevent obesity, some have achieved good results in the behavioral changes of children with regard to eating habits <xref rid="pone.0057498-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0057498-Gortmaker1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> but have led to little or no effect on the variation of weight <xref rid="pone.0057498-Sichieri1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Utter1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Lubans et al. (2012) <xref rid="pone.0057498-Lubans1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> conducted a 12-month multicomponent school-based obesity prevention program in low-income communities in Australia, including teacher professional development, school sport sessions, nutrition workshops, parent newsletters, and text messaging for social support; which also failed to significantly reduce the increase in BMI. However, they observed changes in body composition.</p><p>Also, the &#x0201c;New moves&#x0201d;, a preventing weight-related problems group-randomized study in adolescent girls, conducted in Minnesota, did not lead to significant changes in BMI, but improved eating patterns, sedentary activity, unhealthy weight control behaviors, and body/self-image <xref rid="pone.0057498-NeumarkSztainer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Our decision to involve family members, teachers, and children was an attempt to increase behavioral changes and make an impact on weight gain.

Further, educators have an important role in supporting healthy choices made by children. These educators should be actively involved in intervention strategies based on nutritional education to ensure greater levels of success <xref rid="pone.0057498-Bruss1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In our study, we observed an increase in parents&#x02019; motivation to change dietary habits levels during the school year, which was probably important in reinforcing the adoption of healthy habits by children.</p><p>In studies such as the present one, there is possible bias in reporting towards the expected change in behavior in the experimental group; however, we avoided this by using two methods to provide this information (FFQ and 24HR). Both instruments were employed for measuring changes in eating behavior, and we found that there was a positive change in terms of our intervention goals for the consumption of fruits, cookies, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Only the intake of beans showed no change; however, the reported frequency and portion of intake was already high at baseline. In this study, we have presented the results obtained by the FFQ because this instrument captures the usual intake of individuals. It would be expected that the 24HR provided a less biased report compared with the frequency questionnaire, and we found similar values and positive change with both methods. However, both are dependent on memory, and this is a possible limitation.</p><p>Another possible limitation of the study is the fact that the participant satisfaction was not measured; however focus groups were conducted before the beginning of activities, with the aim of discovering the preferences of children/adolescents.</p><p>Randomization process did not follow completely the consort guideline and was conducted by the investigators, but it was done for each school, using opaque envelops in the presence of three investigators.</p><p>Despite the failure of our intervention to bring about an overall change in the students&#x02019; BMI, the results of this study are important. This is because the dietary patterns of Brazilian adolescents are characterized by low consumption of vegetables and fruits and high consumption of sweets and sodas as well as foods high in sodium <xref rid="pone.0057498-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Bertin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057498-Toral1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Importantly, our results indicate that these behaviors can be changed. Data from the Brazilian Dietary Survey, which was conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in conjunction with the latest Household Budget Survey, showed that Brazilian adolescents consume 4 times more filled cookies (12.3 g/day) than adults (3.2 g/day). They also drink a greater amount of soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages. The average daily intake of sugars is also higher among teenagers, i.e., approximately 110 g per day <xref rid="pone.0057498-IBGE3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>While it is true that a reduction in obesity in the population will not be achieved by 1 or 2 isolated interventions, it is necessary to find effective strategies, especially among economic groups with lower purchasing power. Possible strategies to be explored in communities such the one in this study include an increase in intensity and duration of the interventions, integrating physical activity and/or sedentary behavior, and combining school activities with environmental changes such as reducing the easy access to sodas and low price of junk food.</p><p>Primary prevention of obesity is critical in developing countries because of a strong association between overweight and lower social class. Further studies using multicomponent intervention strategies should be able to increase consumption of healthy dietary items, which are associated with a significant reduction of total energy intake from items such as sodas and cookies. Another good strategy would be to incorporate classroom-based physical activities in such interventions. This is particularly important in low income schools, such as the ones in the study, where outside exercise and games areas are not available.</p><p>When designing this study, we had anticipated that we could change the food environments at schools by discouraging the sale of unhealthy foods at school canteens. However, before the intervention began, most of the participating schools had already closed their canteens in line with a municipal policy. Nonetheless, many students still brought processed salty snacks, filled cookies, and sodas to school. In addition, physical activities were not possible because of lack of support from principals and teachers. More importantly, there school facilities were inadequate; only 2 of the 20 schools had a sports field.</p><p>Lastly, although several studies conducted in developed countries have shown an association between lower consumption of soft drinks and a reduction in weight gain, this was not the case in Brazil. This is because soft drinks are substituted by juices containing sugar in this country <xref rid="pone.0057498-Sichieri2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Thus, further studies are required to develop messages and strategies that not only change specific eating behaviors but also lead to reductions in weight gain, especially among low socio-economic groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057498.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
