The CXCR2 chemokine receptor is important in controlling the extravasation and activation of neutrophils. Selective antagonism of the CXCR2 receptor is a potential approach to reducing neutrophil migration and activation. Danirixin, is a small molecule, CXCR2 antagonist being evaluated as a potential anti-inflammatory medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>(1) First time in human (FTIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending and repeat oral doses of danirixin in healthy male subjects; (2) single-dose study of age, gender, food, and proton-pump inhibitor effects on the pharmacokinetics of danirixin in healthy adult subjects; and placebo-controlled study of the pharmacokinetics of danirixin in healthy elderly subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events considered to be of clinical relevance. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. Systemic exposure following single doses of danirixin 10&#x000a0;mg, 25&#x000a0;mg, 50&#x000a0;mg, 100&#x000a0;mg, and 200&#x000a0;mg increased with increasing dose. Engagement of pharmacology was demonstrated as inhibition of ex-vivo CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils when compared to placebo (approximately 50&#x000a0;% for 50&#x000a0;mg and 100&#x000a0;mg danirixin, and 72&#x000a0;% at 200&#x000a0;mg). There was a 37&#x000a0;% decrease in Cmax and a 16&#x000a0;% decrease in AUC (0-&#x0221e;) following administration of danirixin in the presence of food. Cmax also decreased by 65&#x000a0;% when danirixin 100&#x000a0;mg was administered following omeprazole 40&#x000a0;mg once daily for 5&#x000a0;days. The AUC (0-&#x0221e;) and Cmax were 50&#x000a0;% lower in elderly subjects compared with younger subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The dose-dependent inhibition of agonist-induced neutrophil activation following single and repeated once daily oral administration of danirixin suggests that this CXCR2 antagonist may have benefit in neutrophil-predominant inflammatory diseases. Co-administration with food, gastric acid reducing agents, and variable exposure in the elderly have important clinical implications that need to be taken into consideration in subsequent clinical evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01209052">NCT01209052</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01209104">NCT01209104</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CXCR2 antagonist</kwd><kwd>Danirixin</kwd><kwd>GSK1325756</kwd><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>Omeprazole</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Chemokines acting through specific receptors are able to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation, resulting in the subsequent release of a number of mediators, including neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases, which likely play an important role in disease pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For several acute and chronic pulmonary diseases, chemokines are thought to be important mediators driving the tissue destruction and airway and parenchymal remodeling associated with disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Selective antagonism of the interaction between the CXCR2 chemokine receptor and its various ligands provides a potential targeted strategy for reducing the underlying inflammation that contributes to the deleterious effects of an excessive neutrophil response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In particular, a CXCR2 antagonist may be useful in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are associated with a high tissue burden of activated neutrophils. The potential for CXCR2 antagonism to reduce neutrophil recruitment into the lung has been demonstrated previously in experimental human models of lung inflammation (ozone challenge) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in initial studies in patients with severe asthma and COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Transient reductions in blood neutrophils have been observed with two recent small molecule CXCR2 antagonists following short and long term oral administration leading to concerns about a potential impact on host defense and innate immunity, particularly with chronic use. It is therefore desirable to identify a CXCR2 antagonist that would have the intended efficacy in the target tissues without substantially impacting circulating neutrophil counts.</p><p>Danirixin is a small molecule, non-peptide, high affinity (IC<sub>50</sub> for CXCL8 binding&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.5 nM), selective, and reversible CXCR2 antagonist. This compound has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity in vitro and anti-inflammatory effects in various preclinical models. Its pharmacologic activity and duration of action following oral administration support its potential use as an oral, anti-inflammatory agent.</p><p>The results of two clinical pharmacology studies with danirixin are described in this report. The first time in human (FTIH) study was conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and repeat oral doses of danirixin in healthy adult male subjects. The second study explored the effects of age, gender, food (high fat meal), and a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole) on the pharmacokinetics of danirixin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Danirixin formulation</title><p>The structure of danirixin free base is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Danirixin was extracted using methanol (0.1&#x000a0;mL) containing isotopically labeled [<sup>2</sup>H7]-danirixin (racemic version of danirixin) at a concentration of 50&#x000a0;ng/mL as an internal standard. The extraction tubes were shaken for 1&#x000a0;h at ambient temperature, prior to the supernatant being transferred to clean tubes. The supernatant (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) was injected onto a high-performance liquid chromatography system utilizing a Thermo Scientific Hypersil Gold C18 (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m packing 50 &#x000d7; 4.6&#x000a0;mm) column (supplied by Thermo Scientific, Hempstead, UK), eluted using an isocratic composition: 55:45 (v/v) of aqueous 10&#x000a0;mM ammonium formate containing 0.1&#x000a0;% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B). Danirixin free base has a retention time of approximately 1&#x000a0;min and was detected using tandem mass spectrometry on a Sciex 5000 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using Turbolon Spray in positive polarity mode. Mass transitions monitored were 84 and 89 from precursor ions of 442 and 449 for danirixin and the internal standard. The assay had a linear dynamic range of 5 &#x02013; 1000&#x000a0;ng/mL and quantification was performed using peak area ratios with 1/&#x000d7;<sup>2</sup> weighted linear regression. Assay quality control samples were 15&#x000a0;ng/mL (low), 200&#x000a0;ng/mL (medium) and 800&#x000a0;ng/mL (high). The average within-run precision (%CV) was 9.9, 7.2 and 9.0 respectively, for the low, mid and high quality controls for study CX3112483 and 18.9, 5.9 and 5.2, respectively, for the low, mid and high quality controls for study CX3113722.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the blood concentration-time data for danirixin. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on actual sampling times using standard non-compartmental analysis in WinNonlin Professional, Version 5.2.

The power model analysis was performed on log<sub>e</sub>-transformed AUC (0 to &#x0221e;) and Cmax for danirixin. For each of these parameters, a mixed effects model was fitted with log<sub>e</sub> (dose) as a fixed effect and individual subject intercept fitted as random effects. Estimates of the mean slope of log<sub>e</sub> (dose) were reported along with corresponding 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.</p><p>To evaluate the accumulation ratio and time invariance of the repeat dose cohorts, a statistical analysis was performed after a log transformation of the data from all active treatment groups.

Point estimates of the treatment differences (each danirixin dose vs. placebo) and their associated 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were also calculated (using the pooled estimate of variance) and were back-transformed to provide point estimates and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals for the ratios. The ratios were converted into percent values to give the percent inhibition of danirixin versus placebo and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.</p><p>A Bayesian analysis was conducted to derive the posterior probability distributions for the ratio to baseline fractional increase from control CD11b values at 24&#x000a0;h. The probabilities of seeing the percent inhibition of danirixin versus placebo greater than 0&#x000a0;%, 50&#x000a0;% and greater than 60&#x000a0;% were derived from the frequentist analysis mixed effects model.

There was no evidence of an age-gender interaction; however, as the data are highly variable and the populations were imbalanced in terms of male and female age ranges, further work is needed to adequately define the importance of age and gender on the absorption of danirixin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented in this report are from the first two clinical studies with danirixin in humans to assess the initial safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and repeated doses under conditions relevant to the target patient population. Administration of danirixin was generally well-tolerated at single doses up to 400&#x000a0;mg and following once daily dosing for 14&#x000a0;days at doses of 50&#x000a0;mg and 200&#x000a0;mg. Importantly, subjects did not develop low neutrophil counts or overt neutropenia, as has been reported with other CXCR2 antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Danirixin demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of CXCL1-induced CD11b expression following single doses between 50 to 200&#x000a0;mg, which was maintained after 14&#x000a0;days of dosing. The optimal extent of pharmacodynamic activity needed is unknown, but it is likely that less than complete inhibition of CXCR2 activity is desirable in order to obtain a balance between clinical benefit, while minimizing the impact on innate immunity and host defense. Although the magnitude and duration of CXCR2 antagonism needed to achieve a pharmacologic and clinical effect in disease are unknown the pharmacokinetic data suggest that twice-daily dosing with danirixin may be needed to maintain blood concentrations at an appropriate level.</p><p>The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the use of gastric acid suppressing agents in COPD, one of the disease targets for a CXCR antagonist, is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Proton pump inhibitors have been reported to increase intragastric pH above 4.0 for approximately 50&#x000a0;% of the time over a 24&#x000a0;h interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Acidic conditions are required for optimal dissolution of danirixin. The formulation strategy for danirixin has thus far been focused on optimizing the disintegration and dissolution of the product in the stomach, which would then be expected to deliver a solution of the drug for absorption to the duodenal region of the small intestine. An intra-gastric pH at a steady state above 4.0 during a significant proportion of the day has potential implications for the solubility and absorption of danirixin. Statistically significant reductions in danirixin AUC and Cmax were observed in the presence of omeprazole.</p><p>The effect of omeprazole on the bioavailability of danirixin suggests an important drug interaction requiring further evaluation to determine appropriate dosing recommendations in patients using gastric acid reducing agents. Additional drug interactions that may impact danirixin have not been evaluated. However, one study has assessed the potential for metabolic drug interactions. In this study a bile sample was obtained using a non-invasive sampling technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The results demonstrated that glucuronide conjugation is likely to be the major route of metabolism for danirixin. Oxidative metabolism contributed only in a minor way indicating that cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions are not likely to be a concern for danirixin.</p><p>In the presence of a high fat meal, the AUC and Cmax data suggest that the rate, but not the extent of absorption of danirixin was reduced, as would be expected from a molecule with this solubility profile. Furthermore, these data also suggest that in the fasted state the average exposure to danirixin in the elderly was half that of younger subjects, as reflected by lower AUC and Cmax measurements. In addition, in the fasted state, very high inter-subject variability in the exposure measurement was observed in elderly subjects. Administration of danirixin with food resulted in reduced variability in a range that is considered acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data in the reported studies indicate that danirixin was well-tolerated, with a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in healthy adult subjects, including elderly subjects. The dose-dependent inhibition of CXCL1-induced CD11b expression following single doses between 50 to 200&#x000a0;mg suggests the potential for clinical benefit in disease indications where an excessive neutrophil response has an important role in pathogenesis.
