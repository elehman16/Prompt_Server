The aim of this study was to investigate how therapists&#x02019; ratings relate to the adolescents&#x02019; perspective, how individual therapist and adolescent ratings relate to change in symptoms and treatment satisfaction, and whether discrepant alliance perspectives impact treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method</title><p>The sample consisted of 156 youth (mean age 15.1, range 10&#x02013;18), randomized to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy or treatment as usual, and alliance ratings from 62 therapists. Alliance was measured midtreatment with the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children, and the factor structure of the two scales was analyzed with exploratory factor analyses.

In particular, the development of a strong, therapeutic alliance has been viewed as essential for the successful treatment of traumatized adolescents. This is, in part, because the experience of interpersonal trauma can alter core beliefs about others&#x02019; trustworthiness, thereby making treatment collaboration particularly challenging (Cloitre, Cohen, &#x00026; Scarvalone, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Cohen, Mannarino, Kliethermes, &#x00026; Murray, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Shirk &#x00026; Eltz, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In addition, treatment methods, especially the use of exposure techniques, may be perceived as demanding, and strain the working relationship between adolescent and therapist. Several studies of traumatized adults have found that a strong alliance is related to significantly lower symptom-level post-treatment (Cloitre, Koenen, Cohen, &#x00026; Han, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Cloitre, Stovall-McClough, Miranda, &#x00026; Chemtob, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Cronin, Brand, &#x00026; Mattanah, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; McLaughlin, Keller, Feeny, Youngstrom, &#x00026; Zoellner, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), findings that are in line with at least two studies with traumatized adolescents (Eltz, Shirk, &#x00026; Sarlin, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Ormhaug, Jensen, Wentzel-Larsen, &#x00026; Shirk, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The majority of these studies focused on the client perspective of the alliance. Only two included therapist alliance ratings (Cronin et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Eltz et al., <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Consequently, less is known about therapists&#x02019; perspectives on the alliance, and how this corresponds to clients&#x02019; views in trauma treatments. Clinically, therapists&#x02019; perspectives are important because the therapists are responsible for managing the therapeutic process, including handling potential alliance ruptures (Safran, Muran, &#x00026; Eubanks-Carter, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, the therapists&#x02019; evaluations of the alliance are likely to influence in-session decision-making about specific interventions. For example, if a therapist perceives a fragile alliance, he or she may be reluctant to press the client to engage in challenging treatment tasks such as exposure. In fact, there is some evidence that concerns about alliance rupture is one of the primary reasons therapists avoid exposure-based interventions (Kendall et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). As studies indicate that exposure tasks are important to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Deblinger, Mannarino, Cohen, Runyon, &#x00026; Steer, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ehlers et al., <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), omitting this component may potentially reduce treatment effectiveness. On the other hand, if therapists overestimate alliance strength relative to their adolescent clients, they may fail to engage in supportive strategies to maintain treatment collaboration. In fact, failure to recognize the adolescent's perspectives on the alliance, as reflected in discrepant alliance ratings, could indicate a lack of therapist attunement to the adolescent's experience and predict poorer outcomes. In the adult therapy literature, it has been found that low levels of client&#x02013;therapist agreement on the alliance are related to lower session smoothness and less symptom change (Marmarosh &#x00026; Kivlighan, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Also, lack of therapist attunement to, and reparation of, alliance ruptures have been related to poorer outcomes (McLaughlin et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Safran et al., <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). There are, however, to our knowledge, no studies that have investigated the potential impact of discrepant therapist and adolescent perspectives on process and outcomes.</p><p>Several studies have shown that the level of youth and therapist agreement on the alliance is small to moderate (Accurso &#x00026; Garland, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Creed &#x00026; Kendall, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Eltz et al., <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Hawley &#x00026; Garland, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kendall et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This is consistent with the findings from the adult field, where a meta-analysis showed that the average correlation between therapist and client perspectives was <italic>r=</italic>0.36 (Tryon, Blackwell, &#x00026; Hammel, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Although this suggests some level of convergence between the two perspectives, it also points to important differences between the raters&#x02019; views of the alliance. In the adult treatment literature, there is evidence for differences in the underlying factor structure of therapist and client alliance ratings (Bachelor, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Although less studied, research on youth alliance has indicated that child and adolescent ratings of the alliance may differ from therapist ratings and not conform to the conceptual model advanced by Bordin (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>) with distinct factors related to bond, task, and goals. Instead, DiGiuseppe, Linscott, and Jilton (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) found adolescent ratings to be unidimensional. Interestingly, therapist ratings reflected the multidimensional structure proposed by Bordin (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). In another study of the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children&#x02014;revised (TASC-r; Shirk &#x00026; Karver, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Shirk &#x00026; Saiz, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), it was found that child and adolescent ratings were organized by item valence rather than by the hypothesized dimensions of bond and task (Accurso, Hawley, &#x00026; Garland, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, discrepancies in youth and therapist ratings of the alliance might represent more than differences in vantage point; they could reflect differences in conceptualization of alliance.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to examine therapist evaluations of alliance in the treatment of traumatized adolescents. Specifically, the degree of correspondence between therapist and client ratings of alliance was examined, and the degree to which each perspective predicted treatment outcome was assessed. Because shared source variance may represent confound in alliance&#x02014;outcome studies, both adolescent and therapist ratings of alliance were examined as predictors of outcomes assessed from adolescent and clinician perspectives. In addition to symptom change, adolescents&#x02019; satisfaction with treatment was also evaluated. Given prior results indicating only moderate associations between client and therapist ratings, potential factors underlying differences in therapist and youth ratings were explored. Specifically, the factor structure of adolescent and therapist ratings were evaluated to examine whether the treatment participants perceive the alliance as a similar construct. Finally, we examined whether discrepant views of alliance were associated with treatment outcomes. It was hypothesized that greater divergence between therapist and adolescent ratings of alliance signals poor therapist attunement to the adolescent's experience and represents a marker of negative therapeutic process. Although absolute discrepancy could indicate attunement lapses, we expected that lower adolescent than therapist ratings would be at greater risk for poorer outcomes.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Procedure</title><p>Data were derived from a randomized effectiveness study comparing trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT; Cohen, Mannarino, &#x00026; Deblinger, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) to treatment as usual (TAU) for traumatized youth (Jensen et al., <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All participants were referred and received treatment at one of eight community outpatient clinics in Norway. Inclusion criteria were clinically significant levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (&#x02265;15 on the Child Posttraumatic Symptom Scale [CPSS]; Foa, Johnson, Feeny, &#x00026; Treadwell, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Exclusion criteria were psychotic disorders, suicidal behavior, or need of an interpreter. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research, and written consent was obtained from both the caretaker and the adolescent. Because the alliance has been conceptualized as a measure of how well the client and therapist work together (Horvath, Del Re, Fl&#x000fc;ckiger, &#x00026; Symonds, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the alliance was assessed after session 6. This was to ensure that the adolescents had established an opinion of their working collaboration with the therapist. Post-treatment PTS symptom-level and adolescents&#x02019; satisfaction with the treatment was assessed after 15 sessions. Licensed psychologists from the study group conducted all assessments, and adolescents were informed that the therapists would not be able to see their alliance ratings.

Half of these adolescents (<italic>n=</italic>65) were randomized to the TF-CBT condition, and the other half to TAU. The majority was female (80.8%) and had at least one Norwegian born parent (83.9%). Adolescents reported on average 3.5 different types of traumatizing events (SD: 1.6, range 1&#x02013;8). The most commonly reported events were: sudden death of a caregiver or close person (58.8%), physical assault outside the family (58.0%), witnessing violence and physical abuse within the family (43.5%), sexual abuse outside the family (28.2%), and witnessing violence outside the family (26.0%). The 26 adolescents that did not complete the alliance ratings were not significantly different from the 130 completers in terms of age, sex, number of traumatic events, or pretreatment PTS symptoms.

Of these, 62 rated their alliance with 126 adolescents. This sample consisted of 120 therapy dyads, and 6 therapists with no corresponding adolescent ratings. On average, each therapist rated the alliance with two youth (SD: 1.2, range 1&#x02013;6). The therapist group was predominantly female (87.3%) and consisted of 39 (62.9%) psychologists, 10 (16.1%) educational therapists, 9 (14.5%) social workers, and 4 (6.4%) psychiatrists. Therapists reported on average 12.1 years of postgraduate working experience (SD: 9.7, median=9.0, range 1&#x02013;40). Adolescents whose therapists did not report an alliance rating (<italic>n=</italic>30) were significantly older (mean age 15.8 vs. 14.9, <italic>t</italic>[154]=2.1, <italic>p=</italic>0.039) and reported significantly higher pretreatment CPSS scores (mean score 29.8 vs. 26.4, <italic>t</italic>[154]=2.2, <italic>p=</italic>0.028) compared to adolescents with therapist-rated alliance scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Alliance measures</title><sec><title>Adolescent-rated alliance</title><p>TASC-r (Shirk &#x00026; Karver, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Shirk &#x00026; Saiz <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) is a self-reported scale that includes 12 items.

Relationships between alliance scores and outcome were analyzed with linear regressions. Pretreatment symptom levels were included in the models predicting post-treatment symptom scores, and change scores (level of symptom change from pre to post) were included in the youth satisfaction model. Differences in correlations of youth and therapist perspectives were tested using bootstrap <italic>BC</italic>
<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> intervals (10,000 bootstrap replications). Factor structure of the two scales was investigated with exploratory factor analyses. Geomin factor loadings were used (Muth&#x000e9;n &#x00026; Muth&#x000e9;n, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>&#x02013;2012), and extractions were specified to one or two factors. Because the TASC-r items are rated on a 4-point scale, items were entered as categorical (Rhemtulla, Brosseau-Liard, &#x00026; Savalei, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). To determine model fit, both likelihood-ratio chi square and descriptive fit indices were utilized. The descriptive fit indices included the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker&#x02013;Lewis fit index (TLI), the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR). These fit indices have most commonly been studied as indicators of structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analyses (see, e.g., Schreiber, Stage, King, Nora, &#x00026; Barlow, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and there are currently no established cut-off values for the use of the fit indices in EFA (Barendse, Oort, &#x00026; Timmerman, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In our study, we followed Accurso et al. (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) where models that fit very well (or adequately) were indicated by CFIs and TLIs &#x02265;0.95 (0.90&#x02013;0.94), RMSEAs &#x0003c;0.05 (to 0.08), and SRMR &#x0003c;0.05 (to 0.08). A model was determined to be well-fitting if three of the four descriptive indices indicated good fit. Because of the nested nature of the data the within subjects ICC were calculated to see whether the clinic and/or therapist level had to be taken into account in the EFA and regression analyses. It was assumed that multilevel models could be difficult or impossible to estimate with small ICCs and would not be beneficial with ICC levels lower than 0.05 (Dyer, Hanges, &#x00026; Hall, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Finally, to investigate whether discrepant views of the alliance were associated with treatment outcome, a difference score (therapist ratings minus youth ratings) was entered as a predictor in the regression models.</p><p>Preliminary analyses and analyses of cross-informant agreement were conducted using PASW Statistics 22.0 (IBM, <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and exploratory factor analyses were run in Mplus 7.0 (Muth&#x000e9;n &#x00026; Muth&#x000e9;n, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1998&#x02013;2012</xref>). The remaining analyses were run in R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computation, Vienna, Austria), with multiple imputations calculated using the R package mice (Van Buuren, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and bootstrapping with the R package boot.</p><sec><title>Missing data</title><p>Of the 156 recruited youth, 130 completed the midtreatment alliance ratings.

To account for missing values in covariates, regression analyses were repeated using multiple imputations (200 completed data sets, see R script, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ejpt.net/index.php/ejpt/rt/suppFiles/27705/0">Supplementary file</ext-link>).

In this study, the relationship between client and therapist alliance perspectives, their association with outcomes, and the impact of alliance discrepancy were evaluated in a sample of traumatized adolescents undergoing treatment. Consistent with prior studies on the TASC-r, it was found that the two alliance perspectives were moderately associated (Accurso &#x00026; Garland, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Creed &#x00026; Kendall, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Fjermestad et al., <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kendall et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Also, similar to studies on adults (Hartmann, Joos, Orlinsky, &#x00026; Zeek, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tryon et al., <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) therapists rated the alliance less positively than clients. Given that the TASC-r requires therapists to view the alliance from their client's perspective, this pattern indicates that therapists underestimate alliance strength relative to their adolescent clients. It has been suggested that discrepancies in alliance ratings may be related to differences in clients&#x02019; and therapists&#x02019; implicit views of the alliance construct (Bachelor, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Current results showed that the factor structure of the TASC-r differed across therapist and client perspectives. Findings indicated that therapist ratings clustered based on item content, consistent with dimensions hypothesized by Bordin (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). However, adolescent ratings of alliance did not separate into bond and task dimensions but were instead structured along item valence, that is, whether they are positively or negatively worded. This pattern for adolescent ratings is consistent with the recent results obtained by Accurso et al. (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and suggests that the alliance is largely an affective construct for children and adolescents. It may be that therapists, who often have a broader reference group of patients, judge their clients&#x02019; alliance based on their collaborative involvement in the therapeutic tasks. Clients, on the other hand, are likely to compare therapists&#x02019; attentive and empathic attitudes to responses they usually receive from friends and family members (Hartmann et al., <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and this may have a positive influence on their alliance ratings.</p><p>In this study, client and therapist alliance ratings showed different associations with change in posttraumatic stress symptoms. Consistent with prior research (Cloitre, Koenen, et al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Cloitre et al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Cronin et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; McLaughlin et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), adolescent alliance ratings were significantly associated with self-reported change in PTSS and were marginally related to clinician reports of symptom change. In contrast, therapist ratings were not significantly related to either measure of symptom change, but comparisons of magnitude in correlations showed that client and therapist associations with adolescent-rated symptom change were not significantly different. However, like adolescent ratings of alliance, therapist ratings did predict client treatment satisfaction. This pattern of findings suggests that a positive relationship between adolescent and therapist is an important component of satisfaction with therapy process, and corresponds to prior research that has found that therapist perspectives are related to treatment progress in therapy with traumatized clients (Cronin et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Eltz et al., <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Although it has been claimed that treatment satisfaction is not a good indicator of clinical change (Garland, Aarons, Hawley, &#x00026; Hough, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), in this study there was a significant association between treatment satisfaction and symptom change. In fact, when considered together, both symptom change and alliance predicted client satisfaction.</p><p>Results also provided some evidence that the level of discrepancy between therapist and client views of alliance was associated with outcome and satisfaction. Adolescents whose therapists rated the alliance as relatively more positive than the adolescents showed less symptom reduction compared to dyads where alliance ratings were similar or more positively rated by the adolescent. This pattern is intriguing in that more positive therapist ratings of alliance predict poorer outcomes when considered in relation to client ratings. It is possible that therapists who overestimate alliance strength relative to their adolescent clients are less attuned to their client's experiences in therapy. This could lead them to overlook alliance problems that could impact treatment progress. Alternatively, adolescents who view the alliance more negatively than their therapists may be less open and more difficult to read by their therapists. Either way, these results suggest that future research should include both client and therapist perspectives on the alliance, not simply because they are not interchangeable, but because their level of convergence or discrepancy within dyads appears to predict outcome.</p><p>Although this study has a number of strengths including a relatively large referred adolescent sample treated by community clinicians, and the inclusion of different perspectives on both alliance and outcome, a number of limitations must be considered. The first concerns the non-independence of the alliance ratings as youth were nested within therapists. Investigations of the ICC levels indicated that multilevel analyses would be warranted; however, efforts to take this nesting into account produced unstable estimates and were not computed. This could be due to the distribution of youth&#x02013;therapist pairs in this sample as 43.5% of the therapists rated their alliance with one youth only, and only 30.7% rated their alliance with three or more youth. Nevertheless, the use of single-level analyses means that a certain amount of doubt concerning our findings cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, only alliance ratings from one time point were included in this study. As a fluctuation in the alliance over time has been found to be significantly related to the outcome of PTSD treatment (McLaughlin et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the inclusion of more assessment points would also have strengthened the results of our study. In this study, the alliance was assessed at session 6. This is a time point where most participants in the TF-CBT condition had started their work on the trauma narrative (Cohen et al., <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and it cannot be ruled out that this potentially demanding task may have influenced the adolescents&#x02019; alliance ratings. However, analyses showed that in TAU, the treatment condition that did not include specified work on a trauma narrative (Ormhaug et al., <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the alliance ratings were comparable to the TF-CBT participants&#x02019; ratings. This finding could indicate that the trauma narrative did not have extensive influence on the alliance ratings. Also, the rates of missing data for several predictor variables may have biased our results. Although analyses with multiple imputations showed similar results as complete case analyses, indicating that the impact of missing data was not substantial, results would have been stronger if our data were more complete. The final limitation refers to the composition of the sample. This study had a predominantly female sample, and although there was some ethnic diversity in the sample, most of the participants were of Norwegian descent. Limited diversity could affect the ability to generalize from our results.</p><p>Findings showing important differences between therapist and adolescent ratings of alliance carry a number of implications. From a research perspective, therapist and adolescent perspectives are not interchangeable. The finding that therapist and youth reports are potentially based on two different conceptual models of the alliance has implications for how youth and therapist ratings are interpreted. Adolescents appear to view the alliance in more general affective terms, whereas therapists distinguish therapy work from relational bond. Perhaps, it is not surprising, then, that adolescent and therapist alliance ratings are only moderately associated and have somewhat different associations with change in posttraumatic symptoms. Although it is tempting to recommend that only the client perspective be used as a predictor of outcome, the degree of discrepancy between therapist and adolescent ratings also proved to be related to symptom change. Future research should examine the impact of discrepancy on treatment process to uncover possible mediating variables, for example, the impact on treatment fidelity. From a clinical perspective, the prevalence of therapist&#x02013;adolescent discrepancy suggests that it might be useful for therapists to receive direct feedback on alliance over the course of treatment. Like feedback on symptom change, alliance feedback could help therapists know when treatment is &#x0201c;off track.&#x0201d; Finally, and of specific relevance to the treatment of traumatized adolescents, alliance formation and maintenance appear to be a critical component of successful therapy. Future research should address therapist strategies that promote and maintain the therapeutic alliance with traumatized youth and the impact of alliance level on implementation of core treatment components such as exposure and cognitive restructuring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Therapist and client perspectives on the alliance in the treatment of traumatized adolescents</title></caption><media xlink:href="EJPT-6-27705-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title>Therapist and client perspectives on the alliance in the treatment of traumatized adolescents</title></caption><media xlink:href="EJPT-6-27705-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN0001"><label>1</label><p>Results from complete case analyses can be made available upon request from the first author.</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>There is no conflict of interest in the present study for any of the authors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Accurso</surname><given-names>E.
