A synthetic bone substitute material composed of P-15 with anorganic bone mineral has been scantly studied. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of anorganic bovine-derived hydroxyapatite matrix (ABM)/cell binding peptide (P-15) in human periodontal infrabony defects with that of open flap debridement (OFD) alone.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A split-mouth, randomized controlled clinical study was designed to investigate the efficacy of ABM/P-15. In this clinical trial, 10 patients having bilateral periodontal infrabony defects were treated either with ABM/P-15 or OFD and followed for a period of 9 months. At baseline and at 9 months probing pocket depth (PPD), relative attachment level (RAL), depth of a defect, and radiographic bone level were measured; and compared between test and control sites.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>A statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in PPD was observed in test sites compared to control sites.

In spite, these materials demonstrates clinical effectiveness, functional periodontal repair, defect fill, and reduction of the pocket depth to manageable levels.</p><p>Intense research is currently underway in different laboratories to identify, characterize, purify, and synthesize a variety of biologic modulators that may enhance wound healing and regeneration of lost tissues by periodontal therapy. One such approach has been to identify the specific cell binding domain of Type I collagen. Based on this approach Qian and Bhatnagar developed a synthetic bone substitute material composed of P-15 with an organic bone mineral derived from bovines.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The peptide component (P-15) is a synthetic clone of 15 amino acid sequence (GTPGPQGIAGQRGVV) with steric similarities to the cell-binding site of Type I collagen. The ABM represents a natural hydroxyapatite skeleton that appears more physiological during wound healing. It has been shown that the P-15 helps in binding of cells particularly fibroblasts and osteoblasts.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The combination of above two approaches in the form of ABM/P-15 bone graft material (PepGen P-15&#x02122;) has shown to enhance the attachment of cells and to promote attachment of periodontal fibroblasts to the ABM carrier in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by regulating specific gene expressions of cells during early wound healing.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Thus, PepGen P-15&#x02122; participates in the initial phase of bone regeneration as the P-15 helps in the fundamental requirement of wound healing by cell migration, differentiation, and cell attachment. This material could bypass many of the safety; supply and consistency issues associated with autografts and allografts; and provide a more beneficial material for periodontal regeneration. Until now, scant published literature exists from the controlled clinical studies evaluating the healing process of periodontal disease infrabony defects after treatment with ABM/P-15 graft material. Therefore, the present study was undertaken with objectives to evaluate and compare the treatment of infrabony periodontal defects with ABM/P-15 particulate bone replacement graft (test site) with that of open flap debridement (OFD) therapy alone (control site).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Experimental design and study subjects</title><p>A longitudinal, split mouth, randomized controlled clinical study was designed to investigate the efficacy of ABM/P-15 particulate (PepGen P-15 particulate, Dentsply Friadent, Germany) in infrabony periodontal defects, as compared to conventional flap debridement therapy alone.</p><p>Ten generally healthy patients belonging to either gender (3 males and 7 females, aged 30&#x02013;60 years) having bilateral, moderate to severe (&#x02265;6 mm) periodontal osseous defects were selected from the outpatient Department of Periodontics, Dental College; and followed for a period of 9 months.</p><p>Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Dental College.

Therefore, defect fill of 25&#x02013;35% following surgical debridement could be a common observation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Although clinical studies have proved that clinical attachment gain following regenerative periodontal surgery is mainly dependent on the defect depth and configuration.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It has been reported that the greater the initial defect depth, the better the amount of clinical attachment gain, Deeper defects have a higher potential for bone healing due to their enhanced source of osteogenic cells from periodontal ligament and adjacent alveolar bone.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The use of ABM/P-15 alone in the treatment of grade II furcation was found to be beneficial and cost-effective as compared to the ABM/P-15 with the biodegradable membrane.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, in the present study no attempt was made to treat any Grade II furcation defects.</p><p>In the test sites, residual graft particles were attached to the soft tissue, as well as embedded in the defect fill, showing an appearance of partially calcified matrix [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Figure 20</xref>]. This condition was in agreement with the reported series of studies by Yukna <italic>et al</italic>., in which they found graft particles clinically, as well as in histologic sections.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This shows that anorganic bovine bone mineral matrix/cell binding peptide P-15 (PepGen P-15&#x02122;) takes a longer time to undergo complete resorption and replacement by new bone. It has been shown that ABM material resorbs very slowly, and histologic evidence suggests new bone formation on, around and among the ABM/P-15 particles, incorporating them into the new bone.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the present study, clinically the bone fill did not show the complete bone formation or hard tissue formation even at 9 months. The grafted areas, as well as the control sites, resisted penetration by the probe or removal with a curette, which is similar to the study reported by Rabalais <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Meffert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, it should be borne in mind that the placement of graft material itself into the defect could have modified gingival tissue consistency limiting the penetration of probe without inducing the actual gain in clinical attachments.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><fig id="F20" position="float"><label>Figure 20</label><caption><p>Defect fill with graft particles in test site at 9 months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-651-g023"/></fig><p>Radiographic assessment of the hard tissue was done using the Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. Radiographs at its best represent a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional defect and probably this could be the cause for the discrepancies in the clinical and RDF. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve absolutely reproducible radiographs in all cases. Thus, in order to minimize the variations and to provide a degree of standardization the present study utilized radiographs with a paralleling sensor holder technique. Krejci <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that radiographs should not be used as the sole method to assess the osseous defect fill in infrabony defects due to the difficulties in estimation of the amount of defect fill.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results of the present study, it can be concluded that the natural hydroxyapatite, anorganic bone matrix combined with a synthetic cell binding peptide (ABM/P-15) appears to be a useful and beneficial material in the treatment of human periodontal infrabony defects. The use of this material may effectively circumvent many of the safety; supply and consistency issues associated with autografts and allografts; and provide a more beneficial material for regeneration. However, further studies including human histologic evidences are needed to elucidate true periodontal regeneration by using ABM/P-15 in its particulate form in the treatment of infrabony periodontal defects.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
