Here, we present a trial follow-up study to assess the association between prenatal food and micronutrient supplementation and childhood blood pressure and kidney function. During the MINIMat Trial in rural Bangladesh, women were randomly assigned early in pregnancy to receive an early or later invitation to attend a food supplementation program and additionally to receive either iron and folate or multiple micronutrient tablets daily. The 3267 singleton birth individuals with measured anthropometry born during the trial were eligible for a follow-up study at 4.5 y old. A total of 77% of eligible individuals were recruited and blood pressure, kidney size by ultrasound, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR; calculated from plasma cystatin c) were assessed. In adjusted analysis, early invitation to food supplementation was associated with a 0.72-mm Hg [(95% CI: 0.16, 1.28); <italic>P</italic> = 0.01] lower childhood diastolic blood pressure and maternal MMS supplementation was associated with a marginally higher [0.87 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.18, 1.56); <italic>P</italic> = 0.01] childhood diastolic blood pressure. There was also some evidence that a supplement higher in iron was associated with a higher offspring GFR. No other effects of the food or micronutrient interventions were observed and there was no interaction between the interventions on the outcomes studied. These marginal associations and small effect sizes suggest limited public health importance in early childhood.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The impact of nutrition during development is recognized as an important underlying risk factor for an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility to disease in later life. Studies have consistently demonstrated that altering the nutrient supply of pregnant animals induces profound changes in the function of body systems, including raised blood pressure, fewer kidney nephrons, and impaired pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell development (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In humans, much of the evidence has focused on the inverse associations observed between birth weight and a range of chronic diseases in later life, including hypertension and diabetes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These inverse associations are often interpreted as revealing the importance of nutrient supply to the developing fetus, although many other factors may underlie impaired uterine growth retardation and subsequent disease susceptibility.</p><p>A range of factors affect the supply of nutrients to the developing fetus, including placental function and maternal nutrient stores as well as the maternal diet. Of these, nutritional intake during pregnancy is the most easily manipulated and may thus have the greatest public health importance. Direct evidence from humans on the impact of diet during pregnancy on offspring cardiovascular disease (CVD)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>9</sup></xref> risk is limited and inconclusive (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Moreover, the evidence base is dominated by observational studies that are likely to suffer from confounding due to a range of unmeasured characteristics. The follow-up of maternal supplementation trials to investigate the impact of nutrition during pregnancy on offspring CVD risk represents a powerful resource within this research field, taking advantage of the epidemiological strengths of trial design (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that the developmental origins of chronic disease may be particularly relevant to lower-income countries where nutrition and epidemiological transitions are occurring against a background of generational cycles of undernutrition and infant growth retardation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is thus of particular interest to understand the impact of nutritional supplementation in pregnancy in these settings to explore the long-term consequences of these widely promoted interventions. A few studies have now published data on the impact of supplementation trials in resource-poor settings on offspring CVD risk factors. The provision of protein-energy supplements during pregnancy in The Gambia was found to be unrelated to any of the CVD risk factors studied, including body composition, blood pressure, and lipid profile in adolescents (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). No other studies to our knowledge have looked solely at protein-energy supplements during pregnancy. Multiple-micronutrient supplements (MMSs) provided in pregnancy compared with iron and folate supplements were marginally associated with lower offspring systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure at 2 y of age in one Nepalese study (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) but were unrelated to offspring blood pressure at 6&#x02013;8 y in a separate Nepalese trial where MMSs were compared with vitamin A supplementation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this latter trial, there was also no impact of maternal iron, zinc, and folate supplementation on offspring blood pressure compared with vitamin A supplementation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present information on blood pressure and kidney function for individuals born as part of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Intervention in the Matlab (MINIMat; ISRCTN16581395) trial in rural Bangladesh. This trial was a large, combined food and multiple-micronutrient intervention for pregnant women aimed at improving birth weight and neonatal health (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This paper presents follow-up data on blood pressure and kidney function of the children born during the trial when they reached 4.5 y of age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The MINIMat trial was conducted by the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) between November 2001 and October 2003 in the rural Matlab region of Bangladesh, 57 km southeast of the capital Dhaka. Details of the trial design are available elsewhere (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In brief, women were recruited early in pregnancy through regular surveillance of the demographic area covered by icddr,b. Consenting women were randomly assigned to 2 separate nutritional interventions in pregnancy: access to food supplementation and receipt of a micronutrient supplement. For the food intervention, women were randomly assigned to receive encouragement to attend government-sponsored, local community nutrition centers either early in pregnancy (around 9 wk of gestation) or at a time of their choosing (usually around 20 wk of gestation). Food supplements that provided 608 kcal/d energy and 18 g/d of vegetable protein were available to all attending women. Women participating in the MINIMat trial were also randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 micronutrient supplements with identical appearance: 30 mg of iron and 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g of folate (Fe30F)/d, 60 mg of iron and 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g of folate (Fe60F)/d, or the UNIMAP combination of 15 micronutrients at or above the RDA (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which contained 30 mg iron and 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g folate (MMS)/d. The micronutrient supplements were provided to participants on a monthly basis in special bottles (eDEM, Aprex) containing 35 capsules, which was more than sufficient for the daily tablet allowance. Compliance was assessed by the reported number of food packages received and the number of micronutrient bottle openings (recorded by the eDEM device) from enrollment to wk 30 gestation. In total, 4436 pregnant women were enrolled in the trial and there were 3560 live singleton births (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). The primary outcomes of the original trial were birth anthropometry and neonatal survival; no effect was observed on birth size, but the combined early invitation to food supplementation and MMSs were associated with decreased childhood mortality (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of offspring born during the MINIMat trial and those recruited into the current follow-up study.

The 3267 children who were live singleton births and had measured birth anthropometry were eligible for the follow-up study and informed consent was obtained by their parents or guardians. Scientific approval was granted by the Research Review Committee of icddr,b and ethical approval from the icddr,b Ethical Review Committee as well as the ethical committees of the participating universities (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uppsala University, and the University of Tsukuba); separate approval was granted for the follow-up study and the original trial. A range of outcomes was assessed during the follow-up, including blood pressure and kidney function, which are presented here, and child growth and body composition, which are published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Blood pressure was assessed on all individuals recruited into the 4.5-y follow-up. For cost and logistic considerations, measurements of kidney function were conducted on a subset of participants; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessment was restricted to individuals born during the first year of the MINIMat trial (June 2002&#x02013;June 2003) and the kidney biometric study was restricted to a different subsample of individuals, born during the second half (June 2003&#x02013;June 2004) of the trial to minimize participant burden.</p><p>Blood pressure was measured on all individuals in triplicate using an automated oscillometric device (Omron 705IT, Morton Medical). The first measurement was taken after the participant had been seated at rest for 5 min and there was 1 min between each subsequent measurement. Kidney function was assessed by calculation of the GFR estimated from plasma cystatin C (CysC), which was analyzed from stored, frozen samples using the immunoturbidimetric analysis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) in Uppsala, Sweden. GFR was calculated from CysC using a prediction equation generated in Swedish patients and applicable for use in children (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Kidney volume was assessed by ultrasonography conducted using a 3.75-MHz convex scanner (Toshiba SSA- 510A/P3, Famio-5, Toshiba Medical Systems). Two study physicians conducted all measurements after extensive training and standardization. Intra-observer error (expressed as the SD of the difference of the first and second measurement) ranged from 1.86 to 3.36 cm<sup>3</sup> and the inter-observer error (evaluated by the SD of the difference) ranged from 1.64 to 3.83 cm<sup>3</sup>; both measurement errors were within the range reported in the literature for studies conducted by technical staff and medical doctors (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The right and left kidney volumes were calculated by fitting a best-fit ellipsoid shape that was converted into an estimate of volume using internal software. This method was correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with the alternative length, width, depth method of assessing volume. The mean of right and left kidney volume was then adjusted for body surface area calculated from the Haycock formula (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the main outcomes specified above, a variety of anthropometric measurements was conducted during the 4.5-y follow-up, including weight (digital scale: Tanita, Chasmors) and height (stadiometer: Chasmors). Nutritional status was assessed by comparison with UK reference data (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and a cutoff of &#x0003c; &#x02212;2 Z-scores was used to define wasting and stunting based on weight-for-height and height-for-age indices, respectively. Total body composition was assessed using a foot-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analyzer (Tanita TBF-300MA, Chasmors), applying equations previously generated in this population using deuterium dilution as the reference method in children aged 4&#x02013;10 y (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Parental socioeconomic status was assessed by a continuous wealth index previously generated in this population that included data on land ownership, the construction materials of house walls, ownership of household assets, ownership of sarees or shalwer-kameez for ceremonial use, and pairs of shoes or sandals owned (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>All statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 11 (Stata Corportation); <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c; 0.05 were regarded as significant. Values in the text are mean &#x000b1; SD or median (IQR). The effects of the prenatal interventions were assessed by intention-to-treat analysis, which focused on the effect of food and micronutrient supplementation separately before assessing any interaction between the interventions. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to assess any differences in characteristics from the original trial between those recruited and those lost to follow-up. Linear regression was used to investigate the effect of the maternal interventions on offspring blood pressure and kidney function. Three stages of models were used: adjusted for interventions only (model 1), adjusted for covariates unrelated to the maternal intervention but related to blood pressure/kidney function (model 2), and as model 2 but additionally adjusted for covariates that could be associated with the maternal interventions. The analysis of the food supplementation intervention compared the 2 arms: early and usual invitation to access food supplementation. The unbalanced design of the MINIMat trial allowed for the assessment of 2 important research questions: is there an impact of MMS and is there an impact of providing a high iron dose? The analysis was conducted by creating dummy variables for the MMS and Fe60F interventions and comparing these with the Fe30F group as the reference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The linear regression models were fitted with both terms to assess their independent effects, but the coefficients are reported separately in the results. An &#x0201c;as-treated&#x0201d; analysis was conducted to assess the impact of adherence to the intervention irrespective of randomization. The reported total number of food packets consumed during pregnancy was assessed as the exposure for the food invitation intervention and the pill count obtained from the eDEM technology provided an estimate of micronutrient tablet consumption. Linear regression models were fitted adjusted for covariates relating to blood pressure and kidney function as appropriate.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Categorizing the micronutrient intervention from the MINIMat Trial for the purposes of analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">New code for analysis<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2"><sup>2</sup></xref><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Original randomization code<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><sup>1</sup></xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple micronutrients (MMS)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-iron dose (highFe)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fe30F</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fe60F</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMS</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>1</label><p>Original micronutrient arm of the intervention.

Recruitment rates were similar across the 6 supplement arms of the trial and the reasons for loss to follow-up were also similar in their distributions. The main cause of loss to follow-up was individuals who could not be located during the follow-up study. Among recruited individuals, maternal baseline characteristics remained equally distributed between the 6 intervention arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). There were minor differences in characteristics of mothers whose children were recruited into the current study and those lost to follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Children lost to follow-up were more likely to have been the first born and their mothers were on average &#x0223c;9 mo younger and had spent 6 mo longer in education.

There is evidence that invitation to access food supplements early in pregnancy was associated with a slightly lower offspring diastolic blood pressure at 4.5 y compared with the standard care in later pregnancy. In contrast, MMSs were associated with slightly higher diastolic blood pressure compared with iron and folate supplementation alone and a high- compared with low-iron supplement was associated with a higher offspring GFR. No other effects of the food or micronutrient interventions on offspring blood pressure, kidney volume, or GFR were observed and there was no interaction between the interventions on the outcomes studied.</p><p>Previous studies of protein-energy supplementation trials do not provide a direct comparison with the MINIMat intervention, partly because they lack a temporal variation in food supplementation. The protein-energy supplements provided from 20 wk of gestation to pregnant women in The Gambia were not associated with offspring blood pressure at 10&#x02013;17 y of age (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and those provided during pregnancy and early childhood in Guatemala were similarly not associated with offspring blood pressure at 20&#x02013;29 y of age (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In India, although a community-based cereal meal intervention was not associated with offspring blood pressure in adolescence, children born in intervention areas had a lower measure of global arterial stiffness (the augmentation index) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the current study, no association was observed between food packet consumption and offspring diastolic blood pressure irrespective of the treatment arm, which cautions against the overinterpretation of these findings. In addition, the relatively small effect size and the lack of an effect on systolic blood pressure may question the validity of the findings. However, these data do suggest that researchers may wish in future studies to assess the timing as well as the type of pregnancy intervention.</p><p>Multiple-micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy was associated with a marginal increase in offspring diastolic blood pressure, although the association was only strongly apparent in the fully adjusted analysis. Two other trials, both from Nepal, of multiple-micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy have published data on offspring blood pressure. In contrast to the MINIMat trial, both the Nepalese trials reported an increase in birth weight in the multiple-micronutrient arms of the trial (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The follow-up studies have shown inconsistent results, however. Vaidya et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported lower systolic blood pressure at 2.5 y of age for children born to women who had received multiple micronutrients in pregnancy. In contrast, Stewart et al. (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) found no effect of MMSs on child blood pressure at 6&#x02013;8 y, consistent with the results presented here. One interpretation of the first Nepalese trial is a detrimental effect of the high-iron dose in the comparison group (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The design of the MINIMat trial allows for this to be tested and the analysis presented here has shown no effect of high- compared with low-iron dose on offspring blood pressure in this population.</p><p>It has been suggested that a reduction in nephron number as a result of inadequate fetal nutrition represents a potential mechanism linking low birth weight and hypertension, with supportive evidence from animal models (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In humans, low birth weight has been associated with lower kidney volume (by ultrasound) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and chronic kidney disease in later life (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Few human studies have investigated the association between the maternal diet during pregnancy and offspring kidney function. In the second Nepalese trial reported above, the control group (vitamin A supplements only) had a higher risk of urinary microalbuminuria (microalbumin:creatinine ratio &#x02265;3.4 mg/mmol) compared with individuals whose mothers received folic acid or folic acid, iron, and zinc in addition to vitamin A (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here, we found weak evidence for an increased GFR in children exposed to high-iron supplementation during in utero development, which is challenging to interpret. Some authors have suggested that fewer nephrons will initially be associated with compensatory hyperfiltration (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which could be consistent with a higher GFR. In later life, these same individuals may demonstrate relatively low GFR, which is a standard marker of kidney disease (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), but further studies will be required to unravel this association and assess validity.</p><table-wrap id="tbl6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6</label><caption><p>Effect of maternal iron supplementation on offspring blood pressure and kidney function at 4.5 y in Bangladesh<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn19"><sup>1</sup></xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model 1<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model 2<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model 3<sup>4</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (%)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systolic pressure (mm Hg)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2312</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.04 (&#x02212;0.80, 0.72)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.91 (&#x02212;0.04)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2196</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.06 (&#x02212;0.71, 0.84)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.87 (&#x02212;0.04)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1969</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04 (&#x02212;0.76, 0.84)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.93 (&#x02212;0.05)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diastolic pressure (mm Hg)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2312</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.26 (&#x02212;0.39, 0.90)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.44 (&#x02212;0.02)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2196</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33 (&#x02212;0.33, 1.00)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33 (0.00)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1969</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42 (&#x02212;0.27, 1.11)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.23 (0.02)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kidney volume (cm<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn21"><sup>3</sup></xref>/m<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn20"><sup>2</sup></xref>)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1068</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.10 (&#x02212;2.40, 2.21)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.93 (&#x02212;0.09)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">968</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.54 (&#x02212;2.88, 1.80)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.65 (&#x02212;0.08)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">861</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.91 (&#x02212;3.38, 1.57)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47 (&#x02212;0.05)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GFR<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn23"><sup>5</sup></xref> [mL/(min&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;1.73 m<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn20"><sup>2</sup></xref>)]</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1224</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.47 (&#x02212;0.32, 9.26)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07 (0.19)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1222</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.05 (0.36, 9.74)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04 (0.27)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1093</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.68 (&#x02212;0.22, 9.58)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.06 (0.22)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn19"><label>1</label><p>Values are regression coefficients (&#x003b2;) showing the difference in mean blood pressure and kidney function (95% CI) for individuals born to women in the Fe60F compared to Fe30F intervention group, derived from linear regression analysis. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> refers to adjusted partial R<sup>2</sup> for all models.

Loss to follow-up is a well-recognized issue for long-term follow-up studies within this research field and these rates of loss are relatively low (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The lack of differential follow-up rates between the intervention groups and the marginal differences between recruited individuals and those lost to follow-up suggests limited selection bias for the current study. A related issue is the reduction in sample size as a consequence of participant attrition, which affects study power. In this study, the precision estimate for the effect of maternal MMS supplementation on offspring systolic blood pressure ranged from &#x02212;0.57 to 1.02 mm Hg and effects within this range cannot therefore be discounted. However, it is arguable whether effect sizes of this magnitude would be meaningful from a public health standpoint. Cost and logistic considerations resulted in the measurements of kidney volume and GFR being conducted on a subset of individuals at the 4.5-y follow-up, but the sample size remained large and the precision of effect estimates high. Although it was a limitation that only a small number of individuals had both kidney function measurements, this would not be expected to have influenced the analysis of the intervention effect; the sample size for both outcomes remained large and there is no reason to think that the intervention would have a different effect in these subgroups.</p><p>The main limitation with the original study design is that women were only randomly assigned to encouragement to access food provision rather than being provided with the food supplement itself. Some women would therefore be unlikely to access the supplement at all, although only 54 individuals reported not having had a single food packet during their pregnancy and the majority (76%) of these were in the usual food invitation arm. The intervention was designed to evaluate the existing government nutritional provision, but as a result lacked a true control arm. However, data on food packet consumption during pregnancy did demonstrate that the intervention successfully created 2 distinct groups; women in the early invitation arm accessed the service much earlier in pregnancy and consumed on average 30 more packets during pregnancy. The micronutrient intervention benefitted from being a double-blind randomized trial but again lacked a control group that could be provided with a placebo owing to the ethics of withdrawing FeFol from this antenatal population, which receives 60 mg of iron and 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g folate as standard. This intervention is further compromised by its unbalanced design; there is no multiple micronutrient arm that also contains 60 mg of iron. As a consequence, any effect of the MMS arm could be confounded by the iron treatment arm and it is not possible to look at the interaction between these different treatments. However, because only limited intervention effects have been observed, this limitation is of minor concern. A final important limitation relates to the age of study participants who may be too young for differences in CVD risk factors to emerge. It will be important to study this cohort into the future to assess any prolonged effects of the pregnancy intervention, particularly as groups of offspring become exposed to different environments as they age.</p><p>In conclusion, this is one of the first studies to include a follow-up of a combined food and micronutrient intervention in pregnancy. There is some evidence that access to food supplements early in pregnancy is associated with reduced offspring diastolic blood pressure in childhood, albeit with a relatively small effect size. Weaker evidence was also found for an impact of MMSs on increased offspring diastolic blood pressure and of high- compared with low-iron supplements on increase offspring GFR. Overall, there was limited evidence for long-lasting impacts of pregnancy supplementation on offspring blood pressure or markers of kidney function in this population.</p></sec>
