At the start and end of treatment, inflammation biomarkers (sputum and serum), lung function, and health status (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] questionnaire) were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Although a numerical decrease in differential neutrophil count was observed from baseline, SFC 250 did not significantly reduce sputum neutrophils compared with placebo, nor were there significant changes from baseline in the other biomarkers (sputum or serum), lung function, or CAT, versus placebo. Squamous epithelial cell contamination in some sputum samples rendered them unacceptable for analysis, which reduced the sample size to n=19 (SFC 250) and n=10 (placebo). However, inclusion of contaminated samples did not affect the overall trend of the outcome. Ad hoc bootstrap statistical analysis showed a 27.9% (SFC 250) and 1.3% (placebo) decrease in sputum neutrophils. Sputum IL-8 decreased by 43.2% after SFC 250 but increased by 48.3% with placebo. Responder analyses showed 42% of patients had &#x02265;20% decrease in neutrophils from baseline; and 47% of patients had a &#x02265;200 pg/mL change in sputum IL-8 following SFC 250 versus 20% after placebo; both changes are considered clinically relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides additional information about inflammation in Japanese COPD patients and is the first to study the anti-inflammatory effects of SFC 250 in this context and population. In the primary analysis, SFC 250 did not produce significant changes from baseline in sputum neutrophil levels or other sputum or serum inflammatory markers compared with placebo. Secondary ad hoc statistical analysis showed that SFC 250 reduced the number of sputum neutrophils and IL-8 compared with placebo.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>IL-8</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>serum</kwd><kwd>sputum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently ranked as the tenth highest cause of death in Japan, and its prevalence is increasing.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> COPD is underrecognized in Japan, and data suggest its prevalence is also underestimated.<xref rid="b2-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> COPD is considered a multicomponent disease, involving both pulmonary and systemic inflammation.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In Japan, and globally, the current goals of COPD management include the improvement of symptoms and quality of life as well as the prevention and treatment of exacerbations.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists, used as monotherapy, do not always meet the COPD management goals, and patients often remain symptomatic.<xref rid="b2-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> SFC, a combination of the LABA, salmeterol, and the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP), provides greater relief of COPD symptoms and is more effective than salmeterol at reducing the exacerbation rate.<xref rid="b8-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> SFC is recommended for group C and group D patients.<xref rid="b1-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In Japan, Australia, and the United States, SFC 250, containing salmeterol 50 mcg and FP 250 mcg, is approved for COPD.

As expected, SFC was well-tolerated in this population, with no COPD exacerbations experienced in the SFC 250 group.</p><p>There are a number of possible explanations for the apparent lack of anti-inflammatory effect of SFC 250 in the primary analysis of this study. Due to SEC contamination of sputum samples, the number of acceptable samples for analysis and comparison was decreased. SEC contamination was seen at all three sites, although the degree of contamination varied. SEC contamination can adversely affect the reproducibility of sputum cell differential counts, although the impact of such contamination has not been studied in a controlled manner.<xref rid="b28-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The extent of contamination can vary between subjects and between the different methods of processing samples (whole expectorate versus selected methods). In our study, however, the inclusion or exclusion of contaminated samples did not affect the overall outcome &#x02013; the primary and secondary end points were not achieved even when the contaminated samples were included in the analysis.</p><p>Studies in COPD have shown that sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and bronchial biopsies represent different lung compartments:<xref rid="b29-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> sputum mainly originates from the large, central airways; BAL originates from the smaller bronchioles and alveoli;<xref rid="b30-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> while biopsy samples can contain cells from the large or smaller airways, depending on the site chosen.<xref rid="b19-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b29-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Previous studies using SFC 500 used a combination of sputum and biopsy samples to measure anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, it is difficult to obtain IRB approval for the use of bronchial biopsies for research purposes in Japan, so sputum induction was chosen for our study. Induced sputum provides a practical method that can be used in the clinic and is less invasive for the subject than biopsy. However, the lack of biopsy data meant that we could not compare our sputum data with earlier studies, nor explore the effects in more peripheral airways. Furthermore, sputum methodology may not always be reproducible, and previous sputum data relating to inflammatory markers in COPD have been controversial.<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The conduct of sputum induction across multiple sites may have also caused further variability in the outcomes.</p><p>The available SFC 500 data vary with regard to changes in inflammatory markers and lung function.<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Compared with placebo, SFC 500 had significant anti-inflammatory effects measured in biopsy tissue in COPD patients.<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, it did not significantly reduce sputum levels of IL-8 or total cell counts,<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> BAL levels of neutrophils or eosinophils,<xref rid="b11-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or serum CRP or IL-6 but did significantly decrease serum SP-D.<xref rid="b12-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In two of the studies, lung function was significantly improved following SFC 500 compared with placebo,<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> while in the third, neither lung function nor health status were significantly improved,<xref rid="b11-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which concurs with our own observations. St&#x00103;nescu et al showed increased levels of neutrophils in sputum were correlated with a rapid decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> over a 15-year follow-up period in smokers and ex-smokers.<xref rid="b26-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The difference in percentage neutrophils between the fast and moderate decliners was 10%, while the difference between fast and slow decliners was 30%, therefore, 20% may be considered as a clinically relevant change in neutrophils. Our ad hoc responder analysis showed that almost half the subjects (42%) in the SFC 250 group reached a 20% threshold for change in differential neutrophil count compared with 10% in the placebo group, thus providing possible evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect. Similarly, sputum neutrophilia has been associated with increased levels of the chemoattractant IL-8,<xref rid="b18-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and good correlation has been seen between sputum IL-8 and neutrophils.<xref rid="b31-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> At week 12, 47% of subjects in the SFC 250 group showed a change from baseline in IL-8 of &#x02265;200 pg/mL compared with 20% following placebo, which is the threshold for IL-8 stimulation of human neutrophil chemotaxis. Therefore, 200 pg/mL may be considered a clinically relevant change.<xref rid="b27-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Our study had some limitations, in addition to the use of sputum induction and the effect of SEC contamination, which may have influenced the outcome. We did not control for the presence of potential bacterial colonization in the sputum, which may have affected the degree of neutrophilia and IL-8 concentrations. Although neutrophils play an important role in COPD, they may not be the ideal marker of anti-inflammatory effects of treatment. However, sputum neutrophils appear to be a good marker for evaluating COPD inflammation in the airways, although sputum samples can be difficult to collect and process.</p><p>A 12-week treatment period was chosen to enable comparison with other studies<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but is a relatively short duration and may have limited the possibility of showing any change in FEV<sub>1</sub> or health status, especially with SFC containing the lower dose of FP (250 mcg). Our study may not have been sufficiently powered to show differences in lung function or health status, and so analysis of these parameters was performed on a preliminary basis. Studies using the rate of decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> or reduction of exacerbations as primary end points generally require longer treatment duration as well as larger sample sizes.<xref rid="b34-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In our study, almost 50% of subjects were current smokers, but our study was not powered to explore the impact of smoking status on the outcomes. However, some data suggest that smoking status of subjects may modify the clinical effects of inhaled corticosteroid, indicating that they appear more effective in former than in current smokers.<xref rid="b10-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b35-copd-10-803" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The final numbers in our study did not permit stratification based on smoking status. Other factors, such as disease history and treatment course, may also have affected the outcome. Despite the limitations, this was the first study of its kind to evaluate the possible anti-inflammatory effects of SFC 250 in a Japanese COPD population. As a result of low subject sample numbers, further ad hoc statistical analysis suggested that SFC 250 may reduce both sputum neutrophils and IL-8 in COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of the primary PP analysis, SFC 250 did not produce significant changes from baseline in sputum neutrophil levels or other sputum or serum inflammatory markers compared with placebo, and there also was no corresponding change in lung function or health status. Secondary ad hoc statistical analysis showed that SFC 250 reduced the number of sputum neutrophils after 12 weeks, with almost 50% of patients showing a clinically relevant decrease of 20% and a decrease in levels of sputum IL-8 by a clinically relevant 200 pg/mL.</p><p>It is important to understand the underlying pathophysiology of COPD, particularly with respect to inflammation, in order to determine the utility of anti-inflammatory treatment and improve pharmacological therapy of COPD in the future. Our study has provided further information on this highly complex disease and the possible impact of treatment with SFC 250 in Japanese COPD patients. Additional work, including larger studies with longer treatment period, are now required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (NCT01607398).</p><p>The authors would like to thank the following people for their contributions: Daisuke Yoshimoto and Tomoyuki Hayamizu, Medical Affairs Respiratory, GlaxoSmithKline KK; Gerald Hagan, independent consultant; and the Investigators Katsuji Hashimoto, Director of AMC, Nishi-Umeda Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine; Yasuaki Miki, Physician, Department of Internal Medicine, Nanko Clinic; Yumiko Mizukubo, Naoko Yoshii, and Naoki Ijiri from the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, Japan; and Yoshihiro Tochino, Assistant Professor, Department of Medical Education and General Practice, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University who participated in subject recruitment; SRL Medisearch Inc., for performing the biomarker analyses; the Institute of Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers for performing the statistical analysis; and CIMIC Co, Ltd for performing the data management.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Akihiro Kobayashi and Yukio Makihara were employees of GlaxoSmithKline at the time of the study conduct, with no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.
