Ninety adults with ID aged 18-55 will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) a lifestyle physical activity group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30), 2) a structured exercise group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30), or 3) a usual care control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). Participants in both groups will receive a 12-week intervention delivered by exercise specialists in the community with disability service staff, after which intervention will continue for 6&#x000a0;months, delivered by disability service staff only. Primary outcomes are aerobic fitness, 12-hour energy expenditure, and proxy-reported everyday physical activity.

In Australia, the proportion of adults with ID who meet national guidelines for physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] is only around half that of the general community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. People with ID have a right to good health and a healthy lifestyle, yet without adequate exercise and physical activity they are more likely to experience a lower quality of life and a higher level of physical and mental ill health. Failing to address these issues places an increased burden on families and carers, as well as on disability services and health systems. Such preventable health problems can increase dependency (requiring higher disability service staffing levels), add to absenteeism from disability employment, and result in premature withdrawal from the workforce and greater health care utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The majority of adults with ID have the potential to meet the physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but people with ID need direct personal support to plan, organise, travel to and participate in physical activities. There is a ready source of such support: disability service staff who already provide daily (usually 24-hour) support to their clients. However, these staff do not usually have the skills to support physical activity and exercise of appropriate intensity and duration. Crucially, research on &#x02018;Active Support&#x02019; from staff has shown (a) that appropriate personal support strongly increases participation in functional everyday activities by adults with ID and (b) that disability staff can be trained to provide it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity is an important national policy issue in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The objective of this project is to improve the physical activity, aerobic fitness, strength and well-being of adults with ID by increasing their everyday physical activity and exercise levels in a manner that is sustainable in the long-term. This will involve comparing two approaches to disability staff support of physical activity by adults with ID: (I) a lifestyle physical activity (light-moderate intensity [LMI] lifestyle) approach and (II) a structured exercise (moderate-vigorous intensity [MVI] exercise) approach. The effectiveness of the two strategies for increasing physical activity and exercise in adults with ID will be evaluated and compared to a usual-care control group. By contrasting two different approaches to increased physical activity we will compare the short-term (3-month) and long-term (9-month) effectiveness and sustainability of both strategies. In addition, the project will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has been registered on International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN77889248).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Funding</title><p>The study is being funded by National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) Partnership Grant APP1012692, and two disability industry partners, Lorna Hodgkinson Sunshine Home, and House With No Steps.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>A three arm randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted.

Using the principles underlying active support participants in the LMI-Lifestyle group will be encouraged to engage in a total of 150&#x000a0;minutes per week of LMI physical activity. Participants will be supported for 1&#x000a0;hour (60&#x000a0;minutes) a week by the exercise specialist to engage in individually tailored LMI-Lifestyle activities that are enjoyable (e.g., X-Box Kinnect, swimming, television advertisement exercises) or serve a functional purpose (e.g., walking for transport, hanging out washing). The remaining 90&#x000a0;minutes of weekly physical activity will be supervised by disability staff, who will be encouraged to follow an activity program set out by the university exercise specialist. During the weekly session with the exercise specialist, participants will wear a multi-sensor armband, Sensewear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to assess exercise intensity and compliance. Disability service provider staff will participate in the planning, and where appropriate the activity during and beyond the 12-week intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention group 2; structured MVI-exercise</title><p>Moderate-vigorous intensity exercise classes led by the university exercise specialists will take place over 12&#x000a0;weeks. Three to six participants will be recruited for each cohort. A MVI-Exercise session will comprise 30 to 45&#x000a0;minutes of cardiovascular exercise and 15 to 20&#x000a0;minutes of muscular strength. Sessions will be conducted three times per week. Exercise intensity will be gradually increased over the 12&#x000a0;week intervention period from 40%-50% of heart rate reserve to 50%-70% of heart rate reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Exercise modes will be conducted indoors or outdoors in local community settings (partner organisation&#x02019;s facilities, parks, community gyms) using a small group approach involving activities like brisk walking, jogging and calisthenics with emphasis upon enjoyable body movements. To assess exercise intensity and compliance participants will wear a multi-sensor armband, Sensewear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], for estimation of energy expenditure, throughout the initial 12-week intervention. Participants will also wear heart rate monitors (Polar, Port Washington, NY, USA) to ensure that they are exercising in the appropriate target heart rate zone. Partner Organisation staff will participate in the exercise sessions alongside the exercise specialists and will be trained to continue these classes beyond the 12-week intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention group 3; control participants</title><p>Participants in the control group will continue with their everyday activities.

Participants will be asked to walk as fast as they can for 6&#x000a0;minutes and if required, the participant may briefly stop. The test will be performed indoors, along a flat, hard-surfaced passageway. The total distance walked will be measured and heart rate will be recorded using a heart rate monitor (Polar, Port Washington, NY, USA).

Our MVI-Exercise approach is similar to a previous study that used a 12-week gym-based intervention for people with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Assuming an effect size of d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 (equivalent to f =0.40), and using a design with three groups and three repeated measures, power calculations with alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95, and a correlation among repeated measures of 0.5 show that this would require a total sample size of 69 (i.e., 23 per group), to analyse between-group differences using repeated measures ANOVA. Our assumptions are conservative so as to avoid under-powering the study. Therefore, we will recruit 30 participants per group for a total sample of 90, which allows for 23% attrition without compromising power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Analyses</title><p>Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to compare both the intervention and control group participants on primary and secondary outcome measures, at the 3-month and 9-month assessments.
