A cluster-randomized trial was conducted with the following three study arms: 1) long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) plus standard of care environmental management (SoC-EM), 2) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with &#x003b1;-cypermethrin plus SoC-EM, and 3) SoC-EM alone. Incidence of new CL cases by passive and active case detection, sandfly abundance, and cost and cost-effectiveness was compared between study arms over 5 years. Incidence of CL and sandfly abundance were significantly lower in the IRS arm compared with SoC-EM (CL incidence rate ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15&#x02013;0.69, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 and sandfly abundance ratio = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18&#x02013;0.85, <italic>P</italic> = 0.022). Reductions in the LLIN arm of the study were not significant, possibly due to poor compliance. IRS was effective and more cost-effective for the prevention of CL in Morocco.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human infection by <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. is an important public health problem in Morocco.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Transmission of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites and the resulting disease is endemic throughout many areas of the country with three distinct parasites and disease patterns, typically divided into distinct bioclimactic zones.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) caused by <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> and zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by <italic>L. major</italic> are the most prevalent manifestations of the disease, however, the presence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) caused by <italic>L. infantum</italic> has been recognized since the 1920s.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

There is little data demonstrating the relative effect sizes of these interventions in study settings, which might be directly relevant to the Moroccan environment. Though IRS was previously used in malaria control in Morocco, it has never been national policy to use IRS or ITNs for CL control in the country.

No interventions were estimated to avert large numbers of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in base case analysis, given the nonfatal nature of CL and the relatively low disability weight associated with the disease. IRS was estimated to be a relatively more cost-effective intervention than LLINs in base case analysis, while both interventions added incremental costs above the SoC-EM approach, they were also more effective than SoC-EM. Neither LLINs nor IRS met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for being considered a cost-effective intervention in the Moroccan context (cost per DALY averted &#x02264; 3 &#x000d7; gross domestic product [GDP] per capita).</p></sec><sec id="s3c3"><title>Sensitivity analysis.</title><p>The sensitivity analysis reinforced the conclusion that IRS was a more cost-effective intervention than LLINs for CL prevention in Morocco (Details in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.14-0510/-/DC13/SD13.pdf">Supplemental Information</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.14-0510/-/DC13/SD13.pdf">Supplemental Table 5</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.14-0510/-/DC13/SD13.pdf">Supplemental Figure 1</ext-link>), but also that both interventions would not be considered cost-effective by WHO standards (cost per DALY averted &#x0003e; 3 &#x000d7; GDP per capita). In areas with higher baseline incidence, and delivered as a routine intervention rather than in the context of a community-randomized trial, both IRS and LLINs may be cost-effective interventions in the Moroccan context.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Control measures against ACL in Morocco rely both on case management and vector control. Vector control methods have historically relied mainly on EM. In addition, focal IRS with DDT or synthetic pyrethroids and distribution of LLINs has been conducted by the National Leishmaniasis Control Program in some transmission foci. This study compared the effectiveness of these vector control methods in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.</p><p>The main findings indicate that both IRS with &#x003b1;-cypermethrin at 0.30 g/m<sup>2</sup> and the use of LLINs reduced the incidence of CL, however, the reduction due to LLINs did not reach statistical significance and the protective effect size associated with IRS was much larger.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one study of IRS for CL prevention and no studies of LLIN for CL prevention have previously been conducted in Morocco.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The one study of IRS found significant reductions in CL incidence but no change in sandfly abundance compared with control villages after 2 years of spraying pyrethroid IRS, though the study was conducted with only two intervention and control locations and therefore lacked statistical power.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We are aware of only one study which compared ITN interventions to IRS interventions in areas with similar vectors to those found in Morocco. In an individual (household) block-randomized trial in an urban area (Kabul, Afghanistan), where the predominant vector is <italic>Ph. sergenti</italic>, ITNs and <italic>chadors</italic> showed the largest effects while IRS also appeared to be significantly protective.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>LLINs showed lower efficacy than IRS spraying in this trial. It is possible that this finding is due to differences in the susceptibility of sandfly vectors to the insecticides used in the trial. In the areas where this trial was conducted, <italic>Ph. sergenti</italic> is susceptible to &#x003b1;-cyhalothrin, whereas susceptibility to deltamethrin (the insecticide used on the LLINs) or &#x003b1;-cypermethrin (the insecticide used for IRS) was not tested, we expect that sandflies in the trial areas are also susceptible to both of these pyrethroid insecticides.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Reported use of LLINs in the survey conducted in the final year of the study was low, possibly because the perceived risk of CL is small. Usage rates at the cluster level were inversely related to CL incidence (though the effect was not statistically significant), therefore, it is possible that the low levels of LLIN use compromised the efficacy of the LLIN intervention.</p><p>Although the use of LLINs was associated with lower vector abundance, these differences were smaller than those associated with IRS and were not statistically significant. The entomological findings were thus consistent with the epidemiological outcomes of the trial and lend credence to the overall conclusion of protective effect due to IRS, though the lack of pre-intervention abundance measures limits the internal validity of these measures.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated ITNs against <italic>Leishmania</italic> vectors in the Old Word, namely in Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Afghanistan, as well as in South America.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Contrary to our results, all these studies have shown that pyrethroid-treated nets provide significant protection against sandfly bites and reduced the transmission of ACL. Despite the evident reduction of ACL incidence attributable to ITN use, no significant reductions in density of the local vectors were detected in the above studies suggesting that monitoring vector density is an insufficient parameter to predict any efficacy of ITNs on ACL transmission.</p><p>The costs of the two main interventions (LLINs and IRS) in the study were high compared with the deployment of these interventions in other settings and in routine use.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This finding was not surprising given that the price level in Morocco is higher than in most of sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of previous cost and cost-effectiveness studies of LLINs and IRS have been conducted. In addition, the majority of costs in this study were found to be related to the deployment and monitoring of the interventions, which is in contrast to most routine programs where the commodities associated with LLIN delivery and IRS constitute the largest share of program costs. As these interventions were delivered in the context of a community-randomized trial covering a small population, this is also an expected finding. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if the interventions were delivered as routine interventions to larger populations, the cost per unit would decrease significantly. To our knowledge, no other studies have attempted to quantify the cost-effectiveness of these two vector control interventions for the prevention of CL.</p><p>In the base scenario, neither LLINs nor IRS appeared to be cost-effective per DALY averted due to CL using WHO thresholds for CE, though IRS, despite higher costs, was shown to be significantly more cost-effective than LLINs. The incidence of CL in the study areas was low in general, and as such only a small number of total cases of CL were averted, leading to higher cost-effectiveness ratios. The use of microscopic diagnostic confirmation, which is known to have low sensitivity may bias our incidence estimates downward,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> but there is no reason to assume that this differed between study arms. Sensitivity analysis indicates that in areas of significantly higher CL incidence, the interventions could become cost-effective by WHO standards. In addition, there is considerable debate about the appropriate disability weighting and duration that should be applied to CL.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Although CL is generally not a fatal disease, there are potential severe long-term outcomes that may arise even after an acute case has spontaneously resolved. Furthermore, after resolution of acute cases, permanent scarring may remain, which can be severely stigmatizing and adversely affect individuals' social standing, marriageability, and long-term earning potential. All of these factors could indicate that the appropriate disability weighting and duration are underestimated in our analysis leading to overly pessimistic cost-effectiveness calculations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>IRS with &#x003b1;-cypermethrin and LLIN distribution both reduced the incidence of CL in Morocco. IRS was highly effective, whereas the evidence for LLIN effect was weak and not statistically significant. LLIN efficacy may have been reduced by low usage rates resulting from the low disease burden. Because of the high costs of the interventions in the study areas and the relatively small disease burden, IRS is recommended to be targeted to areas of relatively high CL incidence in Morocco.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="external-data" id="SD13"><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/content/94/3/679/suppl/DC13">Supplemental Datas.</ext-link></p><media mimetype="application/pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="SD13.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e675" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This project was supported financially by the United Nations Environment Programme/Global Environment Facility project (GEF): Demonstration of Sustainable Alternatives to DDT and Strengthening of National Vector Control Capabilities in Middle East and North Africa (GEF ID:2546).
