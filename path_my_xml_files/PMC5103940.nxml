A lack of training during undergraduate medical education has been identified as a potential cause. This prospective intervention study evaluated a novel teaching module for medical students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>As part of a 6-week cardiovascular course, 125 fourth-year undergraduate medical students received a multimodal and interactive teaching module on smoking cessation, including online learning material, lectures, seminars, and practical skills training. Short- and medium-term effects on knowledge, skills, attitudes, and self-reported practice were measured using written examinations and an objective structured clinical examination at the end of the module and 6 months later. Results were compared to data obtained from a historical control cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 70) unexposed to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At the 6-month follow-up, scores in the knowledge test were significantly higher in the intervention than the control group (61.1% vs. 51.7%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). A similar pattern was observed in the objective structured clinical examination (71.5% vs. 60.5%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). More students in the intervention than control group agreed that smoking was a chronic disease (83.1% vs. 68.1%; <italic>p</italic> = .045). The control group was more likely to report recording smoking status (<italic>p</italic> = .018), but no group difference was detected regarding the report of advising to quit (<italic>p</italic> = .154).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A novel teaching module for undergraduate medical students produced a sustained learning outcome in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes but not self-reported practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Studies across the world have identified considerable knowledge gaps and deficits in practical training with regard to smoking cessation counseling in undergraduate medical students. This paper describes a teaching intervention informed by current recommendations for the design of educational activities aimed at enabling medical students to deliver adequate behavior change counseling. The teaching module was tailored to the needs of a specific healthcare system. Given its effectiveness as demonstrated in this prospective study, a rollout of this intervention in medical schools might have the potential to substantially improve medical students&#x02019; knowledge, skills, and attitudes in relation to smoking cessation counseling.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Smoking accounts for 20%&#x02013;30% of total cardiovascular mortality,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and smoking cessation is among the most effective interventions following a myocardial infarction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> A recent study involving biochemical validation of smoking status showed that continuous abstinence is associated with an up to 80% reduction in mortality in this patient group.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite hospitalization for cardiovascular disease being a teachable moment for some patients,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> successful smoking cessation requires intensive support: According to a Cochrane analysis, interventions for patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease need to start during inpatient treatment and must be continued for at least 1 month in order to be effective.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thus, initial counseling during hospitalization is crucial to achieving long-term abstinence, and current guidelines specifically recommend starting counseling early after hospitalization for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, findings from Germany suggest that physicians often fail to adhere to these guidelines,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and even following the implementation of standard operating procedures for the care of smokers hospitalized with cardiovascular disease, the proportion of patients who recalled having received any counseling was well below 50%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Similarly, suboptimal rates of smoking status documentation and counseling activity have been reported for general practice across Europe.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">A lack of training has been suggested as a major barrier preventing physicians from supporting smokers willing to quit.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Ideally, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and effective stop smoking medications as well as practical counseling skills should be acquired during undergraduate medical education. Studies from various countries suggest that these issues are not adequately covered in many undergraduate curricula.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;17</xref></sup> A nationwide survey of German medical students with approximately 20 000 participants revealed that even in the final year, the proportion of students feeling well prepared to counsel smokers willing to quit was below 10%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">A number of teaching interventions aimed at improving knowledge and skills with regard to smoking cessation among medical students have been developed, but most of these were implemented and evaluated outside Europe.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Even across Europe, educational needs differ with regard to the type of support available to patients: While physician counseling can be kept to a minimum in countries operating a network of smoking cessation services, more intense counseling may be needed in countries lacking such a network. As a consequence, teaching interventions should be tailored to the specific needs of the targeted student population.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a short module on tobacco and smoking cessation for undergraduate medical education in Germany. We hypothesized that, compared to students receiving standard didactic teaching, students participating in the novel module would retain more knowledge and practical skills over a period of 6 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Design of the Teaching Intervention</title><p>Undergraduate medical education at G&#x000f6;ttingen University Medical Centre consists of a 2-year preclinical phase and a 3-year clinical phase, followed by 1 year of elective placements before graduation. The new module was designed to be included in a 6-week course on cardiovascular and respiratory disease at the beginning of the second year of the clinical phase. Development of the module was guided by the six-step approach suggested by Kern et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Based on the needs identified in the German medical student survey,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> a total of 20 specific learning objectives were defined, 13 of which referred to knowledge while 6 referred to practical skills and one to attitudes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Four teaching formats aligned to these learning objectives were identified:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Podcast: A recording of a 60-min lecture on epidemiology (including smoking prevalence), the mechanisms of nicotine addiction, withdrawal symptoms, the basic principles of counseling, first-line medication, and potential benefits and risks of electronic cigarettes was made available to students on an online repository.

Student performance was rated on a checklist aligned to the 5A with a maximum score of 50 raw points available.

Compared to the control group, retention of knowledge and skills was higher in the intervention group by a large effect size. However, there was no evidence of improved self-reported practice in the intervention group compared with the control. The intervention was feasible, short, and aligned to the needs of the German healthcare system.</p><p content-type="indent">No significant improvement was observed for some items in the knowledge test, and given that initial knowledge was favorable even before the teaching intervention, efforts could be shifted toward items with moderate medium-term retention despite their relevance for clinical practice (eg, adverse effects of medication, potential risks and benefits of electronic cigarettes). This might be achieved by pitching the cases used in practical skills training sessions to these needs. For example, scenarios could include smokers who are currently trying to quit and are experiencing medication side effects. Also, feedback instructions for session facilitators could put more emphasis on those items for which a suboptimal learning outcome was observed.</p><p content-type="indent">Retention of practical skills as measured in the OSCE was generally favorable. It has been shown that patient satisfaction with primary care is higher the more of the 5A are covered during a consultation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> A more recent case&#x02013;control study found that delivery of &#x0201c;assist&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;arrange&#x0201d; significantly increased the odds of quitting within 6 months.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Brief advice is associated with an increase of quit attempts even in patients not willing to quit.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Thus, our finding of low initial coverage and low retention of skills related to the second A (&#x0201c;advise&#x0201d;) points to a need to further improve the teaching intervention with a specific focus on this aspect. This is particularly relevant for patients with cardiovascular disease as the presenting complaint may serve as an ideal peg on which to hang counseling activities. Given the association between smoking and respiratory and malignant disease,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> the implications of our study extend to this patient group too.</p><sec id="s12"><title>Comparison With Earlier Studies</title><p>A number of teaching interventions on tobacco-induced diseases and approaches to smoking cessation have been implemented and evaluated,<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and the heterogeneity of studies (including outcome measures) precludes direct comparisons. In addition, most of these trials were performed in the United States. Given the difference between healthcare systems, these approaches cannot be readily transferred to European countries. The curriculum described here was tailored to the German healthcare system in which cessation medication is not covered by health insurers and there is no national network of stop smoking services.</p><p content-type="indent">A recent systematic review of behavior change counseling curricula<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> that also featured 67 studies on smoking cessation concluded that, in order to be effective, teaching interventions should be based on existing frameworks (eg, the 5A) and learners should be offered feedback during practical skills training. Successful curricula also employed diverse activating teaching methods. The novel module described here used innovative methods including the flipped classroom approach where student learning is stimulated with preparatory material, thereby freeing up lecture time for interaction and discussion rather than knowledge transfer.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study was based on current recommendations for the design of teaching interventions<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; and according to Kirkpatrick&#x02019;s hierarchy of outcome levels,<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> the exams and questionnaires used in this study covered the modification of knowledge and skills (level 2b) and behavioral change itself (level 3). In addition, we used a prospective design and included a (historical) control cohort. Assessment methods were aligned to learning objectives, and participation in the intervention was mandatory for all students enrolled in the cardiovascular module. Interpretation of our findings is limited by the monocentric design of our study, the fact that the teaching module was tailored to the needs of one national healthcare system and the considerable drop-out observed at T3.</p><p content-type="indent">The size of the longitudinal samples used to assess changes in knowledge (<italic>n</italic> = 60 students) and skills (<italic>n</italic> = 95 students) within the intervention group was acceptable, and we did not find significant differences regarding smoking prevalence, sex, and age between students providing data and students not providing data for any of the four data collection points (data not shown). Since baseline data in the control group were not collected at T1 but at T3, we cannot comment on potential group differences at baseline (ie, start of term 7). However, the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> do not indicate any significant between-group differences at T3.</p><p content-type="indent">Total learning time was unequal in the two groups (control: 45-min lecture; intervention: podcast, lecture, seminar, small-group teaching, and supplemental video material). Increased exposure to the material to be learnt may by itself increase learning outcome. In addition, current research on the impact of repeated testing on long-term retention<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> suggests that the additional testing that occurred in the intervention group may have further increased learning outcome in the intervention group. We are unable to differentiate whether the improvement in outcomes occurred due to these specific interventions themselves or additional exposure time in the intervention group. In order to achieve a similar effect in other student populations, the teaching module (including repeated formative testing) should be implemented in its entirety. Finally, we did not measure patient effects.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Implications for Future Research</title><p>Future studies should assess whether students participating in the novel teaching module deliver more and more effective counseling to their patients. Given the necessity to keep costs for educational activities at a reasonable level, a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the investment in time and resources for teaching with the potential benefit for patients (measured as life-years saved) would be helpful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The novel teaching module had significant and meaningful effects on medium retention of student knowledge, attitudes, and skills.
