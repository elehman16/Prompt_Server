The primary outcome is the incidence (attack rate) of meningitis during the epidemic. Villages will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three different arms: standard care, household-level prophylaxis, or village-wide prophylaxis. After study launch, when a case of meningococcal meningitis is identified in an HZ, the first reported case from a village will trigger the inclusion and randomization of the village. Household-level prophylaxis with single-dose ciprofloxacin will be offered in the home to all household members within 24&#x000a0;hours of the notification of the case, and village-wide distributions will occur within 72&#x000a0;hours of the notification of the case. The sample size necessary to detect differences between each of the two intervention arms and the standard care arm will be set after 4&#x000a0;weeks of data collection, in order to quantify multiple variables that could be particular to a given area. The primary analysis will compare attack rates at the end of the epidemic in each of the three arms. A nested sub-study will assess the effects of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis on the prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae. A total of 200 participants in the standard care arm and 200 in the village-wide prophylaxis arm will provide stool samples at days 0, 7, and 28 following their village&#x02019;s inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">An innovative trial is proposed for implementation during an epidemic that will assess the impact of a novel strategy for meningitis outbreak response.

Historically, the largest epidemics of meningococcal meningitis in the meningitis belt were caused by <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup A (NmA). The introduction of a highly effective conjugate vaccine against NmA (MenAfriVac) in 2010 has had a major impact on the incidence of all-cause meningitis in the African meningitis belt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], dramatic effects on the incidence of NmA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and has virtually eliminated its nasopharyngeal carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In the relative calm after the introduction of MenAfriVac, small-scale epidemics caused by a novel strain of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> serogroup C (NmC) were seen in northwest Nigeria in 2013 and 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These two outbreaks were followed by a much larger epidemic in 2015 in both Nigeria (&#x0003e;6000 cases reported) and Niger (&#x0003e;9000 cases reported) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The response to the 2015 epidemic was complicated by the scarcity of vaccines against NmC. This limited availability may continue for several years, during which time the risk of repeated NmC epidemics is expected to be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Prevention of meningococcal meningitis</title><p id="Par15">Two main strategies exist for meningitis prevention: mass vaccination (either in a preventive manner such as the roll-out of MenAfriVac, or in reactive campaigns during epidemics) and antibiotic prophylaxis. Recommendations for the use of these two strategies vary greatly depending on context.</p><p id="Par16">In the African meningitis belt, the emphasis has historically been on reactive mass vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, because these campaigns can be difficult to organize, and because epidemics due to NmA were often explosive and short-lived, the impact of such campaigns has been called into question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Shortening the delay between epidemic declaration and vaccination could potentially have an important impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but logistical and operational hurdles are difficult to overcome in many contexts.</p><p id="Par17">On the other hand, antibiotic chemoprophylaxis was implemented in the pre-vaccine era in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is commonly used among household contacts of cases during outbreaks in western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but it is not recommended as part of the usual response to meningitis outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This recommendation has been made based on expert opinion that implementing prophylaxis would divert efforts from case management and reactive vaccination campaigns. Nonetheless, data from the 2015 epidemic in Niger suggested that attack rates for household contacts were approximately 20 times higher than that of the general community, suggesting that this group could be an important target for prevention activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, in the same epidemic, 86% of households reported only one case, which could mean that the public health impact of targeting only household contacts could be limited. A recent meta-analysis of four small studies showed a substantial reduction in subsequent cases of meningitis in households receiving chemoprophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Three antibiotic regimens have been considered as a prophylaxis in other settings: single-dose oral ciprofloxacin, single-dose injectable ceftriaxone, and a 2-day, four-dose course of oral rifampicin. The logistical problems inherent with using an injectable drug like ceftriaxone on a large scale and the unavailability of rifampicin as a single drug in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis make ciprofloxacin the best choice for potential prophylactic use in meningococcal meningitis outbreaks in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study rationale</title><p id="Par18">Because of the threat from NmC and the relative scarcity of NmC-containing vaccine for the foreseeable future, an expert group convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a clinical trial to document the effectiveness of the use of ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis as an epidemic response in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given that one concern about the widespread use of ciprofloxacin would be the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria (particularly in the gastrointestinal tract), we will carry out a parallel sub-study to assess the community-wide prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae over time.</p><p id="Par19">We have designed a cluster-randomized trial in response to this call. The proposed trial surpasses the original recommendation of household-level chemoprophylaxis by adding an additional evaluation of village-level chemoprophylaxis, which may be easier to implement and more effective in an epidemic context. Cluster-randomized trials of preventive interventions for both infectious and non-infectious diseases have been implemented in many different African settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We have also designed a sub-study to respond to one of the caveats to this call for a trial, which will investigate the effect of ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis on the selection of antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial aims and objectives</title><p id="Par20">The study is designed as a cluster-randomized trial with three parallel arms in the setting of a future meningitis epidemic. The primary objective is to compare the incidence of meningitis among villages receiving standard care, household single-dose ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, and village-wide single-dose ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. Secondary objectives include comparing the incidence of meningitis between villages in the three arms by sex and age.</p><p id="Par21">A schedule of trial interventions, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) figure, is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and a populated SPIRIT checklist is available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SPIRIT figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2028_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting and launch criteria</title><p id="Par22">The study will be implemented in a Health District (HD) experiencing a meningitis outbreak. In order to launch the study protocol, at least two Health Zones (HZs) of the HD will have met the weekly meningitis epidemic threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All villages in HZs included in the study will be eligible for inclusion. A village will be randomized to a study arm and receive its intervention once the first case has been reported from that village after the study has opened in an HZ. On inclusion in the study, a dedicated study nurse and at least two dedicated community health agents who have been trained in study procedures and case definitions will be stationed in each HZ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Selection of villages and randomization procedures</title><p id="Par23">Because it is impossible to predict which villages will notify cases in advance of an epidemic, the randomization list will not be prepared in advance, so as to ensure a balanced randomization. Villages will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard care, household prophylaxis or community-wide prophylaxis.</p><p id="Par24">Once an HZ has met inclusion criteria, a set of sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes will be prepared, each containing the name of an intervention arm. When the first case presents from a village, study staff in the Health Center (HC) will telephone a central randomizer, who will be otherwise independent of the study functioning.</p><p id="Par25">The central randomizer will keep a master list of names of villages in each HZ and their study assignments. A reference list of village names and study assignments will be updated in each HC as villages are included. When a case presents, study staff based in the HC will verify whether the case-patient&#x02019;s village of origin has already been randomized. This information will in turn be double-checked against the central-level randomization list.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study interventions</title><p id="Par26">In the standard care arm, after the notification of the first case from a village, a study nurse will visit the village and lead an informational session focusing on the signs and symptoms of meningitis, as well as the urgency of presenting to the nearest HC&#x000a0;if any of those symptoms occur.</p><p id="Par27">In the household-level prophylaxis arm, each time a case is notified, a study nurse will visit the case&#x02019;s household within 24&#x000a0;hours. A household is defined as a group of people living in the same building or group of adjacent buildings and under the authority of a single head of household. In the case of polygamy, all wives (and their children) of a male head of household will be considered to be members of a single household, provided that they live in the same building or group of adjacent buildings. In the case of multiple heads of household living in one compound of houses, only persons living under the authority of the head of household of the declared meningitis case will be considered a household member and therefore invited to take ciprofloxacin. The nurse will offer ciprofloxacin to all persons currently living in the household and present at the time of the visit, and supervise intake if they accept. (Household members who have accompanied the notified patient will be offered ciprofloxacin at the HC.) Return visits will be arranged for absent household members. In villages randomized to this arm, prophylaxis of a reported case-patient&#x02019;s household will occur with each subsequent case notified from that village.</p><p id="Par28">In the community-wide prophylaxis arm, after notification of the first case, a study nurse will visit the village within 24&#x000a0;hours and meet with community leaders. During this visit, a community-wide distribution of ciprofloxacin will be arranged within 72&#x000a0;hours of the initial case presentation at the HC. These distributions will be organized with local authorities, and they will take place after a series of community meetings explaining the study and the distribution to villagers. In this arm, distribution of ciprofloxacin will occur only once, after the first notified case-patient in a village.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ciprofloxacin and its administration</title><p id="Par29">A single dose of oral ciprofloxacin will be administered using age-based dosing (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

If major events that could affect the course of the epidemic occur (early rains, a vaccination campaign, etc.), a binary variable (before/after the event) will be added to the data and controlled for using a cluster-level regression model.</p><p id="Par49">The analysis of the resistance sub-study will be done on the basis of the per-protocol population for whom all three stool samples are available. The primary sub-study outcome (change in community-wide prevalence of carriers of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae) will be compared using the method described by Liu and Wu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Individual-level acquisition rates at 7 and 28&#x000a0;days following the initial sample will also be calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the binomial distribution. Acquisition will be defined as the presence of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae at day 7 or day 28 in a participant who did not have ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae at the time of baseline sample collection. A Fisher exact test will be used to compare proportion of acquisition between study interventions. All tests will be two-sided with a significance threshold of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05.Due to the uncertainty of several parameters used in the sample size calculation, we plan to recruit for four weeks and perform a sample size re-estimation based on the estimated value of <italic>p</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, the attack rate in the controls, from this sub-sample. For this, we follow the method of Lake et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We make two assumptions in doing this: that epidemics in individual villages last only a short time, meaning the <italic>p</italic>
<sub>0</sub> estimated 4&#x02013;6 weeks after recruitment of a village will be very close to <italic>p</italic>
<sub>0</sub> for that village at the end of the study; and that the attack rate in each village will remain constant during the whole course of the epidemic, i.e., that villages affected early in the epidemic do not have systematically bigger or smaller epidemics than villages affected later in the epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Safety reporting</title><p id="Par50">Passive surveillance for serious adverse events (SAEs) will be conducted from the start of the study through 28&#x000a0;days following the last dose of ciprofloxacin administered, and be carried out by study staff in HCs.</p><p id="Par51">An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose of ciprofloxacin received, results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or any medically important event/reaction that may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Informed consent and other ethical considerations</title><p id="Par52">Procedures for obtaining informed consent have been developed in accordance with the Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Gatekeepers have been defined as the health care professional in charge of the HC and village chiefs and their deputies. Village chiefs will be asked to provide written permission for the randomization of their village. It will not be possible to obtain individual-level informed consent for participation, as each arm will likely include several thousand individuals during an emergency. We have met established criteria for the waiver of individual consent in a cluster-randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nonetheless, in villages receiving household chemoprophylaxis, the study nurse will present the risks and benefits of taking ciprofloxacin to household members, and it will be administered only to those who are willing. In the village-wide prophylaxis arm, a series of community meetings will be held in advance of the mass distribution, during which the study and its risks and benefits will be presented and questions may be answered. Those persons who present to the ciprofloxacin distribution site will be considered to have been duly informed of the risks and benefits of taking ciprofloxacin and the voluntary nature of their participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial organization and administration</title><p id="Par53">The trial was developed by Epicentre with the support of M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res. The primary trial sponsor is Epicentre, who will hold the data and conduct all analyses. The primary sponsor will independently monitor study execution at field sites.

Limited supplies of vaccine against NmC, combined with limitations inherent to organizing mass vaccinations (particularly regarding their timing), have led to a recommendation to assess the use of chemoprophylaxis among household members as an alternative epidemic response.</p><p id="Par57">The proposed trial responds to this call, and goes one step further by adding a third arm in which chemoprophylaxis would happen at a village level following the notification of the village&#x02019;s first case. This addition responds to on-the-field realities in many parts of the meningitis belt, where it may be politically difficult to treat only one household in a small village when other villagers would also be at risk. Also, despite the higher risk for household members, most households will still report only one case during an epidemic, so this community-wide strategy may have a greater impact on overall meningitis incidence.</p><p id="Par58">On the other hand, given the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, even if this trial were to show overwhelmingly positive results, it would be impossible to recommend chemoprophylaxis as a routine epidemic response without having evidence on the possible effect of mass distributions of ciprofloxacin on the prevalence of resistant pathogens. We believe that by carrying out the sub-study during the epidemic we will provide the most realistic evidence on which to base potential decision making.</p><p id="Par59">The evidence gained in this trial will provide important information about a subject that is very poorly described in the literature, and while we hope that it would never need to be implemented, we are ready to do so.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par60">All resources, materials, and authorizations necessary for the trial are in place in Niger, and surveillance is ongoing to detect eligible districts during upcoming meningitis epidemics. We are currently considering submitting the protocol in other meningitis belt countries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
