We evaluated simultaneous vascular and metabolic responses to pravastatin and valsartan therapy, alone or in combination, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Forty-eight hypercholesterolemic patients (23 had metabolic syndrome) were given pravastatin 40 mg and placebo, pravastatin 40 mg and valsartan 160 mg, or valsartan 160 mg and placebo daily during each 2-month treatment period in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three treatment arms and two washout periods (each 2 months). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and C-reactive protein improved to a greater extent with combined therapy compared with either monotherapy. Importantly, we also observed simultaneous improvement in metabolic phenotypes, with all three treatments causing increased plasma adiponectin levels, reduced fasting insulin levels, and increased insulin sensitivity relative to baseline measurements. For the first time in a statin combination trial, pravastatin combined with valsartan therapy increased plasma adiponectin, lowered fasting insulin levels, and improved insulin sensitivity in an additive manner when compared with monotherapy alone. In contrast to other statins, hydrophilic pavastatin may be combined with other drugs to safely reach lipid target levels while simultaneously improving the metabolic and cardiovascular phenotype of patients at high risk.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are major public health problems that are frequently treated with statins and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, respectively. Although the mechanisms of action for these two classes of drugs differ, both classes have beneficial effects on the vasculature by reducing LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are frequently associated with insulin resistance and disorders of metabolic homeostasis such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular diseases may contribute to insulin resistance and the pathophysiology of diabetes and its vascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, it has recently been recognized that statin therapy, one of the mainstays of treatment for hypercholesterolemia that reduces coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, may have adverse consequences for glucose homeostasis, such as increased risk for diabetes and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This is particularly problematic from a therapeutic standpoint, since the presence of diabetes and insulin resistance increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and cancer mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Indeed, simvastatin and atorvastatin worsened insulin sensitivity by decreasing adiponectin levels despite improvement in endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, we did not observe additive metabolic improvement with combination therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients. Since pravastatin may differ from other statins in that it is nonlipophilic and has beneficial effects on metabolic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), we reasoned that a combination trial of pravastatin plus valsartan may cause simultaneous additive benefit to both endothelial function and metabolic phenotypes that are greater than those observed with either pravastatin or valsartan therapy alone in hypercholesterolemic patients.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study population and design.</title><p>Fifty-one hypercholesterolemic patients (LDL cholesterol levels &#x02265;130 mg/dL) participated in this study. We excluded patients with overt liver disease, chronic renal failure, uncontrolled diabetes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;9% or 75 mmol/mol), severe hypertension, or alcohol abuse. A research nurse counted pills at the end of treatment to monitor compliance. In order to minimize acute side effects to valsartan, study medication was titrated from 80 to 160 mg upwards over a 2-week period. Two patients were hypotensive, and the other one suffered from dry cough. Thus, data from a total of 48 patients were analyzed. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments: pravastatin 40 mg and placebo, pravastatin 40 mg and valsartan 160 mg, or valsartan 160 mg and placebo daily during 2 months. This study design was randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, with three treatment arms (each 2 months), and crossover with two washout periods (each 2 months). Allocation concealment was achieved by using envelopes with the collaboration of a statistician. Twenty-three patients among 48 had metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

Comparable beneficial effects on both lipids and blood pressure were observed with combination therapy. We reasoned that distinct biological actions of pravastatin and valsartan therapies on lipoproteins and the angiotensin system may improve endothelium-dependent vascular function by different mechanisms. Indeed, while monotherapy with pravastatin or valsartan improved endothelial function and inflammatory markers (assessed by FMD and hsCRP levels), combined therapy had additional significant beneficial effects on these parameters over those seen with monotherapy for either drug.</p><p>In all of our previous intervention studies combining simvastatin or atorvastatin with losartan, ramipril or fenofibrate, we observed beneficial additive effects on endothelial function but not on metabolic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We reasoned that these results may be explained by direct adverse metabolic consequences of these statins that masked the beneficial metabolic effects expected from improved endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Indeed, in head-to-head comparisons of simvastatin or rosuvastatin with pravastatin at equal lipid-lowering doses, we observed effects of simvastatin and rosuvastatin to worsen insulin resistance and related metabolic parameters, while pravastatin had beneficial metabolic actions to lower fasting insulin levels, increase adiponectin levels, and improve insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, therapy with high-dose atorvastatin causes glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Our small clinical intervention studies are consistent with larger multicenter outcome studies that suggest most statins, except for pravastatin, cause an increase in the incidence of new onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This has recently led to the Food and Drug Administration requiring a label warning for statins regarding the increased risk of diabetes. Thus, we reasoned that combination therapy of pravastatin with valsartan would result in simultaneous additive beneficial effects on both cardiovascular and metabolic parameters that was lacking in our previous statin combination intervention studies.</p><p>Recent large-scale clinical studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that some statins, particularly at high dose, increase the rate of new-onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Pravastatin would not suffer from this potential downside. Pravastatin retarded the progression of glucose intolerance in diabetes model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Pravastatin enhances adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and causes an increase in adiponectin mRNA and plasma adiponectin levels with enhanced insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Indeed, pravastatin significantly increases plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity in hypercholesterolemic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we observed correlations between percent changes in adiponectin levels and percent changes in QUICKI and inverse correlations between percent changes in adiponectin levels and percent changes in insulin levels following each therapy. We also observed significant correlations between improvement in FMD and changes in QUICKI and insulin levels following combined therapy. We observed similar results in a subgroup of 23 patients with the metabolic syndrome. Thus, our study may have the same implication for the treatment of patients with the metabolic syndrome.</p><p>One caveat in the use of pravastatin for lipid treatment is that it has weaker lipid-lowering effects than other lipophilic statins. Thus, other statins tend to save lives even in diabetic populations. However, one wonders whether even more lives might be saved if lipid targets could be reached without causing diabetes or even diminishing diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time that a combination trial with a statin (pravastatin) and valsartan simultaneously improved endothelial function and insulin sensitivity to a greater extent than monotherapy in hypercholesterolemic patients. This may be due to combined effects of the respective monotherapy to improve lipid profile, blood pressure, endothelial function, adiponectin levels, and insulin sensitivity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
