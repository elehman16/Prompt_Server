Adolescents in England are among the heaviest drinkers in Europe. Recently, the proportion of adolescents who drink alcohol has fallen, although consumption among those who do drink has actually increased. This trial seeks to investigate how effective and efficient an alcohol brief intervention is with 11&#x02013;15&#x02005;years olds to encourage lower alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is an individually randomised two-armed trial incorporating a control arm of usual school-based practice and a leaflet on a healthy lifestyle (excl. alcohol), and an intervention arm that combines usual practice with a 30&#x02005;min brief intervention delivered by school learning mentors and a leaflet on alcohol. At least 30 schools will be recruited from four regions in England (North East, North West, London, Kent and Medway) to follow-up 235 per arm. The primary outcome is total alcohol consumed in the last 28&#x02005;days, using the 28&#x02005;day Timeline Follow Back questionnaire measured at the 12-month follow-up. The analysis of the intervention will consider effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. A qualitative study will explore, via 1:1 in-depth interviews with (n=80) parents, young people and school staff, intervention experience, intervention fidelity and acceptability issues, using thematic narrative synthesis to report qualitative data.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by Teesside University.

Young people will be individually randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms. A statistician not otherwise involved with the study will produce a computer-generated allocation list to ensure allocation concealment. All efforts will be made to conceal allocation to young people, school staff (except LM delivering the sessions) and research staff, but we are unable to guarantee that young adults will not discuss their allocation with each other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safeguarding</title><p>Should issues arise that concern learning mentors or research staff (eg, alcohol and mental health issues), confidentiality will be broken and the necessary support provided to the young person. Safeguarding issues will be recorded in the trial database. Confidentiality will not be broken otherwise, and school staff will be informed through training that they must work to the same rules as doctors and nurses, meaning that confidentiality can only be broken without consent in exceptional (safeguarding) circumstances. Research/trial staff will provide assistance and support on this issue throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment, assent and screening</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>In each of the four geographical sites, initially school performance league tables<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> will be reviewed and schools from the top, middle and bottom of the league table will be contacted. Snowball sampling will allow contact with potential schools via relationships with recruited schools, although may bias the sample and reduce generalisability of results. That said, efforts will be made to recruit a cross-section of schools, including academy schools, schools in deprived areas and religious schools. Gatekeepers and key personnel (eg, School Board of Governors; County Council contacts) will be approached to suggest&#x02014;and create an initial contact&#x02014;with potential schools.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Option to opt-out of screening (assent)</title><p>In advance of screening, all parents/caregivers (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;parents&#x02019;) will be informed by letter, sent by the school, that young people will be screened as part of the study within their child's school. Parents will have the choice to opt their child out of the study by completing an opt-out form and sending this (in the freepost envelope provided) to the coordinating research centre at Teesside University. Those young people whose parents have opted them out of the study will not complete the questionnaire. If the opt-out is received after the questionnaire is completed, the questionnaire will be removed from the trial. Additionally, where possible, young people who have been opted-out will not be in the classroom at the time the questionnaire takes place. Obtaining assent to take part in this manner is a method widely used in various national youth questionnaires of alcohol consumption and other health behaviours.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Screening for the trial</title><p>A video-clip will be played to the young people opted into the study, in each school, to give instructions on completing the questionnaires (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBm3VZVtx0&#x00026;feature=em-upload_owner">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBm3VZVtx0&#x00026;feature=em-upload_owner</ext-link>). This video-clip will only provide guidance on the process of questionnaire completion and not on the content. Young people will be asked to voluntarily leave their name and class on the questionnaire. Young people will have the option to: (a) not complete the questionnaire (indicative of lack of assent to screening from the young person); (b) complete the questionnaire anonymously; and (c) complete the questionnaire adding their name and class. Each young person will place their completed questionnaire in an envelope and then return it to the teacher. Teachers will not open these envelopes. Individual responses will not be shared with the class teacher or learning mentor. The Research Coordinator will collect the sealed envelopes from the school. Those young people who have screened positively on the A-SAQ (see below) and have left their name will be eligible for the trial. Completed baseline questionnaires by trial participants will be used for the baseline measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Baseline data collection</title><p>The study envelope will contain a series of questionnaires, including the study screening questionnaire (part of the A-SAQ): &#x02018;In the last 12&#x02005;months how often have you drunk more than 3 units of alcohol?&#x02019; with the response options of &#x02018;Never&#x02019;; &#x02018;less than 4 times&#x02019;; &#x02018;4 or more times but not every month&#x02019;; &#x02018;at least once a month but not every week&#x02019;; &#x02018;every week but not every day&#x02019;; &#x02018;every day&#x02019;. Scoring &#x02018;4 or more times&#x02019;, or more frequently, indicates a positive screen and eligibility for the trial. This score was shown in our pilot feasibility trial to be a methodologically robust approach to identifying the adolescent population who may benefit from an intervention.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The A-SAQ will be embedded within a larger questionnaire with items addressing a number of health and lifestyle topics (described above).</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Invitation to meet with learning mentors</title><p>Completed baseline questionnaires will be enclosed in a sealed envelope and returned to the individual universities coordinating each study site. The A-SAQ will be scored and a list of ID numbers and names of those who score positive will be sent to a researcher at Teesside University. After learning mentor training (convened by study site coordinators), learning mentors will be given case packs for each eligible young person. Learning mentors will invite young people who scored positive on A-SAQ on the baseline questionnaire to a meeting with them in their office, where they will open the case pack. In the case pack there will be an information leaflet, a case diary, assent forms and a sealed envelope that contains the randomised condition (intervention or control). Young people will be informed that participation is voluntary and will be given the information leaflet to read before signing the assent form. The assent form also asks for the first part of the young person's postcode. The postcode information will be used to enable a stratified sample of young people to be invited to take part in the qualitative study. Once a young person has assented, the second envelope will be opened which will state whether the participant has been randomised to intervention or control. The learning mentor will then deliver the brief intervention or give the participant the control leaflet (in the same meeting). The completed case packs will be sealed and returned to coordinating sites, then couriered to Teesside University. At all times, only the randomisation statistician (AB), two researchers (JB, LA), and individual learning mentors who meet with the young people will know of the randomisation allocations before the trial ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>12-Month follow-up</title><p>Follow-up will occur 12&#x02005;months post intervention. All young people who are randomised into the trial will be invited to meet with the Research Coordinator (in school) where they will be asked to complete the same questionnaires used at baseline. The researcher will be blinded to the condition the young person was allocated to. The TLFB (including the primary outcome measure of total alcohol consumption) will also be completed face-to-face in schools with the researcher in order to limit bias in the results. All trial participants will be given an admit-one cinema voucher, to compensate them for their time involved in the study.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Trial participants' baseline and follow-up questionnaires will be linked with a unique ID (the screening number). All participants will be asked by the researcher at follow-up whether they are willing to be contacted for an in-depth interview by a researcher who may be the same individual or another researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s2f4"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>It is important to ensure learning mentors deliver the intervention in accordance with the intervention manual. To establish intervention fidelity, we will complete competency and fidelity checks at two time points: (1) competency checks of learning mentor training, and (2) fidelity checks of cases delivered during the intervention phase. For the competency checks, each learning mentor will have one simulated intervention with another learning mentor or the research coordinator. Of these sessions, at least 80% will be recorded and &#x02018;signed off&#x02019; by an independent expert rater from the research team using the BECCI rating scale.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Additionally, we will attempt to assess 20% of live cases for fidelity (using a pragmatic sampling approach). The BECCI scale is a tool that measures the skills involved in behaviour change counselling. It is scored 0&#x02013;4 with a score of 2 or more (skills used to &#x02018;some extent&#x02019;) being acceptable as used in previous studies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref> The young people will provide assent for the live case recording to take place. As the recording and analysis of the delivery of the intervention sessions forms part of the employment contract of the learning mentors, formal consent is not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2f5"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Using estimates from the pilot trial (mean year group size=210, 87% completing baseline questionnaire, 20% being positive on A-SAQ and leaving contact details, 80% recruited to trial and 88% providing data at 12&#x02005;months follow-up), achieving follow-up data on 235 young people per arm the sample size has been calculated to have a 90% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.3 (which equates to a ratio of 1.5 in geometric means in total alcohol units in 28&#x02005;days) using a significance level of 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012474F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012474F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012474f01"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Baseline data</title><p>Descriptive statistics (comparisons of percentages, means or medians as appropriate) will be used to report the pupil-level baseline data, and completeness of intervention received between those allocated to the two trial arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary effectiveness analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Multiple linear regression will be used to compare the primary outcomes between the two randomisation groups at 12&#x02005;months, adjusting for any imbalance in key covariates, including school.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar manner. Comparisons of means will be presented as mean differences or ratios of geometric means (if a logarithmic transform is necessary for skewed data) with 95% CIs &#x000a0;ORs and 95% CIs will be presented for binary outcomes. Exploratory analyses will also be undertaken, for example, to examine differences in outcome by gender, deprivation and extent of intervention received, though there is limited power to investigate these comparisons. These moderators have been included so as to consider whether the ABI may need to be targeted when delivered, should it be shown to be effective. We will consider any difference in attrition rates, and any non-randomness of the attrition, when comparing outcomes between the two groups. The pattern of missing observations because of loss to follow-up will be examined to determine the extent of missingness, and whether it is missing at random or is informative. If data are missing to a sufficient extent, the use of appropriate multiple imputation techniques will be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2g4"><title>Health economics</title><p>The economic component will include a within trial cost-utility and cost-consequence analysis and, as described below, a model based analysis taking the perspective of the UK public sector (NHS, educational, social and criminal services). The cost-utility analysis will use measures of effectiveness limited to health-related quality of life as measured by EQ-5D Y. The cost-consequence analysis will take the same perspective for costs but will present these alongside all of the primary and secondary measures of effectiveness outlined above. The follow-up for the within trial analyses will be 12&#x02005;months, so discounting will not be conducted. For the model-based analysis, the time horizon will be longer (potentially up to the participant's life time) and costs and effects will be discounted at 1.5%, the UK recommended rate for public health interventions,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> with a sensitivity analysis used to explore the impact of higher (and lower) discount rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2g5"><title>Within-trial analysis: cost-utility and cost-consequence analyses</title><p>For each trial participant, the use of health, educational, criminal and social care services will be elicited using the S-SUQ administered at baseline (with a recall period of 3&#x02005;months) and 12&#x02005;months. Further cost data will come from the learning mentor time case diaries completed by the learning mentors for each contact. Costs for healthcare and social services will be obtained from standard sources such as NHS reference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gov.uk">http://www.gov.uk</ext-link>), the British National Formulary<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> for medications, Unit costs of Health and Social Care<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> for contacts with primary care. Further data will come from the study centres themselves. Data on the use of educational services will be elicited via the questionnaire. As part of the pilot trial, we confirmed with the expert group the type of services relevant to collect and have also added further questions related to days missed from school and truancy.</p><p>Learning mentor training costs will be included and will need to be apportioned according to scaled up practice. This will be informed by data from the training conducted as part of the trial and through expert opinion. The time of educational staff will be sought through a parallel costing exercise in which these staff will be asked to provide information on the impact of the intervention on their workload. With respect to learning mentors, a detailed proforma (case diary) was developed and tested in the pilot to capture resource use for cost-effectiveness analyses, and this new tool will be used in this study. With respect to school building and other large capital items, the opportunity cost will be considered. Some resources (eg, buildings) will exist with or without the intervention and the intervention may not displace any other activity. In this circumstance, the opportunity cost of the building would be zero. However, costs might be incurred in terms of heat, power and light, and these data will be captured using standard costing methods.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> For each participant, measures of use of resources will be combined with unit costs to provide a cost for that participant.

We will also interview parents of young people in attendance at schools in each of the four sites (16 interviews in total). We will endeavour to include mothers and fathers (cohabiting and lone parents) in the sample as well as parents of boys and girls covering different cultural groups. Variation will also be sought in terms of drinking risk status of the young people (based on A-SAQ screening data) and socioeconomic status of young people and parents (as measured by index of multiple deprivation rank of school and the first part of the pupil's postcode at baseline and A-SAQ score at follow-up). Teachers and learning mentors will be sampled according to variation of socioeconomic status of the school where they are employed.

<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Data will be coded by a qualitative researcher following standard thematic analysis procedures. That said, our development of the discussion guide for the interviews will be informed by theory on the likelihood of embedding study interventions in clinical practice, namely Normalization Process Theory.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> It is expected that the discussion guide will include questions linked to intervention implementation, such as role legitimacy (appropriateness of role/parental views, any role conflicts), adequacy (training, how the children are identified, how the intervention is conducted) and support (time available, support from school, parents). This theory considers factors that affect implementation in four key areas: how people make sense of a new practice (coherence); the willingness of people to sign-up and commit to the new practice (cognitive participation); their ability to take on the work required of the practice (collective action); and activity undertaken to monitor and review the practice (reflexive monitoring). The approach is increasingly used in studies of the implementation of interventions in healthcare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.normalizationprocess.org">http://www.normalizationprocess.org</ext-link>). Data from interviews with young people and parents will also be analysed inductively first through open coding and thematic analysis, and will follow the principles of constant comparison thereafter.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In this way, a qualitative researcher will read the interview transcripts and identify important or recurrent themes emerging from the transcripts. These emergent themes will be used to code the remaining transcripts, with open coding of any new themes that may emerge to expand on the emerging theory/results.
