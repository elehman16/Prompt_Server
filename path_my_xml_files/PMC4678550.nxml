A 10 ml syringe was used to draw 8 ml of blood and immediately transferred into a test tube containing 1.5 ml of citrate anticoagulant solution (anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution). The sample tube was then spun in a standard centrifuge for 10 min at 2400 rpm to produce platelet poor plasma (PPP). The PPP was taken up into a syringe with a long cannula.

Immediately after the blood draw, the dried monovettes (without anticoagulant) were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in the table top centrifuge. A structured fibrin clot formed in the middle of the tube, just between the red corpuscles at the bottom and acellular plasma at the top PRP and PPP.

The production or regeneration of any tissue type is a complex biological process in itself, requiring intricately regulated interactions between cells, locally acting growth factors, systemic hormones and growth factors, and the extracellular matrix components in which these entities interact.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>PRP and PRF act as a storage house for growth factors such as TGF-&#x003b2; and PDGF and they have been demonstrated to induce healing and regeneration of tissues, including those in the periodontal area.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] PRP and PRF are autologous sources of PDGF and TGF-&#x003b2; that is obtained by appropriating and concentrating platelets by gradient density centrifugation. They have been shown to stimulate healing and rejuvenation of tissues including those in the periodontal area.</p><p>According to Marx <italic>et al</italic>., a therapeutic autologous platelet concentrate should present approximately 1 million platelets/&#x000b5;L in humans, considering that the whole blood contains approximately 200,000 &#x000b1; 75,000 platelets/&#x000b5;L.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In order to obtain a therapeutic material and in agreement with previous studies, a minimum platelet concentration of 200,000 platelets/&#x000b5;L was considered vital in this study, and patients with a lower platelet count were excluded.</p><p>PPD, CAL, and GR were assessed using a UNC 15 probe which was positioned along the grooves on a customized acrylic stent to provide a reproducible insertion axis for the probe. Similar technique has been implemented in other studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Preoperative and postoperative comparability of probing measurements that do not use this standardized method is questionable.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The PRP preparation has been described by T&#x000f6;z&#x000fc;m and Demiralp.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this study, calcium gluconate was used as a gelling agent instead of calcium chloride and bovine thrombin. Bovine thrombin has been implicated in the development of antibodies to human clotting factors V, XI, and thrombin resulting in a risk of potentially life-threatening coagulopathies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Studies have used calcium gluconate as the gelling agent and have found it to be an excellent alternative to the use of calcium chloride and bovine thrombin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The PRF was prepared following the protocol developed by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This practice has been deemed the most ideal method for PRF preparation for its use in periodontal reconstructive surgeries.</p><p>The oral hygiene was maintained satisfactorily in all the subjects until the end of the study period, which could have been due to the regular reinforcement of oral hygiene. The Hawthorne effect could also have played an important role with regard to oral hygiene maintenance. Hawthorne effect is a form of reactivity whereby subjects improve or modify an aspect of their behavior, which is being experimentally measured, in response to the fact that they know that they are being studied.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In PRP, the platelet count was measured using a Neubauer chamber. Smear of the platelet concentrate was made, and it was used to assess the platelet count. Similar techniques have been used in other studies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] To assess the platelet count in PRF gel, the platelet counts were assessed in the donors&#x02019; whole blood and in the residual serum remaining after PRF preparation and then these counts were used to assess the platelet count in the PRF gel prepared. This technique has been used in other studies.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In Group I, there was an improvement with respect to all clinical and radiographic parameters. Literature has studies which show a similar improvement in clinical and radiographic parameters with the use of PRP.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The use of PRP has been shown to have a definite chance of improving the healing in periodontal endosseous defects.</p><p>Group II, in which PRF has been used, also showed improvement in all clinical and radiographic parameters. The use of PRF has resulted in the improvement in clinical and radiographic parameters in other studies seen in literature.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Bone tissue engineering applications have been seen for PRF, which acts as a suitable scaffold for breeding human periosteal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] PRF has been found to have a strong induction effect on osteoblasts also.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In this study, PRF and PRP have been found to have similar periodontal regenerative effects with PRF showing a slightly superior effect. The comparison between the use of PRP and PRF has been done in a study which showed that there was similar PD reduction, CAL gain, and bone fill at sites treated with PRF or PRP with conventional open-flap debridement. PRF requires less time for preparation and is less technique sensitive.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Hence, currently, PRF is the preferred platelet concentrate for periodontal regenerative procedure.</p><p>The fibrin matrix structure of PRF and PRP differ; this might be one of the contributory factors to the superiority of PRF over PRP. The difference between the structures of PRP and PRF is attributable to the gelling mode. PRF has the characteristic of polymerizing naturally and slowly during centrifugation, and there is no addition of any extraneous agent for polymerization. This phase is critical to establish the three-dimensional organization of a fibrin network. In PRF gel, connected junctions are formed between the fibrin fibrillae, and this allows for the establishment of a fine and flexible fibrin network which is able to support cytokines enmeshment and cellular migration. This three-dimensional organization also renders elasticity to the fibrin matrix.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The superiority of PRF over PRP may also be explained in terms of the difference in platelet count. It was seen in this study that PRP has a greater platelet concentration than PRF, and the difference in platelet count between the PRP and PRF groups was statistically significant. A negative correlation was seen between the various parameters measured and the platelet count in the PRP group. The platelet concentration required for a positive effect on bone regeneration appeared to be within a very limited range. Beneficial biological effects seemed to occur when a gel with a platelet concentration of approximately 1000,000/&#x000b5;L was used.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The lower concentration of platelets, gave a suboptimal effect while higher concentrations have been shown to have an inhibitory effect.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This might explain the negative correlation between the parameters and platelet count. A study by Hsu <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that the proliferation of oral cells significantly decreased when treated with high concentrations of PRP. Abundant secretion of thrombospondin-1 from concentrated PRP might have contributed to the antiproliferative effect.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>This study is limited by the fact that the exact range of platelet count to achieve the optimal regenerative potential has not been analyzed. A molecular study assessing the factor or factors responsible for the paradoxical effect has to be performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PRF and PRP are efficient bone graft substitute materials which have the advantage of being autologous preparations and barely technique sensitive. The use of PRF and PRP also decreases the cost of the regeneration therapy. PRF appears to have a slight advantage over PRP in its value in the management of periodontal endosseous defects. The advantage of PRF over PRP might be due to several reasons ranging from the structure of its fibrin matrix to the platelet count in the preparation. In the study presented in this manuscript, it has been shown that only within a limited range of platelet count does optimal regeneration take place.</p><p>Further studies are required to evaluate the exact range of platelet count at which the regenerative potential is at the maximum. Long-term, randomized, controlled clinical trial and histologic and biochemical research will be needed to arrive at a definitive conclusion.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pradeep</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of 3-wall intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis with autologous platelet-rich fibrin: A randomized controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2011</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>1705</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21513477</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yilmaz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabadayi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ipci</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cakar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuru</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of intrabony periodontal defects with platelet-rich plasma versus platelet-poor plasma combined with a bovine-derived xenograft: A controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2011</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>837</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21138357</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>T&#x000f6;z&#x000fc;m</surname><given-names>TF</given-names></name><name><surname>Demiralp</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Platelet-rich plasma: A promising innovation in dentistry</article-title><source>J Can Dent Assoc</source><year>2003</year><volume>69</volume><fpage>664</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14611717</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kawasumi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kitoh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Siwicka</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishiguro</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of the platelet concentration in platelet-rich plasma gel on the regeneration of bone</article-title><source>J Bone Joint Surg Br</source><year>2008</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>966</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18591611</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weibrich</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kleis</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Buch</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hitzler</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of platelet concentration in platelet-rich plasma on peri-implant bone regeneration</article-title><source>Bone</source><year>2004</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>665</fpage><lpage>71</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15050897</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choukroun</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Diss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Simonpieri</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Girard</surname><given-names>MO</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoeffler</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dohan</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF): A second-generation platelet concentrate.
