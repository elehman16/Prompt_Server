Secondary peristalsis is physiologically triggered by intra-esophageal stimuli such as injection with air or water, and balloon distension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Initiation of secondary peristalsis is physiologically involved in a reflex arc mediated by a vagal afferent pathway in that rapidly adapting mucosal and slowly adapting muscular mechanoreceptors are both required in such responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> The neural pathway of secondary peristalsis in the striated muscle is controlled by central mechanisms via vagal afferents, which then activate sequential vagal efferent discharge to the striated musculature of the proximal esophagus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> while that of the smooth muscle part of the esophagus is largely modulated by an intrinsic neuromuscular reflex inside enteric nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>Prucalopride, a novel enterokinetic agent, is a selective, high-affinity 5-hydroxytrypatamine 4 (5-HT<sub>4</sub>) receptors agonist, which is thought to exert its action by facilitating the release of acetylcholine from neurons of the myenteric plexus via a high affinity and specificity for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> It differs from other 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists in that its cardiac side effects are pharmacologically negligible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> It has been ademonstrated to be useful in the treatment of severe chronic constipation without significant side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Prucalopride also reduces esophageal acid exposure and accelerates gastric emptying in healthy adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> indicating its potential utility in the management of gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Although esophageal motility was not affected by prucalopride,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> other <italic>in vivo</italic> work showed potential effect on esophageal motility by enhancing neuoromuscular response in muscle strips of isolated human esophageal body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p><p>The effect of prucalopride on upper gastrointestinal motility has been demonstrated in healthy adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, it remains to be established whether such influence also occurs in human esophagus by its activation on 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors. Our study, therefore, was designed to investigate the effects of prucalopride on physiological characteristics of secondary peristalsis in human esophagus. It was hypothesized that acute administration of prucalopride would promote distension-induced secondary peristalsis as generated by intraesophageal air injections. This work also investigated whether primary peristalsis could be affected by prucalopride as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Studies were performed in 11 healthy subjects (6 female, mean age 23, range 21&#x02013;25 years) enrolled from the university by the advertisement. None of the subjects had previous history of esophageal disorders or any evidence of acute or chronic illness. Before the study, all subjects did not take any medications known to affect esophageal motility. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan. All subjects provided written informed consents before the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Esophageal manometry</title><p>Intraluminal pressures were recorded by a Koenigsberg 4-channel manometric catheter (Sandhill EFT catheter; Sandhill Scientific, Inc., Highlands Ranch, CO). The design of 4.5&#x02009;mm-diameter solid-state catheter includes three unidirectional pressure sensors located at 10, 20, and 25&#x02009;cm, and one circumferential pressure sensor at 5&#x02009;cm from the tip, whereas the infusion port was located between 15 and 20&#x02009;cm from the tip with approximately in the mid esophagus. The catheter was inserted through nose into the esophagus up to a depth of 60&#x02009;cm. After detecting lower esophageal sphincter (LES) by stationary pull-through method, we placed the most distal sensor of the high-pressure zone of the LES. The pressure data were then continuously recorded on the computer throughout the entire study period. Swallowing was identified from the most proximal sensor of the assembly located in the pharynx, thus allowing differentiating primary and secondary peristaltic activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>The subjects fasted overnight and reported to the motility laboratory in the morning. Oral prucalopride (4&#x02009;mg) and placebo were studied on 2 separate occasions at least 1 week apart in randomized order. Two hours after the drug administration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> we performed esophageal manometry. Each subject was asked to be positioned in sitting position and was allowed to accommodate the assembly for 10&#x02013;15&#x02009;min. Primary peristalsis was performed with 5-ml boluses of normal saline. Ten swallows were performed with each of the swallows separated by at least a 20-second (s) interval.</p><p>For generating secondary peristalsis, we performed slow air injection into the esophagus first by a slow air infusion (0.25&#x02009;ml&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) via an infusion pump attached to the assembly of the manometry. The amount of volume tested was automatically determined by a pump machine based on the rate and time for infusion of air. For rapid air injection, we started at 1-mL volume with continuous increase of the volume by 1-mL increments until the occurrence of secondary peristalsis was seen or the volume of the injection reached 20&#x02009;ml. The threshold volume of air injected was then determined as the lowest injected volume that could activate a successful peristaltic pressure wave.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Finally, ten 20-ml boluses of air within 0.5&#x02009;s were injected to determine effectiveness of secondary peristaltic response (&#x00025;) and relevant manometric parameters. Each stimulus allowed an interval of 20&#x02009;s to see any response to occur, during which subjects were asked not to swallow. All subjects were asked to have a dry swallow at the end of 20&#x02009;s for ensuring no residual air before the next stimulus and reducing the desire to swallow during the stimulation. The average duration for completing secondary peristalsis protocol took about 30&#x02009;min for each subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Complete or normal primary peristalsis was recognized if the pressure wave of &#x02267;12&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg was found in the proximal esophagus and &#x02267;25&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg in distal part of the esophagus associated with normal propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The minimal latency of wave onset between two recording channels was 0.5&#x02009;s. Secondary peristalsis in response to air injection (rapid and slow) was analyzed in the same manner as primary peristalsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> For assessing primary peristaltic wave amplitude (mmHg), duration (s), proximal recording sensors were located 5, 15, and 20&#x02009;cm above the LES. Data for secondary peristaltic wave amplitude and duration of contraction were determined and compared for middle and distal esophagus.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were expressed as mean&#x000b1;s.e.m. The effects on LES, threshold volumes and esophageal peristaltic parameters between prucalopride and the placebo were compared by a paired <italic>t-</italic>test.

Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was accepted as statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19 for Windows (SPSS Inc., IL, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Based on our previous data regarding between-group differences in the threshold volumes and relevant esophageal peristaltic amplitudes of secondary peristalsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> we determined at least 10 normal subjects would be necessary to detect statistically significant differences with a power of 80&#x00025; and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effects on esophageal distension thresholds by slow and rapid air injections</title><p>Prucalopride significantly decreased the threshold volume to trigger secondary peristalsis in response to slow air injections (prucalopride, 9.8&#x000b1;1.4 vs. placebo, 14.4&#x000b1;0.9&#x02009;ml, <italic>P</italic>=0.005) and rapid air injections (prucalopride, 3.9&#x000b1;0.3 vs. placebo, 5.2&#x000b1;0.4&#x02009;ml, <italic>P</italic>=0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, the frequency of secondary peristalsis during rapid air injections was greater after prucalopride as compared with the placebo (80&#x00025; (70&#x02013;100&#x00025;) vs. 70&#x00025; (62&#x02013;73&#x00025;), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on esophageal motility characteristics</title><p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the results of primary peristalsis.

Prucalopride significantly increased the pressure wave duration of secondary peristalsis in response to slow air injection in middle (3.3&#x000b1;0.5 vs. 2.5&#x000b1;0.2&#x02009;s, <italic>P</italic>=0.004) and distal esophagus (4.5&#x000b1;0.5 vs. 2.8&#x000b1;0.2&#x02009;s, <italic>P</italic>=0.005) compared with the placebo. Prucalopride did not affect the pressure wave duration of secondary peristalsis in response to rapid air injection.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work has demonstrated that the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors agonist, prucalopride, enhanced esophageal mechanosensitivity in triggering second peristalsis and consequently increased the effectiveness of secondary peristaltic responses to abrupt esophageal distension in healthy adults. The principal findings of motor effects were that prucalopride significantly increased pressure wave amplitudes of secondary peristalsis as triggered by both slow and rapid air injections into the esophagus. Similarly, prucalopride significantly increased primary peristaltic wave amplitude, as well as basal and residual LES pressure.</p><p>We have previously used 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist mosapride and demonstrated in healthy volunteers that it significantly enhanced esophageal mechanosensitivity of distension-induced secondary peristalsis and subsequently increased the effectiveness of secondary peristaltic response to abrupt esophageal distension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In addition, we observed that mosapride significantly increased pressure wave amplitudes of secondary peristalsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Notably, the activation of secondary peristalsis by slow air injection was not affected by mosapride. Although current findings are in line with our prior investigation with mosapride;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> nevertheless, the new evidence is that prucalopride significantly enhanced distension-induced thresholds of secondary peristalsis regardless the types of the stimuli inside the esophagus. Our results indicate that the highly selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist prucalopride appears to be more potent than mosapride in sensory modulation of esophageal secondary peristalsis via different types of mechanoreceptors in human esophagus.</p><p>In the present study, we found that prucalopride significantly increased primary peristaltic activity and LES pressure. Our data were in contrast with an earlier work investigating the effect of prucalopride 4&#x02009;mg daily on esophageal motility, Kessing <italic>et al.</italic> did not observe any effect of prucalopride on esophageal peristaltic activities or LES function using high-resolution manometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Although the cause of this discrepancy is not fully clear, it may be due to different methodology, study design, or dosage and timing of the medication used. However, in agreement with an earlier work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> studying on the prokinetic activity of prucalopride on human isolated esophageal body, prucalopride was shown to increase the amplitude of circular muscle contractions. This <italic>in vivo</italic> study has demonstrated better intrinsic activity of prucalopride on the modulation of neuromuscular functions in human esophagus.</p><p>Although our prior work did not show any effect of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist mosapride on basal LES pressure or residual LES pressure during swallowing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> prucalopride does significantly increase both basal and residual LES pressure. Data regarding the prokinetic effect of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> on LES functioning remain to be established;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> however, the reason for the discrepancy between different 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists may reflect the notion that there are marked variations in the effects and potency of those agonists at the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors with also interfering with other receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and prucalopride may possess relatively higher intrinsic and selective activity for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors.</p><p>The distension-induced secondary peristalsis can be classified according to the types of the stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In human esophagus, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors in response to rapid esophageal distension are located in the mucosal layer, whereas slowly adapting esophageal mechanoreceptors in response to slow distension are found in the muscularis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Our prior work in healthy adults has documented that both mucosal and muscular mechanoreceptors contribute to mediate esophageal reflexes (secondary peristalsis), which can be generated by <italic>in vivo</italic> slow and rapid air injections into the esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Given the known mechanisms of secondary peristalsis, the notion that distension thresholds of secondary peristalsis triggered by slow and rapid air injections were influenced by prucaloride suggests that esophageal distension-induced secondary peristalsis appears to be equally modulated by 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in accordance with both slow and rapid adapting mechanoreceptors.</p><p>Some limitations need to be acknowledged in this study. Although complete peristaltic events were well observed with conventional manometry, the high resolution manometry may have the advantage by avoid missing some of the peristalsis. The lack of high resolution manometry may limit comprehensive characterization of distension-induced secondary peristalsis due to the notion that secondary peristalsis may not run through the entire length of the esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Prior work using 4&#x02009;mg prucalopride has well demonstrated its effects in reducing esophageal acid exposure and accelerating gastric emptying; however,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> it is still unclear whether the dose we used is optimal to induce a series of physiological events related to secondary peristalsis. This has been overcome by the notion that the efficacy in promoting secondary peristalsis has been well observed in current work at the dose of 4&#x02009;mg. Finally, the pattern and response to esophageal distension may depend on the type of the stimulation. The air boluses disperse rapidly along the esophagus and can be moved ahead of any peristaltic wave after injection. In contrast, the balloon distension provides a focal stimulus that can't be moved by any induced motor response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> However, balloon distension has lower response rate when compared with those of air and water in the normal subjects.</p><p>Our study merits some clinical implications. It suggests that prucalopride is capable of promoting secondary peristaltic activities that would further facilitate the efficiency of esophageal clearance relevant to defense mechanism when abrupt reflux or regurgitation of residual bolus occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> A recent work has demonstrated that prucalopride significantly reduces esophageal acid exposure and accelerates gastric emptying in healthy volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Together with our findings, it is suggested that prucalopride has its prokinetic effects in not only human stomach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> but also in the esophagus. Since secondary peristalsis appears to be important during sleep states when salivation and primary peristalsis are suppressed;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> it is expected that prucalopride has potential clinical utility in improving nocturnal acid reflux because of its benefits on decreasing acid reflux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and promoting secondary peristalsis, as shown in this work. Moreover, since it has been demonstrated that impaired secondary peristalsis occurs in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease and was found more in those with severe esophagitis or concomitant ineffective motility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> current findings indicate that prucalopride is theoretically helpful in improving esophageal hypomotility in patients with complicated gastro-esophageal reflux disease. This notion needs to be further confirmed in gastro-esophageal reflux disease patients with significant esophageal hypomotility.</p><p>In summary, although prior work has revealed that the involvement of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in mediating the modulation of distension-induced secondary peristalsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> the present study has further demonstrated that prucalopride, a novel enterokinetic agent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> also promotes physiological characteristics of secondary peristalsis by enhancing distension thresholds and improving peristaltic activities in health adults. As secondary peristalsis can be influenced by prucalopride regardless type of the stimuli, this notion may support the evidence that both slowly adapting muscular and rapidly adapting mucosal mechanoreceptors can be both modulated via 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the generation of secondary peristalsis in human esophagus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>A part of this study was presented at the DDW 2016 in San Diego and published as an abstract form in from Gastroenterology (2016) 150 (4 Suppl. 1): S282.</p></ack><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article:</bold> Chien-Lin Chen, MD, PhD</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions:</bold> Data collection, design of the work, and drafting the work: CHY and CLC; analysis and interpretation of data: WYL, JSH, LTT; approved the final version of the submitted work: all the authors.</p><p><bold>Financial support:</bold> This study was supported by a grant, TCRD 104-18, from Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.</p><p><bold>Potential competing interests:</bold> The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Helm JF, Dodds WJ, Pelc LR et al. <article-title>Effect of esophageal emptying and saliva on clearance of acid from the esophagus</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>
