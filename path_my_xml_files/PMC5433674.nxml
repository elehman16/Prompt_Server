A methodological strength is that no carry-over effects were detected that can explain the differences in sputum production.</p><p>Individual responses in single trials are demanding to generalise to the wider population. However, it has been suggested that results might be generalised by combining trials with the use of strict entry-criteria, similar procedures and outcome measures, and acceptable statistical tests.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Our study demonstrates that individual RCTs can be useful in evaluating the feasibility of a novel technique.

The adherence to the trial design was excellent; demonstrating that the novel SCT was well tolerated and accepted as each participant underwent eight treatments with no drop outs.</p><p>This pilot study followed guidelines for N-of-1 RCTs as presented by Guyatt et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, there might be some potential limitations which could have influenced the results.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The major limitation is the small sample size, thus making it difficult to generalise. However, we were able to find significant differences between SCT and FET in individual participants, thus indicating that the design may be valid in future larger studies.</p><p>One other limitation is the lack of blinding of the physiotherapist and participant through the intervention, thus prior beliefs, preferences and expectations may bias the results.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Another possible limitation is related to disease stability. Previous studies have validated sputum production as a reproducible outcome measure in CF and reported sputum production to be similar within a week interval<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and on a day-to-day basis during disease stability.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In this study, sputum production was relatively similar in each pair when the techniques were compared.</p><p>A further possible limitation relates to the use of sputum wet weight (g) as outcome due to potential overestimation and underestimation.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Although dry weight of sputum has been considered as more accurate in reflecting sputum quantity, contradictory findings exist in the literature regarding the correlation between wet and dry weight. While some studies found no difference in the ratio of dry to wet sputum weight,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and no significant difference in wet or dry sputum weight between treatment groups and placebo,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> other studies have found a significant difference between treatments when considering both wet and dry weight.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2050312117697505" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although a standardised protocol was used in this study, the lack of sufficient recoding of total coughs in the interventions, as spontaneous coughs can influence sputum production, may have affected sputum weight.</p><p>One limitation may be related to treatments being conducted by the developer of the SCT. In studies on airway clearance, supervision by an experienced physiotherapist is important. However, it may also leave the study open to bias in favour of a technique. However, in our study, treatments were based on a standardised protocol with objective outcome measures and blinding of outcome assessments, which may have helped to reduce potential variability due to the conductor.</p></sec><sec id="section23-2050312117697505"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>This pilot study demonstrates that the N-of-1 trial design can be useful in determining an individual treatment efficacy outcome and to identify responders to treatment.
