This results in the destruction of articular cartilage and marginal bone, which is generally thought to be irreversible.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recent studies have demonstrated that the early treatment of patients with antirheumatic drugs is associated with a reduction in inflammation, greater inhibition of structural damage and better long-term outcomes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, early aggressive treatment with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), such as antitumour necrosis factors (TNFs), was reported to be highly effective at reducing disease progression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The effect of treatment discontinuation/tapering following successful inhibition of disease progression as a result of using bDMARDs early in the course of the disease has yet to be fully investigated; however, there is the possibility that the positive disease trajectory may be maintained following treatment cessation.</p><p>Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a humanised anti-TNF antibody fragment conjugated to polyethylene glycol, approved for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including RA. The efficacy and safety of CZP in combination with methotrexate (MTX) during the early stages of RA was assessed in the Certolizumab-Optimal Prevention of joint damage for Early RA (C-OPERA) study. This study consisted of two periods: a 52-week double-blind (DB) period during which patients received either CZP or placebo (PBO) together with MTX, and a subsequent 52-week post-PBO/CZP treatment (PT) period in which patients received MTX therapy without CZP or PBO.

The feasibility of bDMARD withdrawal after achieving a therapeutic target is also of importance from both safety and economical points of view. If these issues are overcome, there is the possibility of a clinical approach where RA therapy is initiated with a bDMARD in the early stage of disease, leading to improved outcomes that can be maintained even after withdrawal of the initial aggressive treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>C-OPERA was designed to assess the clinical benefit of CZP treatment concomitant with MTX as first-line therapy for early RA, particularly for patients who were considered to require aggressive treatment. Patients who had poor prognostic factors, including a high titre of anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody in addition to either rheumatoid factor positivity or bone erosions, were eligible to enter the study. C-OPERA was a study composed of two periods. The results from the first year of the study demonstrated the clinical benefit of adding CZP to MTX therapy (DAS28(ESR) remission and radiographic non-progression was achieved in more than 50% and 80% of patients, respectively), suggesting that the introduction of CZP at a very early stage led to substantial therapeutic effects, despite poor prognosis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In this report, we assessed whether the clinical benefit of initial 1-year CZP+MTX treatment was observed after stopping CZP and continuing with MTX therapy for 1&#x02005;year.</p><p>A key finding from the PT period reported here, was that the beneficial effect seen after an initial 1&#x02005;year of treatment with CZP was observed after discontinuing CZP therapy when the dose of MTX remained optimised. Radiographic progression, estimated using linear extrapolation, remained lower in the CZP+MTX&#x02192;MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX&#x02192;MTX group. When using linear extrapolation, patient withdrawal can result in an overestimation of mTSS change from baseline. To overcome this, analyses were repeated using LOCF imputation, confirming the efficacy of CZP co-administration. The rate of radiographic non-progression observed in the CZP+MTX&#x02192;MTX patient population during the PT period was similar to that observed during the DB period in the same population. This suggests that joint destruction may be prevented even after discontinuation of CZP in patients who responded adequately to initial treatment with CZP+MTX. These data, combined with the lower rate of RRP in the CZP+MTX&#x02192;MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX&#x02192;MTX, and the subgroup analyses (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S3</xref>) suggest that induction treatment with CZP+MTX benefits those with a high risk of radiographic progression. The rate of HAQ remission was higher in patients with radiographic non-progression compared with those with radiographic progression, suggesting that radiographic progression associates with functional disability even during the 2&#x02005;years of the study. These results suggest that early treatment with CZP during the initial stages of the disease, when rapid joint damage may take place,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> could prevent long-term progression of joint damage and functional disability as previously suggested in the &#x02018;window of opportunity&#x02019; concept.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>
</p><p>In addition to joint damage prevention, the rates of clinical remission throughout the PT period remained higher in the CZP+MTX&#x02192;MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX&#x02192;MTX group. After CZP discontinuation, approximately 25% of the patients flared; however, they showed rapid response to CZP retreatment, with recovery to preflare disease activity levels. Although joint destruction was consistently prevented in the PT population following CZP withdrawal, clinical remission was sometimes lost. Discrepancies in clinical and radiographic efficacy have been reported for adalimumab (ADA);<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> similar differences in the clinical and radiographic efficacies of CZP that continue following treatment discontinuation could be responsible for the results observed here. A decrease in remission rate was mainly observed during the first 16&#x02005;weeks after CZP discontinuation. We speculate that patients who still produce excessive TNF may have flared as the concentration of CZP decreased.</p><p>Overall, the results suggest that initial aggressive treatment with a bDMARD could be a potential treatment option at the early stage of disease, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis. Once patients achieve their treatment targets, bDMARD treatment could be withdrawn. This treatment approach has the potential to prevent irreversible joint damage, reduce patient risk of AEs and be a more cost-effective way to manage RA over the long term. This approach is supported by two further studies. The Optimal Protocol for Methotrexate and Adalimumab Combination Therapy in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (OPTIMA) study demonstrated minimal loss of clinical response without significant radiographic progression after ADA withdrawal in patients with early RA who initiated combination therapy with MTX.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While, The High Induction Therapy with Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (HIT HARD) study showed better radiographic outcomes but no significant difference in disease activity after ADA withdrawal in the ADA+MTX&#x02192;MTX group compared with MTX alone.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Differences in the results of these studies compared with C-OPERA suggest that the condition of the &#x02018;induction-maintenance&#x02019; regimen<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> may be important. Further studies are now needed to identify the appropriate disease activity targets required to achieve continued disease inhibition following CZP withdrawal, and to identify patient populations that would particularly benefit from first-line therapy with CZP. Moreover, additional analyses are also required to confirm whether this approach has significant clinical benefits for patients failing to respond to MTX therapy after 3&#x02005;months, which is the approach currently recommended in treat-to-target guidelines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>Safety analyses showed similar rates of SAEs for both the CZP+MTX&#x02192;MTX and PBO+MTX&#x02192;MTX groups over the 2&#x02005;years of the C-OPERA study, indicating that there are no major safety concerns when adding CZP to optimised MTX therapy. Incidences of AEs and SAEs during the PT period were lower compared with the initial DB period in both groups. One reason for this may be &#x02018;survival bias&#x02019;, where patients discontinued the study because of an intolerance to the study drugs (CZP and/or MTX) in the first period, resulting in a lower AE rate in the second.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>This study has several limitations. In clinical practice, only patients failing to respond to MTX would receive CZP therapy, and so it is not known how this approach compares with initial CZP therapy. No patients received CZP for a full 2&#x02005;years or were treated with a reduced dose of CZP, so it was not possible to compare these treatment regimens with CZP discontinuation. CZP withdrawal had not been optimised; therefore, there is the potential for further investigation regarding the appropriate treatment targets and the timing of CZP withdrawal in different patient populations. There were differences between the study design of C-OPERA and current RA treatment recommendations. For example, in clinical practice, treatment recommendations for patients with poor prognostic factors include using additional DMARDs in addition to MTX,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which was prohibited in C-OPERA. C-OPERA was not designed as an intercontinental global study; thus, it is not known whether these results are generalisable to ethnicities other than Japanese. In particular, the MTX dose of 16&#x02005;mg is low compared with similar RA studies from the European Union and USA (15&#x02212;17&#x02005;mg/week).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;26</xref> However, when considering differences in patient body weight and MTX metabolism,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> a lower dose of MTX in this study may correspond to the doses used in those previous studies. Finally, as non-responding patients were eligible to receive rescue treatment from 24&#x02005;weeks onwards, we cannot exclude the possibility that a proportion of the 70 PBO+MTX patients switching to rescue therapy in the first year may have achieved clinical response if treated for a longer period of time.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that patients with early RA would benefit from the addition of CZP to MTX therapy during the early stages of disease, particularly with respect to the prevention of joint destruction. Although this aggressive therapeutic strategy would not be recommended for all patients, it may be a potential option for those patients with a high risk of experiencing rapid joint destruction. How to identify these patients at disease onset requires further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Lilia Marinova MD, PhD, UCB Pharma, UK, for publication coordination, and Simon Foulcer, PhD, and Danielle Machin, BSc, from Costello Medical Consulting, Cambridge, UK, for medical writing and editorial assistance in preparing this manuscript for publication, based on the authors' input and direction.
