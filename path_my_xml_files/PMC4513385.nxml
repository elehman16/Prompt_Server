Lifestyle programs are needed as part of a comprehensive approach to prevent obesity. Evaluation provides a unique opportunity to investigate and inform improvements in lifestyle program implementation strategies. The Healthy Lifestyle Program for rural women (HeLP-her Rural) is a large scale, cluster randomized control trial, targeting the prevention of weight gain. This program utilises multiple delivery modes for simple lifestyle advice (group sessions, phone coaching, text messages, and an interactive program manual). Here, we describe the acceptability of these various delivery modes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed-method process evaluation was undertaken measuring program fidelity, recruitment strategies, dose delivered, program acceptability and contextual factors influencing program implementation. Data collection methodologies included qualitative semi-structured interviews for a sub-group of intervention participants [<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28] via thematic analysis and quantitative methods (program checklists and questionnaires [<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;190]) analysed via chi square and t-tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 649 women from 41 rural townships into the HeLP-her Rural program with high levels of program fidelity, dose delivered and acceptability. Participants were from low socioeconomic townships and no differences were detected between socioeconomic characteristics and the number of participants recruited across the towns (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15). A face-to-face group session was the most commonly reported preferred delivery mode for receiving lifestyle advice, followed by text messages and phone coaching. Multiple sub-themes emerged to support the value of group sessions which included: promoting of a sense of belonging, mutual support and a forum to share ideas. The value of various delivery modes was influenced by participant&#x02019;s various needs and learning styles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This comprehensive evaluation reveals strong implementation fidelity and high levels of dose delivery. We demonstrate reach to women from relatively low income rural townships and highlight the acceptability of low intensity healthy lifestyle programs with mixed face-to-face and remote delivery modes in this population. Group education sessions were the most highly valued component of the intervention, with at least one face-to-face session critical to successful program implementation. However, lifestyle advice via multiple delivery modes is recommended to optimise program acceptability and ultimately effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registry</title><p>Australia &#x00026; New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry.

The Australian Preventative Taskforce has advocated the need for obesity prevention programs amongst all population groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Reproductive aged women are an important target group with longitudinal population data revealing high rates of unhealthy weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and many barriers to participation in obesity protective behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of obesity is elevated in women living in rural settings in comparison to their urban counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rural communities are often socio-economically disadvantaged, and have relatively poor access to primary health care services, resources and trained health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The need for novel low cost lifestyle programs that can be implemented easily in such groups is critical, where greater program implementation challenges exist. Yet despite this urgency, few healthy lifestyle programs have been implemented in vulnerable target groups such as rural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a systematic review highlighted that the efficacy of weight gain prevention programs in rural communities has yet to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The International Obesity Task Force highlights the need for monitoring and evaluating all obesity prevention and management programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this context, evaluation should focus on the processes required to effectively establish and maintain evidence-based programs in real world conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to inform policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Process evaluations through the rigorous documentation and assessment of implementation strategies, improves our understanding of the impact of a program and informs how each program component contributes to outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Process evaluations also assess program internal and external validity, generalisability to diverse populations and identifies factors (program specific and contextual) influencing consistency of program delivery with the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Common components of process evaluation include an assessment of program fidelity (the extent to which the program was implemented as per the protocol), dose delivered (the amount of intended components delivered), context (socio-cultural and physical environment), dose received (the extents to which participants actively engage with, interact with and/or used the program materials) and acceptability (primary and secondary audiences satisfaction with the program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The value of conducting obesity prevention program evaluations has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There has been multiple process evaluations of school based childhood obesity prevention programs conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], demonstrating their value and enabling replication of successful programs to maximise research investments and population benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, there is a current dearth of process evaluations of adult obesity prevention programs, limiting understanding of the interplay between the underlying program theory, processes and outcomes. This information gap also curtails potential for translation of evidence into improved public health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further research and evaluation is clearly needed in this area.</p><p>Another key research gap is the value and &#x0201c;audience appeal&#x0201d; of obesity prevention programs in women overall and the acceptability of various modes of delivering lifestyle advice (face&#x02013;to-face and remotely including resources, correspondence and mobile phones) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To our knowledge, there has only been one study which has assessed the acceptability of various delivery modes within an obesity prevention program. In this study the acceptability of delivery modes (group or correspondence delivery) were compared to controls, with significantly less women choosing to participate in face to face groups. However, the group delivery mode produced the largest short-term changes in weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, further exploration of the acceptability of remote delivery methods alone is warranted.</p><p>Understanding participant&#x02019;s value and preferences for various modes of delivering lifestyle advice, can inform translation and impact on participation rates and program reach, effectiveness and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addressing these clear and important research gaps, we aimed to conduct a process evaluation within the context of a large scale rural obesity prevention program, measuring implementation fidelity, dose delivered, context, reach and acceptability of diverse delivery modes. This evaluation focused on informing the acceptability of obesity prevention program implementation strategies in general within complex systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>HeLP-her Rural program design and theory</title><p>The Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP-her Rural program) is an integrated community cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to prevent weight gain in a population of reproductive-aged women living in rural Victorian communities in Australia. Detailed study design methodology are comprehensively explained elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, the program was designed to be low intensity and focused on participants making small long-term sustainable behaviour changes. In this program 41 rural communities were randomised to intervention or control groups. The control participants attended a single general group health information session. The intervention participants received lifestyle advice through mixed delivery modes including (i) limited personal contact: one group session and (ii) remotely, consisting of: one phone coaching session, monthly text message reminders and a program manual. The intervention content was based on the principles of building self-management informed by the self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The primary outcome was the difference in weight gain between the control and intervention groups at 12-months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>The sample size calculations were completed a-priori as outlined in the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and clinical trial registry. In the calculation of sample sizes for the primary outcome (weight change over 12-months), adjustments were made for the clustered design prior to program recruitment. The variance inflation factor (VIF) used to achieve this was determined from the average cluster size and the Intra-Cluster Correlation (ICC). The trial was powered to detect a difference of 1.0&#x000a0;kg in weight between groups at 12&#x000a0;months, the weight difference achieved in our original trial (HeLP-her) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the estimated population weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The actual ICC calculated in the previous HeLP-her study was &#x02212;0.02 using Generalised Estimating Equations, (GEE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], despite the negative value is assumed to be equivalent to zero. However we assumed some clustering in this setting although likely small and notably there was little published data to inform the ICC estimates in rural communities. Therefore, to detect an absolute difference in weight between groups, 196 women per intervention arm (control and intervention) were required to participate in the HeLP-her Rural program. Adjusting for the cluster design with a variance inflation factor (VIF) =1.28, cluster size of 15, and allowing for 20&#x000a0;% attrition over 1-year, we aimed to recruit a minimum of 600 women into 40 clusters of 15 women. To allow for inadvertent recruitment challenges 42 towns (clusters) were randomized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>HeLP-her rural program recruitment</title><p>Participant recruitment commenced in September 2012 and was completed in April 2013 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Program recruitment was underpinned by a comprehensive community communication and engagement plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Participant recruitment strategies were intentionally simple and low cost to reflect usual practice and centred on community integration within current structures. Participants were recruited through the distribution of an invitation letter and flyer to women, provided through primary schools, pre-schools, child care centres and health services in each township. All women aged 18&#x02013;50 living within each of the 41 selected townships were invited to participate and to assist program recruitment research staff visited each township to provide information in person to participants.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort Diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1995_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>HeLP-her Rural program delivery and implementation</title><p>Multiple intervention components were utilised based on existing evidence of efficacy and feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The delivery modes were designed to reinforce program messages, appeal to various learning styles and preferences and to maximise cost-effectiveness via delivering lifestyle advice remotely, whilst retaining some personal contact. The group education session provided an opportunity to receive personal contact, improve social support amongst participants and encouraged participants to set appropriate health goals based on personalised priorities. During this group session five simple healthy lifestyle messages related to weight gain prevention were presented by the program facilitator (e.g. try to eat 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables per day, reduce soft drink intake and take a brisk walk for at least 30&#x000a0;min on most days of the week). Education was provided on building behavioural self-management capacity including: goal setting, action planning, addressing barriers, problem solving and relapse prevention skills. For example rather than advising women to eliminte takeaway food we focused on how they could prepare a healthy meal for the family, despite their multiple family and women commitments. At the end of the group education session participants had generated lifestyle goals and action plans based on their personal priorities and therefore had developed a personalised weight gain prevention strategy.</p><p>The program manual was incorporated to promote participants to self-manage their health behaviours though the completion of self-directed activities. Participant were required to document their health goals within their program manual. The phone coaching utilised client orientated counselling approaches and promoted behaviour change through exploring and resolving ambivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Women unable to complete the phone coaching were mailed a summary sheet of the core messages provided. The text messages reinforced the program content and accountability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The primary outcome of HeLP-her Rural program was the difference in weight gain between the control and intervention communities at 12&#x000a0;months post program initiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>HeLP-her Rural process evaluation design and theory</title><p>The evaluation ran parallel to the HeLP-her Rural program which monitored, documented and assessed program implementation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Specific dimensions of the process evaluation measured were; program fidelity, recruitment strategies, dose of the program delivered, program acceptability and contextual factors influencing program implementation. A logic model was developed to monitor the program evaluation, reflecting resources and activities (inputs), and underlying theory and anticipated program outcomes.</p><p>The intervention study and the evaluation were approved by the Monash Health Research Ethics Committee for research involving humans, project No.12034B.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Evaluation data collection methods</title><p>The evaluation utilised a mixed method data collection approach, recognising the synergistic benefits of both qualitative and quantitative research methods.

During the group education sessions all participants engaged with the program manual and completed self-management activities with support from the program facilitators.

Results on dose received are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In summary, in-depth semi-structured interviews with HeLP-her Rural program participants revealed a high level of program dose received, with almost all interviewees reporting that the program supported them to initiate behaviour change. Factors which influenced behaviour change initiation and continuation included realistic program expectations and the participant&#x02019;s ability to apply the core program elements including: setting small, achievable behaviour change goals, problem solving and using self-management techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Adherence to the Help-Her Rural program protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was high with all program components delivered as planned to both the control and intervention groups, confirmed through administrative data, completion of program checklists and staff observations. The program checklists completed during the delivery of the group education sessions (intervention arm), confirmed that the five simple program health messages had been discussed amongst the group and that participants had an opportunity to develop and document their personalised health goals. Thus, each participant set a personalised weight gain prevention strategy within their provided program manual.</p><p>Furthermore, all program facilitators received specific program training, attending a compulsory one-day training workshop (August 2012). During this workshop the underlying program theory was discussed in depth (self-determination and cognitive behavioural theory) and motivational interview training was provided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Program context</title><p>Contextual factors influencing program delivery were documented via researchers completing program devised checklists. The completed checklists indicated that there were a greater number of enablers to program delivery, in comparison to barriers (across control and intervention communities). Observed program contextual enablers included, an interactive and interested group, indicated by participants being actively involved in group discussions and asking numerous questions, evidence of social interactions, friendships, and participant&#x02019;s encouraging each other during the session. The most frequent barrier to program delivery included reduced group size limiting group discussions and significant background noise made by children present at the sessions, distracting program participants and the program facilitator. However, study design and sample size limited group size in each town and other barriers were addressed by one staff member looking after the children, whilst the other delivered the program to participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Program acceptability: quantitative results</title><p>Program satisfaction was measured quantitatively by questionnaire at 1-year on a likert scale of 1&#x02013;5 with a higher score indicating greater participant satisfaction.

The acceptability of the program devised manual&#x02019;s value varied between intervention participants. Additional supportive quotes can be found in (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Qualitative findings were consistent with our quantitative findings collected at 12&#x000a0;months, supporting the usefulness of the various intervention components and suggesting that face-to-face education was the preferred mode of delivering lifestyle advice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Group education sessions</title><p>A recurrent key theme across participant interviews was that the group education session was the most valuable intervention component. Multiple sub-themes emerged to support the value of group sessions, the most prominent was that group sessions promoted a sense of belonging.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;It made me realise everyone&#x02019;s trying to do this and you&#x02019;re not in it alone&#x0201d;</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>This peer interaction was described as particularly important amongst women living in isolated rural communities. Participants also explained that group session provided an opportunity for participant&#x02019;s to share ideas and solutions to overcome barriers to achieving a healthy lifestyle. The sense of group therapy and camaraderie was a motivating factor in initiating lifestyle modifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Phone coaching and text messages</title><p>Numerous sub-themes arose from our data endorsing the benefits of utilising phone coaching within a lifestyle intervention. Participants described that phone coaching provided an opportunity to receive personalised health advice and to resolve questions about the program content. Phone coaching and text messages promoted lifestyle change as they &#x0201c;reminded&#x0201d; participants to self-monitor lifestyle choices and reinforced program messages. Additionally, these initiatives promoted a sense of program &#x0201c;support&#x0201d; and fostered program commitment within participants.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;It was just a reminder that someone was there wanting to support us if we were struggling&#x0201d;.</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>A small number of participants did not view the phone coaching and text messages as valuable. A described drawback of the phone coaching was that the lifestyle advice discussed was &#x0201c;repetitious&#x0201d; and another participant reported &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m just not good on the phone&#x0201d;. Limitations of text messages were often related to issues with phone reception, &#x0201c;we live in the bush and mobile phone coverage is poor" and issues with text messages arriving at &#x0201c;inappropriate&#x0201d; times. Other participants revealed that the text messages were &#x0201c;easy to ignore&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;delete&#x0201d; and that they &#x0201c;didn&#x02019;t take enough notice of them&#x0201d;. Some women explain that the text messages were of limited value as they would prefer a more &#x0201c;personalised&#x0201d; approach and favoured &#x0201c;talking to someone&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Program manual</title><p>The overarching theme regarding the usefulness of the program manual was that the acceptability varied greatly amongst participants. Approximately half of the program participants interviewed perceived the manual as very &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d; as it provided informative lifestyle advice that could be &#x0201c;revisited&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;referred back to&#x0201d; and incorporated useful self-management activities such as &#x0201c;setting goal&#x0201d; and problem solving activities.</p><p>The majority of women who did not complete the activities, perceived the manual as not being valuable. Emerging sub-themes identified as barriers to greater uptake of the manual included lack of time, multiple commitments, poor literacy skills and the manuals passive written format. However, it was suggested that a strategy to promote better compliance and utilisation of the manual, would be to allocate specific times in sequential group sessions to complete the manual activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Overall qualitative participant feedback on various program components</title><p>The value of utilising multiple delivery modes (face-to-face and remote) resonated strongly with participants. Participant&#x02019;s agreed that the combination of various program components led to behaviour modifications and improved program acceptability, revealing that &#x0201c;it&#x02019;s a complete&#x0201d; program and &#x0201c;it all works together&#x0201d;.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I think that it&#x02019;s [all] those little things that get you more motivated, as otherwise you just forget about it and&#x02026;fall back into your usual routine&#x0201d;.</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>However, the value of the group session in combination with other components was a repeated theme.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I found the group session brilliant.

We reached women experiencing relative socioeconomic disadvantage and report a high level of program fidelity, dose delivered and program acceptability. The most commonly preferred method of receiving lifestyle advice was via the face-to-face group session. Whilst text messages and phone coaching also had high reported value, they appeared to be most helpful when used in combination with face-to-face contact. Overall, participants emphasised that the combination of various delivery modes maximised program acceptability and value. Based on our evaluation findings, key learnings to optimise the future implementation of the HeLP-her Rural program are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>The key evaluation learnings to improve the implementation of the HeLP-her Rural program</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; Simple low cost participant recruitment strategies were effective in recruiting rural women into a healthy lifestyle program (i.e. the distribution of flyers to women provided through primary schools, pre-schools and health services, media releases and researcher presence in each community).

This is in contrast to previous literature highlighting the challenges of engaging low income population groups into research trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], with most weight trials in women attracting highly educated participants of high socio-economic status, who are not representative of the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Here we also report no clear relationship between program reach and socioeconomic status of the townships as it appears this locally delivered, community based low intensity program appealed to women of relatively low income backgrounds. This is important, as people experiencing social disadvantage are more likely to be obese, as a result of reduced physical activity participation and poorer diet quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Potentially, the variation in participant numbers recruited across the 41 townships was influenced by multiple socio-cultural influences such as the presence and engagement of local community champions, social norms, partnerships, program awareness and accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The current results are encouraging and in future greater investigation is needed to identify sociocultural influences and optimise program engagement strategies in low income communities.</p><p>Multiple strategies were employed to ensure high program fidelity and dose delivered. We report high program fidelity as result of all program facilitators attending program specific training and standardisation of resources used during program delivery. Dose delivered has been shown to be a limiting factor in intervention success with results from an intensive obesity prevention trial, reporting that only 50&#x000a0;% of participants received the intended program dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The literature consistently demonstrates low adherence and reduced dose delivered in high intensity face-to-face programs limiting feasibility and effectiveness of intensive programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We deliberately designed a low intensity intervention program with mixed delivery modes including both face-to-face and remote delivery modes to reduce participant burden and were able to optimise adherence and dose delivered. We also addressed common barriers to attendance and participation which limits dose delivered, such as inconvenient times, childcare and transport by offering multiple delivery times and using local familiar settings such a schools, and allowed toddlers to attend with mothers. We achieved high levels of phone coaching compliance through offering flexible phone coaching times (evening phone coaching conducted), making multiple calls to participants and scheduling phone coaching time in advance strategies which have been used in weight management programs in young women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our results suggest that program design with some face&#x02013;to-face content but low participant burden and mixed delivery mode optimises program acceptability of lifestyle obesity prevention programs.</p><p>Supporting the value of utilising various delivery modes, two systematic reviews have reported increased program efficacy with combined program delivery modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Prior to the current study, there was limited evaluation of the acceptability of isolated individual program components such as texts and phone coaching. Most programs include multiple components and do not include process evaluations, making the value of individual components difficult to ascertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Here we advance the literature by demonstrating that face-to-face delivery, combined with other modes including phone coaching and text messaging are valued by participants. This is consistent with the very few interventions that investigated efficacy of phone coaching and text messaging, which found that these approaches were most efficacious when supported by face-to-face group sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This current research affirms the combined delivery modes in the HeLP-her Rural lifestyle program and informs delivery modes for use in future lifestyle interventions. However, greater research exploring the acceptability of various modes of delivering lifestyle advice during formative evaluations and pilot studies is warranted.</p><p>Regarding face-to-face delivery, group-based healthy lifestyle programs appear advantageous at the individual and systems level. A systematic review revealed that group-based education sessions produced significantly greater weight management effects over 12&#x000a0;month, compared to individual based treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These programs are a resource and cost effective delivery mode for health information and enhance the opportunity for social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], as social networks can encourage positive health behaviours, improve self-worth and individual perceptions of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, group education creates a sense of belonging, illustrating to program participants that it is &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; to struggle to achieve healthy lifestyles. The enhanced sense of belonging promoted by group education is important in rural settings, with increased risks of social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, as rural women are high users of mobile phones and &#x0201c;remote counselling&#x0201d; has been shown to be efficacious in a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], combination of group and mobile phone delivery appears ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Remote delivery modes also minimise participant burden associated with travel to group sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, our quantitative findings indicated that phone coaching satisfaction scores were lower than face-to-face group sessions and text messages, highlighting the benefits of utilising diverse delivery methods. Whilst we have demonstrated the benefit of group face-to-face program delivery, exploration of the optimal balances and frequency of supplementary text messages and phone calls is still needed. Additionally, further exploration of program acceptability and methods of delivering lifestyle advice during formative evaluations and pilot studies is also warranted.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Challenges and lessons learned</title><p>The HeLP-her Rural program is one of the largest prevention trials in Australia presenting logistical challenges but providing an opportunity to learn valuable translation and scale-up lessons. To ensure our evaluation would yield useful and reliable results, extensive pre-planning was essential. Vital components included defined evaluation questions, aligning the evaluation with program objectives and prioritising and building an evaluation plan within our program resources (staffing, time, funding and logistics). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarises the key evaluation learnings to improve the future implementation of the HeLP-her Rural program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>Strengths of the current study included the application of a mixed-method evaluation approach to a rigorously designed large-scale obesity prevention RCT, targeting a healthy population at risk of weight gain. The use of robust qualitative data analysis methods (theoretical framework and two independent staff conducted analysis) and a range of quantitative data collection tools (administrative data, checklists and questionnaires) strengthened results. Moreover, the purposeful sample utilised in the qualitative data collection increases the generalisability of the results to the wider RCT cohort. We chose to focus on the acceptability of numerous delivery modes for lifestyle advice, as this was a key gap in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and can inform the design of future healthy lifestyle programs. We note that the acceptability of the HeLP-her Rural program was not explored in control participants, as they did not receive the active intervention components. However, data pertaining to dose delivered, context and fidelity was recorded for control participants and included within this manuscript. In order to improve program recruitment we believe that more intensive recruitment methods could have increased program uptake, however ethically we were unable to recruit more women than required. Limitations of this study include that our program checklists exploring program fidelity and contextual influences were completed by research staff involved in the trial rather than independent evaluators. In addition fidelity to motivational interviewing theory was not assessed. Exploration of the different delivery modes for healthy lifestyle advice using quantitative and qualitative data were not collected at the same time point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Broad scale evaluations of healthy lifestyle obesity prevention programs are not routinely conducted, limiting the ability to maximise on research investments and translate evidence into practice to address the obesity epidemic. Here, results from a comprehensive evaluation of a lifestyle obesity prevention program, demonstrate strong fidelity and high level dose delivery. We reached women from relatively low income rural townships and highlight the acceptability of combined delivery modes including mixed face-to-face and remote delivery modes in this population. Group education sessions were the most highly valued program component and including at least one face-to-face session within a healthy lifestyle program appears integral. Phone coaching and text messages were also valued delivery modes, reinforcing program messages and encouraging commitment to the program. Delivery of lifestyle advice through multiple delivery modes is recommended to optimise program acceptability and ultimately effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2015_1995_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
