The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class of drugs has been showed to improve glycaemic control by coordinating multiple mechanisms of action including induction of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, enhancement of satiety, and slowing of gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Thus, GLP-1 receptor agonists act on several systems to modulate plasma glucose concentrations.</p><p>Exenatide is a subcutaneously injected, peptide GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been shown to improve glycaemic control, promote weight loss, and improve some cardiovascular risk markers in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. The two formulations of exenatide, exenatide once weekly (ExQW) and exenatide twice daily (ExBID), both approved for the treatment of T2DM in the US and Europe, provide continuous or intermittent GLP-1 receptor activation, respectively. ExQW encapsulates the exenatide molecule of ExBID into poly-(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres, allowing a gradual rise in exenatide plasma concentration as it is released via diffusion from the biodegradable microspheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. With weekly dosing, this formulation reaches minimally effective therapeutic concentrations of exenatide within 2 weeks and steady state concentrations providing continuous exposure to exenatide by about 6&#x02013;7 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. In contrast, the ExBID formulation is administered as a bolus injection prior to the two largest meals of the day and has a systemic half-life of 2.4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>].</p><p>Two open-label, randomized, controlled, clinical studies directly compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the two formulations of exenatide in patients with T2DM over 24 or 30 weeks of treatment. ExQW was showed to be superior to ExBID in reducing haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) over 24 or 30 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. In these studies, least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were &#x02212;1.9% (ExQW) and &#x02212;1.5% (ExBID) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and &#x02212;1.6% (ExQW) and &#x02212;0.9% (ExBID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], with significant LS mean treatment differences of 0.33 and 0.67%, respectively. While both formulations reduced both fasting and postprandial glucose, ExQW had significantly greater effect on fasting glucose than ExBID whereas ExBID had significantly greater effects on postprandial glucose than ExQW. Patients in both treatment groups lost similar amounts of weight in the two studies. Few differences in the safety and tolerability of the two formulations were observed in the individual studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>The goal of this retrospective integrated analysis was to characterize the comparative safety and tolerability of the extended-release (ExQW) and immediate-release (ExBID) formulations of exenatide using the pooled data from the two head-to-head pivotal trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. This analysis was performed to increase the likelihood of detecting and characterizing differences in the onset, incidence, or duration of adverse events (AEs) between the two formulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Participants and Procedures</title><p>Patients from two randomized, controlled, open-label, studies of similar design (DURATION-1 and DURATION-5) were included in this analysis. The population included 545 intent-to-treat (ITT) patients (277 ExQW; 268 ExBID) with T2DM treated with diet/exercise and/or up to 2 oral antidiabetic medications [any combination of metformin, sulphonylurea (SU) or thiazolidinedione (TZD)]. Patients were randomized to receive 2 mg of ExQW or 5 &#x000b5;g of ExBID for 4 weeks followed by 10 &#x000b5;g ExBID for the remainder of the 24- or 30-week study (all patients in DURATION-1 received 5 &#x000b5;g of ExBID for 3 days prior to randomization) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Patients were at least 18 years of age and had a baseline HbA1c of 7.1-11.0%, a body mass index of 25&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and stable body weight for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit. Patients were excluded from the studies if they had evidence of a clinically significant medical condition or had regularly used systemic corticosteroids, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, or meglitinide.</p><p>Patients self-administered exenatide during the trial and data was collected at scheduled visits that occurred at weekly, 4-week, or 6-week intervals. The occurrence of AEs was reported spontaneously by the patient or noted by the investigator. Documented AEs were attributed to a defined period according to the event onset date. The intensity of an AE (mild, moderate or severe) was assessed by the investigators according to predefined and standardized definitions. Specific details of the study procedures, as well as efficacy and safety data, have been reported previously for the individual studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Clinical protocols for each study were approved by an Institutional Review Board in accordance with the principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki including all amendments through the Seoul revision of 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. Patients provided written informed consent before participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Subject disposition and baseline demographic information were summarized by treatment group for the ITT population, which included all randomized patients receiving at least one injection of randomized study medication.</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs occurring for the first time or worsening after the first injection of randomized study medication through the end of the 24- or 30-week controlled study period. Between-group differences in incidence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal, frequently occurring AEs, and AEs of interest including hypoglycaemia. The incidence of AEs of interest, including nausea, vomiting and injection-site AEs (pooled analysis of injection-site pruritus, erythema, urticaria and rash), were summarized over time in 2-week intervals, with a new event defined as onset of the event occurring for the first time in a patient and a recurrent event defined as an event that occurred in the same patient in any of the previous 2-week intervals. An event with a duration that spanned more than one 2-week interval was only recorded in the interval corresponding with event onset. Within each 2-week interval, the percentage of patients with events was calculated using the total number of patients remaining in the trial during the defined period.</p><p>Major hypoglycaemia included events that (i) resulted in loss of consciousness, seizure, coma, or other mental status change consistent with neuroglycopenia which resolved after administration of glucagon or glucose or (ii) those that required third-party assistance because of severe impairment in consciousness or behaviour and had a glucose value of &#x02264;54 mg/dl. Minor hypoglycaemia included events that had symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and glucose values of &#x02264;54 mg/dl prior to treatment. As hypoglycaemia is more frequently observed when exenatide is used in combination with SU, a subgroup analysis by concomitant SU usage was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Patients were considered to have concomitant SU use if the patient used SU at any point during the 24- or 30-week controlled study period.</p><p>A patient was defined as having treatment-emergent antibodies to exenatide if antibodies were present after the first injection of randomized study medication following absence of antibodies or a missing antibody measurement at baseline, or if the titre increased by at least three dilutions from a detectable measurement at baseline. The incidence of AEs by antibody status was compared in each treatment group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient Demographics and Disposition</title><p>The ITT population included 545 patients (ExQW N = 277, ExBID N = 268; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>). At baseline, patients were either drug-na&#x000ef;ve (17%), or treated with one (45%) or a combination (38%) of oral antidiabetes medications (metformin, SU and TZD). Patient demographics were balanced between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>), including similar HbA1c (8.3%), fasting plasma glucose (163&#x02013;168 mg/dl), body mass index (34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), body weight (98&#x02013;99 kg), background antidiabetes medications, and duration of diabetes (7 years). Similar numbers of patients withdrew from both groups (14 and 16% with ExQW and ExBID respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>).

Other injection-site-related adverse events included injection-site urticaria (0.7% vs. 0.4%) and injection-site rash (1.4% vs. 0.4%), both having no significant between-group differences in incidence rate. The incidence of these injection-site-related events decreased over time in both groups with no events reported beyond 14 weeks in either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">figure 2</xref>C). With ExQW, the majority of injection-site-related events resolved within 14 days. With ExBID, the majority (6 of 8) of injection-site-related events required greater than 14 days to resolve. Most events in either group were mild in intensity, with only a single patient treated with ExQW experiencing a severe injection-site adverse event. This patient had an AE of indurated macular rash with severe itching that was deemed non-serious and resolved without patient withdrawal from the study. No patients treated with ExBID reported severe injection-site AEs. Injection-site nodules, primarily transient and mild, were the only other AE reported significantly more frequently with ExQW than ExBID (2.2% vs. 0%) for a between-group difference of 2.2% (0.5, 3.9).</p><p>It was noted that although there was no relationship between antibody status and overall incidence of AEs within a treatment group, antibody-positive ExQW-treated patients had a higher incidence of injection-site-related adverse events including injection-site erythema (8.5% vs. 1.4%) and injection-site pruritus (15% vs. 4.2%) compared to antibody-negative ExQW-treated patients.

Thus, understanding differences in the safety and tolerability profiles of different agents is a key aspect of making therapeutic decisions.</p><p>While ExQW and ExBID contain the same active therapeutic compound, they have different pharmacokinetic profiles, allowing one to remain in the systemic circulation in a continuous manner (ExQW) and the other to provide intermittent exposure over a 24-h period (ExBID). Integrated analyses of the safety and tolerability of intermittent exenatide exposure with ExBID have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. In this pooled analysis of two randomized, head-to-head, controlled clinical trials over 24 or 30 weeks of treatment, the safety and tolerability profiles of ExQW and ExBID were directly compared. Both ExQW and ExBID had an equally low incidence of SAEs (4%) and AEs that led to withdrawal (5%). The safety and tolerability profile of ExQW was largely consistent with that of the immediate-release ExBID formulation; there were no indications that continuous exposure to exenatide resulted in an increase in the types, intensity, and duration of AEs observed in the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].</p><p>The results of this analysis showed that the primary differences in tolerability between the two therapies were in GI-related and injection-site related AEs. Mild-to-moderate GI-related AEs were the most common AE, with nausea reported most frequently in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. However, GI tolerability was improved with ExQW vs. ExBID; the incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower with ExQW than ExBID and study withdrawal because nausea occurred less frequently with ExQW than ExBID. Similar to findings in other studies of exenatide or other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the incidence of nausea and vomiting declined over time in both groups, with few reports of GI-related events with longer-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. There was no prolongation in the duration of nausea or vomiting events with ExQW, nor worsened intensity despite the continuous presence of exenatide.</p><p>Exenatide-associated nausea and vomiting is thought to be GLP-1-dependent, resulting from slowed gastric emptying, appetite suppression and/or stimulation of neural GLP-1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. While most cases of exenatide-related nausea and vomiting have been reported as mild/moderate in intensity, further mitigation by use of anti-emetics, increased fluid intake, slower eating or smaller meal size has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]; however, robust data supporting these options is not available. Gradual dose escalation of ExBID has been shown to reduce the proportion of patients experiencing exenatide-related nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. The gradual escalation of exenatide concentrations imposed by the release properties of ExQW may underlie the improved GI tolerability with ExQW compared to ExBID. It is of note that nausea and vomiting are generally not associated with higher concentrations of exenatide. Higher circulating exenatide concentrations, as measured in some individuals administered 2 mg ExQW, did not appear to affect tolerability (Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., data on file). This observation was further supported in the current analysis by the evaluation of GI events over time, in which the highest incidence of nausea and vomiting occurred at initiation, when ExQW levels were at their lowest. A plateau in the incidence of nausea and vomiting was observed as exenatide concentrations continued to increase during the approach to steady state. Thus the decrease in GI events over time, despite the presence of high concentrations of exenatide at steady state, suggests an acclimation to the GI effects of exenatide over time.</p><p>Injection-site related AEs occurred more frequently with ExQW compared to ExBID. However, these events were rarely treatment-limiting and few patients (&#x0003c;1%) discontinued as a result of injection-site events. In general, injection-site events were mild and transient, and their frequency diminished over time.</p><p>Injection-site nodules were also observed as low-grade foreign body-type reactions occurring in response to the poly-(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres that encapsulate exenatide in the ExQW formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. As with other injection-site events, nodules rarely lead to withdrawal and were typically mild and transient in nature.</p><p>Consistent with the glucose-dependent mechanism of action of exenatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>], the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was low with both ExQW and ExBID treatment and no major hypoglycaemia events occurred. The incidence of minor hypoglycaemia was similar for both groups; however, incidence of minor hypoglycaemia was increased in patients using concomitant SU therapy compared to patients not using SU.</p><p>A limitation of this analysis is that it did not include sufficient patient numbers to detect extremely rare AEs and the duration of the trials may not have been long enough to observe AEs that may occur only with extended use of the study drug. Other limitations of this analysis include the open-label nature of the studies and the retrospective analysis of the data.</p><p>Overall, continuous (ExQW) vs. intermittent (ExBID) exenatide exposure did not impact the general safety profile of exenatide. This pooled analysis has showed that both exenatide therapies were well-tolerated and resulted in few withdrawals because of AEs. Notably, sustained exenatide concentrations achieved with ExQW resulted in improved GI tolerability and were not associated with a general prolongation or worsened intensity of common AEs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The studies in this analysis were sponsored by Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Eli Lilly and Company.
