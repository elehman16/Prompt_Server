A focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) is a limited sonographic evaluation easily learned by those with minimal experience. Our study attempts to prove that surgical residents of all postgraduate levels can be trained with a short didactic session followed by hands-on experience, studying patients with known intra-abdominal fluid. With this method, surgical residents can be quickly and cost-effectively taught to perform FAST examinations with proficiency rates matching those of the literature .</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this prospective randomized trial, thirteen surgical residents were trained to perform FAST scans. Residents attended a 3-hour didactic course and then performed three normal FAST scans followed by four scans on patients with known intra-abdominal fluid. Lastly, trauma patients over a six-month period were studied. FAST results were compared to CT, DPL, or serial examination results. Statistical analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In 93.8% of patients no fluid was detected. There was one false positive and one false negative exam. The sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 99%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 99%, respectively. A kappa statistic of 0.79 was calculated indicating a substantial amount of agreement between the FAST scan group and the CT/DPL/serial exam group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Sonography guidelines for the training of surgical residents are needed. By maximizing positive examinations, the number of required proctored examinations can be lowered and the learning curve shortened. In a short time, surgical residents can learn to perform the FAST scan with proficiency rates matching that of the literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By training on patients with known intra-abdominal fluid, in a short time, surgical residents can learn the FAST scan. With our method, resident proficiency can match that of more experienced personnel.</p></sec></sec></body></article>
