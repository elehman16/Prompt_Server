James Reason's work in this field has had a major influence on our understanding of the causes of medication errors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have, in developing our interventions, taken account of human error theory in considering the causes of medication errors in primary care and the approaches that are most likely to reduce error rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Medication errors in primary care</title><p>This proposal builds on our narrative[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and systematic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reviews of the international literature on medication errors in primary care and on our own related empirical work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have drawn on these experiences to identify and select outcome measures that are clinically important. This work has shown that the following groups of drugs are both commonly and consistently associated with medication errors that result in serious morbidity and, in some cases, mortality:</p><p>&#x02022; Cardiovascular drugs (including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and diuretics)</p><p>&#x02022; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p>&#x02022; Oral anticoagulants (warfarin).</p><p>We have also taken account of errors associated with the use of methotrexate, in view of warnings about this drug from the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer for England[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and lithium and amiodarone because of their narrow therapeutic indices and the need to undertake regular blood test monitoring[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Underlying causes of medication errors</title><p>There have been a number of studies that have investigated the underlying causes of medication errors in hospitals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Leape <italic>et al</italic>, for example, identified 16 major systems failures from an analysis of 334 errors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The most common underlying problem was "failure of drug knowledge dissemination" (i.e. the doctor not knowing enough about the drug) and this accounted for 29% of errors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, Dean <italic>et al </italic>investigated the causes of 44 prescribing errors and found that slips in attention or failure to apply relevant rules were the commonest underlying causes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>There have been relatively few detailed analyses of the causes of medication errors in primary care although several studies have identified the points in the medicines management process where most errors occur[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]</p><p>Gurwitz <italic>et al </italic>found that the majority of preventable adverse drug events associated with community-based prescribing were due to errors in the prescribing and monitoring phases of pharmaceutical care[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings were mirrored in the study of drug-related hospital admissions that was undertaken in Nottingham, UK[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], whereby 35% of admissions were thought to be due to unsafe prescribing decisions and 26% due to inadequate monitoring.</p><p>Our analysis of these studies suggest that in aiming to reduce rates of medication error in primary care the key factors that need to be addressed are:</p><p>&#x02022; ensuring that general (family) practitioners (GPs) are aware of the risks of the drugs most commonly associated with adverse events</p><p>&#x02022; ensuring that GPs recognise the hazards of rule violation, e.g. prescribing drugs that are contraindicated</p><p>&#x02022; developing robust systems for monitoring patients on high-risk medications (including call and recall for blood tests) so that patients are not exposed to correctable hazards.</p><p>We have taken account of these issues in the design of the complex pharmacist-led information-technology (IT) based intervention for our trial.</p></sec><sec><title>The development of methods for identifying medication errors using GP computer systems</title><p>The use of clinical computer systems to identify patients with medication errors is a potentially powerful method for "error trapping" that may allow general practices to correct errors before patients are harmed.</p><p>We used MIQUEST[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] software successfully in our pilot work to identify preventable drug-related morbidity in general practice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This process involved writing precise computer queries that are capable of extracting the information required.</p><p>In our pilot work[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we found the processing of MIQUEST data very time-consuming. This is because it usually involves visiting general practices to extract data and then a considerable amount of work in processing and checking the data. Also, it does not produce user-friendly output for practices on individual patients who are deemed to be "at risk".</p><p>We resolved these problems through the use of an additional type of software called Quest Browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tcrnottingham.com"/>. This well-established software uses MIQUEST queries of GP computer systems, but has several advantages over using MIQUEST alone. Firstly, it can produce user-friendly feedback at the practice-level on patients with medication errors (or any other clinical problem). Secondly, output from Quest Browser can be imported straight into a database without the need for additional manipulation. Thirdly, Quest Browser has a facility (called Quest Browser Central) whereby, with agreement from the practices and research ethics committees, linked-anonymised data can be sent to researchers in an encrypted form via the Internet. This reduces the number of visits that researchers need to make to practices and helps with the timely collection of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of the complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention</title><p>Informed by the Medical Research Council's (MRC) framework for complex interventions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we took account of the theoretical considerations outlined above, along with pilot work, to develop the pharmacist-led IT-based intervention. This is described in more detail below (see "pharmacist-led intervention" section).</p></sec><sec><title>Aims of the study</title><p>To determine the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and acceptability of a complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention compared with simple feedback in reducing proportions of patients at risk from potentially hazardous prescribing and medicines management in general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific objectives</title><p>1. To test the hypothesis that a pharmacist-led IT-based complex intervention using educational outreach and practical support is more effective than simple feedback in reducing the proportion of patients at risk from hazardous prescribing and medicines management in general practice.</p><p>2. To conduct an economic evaluation of the cost per error avoided, from the perspective of the NHS, of the pharmacist-led intervention compared with simple feedback.</p><p>3. To explore the views and experiences of health care professionals and NHS managers concerning the intervention; investigate the possible reasons why the interventions might prove effective or ineffective, and inform future roll-out of the pharmacist-led intervention if it proves to be effective.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>We will conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised trial. Trial practices will receive either i) computerised feedback on patients identified to be at risk from potentially hazardous prescribing and medicines management or ii) a complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention in addition to computerised feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility of general practices for entering the trial</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022; NHS general practices within a 50 mile radius of Manchester and Nottingham in England.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices within NHS primary care trusts (PCTs) that agreed to be involved in the study.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices that were laboratory-linked (or had other reliable systems for recording blood test results on the practice computer system) for at least 15 months prior to the time of baseline data collection (being laboratory-linked means having all blood test results relayed electronically to the practice so that these can be downloaded into patients' computerised records).</p><p>&#x02022; Practices that agreed to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022; Practices that stated they did not routinely record morbidities such as asthma or peptic ulcer on patients' computerised records.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices not routinely using their computers to record prescriptions issued.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices that were intending to change their GP computer systems to that of a different supplier which was not Quest Browser compatible during the course of the study.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices in PCTs that were undertaking interventions that might overlap with our intervention.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices that were involved in the pilot study for the trial.</p><p>&#x02022; Practices that expected major changes in list size (numbers of registered patients) during the course of the study, either because of the splitting up of the practice, merger with other practices or any other reason for a large influx or loss of patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><sec><title>General practices</title><p>We wrote to general practices in PCTs in Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Central and Eastern Cheshire, England informing them of the study. Where practices expressed an interest in participating we arranged a face-to-face meeting at which the study was explained in more detail. A member of the practice team then signed a consent form if the practice decided to participate. Seventy-two general practices were recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>For the purposes of the health economic analysis, the general practices recruited to the study were asked to write to all patients identified through baseline data collection who appeared in the numerator of one of our outcome measures (i.e. they had potentially been subjected to hazardous prescribing or medicines management). In the accompanying patient information leaflet, patients were given information about the study and were asked to give consent for the research team to access their medical records. Patients were asked to sign a consent form and to return this to the study team.</p><p>For outcome measure six (see below for further details), we identified some practices that keep their records of international normalised ratio (INR) results for monitoring anticoagulation therapy separate from their main practice computer system and thus appeared to have very high proportions of patients not having INRs checked according to the computer searches we undertook. In these cases, we did not write to patients to seek consent to access their records because it is likely that the majority were not at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants for the qualitative analysis</title><p>In order to obtain a range of perspectives, purposive sampling has been employed. This has enabled us to identify a range of NHS staff (e.g. clinicians and administrative staff) working in both the intervention and control practices in both geographical regions and in practices of varying size. Also, on the basis of suggestions from trial researchers and intervention pharmacists, we have recruited participants with a range of viewpoints, including those from practices where the interventions appear to have been received positively and those where problems have been encountered.</p><p>Other key stakeholders we have recruited include prescribing and clinical governance leads of primary care organisations, trial pharmacists, community pharmacists and researchers closely involved in the roll-out of the study.</p><p>We wrote to potential participants for the qualitative analysis and obtained written consent before undertaking interviews.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Simple feedback</title><p>Those practices randomly allocated to this arm received computerised feedback on patients identified to be at risk from potentially hazardous prescribing and medicines management along with brief written educational materials explaining the importance of each type of error. This information was given to a nominated member of the general practice (usually the practice manager) after baseline data have been collected from the practice computer system, using Quest Browser software.</p><p>Practices in the simple feedback arm were asked to try to make any changes to patients' medications within a 12 week (intervention) period following the baseline data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacist intervention</title><p>Those practices randomly allocated to this arm received simple feedback and in addition, had a complex pharmacist-led IT-based complex intervention.</p><p>First, the pharmacist arranged to meet with members of the practice team to discuss the computer-generated feedback on patients with medication errors. All doctors were encouraged to attend this meeting along with at least one member of the nursing staff, the practice manager and at least one member of the reception staff.</p><p>Before the meeting, wherever possible, all relevant members of staff were provided with a brief summary of the objectives of the pharmacist-led intervention and a summary of the findings from the computer search.</p><p>At the meeting the pharmacists were asked to use the following approach derived from the principles of educational outreach[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] while also taking account of human error theory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]:</p><p>&#x02022; Establish professional credibility by explaining their own background in clinical pharmacy and their affiliation with either the University of Manchester or University of Nottingham (depending on the site they are working from)</p><p>&#x02022; Take a non-judgemental approach in all discussions with members of the practice team</p><p>&#x02022; Outline the findings from the computer search</p><p>&#x02022; Explore the views of team members about the findings</p><p>&#x02022; Investigate the baseline knowledge of team members regarding the importance of each of the errors</p><p>&#x02022; Provide clear, concise, evidence-based materials on each of the errors, encouraging active participation by team members</p><p>&#x02022; Explore the views of team members on the underlying causes of the medication errors (using root-cause analysis techniques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] where appropriate)</p><p>&#x02022; Explain their availability to work part-time with the practice over the following 12 weeks to:</p><p>- Help take corrective action in individual patients with medication errors</p><p>- Help improve the systems operating in the practice in order to prevent future errors.</p><p>&#x02022; Encourage the team to agree on an action plan with clear objectives</p><p>&#x02022; Ask for a member of the practice team to volunteer to liaise with the pharmacist over arrangements for making changes to individual patients' medication and introducing changes to systems within the practice</p><p>&#x02022; Ask the practice to agree to a follow up meeting within four to six weeks of the initial meeting.</p><p>Following this initial meeting, the pharmacists were expected to use a range of techniques to help correct the medication errors that had been identified and prevent future medication errors.

Eligible GP practices agreeing to participate in the trial were stratified by centre (two strata: Manchester and Nottingham) and the size of the patient population in each general practice (three strata: &#x0003c;2500, 2500&#x02013;6000, &#x0003e;6000) and randomly allocated within strata (1:1 ratio) to the two treatment arms.</p><p>The reason for stratifying by centre was to help ensure an even distribution of practices allocated to each of the intervention groups within each centre. The reason for stratifying by size of the patient population in each general practice was because a trial of educational outreach suggested that the larger the practice the more difficult it is to make changes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Block randomisation, using non-predictable block sizes of either two or four, was used to ensure a similar number of practices in each arm. Practices were centrally randomised as they were recruited using the independent web-based randomisation service provided by the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the University of Nottingham. Access to the sequence was confined to the CTU Data Manager (who was independent from the study team).

We also worked with the company to produce the outputs needed for the secondary outcome measures.</p><p>For each practice agreeing to be involved in the trial, Quest Browser software was installed on their clinical computer system.

With 34 practices in each of the two treatment arms, we would have at least 80% power (two-tailed alpha of 0.05) to demonstrate a 50% reduction in rates of potentially hazardous prescribing and medicines management in the pharmacist-led arm compared with 11% in the simple feedback arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance</title><p>We recognise that it can be a challenge to encourage general practices to engage in interventions. However, as the intervention involves either simple feedback, or feedback and the provision of a pharmacist to work with the practices, we do not expect non-compliance with the intervention to be a large problem. In addition, from our experience of the pilot study and of conducting previous trials, we believe that the risks of non-compliance will be minimised by providing practices with clear information on what the study involves, providing access to members of the research team to answer queries and address problems experienced by the practices, and support from the PCTs.</p></sec><sec><title>Likely rate of loss to follow up</title><p>We do not envisage practices dropping out of the study once they have agreed to take part. Nevertheless, at the outset we have stressed to the practices the importance of allowing us to collect follow-up data, even if the practice has not engaged fully in one of the interventions. As outcome data collection will require minimal input from the practice or its staff, we do not foresee problems with obtaining outcome data from participating practices.</p><p>Some patients will move practices and some will die within the intervention period. However, this is unlikely to have a large impact on the proportion of patients with errors at follow-up, unless leaving the practice or death is differentially related to medication error. This is unlikely because the number of deaths attributable to the medication errors we are studying is likely to be small during the course of the study. Nevertheless, we will try to follow up patients who have died by viewing their electronic medical records up until the time of death, and requesting paper-based records that might contain details of contacts with secondary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal of patients from the study</title><p>Withdrawal of patients consenting for their medical records to be examined will not affect the analysis of clinical outcomes as these are obtained from anonymised computer searches of all "at risk" patients in the general practices recruited to the study.</p><p>Withdrawal of these patients will affect the health economic analysis although it is expected that numbers of patients withdrawing will be small. A patient will be considered to have withdrawn from the study if the study team receive any notification that the patient wishes to withdraw. This notification might come from the patient themselves, the patient's representative or from the patient's general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis, using the following analysis plan, will be undertaken blind to treatment arm allocation (i.e. the treatments will be identified only as A and B until analysis is complete).

Baseline costs at practice level will be included as covariates in the model. The assumptions for undertaking random effects linear regression will be assessed using residual plots and in addition the robustness of the analysis to non-normality will be assessed by estimating 95% confidence intervals around the difference in mean costs using bias corrected non-parametric bootstrapping. If the assumptions for undertaking random effects linear regression are not met, we will consider aggregating the patient level cost data to the level of the practice. Comparisons between treatment arms at practice level will be made using a two sample t-test on the original dataset, or on a bootstrapped dataset, depending on the normality of the distribution of practice level costs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Modelling analysis of costs</title><p>The practice level cost of the intervention will be combined with patient-level costs of error management.

Incremental cost effectiveness ratios will be calculated if the higher cost intervention is associated with better outcomes.

It is likely that our success in recruitment relates to the attention to detail we put into developing a feasible intervention that was seen to be relevant to general practices, although we will find out more about whether this was the case from our qualitative study. In addition, we put considerable effort into our recruitment strategy including pre-publicising the trial, sending documentation to general practices about the trial and following up on this to arrange visits to practices where the study was explained in more detail.</p><p>Baseline data extraction was undertaken smoothly and successfully and provided the information needed for practices to consider acting on patients with potentially hazardous prescribing and medicines management. In particular, data extraction for our pre-specified primary outcome measures appears to have worked successfully in all general practices recruited to the study. Nevertheless, we have encountered some difficulties with the secondary outcome measures, as described above. Some of these problems could have been avoided with better foresight on behalf of the research team. For example, had we been aware that some general practices kept a separate record of INR results, and did not keep these on their main clinical computer systems, we could have excluded such practices from our recruitment. Similarly, if we had realised that it would not be possible to extract dosage instructions for general practices using the TPP computer system, we could have excluded practices using this computer system (we did pilot our outcome measures using the TPP computer system and went ahead with recruiting practices because we erroneously believed that was a solution to the problem). For outcome measure nine, which focused on dosage instructions for methotrexate, a national policy change that occurred during the course of our study has meant that we will be unable to collect useful follow-up data on this outcome measure for any of the practices we have recruited. This is because the introduction of a forcing function to GP computer systems, which does not allow for anything but weekly dosing, does not appear as a line of dosing text that can be picked up by MIQUEST software. It is unfortunate that our study will not be able to demonstrate the impact of this important safety initiative, although it is likely that the introduction of this computerised safety feature will have brought about improvements in both arms of the trial.</p><p>At the time of submitting this protocol, analysis of quantitative data had not been undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACE: Angiotensin converting enzyme (inhibitor); CHD: Coronary heart disease; CTU: Clinical Trials Unit; DMEC: Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee; GP: General practitioner (or family practitioner); ICC: Intraclass correlation coefficient; ICER: Incremental cost effectiveness ratios; INR: International normalised ratio; IT: Information technology; MRC: Medical Research Council; NHS: The UK National Health Service; NPSA: National Patient Safety Agency; NSAIDs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PCT: Primary Care Trust; PPI: proton pump inhibitor; TPP: The Phoenix Partnership (the name of a GP computer system); TSC: Trial Steering Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJA, who has made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, is co-responsible for the overall administration and direction of the project, the analysis and interpretation of data and will give the final approval of the version to be published.
