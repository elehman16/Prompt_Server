Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other clinical characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective observation study included 75 NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36&#x000a0;years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis.

More recently, it has been reported that a consistent percentage of the general population consider themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity&#x02019; (NCGS). In a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] we suggested the term &#x02018;Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity&#x02019; (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes the symptoms in NCGS patients, and we also showed that these patients had a high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. That previous study also showed a percentage of NCWS patients had weight loss and anemia: whether these depended on the intestinal malabsorption or not remains unclear.</p><p>As yet no data are available on the presence and prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS patients. The aims of the present study were: 1) to investigate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients; and 2) to search for a possible correlation between BMD and other clinical characteristics, in particular the body mass index (BMI), of NCWS patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>This prospective study included consecutive adult patients with an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like clinical presentation, according to Rome II criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS. The patients were recruited at the Internal Medicine Department of the University Hospital of Palermo and at the Internal Medicine Department of the Hospital of Sciacca (Italy), between July 2011 and July 2013. Most of the patients were referred due to intestinal symptoms with onset after wheat ingestion. None of them were included in previous published studies.</p><p>NCWS diagnosis was made according to the recently proposed criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Both the CD specific serum antibodies and the duodenal histology were evaluated on a diet containing at least 100 grams of wheat per day, for at least three months. Furthermore, according to our experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], all patients met the following adjunctive inclusion criteria: 1) resolution of the IBS symptoms on a standard elimination diet excluding wheat, cow&#x02019;s milk, egg, tomato, chocolate and other self-reported food(s) causing symptoms; and 2) symptom reappearance on double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. DBPC cow&#x02019;s milk protein (CMP) challenge and other &#x02018;open&#x02019; food challenges were also performed in all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: 1) self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it, before entering the study; 2) nervous system disease, major psychiatric disorder; 3) hyperparathyroidism, Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome, kidney disease and other &#x02018;organic&#x02019; gastrointestinal disorders; 4) physical impairment limiting physical activity; 5) menopause; and 6) steroid and sex steroid therapy, hormone replacement therapy or ovariectomy.</p><p>Fifty sex- and age-matched subjects with CD and sixty-five suffering from IBS unrelated to NCWS or other food &#x02018;intolerance,&#x02019; diagnosed according to standard criteria during the same study period, were chosen at random (randomized by computer generated method among the patients with a new CD or IBS diagnosis posed during the same study period) and enrolled as control groups. The same exclusion criteria used for the NCWS patients were applied to the control groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p>On entering the study all patients underwent serum assays and HLA-DQ typing for CD diagnosis (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Specific IgE (RAST) and/or skin prick tests for food allergens were performed on all patients, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Duodenal histology</title><p>Four to six biopsy specimens were obtained from the bulb and the second duodenal portion during gastroduodenoscopy, performed when the patients were on a wheat-containing diet. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and graded according to the original modified Marsh classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) per 100 villous epithelial cells was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The upper limit of the reference interval in our laboratory was 25 IEL/100 epithelial cells. The number of eosinophils (EOS) per high-power fields (HPFs, 40 X) was also assessed; the upper limit of the reference interval in our laboratory was 60 EOS/10 HPFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Elimination diet and double-blind placebo-controlled challenge method</title><p>On entering the study all patients commenced a standard elimination diet, with the exclusion of wheat, cow&#x02019;s milk, eggs, tomato and chocolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients self-reporting food hypersensitivity were also asked to avoid ingestion and/or contact with the food(s) causing symptoms. After four weeks on the elimination diet they underwent DBPC wheat challenges, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). During all phases of the study, including the challenge period, the severity of symptoms was recorded: the patients completed a 100&#x000a0;mm visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 representing no symptoms, which assessed overall symptoms and the specific symptoms they each reported. DBPC challenge for CMPs was performed using an identical method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], at least four weeks before or after wheat challenge and when the VAS score was &#x0003c;10, on the elimination diet. The challenges were stopped when clinical reactions occurred (increase in VAS score &#x0003e;30) for at least two consecutive days (onset of abdominal discomfort or pain, associated with a change in stool frequency and/or appearance). The challenges were considered positive if the same symptoms which had been initially present reappeared after their disappearance on the elimination diet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Other laboratory examinations</title><p>The nutritional status of each patient was defined at diagnosis by measuring the following laboratory indices: hemoglobin, serum albumin and triglycerides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Bone mineral density assessment</title><p>BMD was assessed at baseline by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), using a QDR Discovery Hologic DXA in the femoral neck and in the lumbar spine by total body DXA.

Repeated measurements of the lumbar spine of ten healthy volunteers were performed to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> precision of the absorptiometer. The average coefficient of variation was 2.1%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Physical examination and dietary assessment</title><p>At the start of the study, the BMI of all participants was recorded. The subjects also filled in a health and lifestyle questionnaire considering menarche, medical history and lifestyle habits (including physical activity, smoking and elimination diet, that is, wheat and other foods). The subjects also received a previously validated dietary form containing a printed list of the most common foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (for details see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Final forms were analyzed using a computerized database and calcium intake was calculated using a nutrient composition database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD) when the distribution was Gaussian and differences were calculated using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test.

Fisher&#x02019;s exact and Mantel-Haenszel tests, Pearson&#x02019;s correlation and Spearman's rank correlation were used where appropriate. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to evaluate the BMD differences between the three study groups; <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis and comparison between two groups was performed by means of the Bonferroni test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the presence of osteopenia and osteoporosis with the other clinical variables evaluated. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using the SPSS software package (version 16.0; Chicago, IL, USA).</p><p>The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Palermo, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, 80 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but 5 of them refused to undergo DXA and were excluded (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

However, some doubts persist about the pathogenic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and it has been suggested that wheat could cause gastrointestinal symptoms independently of its gluten-content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For these reasons we suggested the term &#x02018;non-celiac wheat-sensitivity&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A recent UK study showed that the self-reported prevalence of wheat-sensitivity was 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The prevalence of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet in the general population ranged between 0.55 and 3.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>However, nothing is known about the osteoporotic risk in this condition, whereas it is known that more than 75% of untreated celiac patients suffer from a loss of bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>We showed that the NCWS patients had a significantly lower bone mineral content than IBS controls both at the lumbar spine and at the femoral neck. Furthermore, 35 of the 75 NCWS patients (46.6%) had osteopenia or osteoporosis at one of the two sites. This high frequency of low bone mass in NCWS patients is much more relevant if it is considered that our study population included young subjects, mostly pre-menopausal women, with median age 36&#x000a0;years. These women will reach the age of menopause - the most critical period for bone loss risk - with bone mass already reduced.</p><p>Concerning the possible causes of osteopenia/osteoporosis in NCWS, we did not find any correlation with the degree of inflammation of the duodenal mucosa: there was no association with the Marsh 1 lesion (increased number of IELs) nor with the mucosal eosinophil infiltrate. The presence of the DQ2 or DQ8 HLA haplotypes was not associated with the presence of bone mass loss. On the whole these data seem to indicate that the mechanisms which cause osteoporosis in CD patients (malabsorption, inflammation, and so on) would not be pivotal in NCWS patients.</p><p>On the contrary, we found a direct correlation of bone mass loss with the BMI and hemoglobin values and these data could support the hypothesis of a role for malnutrition. In particular, it must be emphasized that about one third of our patient population reported weight loss of &#x0003e;10% of body weight during the last year, and that 42 NCWS patients (56%) had a BMI less than 20. Thus, the role of malnutrition seems very important in our study group.</p><p>We found that the dietary calcium intake of the NCWS patients (mean 615&#x000a0;mg/day) was significantly lower than that of the IBS controls, and much lower than the 1,000&#x000a0;mg/day commonly recommended. The selective malnutrition could be caused by self-restriction of the diet: 37 of the 75 NCWS patients reported self-exclusion of wheat before entering the study, and dietary calcium intake was significantly lower in patients with multiple food sensitivity than in patients with NCWS alone, probably because the latter patients excluded a higher number of foods from their diet. Bucci <italic>et al</italic>. reported 70% of NCWS patients excluded milk and dairy products from their diets to avoid symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; Tavakkoli <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the people self-diagnosed as &#x02018;wheat-sensitives&#x02019; had additional food avoidances including dairy (59%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A lower percentage (35%) of coexistent food intolerance has been recently reported in an Italian multicenter study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This suggests that NCWS patients need dietary support to avoid mineral or other nutrient deficiencies.</p><p>However, the limits of our study must be highlighted. We did not suggest a low fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) diet to our patients, and it has been demonstrated that there was no evidence of effect of gluten in patients with gluten-sensitivity placed on diets low in FODMAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, our patients became asymptomatic on the elimination diet and clearly reacted on DBPC wheat challenge, performed with a relatively small challenge dose of wheat. It is unlikely that our challenge method permitted us to identify many patients who are intolerant of the carbohydrate content of wheat, specifically fructans. Consequently, it is probable that we have studied a selected population which was different from that reported by Biesiekierski <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, our finding of the high prevalence of reduced bone mass and low BMI in NCGS patients must not be generalized.</p><p>We found a very high percentage of malnourished patients in our study group, but eating disorders were not regularly excluded by means of psychometric methods. In any case, the high percentage of NCWS patients with low BMI in our series could have influenced the high frequency of low BMD we found.</p><p>Furthermore, we cannot exclude that a percentage of our patients were in a &#x02018;pre-celiac condition&#x02019;, as could be suggested by the presence of DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes (41%), CD family history (24%) and duodenal lymphocytosis (52%). However, these are common findings in the NCWS population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>We were unable to provide data about Vitamin D levels, parathyroid hormone and markers of both bone synthesis and re-absorption; future studies need to clarify the possible mechanisms of osteoporosis in NCWS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found an elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients (46.6%). This was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with NCWS associated with other food sensitivity than in patients with NCWS alone. Dietary support should be strongly recommended at the time of NCWS diagnosis, whatever is its pathogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12916_2014_230_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
