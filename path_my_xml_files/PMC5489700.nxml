The UK TACT2 trial used a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design to test two hypotheses: whether use of accelerated epirubicin would improve time to tumour recurrence (TTR); and whether use of oral capecitabine instead of cyclophosphamide would be non-inferior in terms of patients' outcomes and would improve toxicity, quality of life, or both.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older from 129 UK centres who had histologically confirmed node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable breast cancer, had undergone complete excision, and were due to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> epirubicin either every 3 weeks (standard epirubicin) or every 2 weeks with 6 mg pegfilgrastim on day 2 of each cycle (accelerated epirubicin), followed by four 4-week cycles of either classic cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cyclophosphamide intravenously on days 1 and 8 or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally on days 1&#x02013;14; 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> methotrexate intravenously on days 1 and 8; and 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> fluorouracil intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle) or four 3-week cycles of 2500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> capecitabine (1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given twice daily on days 1&#x02013;14 of each cycle). The randomisation schedule was computer generated in random permuted blocks, stratified by centre, number of nodes involved (none vs one to three vs four or more), age (&#x02264;50 years vs &#x0003e;50 years), and planned endocrine treatment (yes vs no). The primary endpoint was TTR, defined as time from randomisation to first invasive relapse or breast cancer death, with intention-to-treat analysis of standard versus accelerated epirubicin and per-protocol analysis of CMF versus capecitabine.

At a median follow-up of 85&#x000b7;6 months (IQR 80&#x000b7;6&#x02013;95&#x000b7;9) no significant difference was seen in the proportions of patients free from TTR events between the accelerated and standard epirubicin groups (overall hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;94, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;81&#x02013;1&#x000b7;09; stratified p=0&#x000b7;42). At 5 years, 85&#x000b7;9% (95% CI 84&#x000b7;3&#x02013;87&#x000b7;3) of patients receiving standard epirubicin and 87&#x000b7;1% (85&#x000b7;6&#x02013;88&#x000b7;4) of those receiving accelerated epirubicin were free from TTR events. 4358 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis, and no difference was seen in the proportions of patients free from TTR events between the CMF and capecitabine groups (HR 0&#x000b7;98, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;85&#x02013;1.14; stratified p=0&#x000b7;00092 for non-inferiority). Compared with baseline, significantly more patients taking CMF than those taking capecitabine had clinically relevant worsening of quality of life at end of treatment (255 [58%] of 441 vs 235 [50%] of 475; p=0&#x000b7;011) and at 12 months (114 [34%] of 334 vs 89 [22%] of 401; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;001 at 12 months) and had worse quality of life over time (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Detailed toxicity and quality-of-life data were collected from 2115 (48%) of treated patients. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in cycles 1&#x02013;4 were neutropenia (175 [16%]) and fatigue (56 [5%]) of the 1070 patients treated with standard epirubicin, and fatigue (63 [6%]) and infection (34 [3%]) of the 1045 patients treated with accelerated epirubicin. In cycles 5&#x02013;8, the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (321 [31%]) and fatigue (109 [11%]) in the patients treated with CMF, and hand-foot syndrome (129 [12%]) and diarrhoea (67 [6%]) in the 1044 patients treated with capcitabine.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We found no benefit from increasing the dose density of the anthracycline component of chemotherapy.

No optimum regimen had been established and, although the benefits of adding taxanes to the previously established standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens had been shown, the absolute benefit for patients varied. Some evidence suggested that specific tumour types were not associated with much benefit. Findings from some studies indicated that shortening the interval between chemotherapy cycles by using growth factors to hasten the recovery of peripheral neutrophil concentrations improved efficacy. This approach was called accelerated chemotherapy, and was becoming the standard of care in parts of the world, but the designs of the trials on which use was based did not make it clear whether the benefits were due to the accelerated regimen alone. Perhaps the most important study that had been reported when we designed TACT2 was the US CALGB 9741 study, in which the schedule of the paclitaxel component (for which growth factor support is not needed) was also changed, but the relative contribution of that component was unclear. This is important because the use of growth factors not only adds to the cost of chemotherapy but also increases the risk of toxic effects. Toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy was, and remains, an important issue for patients, and in particular for one of the standard UK regimens, epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), it was observed in an analysis of two trials that all treatment-related deaths occurred while patients were taking CMF. We designed TACT2 to investigate whether use of accelerated epirubicin chemotherapy would improve time to tumour recurrence and whether using oral capecitabine instead of CMF would be non-inferior for efficacy but superior for toxicity, quality of life, or both.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>We found no benefit from accelerating the anthracycline component of a standard UK chemotherapy regimen. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the toxicity and tolerability of accelerated chemotherapy showed that accelerated epirubicin was not associated with fewer hospital admissions than standard epirubicin, as had been hoped, nor with better quality of life from the patients' perspective. Use of capecitabine instead of CMF after epirubicin was not associated with inferior disease outcomes, and was, as hypothesised, associated with a different and generally better tolerated toxicity profile. Importantly, this difference was confirmed by better patient-reported quality of life scores for women during capecitabine treatment than during CMF treatment. A notable effect was that fewer women receiving capecitabine became permanently menopausal than those taking CMF.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Several studies have indicated benefits or otherwise with accelerated chemotherapy in early breast cancer, but the regimens and schedules assessed have differed. A meta-analysis will be important to determine circumstances in which clear benefits can be achieved. The large size of TACT2 means it will be an important contributor to such an analysis. Our observations on the lack of subjective benefit on quality of life with accelerated epirubicin will be important to form part of any discussion between patients and doctors about the possible benefits and risks of using an accelerated chemotherapy regimen. We found also that capecitabine can be used after epirubicin without loss of efficacy and with improved toxicity and quality of life outcomes compared with CMF. Furthermore, for premenopausal women concerned about retaining ovarian function, epirubicin followed by capecitabine seemed to reduce the risk of permanent chemotherapy-induced menopause.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current outcomes for patients with early breast cancer reflect advances in diagnosis and therapy, including the standardisation of adjuvant systemic therapy.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Chemotherapy is administered to many patients with early breast cancer, and the use of anthracyclines has improved efficacy<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> compared with older non-anthracycline regimens. Although the addition of taxanes to anthracycline-based regimens has shown modest benefits, the growing recognition of breast cancer as a heterogeneous disease has prompted post-hoc analyses which suggest that benefits with different regimens, with or without taxanes, could be restricted to specific subgroups.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> From the early 2000s, when little advantage to patients was expected from the addition of taxanes, block-sequential epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) was the anthracycline regimen of choice in many UK hospitals.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, in an analysis of two similar trials involving 2391 women who received epirubicin followed by CMF or CMF alone, all 20 treatment-related deaths occurred during treatment with CMF (six among those receiving epirubicin followed by CMF and 14 among those receiving CMF alone).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A less toxic but equally effective alternative to CMF was, therefore, needed.

The CALGB 9741 trial<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> showed a significant advantage with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks compared with the standard of every 3 weeks.

We used a pragmatic 2&#x000d7;2 factorial study design, which allowed TACT2 to run throughout the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded National Cancer Research Network in England and affiliated research networks supported by the Departments of Health in other parts of the UK permitting recruitment of breast cancer patients from both teaching and district general hospitals across the UK.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>TACT2 is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial with a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design testing two hypotheses: first that accelerated epirubicin regimen will be superior in terms of time to tumour recurrence; and, second, that substituting CMF with the oral prodrug capecitabine will not worsen patients' outcomes and will offer advantages in terms of toxicity, quality of life, or both (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 42&#x02013;99</xref>). Patients were recruited from 129 UK centres (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Eligible patients were women or men aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed invasive primary breast carcinoma (T0&#x02013;3, N0&#x02013;2, M0)<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> who had undergone complete excision and were due to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients needed to be fit to receive any of the trial chemotherapy regimens and to have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Patients had to be randomised and able to start assigned treatments within 8 weeks of surgery. Exclusion criteria (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) included malignant disease in the previous 10 years, except ductal carcinoma in situ, basal-cell carcinoma, and cervical carcinoma in situ, locally advanced or distant disease, surgical margins involved at any tumour site in the final operative resection, and severe cardiac or renal disorders.</p><p>The study was approved by the Scotland Multi-Research Ethics Committee (MREC 04/MRE00/88) and local research and development offices. Patients provided written informed consent before enrolment. The Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK (ICR-CTSU), had overall responsibility for trial coordination with three collaborating clinical trials units (Cancer Clinical Trials Unit, Scotland, Edinburgh, UK; Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit, Leeds, UK; and Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, UK) that were responsible for randomisation and data management of patients within their geographical regions. Safety and efficacy data were reviewed regularly by an independent data monitoring committee. An independent trial steering committee provided trial oversight on behalf of the funders and sponsors. The trial management group was responsible for the day-to-day running of the trial. ICR-CTSU did all central statistical monitoring and the interim and final analyses.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>The randomisation schedule was generated by computer at ICR-CTSU in permuted blocks with sizes of eight and 12. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive standard epirubicin followed by CMF, accelerated epirubicin followed by CMF, standard epirubicin followed by capecitabine, or accelerated epirubicin followed by capecitabine. Randomisation was performed via a telephone call to one of the four clinical trials units. Patients were stratified by centre, number of nodes involved (none <italic>vs</italic> one to three <italic>vs</italic> four or more), age (&#x02264;50 years <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;50 years), and planned endocrine treatment (yes <italic>vs</italic> no). TACT2 was open label because the different treatment schedules made a double-blind design impractical.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Patients assigned to the standard epirubicin group received four treatment cycles with 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> epirubicin delivered every 3 weeks, and those assigned to the accelerated epirubicin group received four cycles with 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> epirubicin delivered every 2 weeks plus 6 mg pegfilgrastim given on day 2 of each cycle. In the standard epirubicin groups, patients could receive pegfilgrastim as secondary prophylaxis against neutropenia. Patients subsequently received four 4-week cycles of CMF (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cyclophosphamide intravenously on days 1 and 8 or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally on days 1&#x02013;14; 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> methotrexate intravenously on days 1 and 8; and 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> fluorouracil intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle) or four 3-week cycles of 2500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> capecitabine per day (1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given twice daily on days 1&#x02013;14 of each cycle).</p><p>Clinical, haematological, and biochemical assessments were done before the start of each cycle. Chemotherapy was administered only if neutrophil counts were 1&#x000b7;0&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L or more and platelet counts were 100&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets per L or more. Supportive care was provided as per the local policy. The protocol stressed the need to maintain the interval between cycles, such that during standard epirubicin and CMF chemotherapy, any delay of longer than 7 days required a 20% dose reduction to minimise the risk of further dose delays (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>After chemotherapy, standard radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and 1 year of trastuzumab treatment were given according to local and national guidelines, and patients were permitted to enter further selected trials of adjuvant therapy provided these did not compromise the aims of TACT2 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>).</p><p>Patients were followed up at 12, 18, and 24 months and then yearly for at least 10 years after randomisation, according to local practice for patients in trials of early breast cancer. Toxicity and clinical assessments were done at least every 6 months until the end of year 2 and annually thereafter. Imaging of the breasts (eg, by mammography or MRI) was done every 1 or 2 years for at least 10 years, in accordance with local practice. Patients in selected centres participated in a quality-of-life and toxicity substudy, for which data were obtained via questionnaires completed by patients and by collection of detailed information by clinicians. Due to logistical issues, collection of quality-of-life data was temporarily suspended part way through the trial and, therefore, lower numbers of patients are available for this analysis than that for acute toxicity. We used the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30-BR23,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Wu Cancer Fatigue Scale, Fatigue Symptoms Inventory (FSI), and the EQ-5D, and included TACT2-treatment-specific questions on toxicities during the treatment period (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 32&#x02013;33</xref>). Adverse events were assessed by clinicians after each chemotherapy cycle and graded with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) and coded by use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 10), with central clinical review done by DC, PC, and PB-L when needed. Data on use of National Health Service (NHS) resources, including hospital admissions, were collected after each chemotherapy cycle and at each clinical follow-up visit for up to 5 years after treatment. Data on other adjuvant treatments were collected 12 months after randomisation. Data on ovarian function in women who were premenopausal at the start of chemotherapy were collected 18 months after randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was time to tumour recurrence (TTR), defined as the time from randomisation to first invasive relapse or breast cancer death. Patients who remained free from TTR events, including those who died from other causes in the absence of breast cancer relapse, were censored at their date of last follow-up or death. Deaths occurring after distant recurrence were classified as breast cancer deaths, irrespective of stated cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause), invasive-disease-free survival (time from randomisation to first invasive relapse, new second primary breast cancer, or death from any cause), time to distant tumour recurrence (time from randomisation to first invasive distant relapse, excluding ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa, or to breast cancer death), and tolerability of the regimens (assessed by treatment adherence and frequency and nature of acute adverse events).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Questionnaires on quality of life and TACT2-treatment-specific toxicities were administered at baseline (after consent but before randomisation), at the end of standard or accelerated epirubicin, at the end of CMF or capecitabine, and at 12 and 24 months after the end of chemotherapy. The primary analysis of standard versus accelerated epirubicin was by intention to treat and the analysis of CMF versus capecitabine was per protocol.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We assumed the 5-year proportion of patients free from TTR events would be 80% after standard epirubicin followed by CMF. To test whether accelerated epirubicin was superior to standard epirubicin, we calculated that 3876 patients would be needed to detect a 4% absolute improvement from 80% to 84% (hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;78) with 5% two-sided significance and 90% power. To test the second hypothesis that capecitabine would be non-inferior to CMF, we calculated that 4400 patients would be needed to provide 80% probability that the lower 90% CI for the difference between the regimens would exclude 3% if the groups were truly equivalent. Owing to a lower than expected number of TTR events, the independent data monitoring committee revised the hazard ratio threshold as the trial evolved. Therefore, a target accrual of 4400 patients was chosen, giving approximately 92% power for the comparison of standard versus accelerated epirubicin (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>).</p><p>For survival-related endpoints, we plotted Kaplan-Meier curves and compared treatment groups with the log-rank test. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression models, with HRs less than 1&#x000b7;0 taken to favour accelerated epirubicin or capecitabine. Unless stated otherwise, analyses were unadjusted and stratified by the companion randomisation. Analyses adjusted for randomisation stratification factors are also presented; all centres that assigned fewer than 25 patients to treatment are grouped into one category. Superiority analyses for all efficacy endpoints were done by intention to treat. The non-inferiority analysis and additional sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were done per protocol (ie, including all patients who received at least one cycle of allocated treatment). We did further analyses in a priori defined subgroups: companion randomisation regimen, oestrogen-receptor status, HER2 status, nodal status, age, tumour grade, tumour size, and vascular invasion. We also did exploratory subgroup analyses by menopausal status and molecular subtype (local oestrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, and HER2 status).</p><p>For the standard epirubicin versus accelerated epirubicin comparison, we calculated the actual fraction of the intended dose density for epirubicin, defined as the observed dose density divided by the protocol planned dose density for standard epirubicin, with the mean expected to be 1&#x000b7;5 times higher than that in patients who received standard epirubicin. For CMF and capecitabine, we calculated relative dose intensities (separately for each drug), defined as the observed dose intensity divided by protocol planned dose intensity. For both comparisons, for each chemotherapy cycle not received a relative dose intensity of zero was assumed.</p><p>The acute safety analysis population included all patients in the quality-of-life and toxicity substudy who received at least one cycle of allocated chemotherapy. The analysis of late toxicities compared all signs and symptoms reported 12 months or later after randomisation. The worst grades of adverse events were compared between treatment groups using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for trend. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 adverse events in each treatment group was compared with Fisher's exact test. We took p values lower than 0&#x000b7;01 to be significant, which allowed some adjustment for multiple testing of safety endpoints.</p><p>The protocol specified two primary quality-of-life outcomes by which to compare CMF and capecitabine: overall quality of life, measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status quality-of-life scale (GHS/QOL), and HADS total score. Secondary prespecified measures of interest included EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales for physical function, role function, and fatigue; EORTC QLQ-C30-BR23 subscales for sexual function and systemic therapy side-effects; and the FSI, Wu Cancer Fatigue Scale, and TACT2-specific toxicity questions. Here we report only the findings from the primary quality-of-life assessment with EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL and the questions on TACT2-specific toxicity to supplement the adverse event data. The other findings will be reported separately. Cross-sectional analyses were done of differences in continuous EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL scores at the end of standard or accelerated epirubicin treatment, at the end of CMF or capecitabine treatment, and at 12 and 24 months after the end of the chemotherapy. For analyses of changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL scores between baseline and these timepoints, subscales were taken to be continuous and were dichotomised by whether or not a patient's quality of life had worsened by ten or more points.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Changes from baseline to each timepoint were compared between groups with ANCOVA with adjustment made for baseline scores. Generalised estimating equations models were used to analyse data longitudinally across all timepoints. In addition to randomised treatment, generalised estimating equations models included baseline score, time from baseline to follow-up questionnaire completion, component of quality-of-life study (before or after suspension), and age at randomisation. For patient-reported toxicity at each timepoint, the proportions of patients who reported suffering &#x0201c;quite a bit&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; were compared between treatment groups with Fisher's exact test. Proportions of patients reporting each score were compared across treatment groups with a trend test.</p><p>Analyses presented here are based on a database frozen on Aug 25, 2015.

The two treatment groups were well balanced for standard clinicopathological factors likely to influence outcomes, and we found no evidence of heterogeneity of effect by breast cancer subtype or nodal status. By contrast, our results support the second hypothesis, that capecitabine can be safely substituted for CMF, when given after single-agent epirubicin, without loss of efficacy and with improvements in toxicity profile and overall quality of life. We found no evidence in any subgroup of significantly inferior efficacy. Patients randomly assigned to capecitabine had fewer adverse events in most categories, with more adverse events seen than with CMF in only three: diarrhoea, hand&#x02013;foot syndrome, and neuropathy. For diarrhoea, which is a known side-effect of capecitabine, patients' self-reported severity did not differ significantly between the CMF and capecitabine treatment groups.</p><p>Patients in all groups had 5-year overall survival of around 90% with no unexpected adverse events. Fatal adverse events were rare and occurred at similar frequencies in all groups, although numerically more deaths due to infection were seen among patients receiving CMF and more vascular deaths were seen among patients receiving capecitabine. These deaths serve as a reminder that adjuvant chemotherapy is toxic. Thus, although even with an improved toxicity profile, use of capecitabine did not prevent all treatment-related deaths.</p><p>The results of our analysis of accelerated versus standard epirubicin might seem to be at odds with those from other studies. However, a meta-analysis of 3418 patients in four trials that included the CALGB 9741 study showed an overall significant benefit in terms of survival free from invasive disease for accelerated chemotherapy (HR 0&#x000b7;85, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;73&#x02013;0&#x000b7;95),<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> an estimate consistent with the data reported in TACT2, which assessed a larger population than these four trials combined. The CALGB 9741 study<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> reported a benefit in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy with increased dose density compared with standard therapy, but in contrast to TACT2, the anthracycline and the taxane components were both accelerated. In the Italian GIM2 study<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> better outcomes were also reported with accelerated chemotherapy than with standard chemotherapy. The CALGB 9840 study has further shown inferiority of paclitaxel given every 3 weeks compared with when given once per week.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In both of these studies, however, how much of the reported benefits were due to the altered paclitaxel schedule and how much to the accelerated administration of the anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based components remains unclear. The TACT2 data indicate that acceleration of only the anthracycline component alone provides little benefit to patients.</p><p>The TACT2 population differs from the populations in other trials in several ways. 54% of TACT2 patients had involved axillary nodes, whereas CALGB 9741<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and GIM2<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> only enrolled women with confirmed axillary involvement. 40% of patients in CALGB 9741 had more than three involved nodes compared with only 12% in TACT2. The benefits seen in the CALGB 9741 and GIM2 studies, therefore, might have been driven by the inclusion of higher-risk populations, and particularly patients with extensive nodal involvement. This possibility is supported by data from the AGO-ETC trial,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> in which the HR at 5 years for a dose-dense schedule was 0&#x000b7;64 among patients with ten or more involved nodes, compared with 0&#x000b7;79 for patients with four to nine involved nodes, although the difference was not significant. However, despite what other studies have suggested, we saw no benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy in patients with more than ten involved nodes (HR 0&#x000b7;82, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;51&#x02013;1&#x000b7;31). This difference between findings highlights the need for a meta-analysis of individual patients' data to determine whether or not traditional prognostic factors, such as extent of nodal involvement, identify subgroups of patients who will gain increased benefit from accelerated chemotherapy (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">table 7</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Risk of disease recurrence by nodal status in trials of dose-dense chemotherapy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left"><bold>Node negative</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>1&#x02013;3 nodes</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>&#x0003e;3 nodes</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">TACT2</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;00 (0&#x000b7;78&#x02013;1&#x000b7;28)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;87 (0&#x000b7;69&#x02013;1&#x000b7;09)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;97 (0&#x000b7;72&#x02013;1&#x000b7;30)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GIM2<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><xref rid="tbl7fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="left">N/A</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;88 (0&#x000b7;67&#x02013;1&#x000b7;11)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;68 (0&#x000b7;54&#x02013;0&#x000b7;86)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AGO ETC<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></td><td align="left">N/A</td><td align="left">N/A</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;72 (0&#x000b7;59&#x02013;0&#x000b7;87)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are hazard ratios (95% CI) for the primary endpoint (recurrence) by nodal subgroups.

Of the other studies, GIM2 was the only one to be done in the trastuzumab era, but only 130 (27%) of 480 patients with HER2-positive disease received this drug, which constituted 6% of the overall trial population (compared with 17% in our study), and in this small group no benefit was associated with accelerated chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> This difference alone, however, cannot explain the absence of benefit from accelerated chemotherapy in TACT2.</p><p>We had anticipated that epirubicin given every 2 weeks in our accelerated regimen would be associated with reduced risk of toxicity because of the use of primary prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Apart from the expected significant reduction in neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, patients in the accelerated epirubicin group had more adverse events, particularly low-grade events, than those in the standard epirubicin group. The overall quality of life was worse during accelerated epirubicin treatment than during standard epirubicin treatment, although this difference did not persist after this treatment ended.</p><p>Although other studies have tested the efficacy of additional capecitabine in early breast cancer (FINXX<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>, GBG - GeparQuattro<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>, CREATE-X<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>), only one other study of which we are aware, the CALGB 49907 study,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> has compared CMF and capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, and that trial showed inferior outcomes for patients assigned capecitabine. Older women at increased risk of recurrence were assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (a choice of four cycles of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin or six cycles of CMF) or single-agent capecitabine at a reduced dose of 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day. The study was stopped early due to inferiority of capecitabine when just over 600 patients had been enrolled, of whom less than half of the standard chemotherapy group had opted for CMF. The delivery of the chemotherapy seems to have been challenging in both groups. The overall poorer result for the capecitabine group was based on an early analysis (18 <italic>vs</italic> 24 distant recurrence events). An updated analysis suggested that the difference in efficacy between the two groups had reduced, and might only be significant in patients with hormone-receptor-negative tumours.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In the TACT2 trial, we used capecitabine after anthracycline chemotherapy, which might explain further the difference between our results and those in the CALGB 49997 study.</p><p>We conducted the acute substudy in only a large subset of patients since both regimens were well characterised clinically and the number needed to assess patient-reported outcomes and adverse events was not as large as that required for assessing the efficacy endpoint. This pragmatic solution aimed to maximise trial efficiency and is not seen as a limitation to the interpretation of the study.</p><p>Defining whether a toxicity profile is better for one treatment than another from the patients' perspective is not as straightforward as assessing relative efficacy with one disease-based endpoint, such as TTR. Patients, nurses, and doctors might classify the relevance of toxicity differently, and the inclusion of patient-reported adverse events is recommended to supplement clinician reporting.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> From a medical perspective, of the 12 adverse events for which the frequency of grade 3 or 4 events differed significantly between the CMF and capecitabine groups only two were more frequent with capecitabine (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). The differences are what would be expected from these therapies, with fatigue, nausea/vomiting, gastrointestinal and bone marrow events, and thromboembolism all being more frequent in patients receiving CMF, whereas only diarrhoea and hand&#x02013;foot syndrome were more frequent in patients receiving capecitabine.</p><p>How to synthesise from a patient's perspective a shift in toxicity profile between two similarly effective regimens is a conundrum. For some patients, although toxicities were numerically fewer with capecitabine, experiencing grade 3&#x02013;4 diarrhoea while taking this drug might be less acceptable than, for example, experiencing grade 3&#x02013;4 nausea, fatigue, and asymptomatic neutropenia while taking CMF.</p><p>Quality-of-life scales are designed to measure overall burden on patients, globally and within various subdomains. Our hypothesis that capecitabine would have better tolerability than CMF is confirmed by the main quality-of-life outcome, which showed worse self-reported global quality of life at the end of CMF treatment than at the end of capecitabine treatment, and this difference persisted at 12 and 24 months. Although the numbers of patients who completed quality-of-life questionnaires differed between groups, additional analyses suggested that at 12 months these differences were not associated with physician-reported adverse events at the same timepoint (data not shown).</p><p>An important difference in the toxicity profiles of capecitabine and CMF was the recovery of menstrual function in women who were premenopausal at enrolment. Evidence suggests that recovery of function could have resulted in a slightly less active endocrine regimen,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> but our findings do not allow us to draw conclusions on the relation between this and disease-related outcome. Importantly, recovery of menstrual function might be of benefit to younger women, given the increasing age at which many are starting families, with increasing numbers of women with early breast cancer requiring chemotherapy but also wishing to preserve their fertility. Although we do not know the numbers of women in this study who maintained fertility, the increased frequency of return of menses among those receiving capecitabine seems to offer this as an option to try and preserve ovarian function. Using ovarian suppression during chemotherapy to preserve menstrual function has had mixed results.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>There is no one universal standard regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. In the TACT2 study, we used a UK regimen of epirubicin followed by CMF that was standard care at the time. This regimen, along with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, was compared in the TACT trial<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> with an anthracycline and taxane regimen, against which there was no evidence of inferiority. In TACT2 we have shown that increasing the dose density of the anthracycline component of chemotherapy did not improve disease outcomes or quality of life. However, we did confirm that capecitabine may be used in place of CMF with reduced overall toxicity. For the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer, in patients in whom taxanes are not indicated or contraindicated, treatment with epirubicin followed by capecitabine in 3-week cycles is an effective, safe, and well tolerated option.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"
