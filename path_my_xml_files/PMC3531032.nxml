Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of use of various Probiotic products including curd. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of short-term consumption of probiotic curd containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and normal curd on salivary <italic>Streptococcus Mutans</italic> counts, as well as salivary pH.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty, caries-free, 10-12 years old children were selected and randomly allocated to two groups. Test Group consisted of 20 children who consumed 200ml of probiotic curd daily for 30 days. Control Group consisted of 20 children who were given 200ml of regular curd for 30 days. Salivary pH and salivary <italic>Streptococcus Mutans</italic> counts were recorded at baseline and after 30 days and statistically compared using the Student's <italic>t-test</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Consumption of probiotic curd resulted in a statistically significant reduction in <italic>S.

One of the antimicrobial approaches has been the use of probiotic-enriched products such as milk, ice cream, lozenges, cheese and yoghurt. Probiotic products contain living microorganisms such as <italic>bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>lactobacilli</italic>. Several of these normal dietary constituents contain microorganisms, which can function as probiotic agents. However, these specially formulated probiotic products contain around 10<sup>10</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> colony forming units of microorganisms per milliliter. The hypothesized mechanisms of action include (a) direct interactions in the dental plaque with interference of biofilm formation, plaque ecology, competing with oral microbes for the available substrate and production of antimicrobial substances and (b) Indirect actions including modulation of systemic immune function, local immunity, effect on nonimmunologic defense mechanisms, regulation of mucosal permeability and oral colonization by less pathogenic species.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The present study was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of short term consumption of probiotic curd containing lactobacillus acidophilus on salivary <italic>streptococcus mutans</italic> counts, its effect on salivary pH value and to compare this with normal curds in caries-free children.</p><p>Curds (Nestle fresh &#x02018;n&#x02019; natural dahi) was selected as it is a common dietary constituent of the Indian population, is readily available, inexpensive and can be used in several different combinations that are acceptable to the paediatric age group. Unlike milk and milk products, curd being semisolid may be retained in the oral cavity for a longer period of time with an extended beneficial effect. Further, this study aims to compare the relative effects of regular curd with a specially formulated probiotic curd (Nestle dahi with probiotic) that contains 10<sup>10</sup> colony forming units per milliliter of lactobacillus acidophilus. Several studies have shown that <italic>lactobacilli</italic> may inhibit the growth of other bacteria including <italic>streptococci</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> and <italic>lactobacilli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> by producing low molecular weight bacteriocins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>There have been no documented studies correlating the effect of probiotic containing curd on salivary pH. In the present study, salivary samples were used to determine any change in pH and <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts on the day before onset (baseline) and 30 days after the intervention period (consumption of probiotic curds). The assessment was therefore of the impact of probiotic, as well as normal curd on the general ecology of the oral cavity rather than a specific plaque evaluation.</p><p>On comparison of mean salivary pH in the Control Group, as well as the Test Group, a statistically significant lowering of mean pH value was seen at 30 days interval as compared to baseline [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>At 30 days interval, the mean pH value in Test Group was slightly higher as compared to the Control Group but this difference was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>This decrease in salivary pH on consumption of both probiotic containing curd and normal curd was primarily due to the acidic nature of the curds. However, the pH levels were still above the critical pH (5.2-5.5), which otherwise could have been considered as harmful for the causation or progression of dental caries. This further proves that curd though acidic in nature does not pose any risk for caries active children. Conversely it may prove beneficial due to its calcium, phosphorous, protein and vitamin content.</p><p><italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> has been implicated as one of the major and most virulent of the caries-producing organisms. Therefore, the effect of probiotic curd containing lactobacillus acidophilus on <italic>S. mutans</italic> count was looked into.</p><p>In this study, the <italic>S. mutans</italic> colony counts in the Test Group at 30-day time interval was significantly lower than at baseline. In the Control Group a slight but statistically insignificant reduction was observed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. The results are in accordance to other studies which support the use of probiotics against salivary <italic>streptococcus mutans</italic>, oral malodour and other oral infections like <italic>candida albicans</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> This effect against <italic>streptococcus mutans</italic> has been attributed to the general antimicrobial activity of curd rather than a specific competitive activity of curd microorganisms.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Due to the paucity of studies using curd/yoghurt a definite conclusion on the possible mechanism of action in reducing cariogenic bacteria could not be drawn from the present study. Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the effect of probiotic agents on oral ecology.</p><p>Lactobacilli have been implicated in the progression of dental caries especially in dentin. However, the use of <italic>lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> based milk product has been justified due to the good buffering capacity of milk, presence of tooth protective minerals including calcium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> However, the use of these products has been contraindicated in children with open carious lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Also in patients on long term use of probiotics monitoring of oral health becomes important along with lactobacilli counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> Most antimicrobial strategies are effective only as long as the patient is on the treatment. Following cessation of the intervention the oral bacterial counts rapidly return to the original counts. In this regard probiotics may prove to be beneficial especially when combined with a modification in dietary patterns along with effective restorative treatments.</p><p>Further studies need to be done in the use of these probiotic products in children with varying degrees of caries risk over a longer period of time. Monitoring of plaque microbial counts may provide additional indicators of the ecological changes that may occur with use of these products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study:</p><p>
