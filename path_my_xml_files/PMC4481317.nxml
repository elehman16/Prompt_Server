Recent studies have begun to elucidate brain-gut interactions with neuroimaging approaches such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the neural mechanism underlying different behavioral and physiological effects of glucose and fructose are unclear. In this paper, we have used resting state functional MRI to explore whether acute glucose and fructose ingestion also induced dissociable effects in the neural system. Using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we compared resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) strengths within the basal ganglia/limbic network in 12 healthy lean males. Each subject was administered fructose, glucose and placebo on three separate occasions. Subsequent correlation analysis was used to examine relations between rsFC findings and plasma concentrations of satiation hormones and subjective feelings of appetite. Glucose ingestion induced significantly greater elevations in plasma glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and GIP, while feelings of fullness increased and prospective food consumption decreased relative to fructose. Furthermore, glucose increased rsFC of the left caudatus and putamen, precuneus and lingual gyrus more than fructose, whereas within the basal ganglia/limbic network, fructose increased rsFC of the left amygdala, left hippocampus, right parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and precentral gyrus more than glucose. Moreover, compared to fructose, the increased rsFC after glucose positively correlated with the glucose-induced increase in insulin. Our findings suggest that glucose and fructose induce dissociable effects on rsFC within the basal ganglia/limbic network, which are probably mediated by different insulin levels. A larger study would be recommended in order to confirm these findings.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>BKW was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF: Marie Heim-Voegtlin subsidy PMPDP3-145486/1), SB, CB and RP receive grant support from the SNSF (grant no. 138 157) and AS was supported by FAG Basel.

Appetite regulation is mediated via a functional interplay between homeostatic and non-homeostatic brain areas [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides the hypothalamus as the central gateway, reward-related brain regions such as the striatum or the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) have also been implicated in feeding behavior [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In particular, it has been suggested that striatal responses to food may reflect the hedonic and rewarding value of feeding, while other regions including the OFC, amygdala and hippocampus may be more related to motivational and cognitive aspects of food control [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Responses in these brain regions depend on levels of peripheral satiation hormones [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In order to maintain appropriate levels of energy balance, ingested nutrients trigger a variety of satiation signals (e.g. GIP, gastric inhibitory polypeptide; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1) with immediate effects on appetite, whereas adiposity signals (e.g. leptin and insulin) are responsible for the long-run maintenance of energy balance [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent studies show that insulin and leptin reduce reward-driven food intake as well and thus also have an immediate appetite-suppressing effect [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Fructose is a monosaccharide naturally found in honey and fruits. High-fructose corn syrup&#x02014;a mixture of glucose and fructose in varying concentrations&#x02014;is increasingly used in soft drinks and is partially held responsible for the worldwide increase in fructose consumption. Chronic fructose consumption may adversely affect human health by leading to increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver, hyperuricemia, insulin resistance and obesity [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Fructose consumption might even contribute to continuous food intake and exert symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal by down regulation of dopamine receptors in reward-sensitive pathways [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Glucose is a highly potent secretagogue leading to release of insulin and satiation peptides by enteroendocrine cells and inhibits the release of the appetite inducer ghrelin. In contrast, fructose intake does not affect the release of the above-mentioned peptides to the same extent [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and rather than suppressing the intake of additional food, calories from fructose seem to add on to the total calorie intake [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The global obesity problem supports the urgent need for research that aims to understand the basic mechanisms that regulate food intake, appetite and body weight. However, it is unclear how different behavioural and physiological responses to glucose and fructose are mirrored in the neural system including sensory, cognitive and reward processes. Therefore, we are exploring the role of ingested nutrients in triggering adaptive processes in the brain by uncovering the temporal relations between gut and brain signals that control eating and feeding behaviour and energy consumption.</p><p>To address this question, we used resting state functional MRI to examine neural changes after the acute ingestion of fructose in comparison with glucose. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) is based on the analysis of low-frequency fluctuations present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These low-frequency fluctuations have been shown to be temporally correlated within spatially distinct but functionally related resting state networks establishing an intrinsic functional architecture [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Resting state functional connectivity analysis is particularly suitable to examine brain functions including sensory, cognitive and reward processes [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previous resting state fMRI studies have detected a basal ganglia/limbic network during rest, which subsumes the striatum, the thalamus and the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Many of these regions are strongly implicated in reward processes and dopamine function [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Primary outcome of this study was to examine differences between glucose and fructose administration with respect to resting state functional connectivity within the basal ganglia/limbic network. The secondary outcome was to examine whether these effects are related to the behavioral and physiological effects of glucose and fructose. We hypothesized that fMRI would show a different pattern of activation within the neural reward network after fructose versus glucose ingestion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The original protocol is included under supplemental material. Morbidly obese volunteers have also been examined; however, this data is not included in this manuscript as it is currently being analyzed.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twelve right-handed male volunteers (mean age: 24.8 years, range: 21&#x02013;31 years and mean BMI: 22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, range: 21&#x02013;24.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were analyzed. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Basel, Switzerland (EKBB: 08/11) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were recruited by word of mouth over a period of three months (March 2012- June 2012). Each participant underwent a medical interview, laboratory screening and gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: smoking, substance abuse, regular intake of medications, medical or psychiatric illness, fructose intolerance and any contraindication to MRI (e.g. claustrophobia, non-removable metal devices), and any abnormalities detected upon laboratory screening. Of the fourteen subjects originally recruited two had to be excluded as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. There was also one drop-out who was replaced. Hence, complete data from 12 subjects were obtained for analysis. The purpose of this study is to gain basic information on the physiologic role of the aforementioned carbohydrates on regional blood flow in the brain. Samples size of this study was chosen on the basis of practical considerations rather than statistical estimation. However, according to our experience, a sample size of 12 subjects will most likely allow to detect large differences in parameters (&#x0003e; 50%) between the treatments groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design and experimental procedures</title><p>The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial and was carried out at the Phase one Research Unit of the University Hospital of Basel. Each subject was administered fructose, glucose and placebo on three separate occasions. The treatment order was randomized within a subject and the time between these visits was at least 7 days.</p><p>After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, an 8F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach through an anaesthetized nostril and its intragastric position was confirmed by rapid injection of 10ml of air and auscultation of the upper abdomen. A peripheral venous cannula was inserted for blood sample collection. Two baseline blood samples were taken and appetite perceptions (feelings of: a) hunger, b) satiety, c) fullness and d) prospective food consumption) were assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS) [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The solutions were freshly prepared and were at room temperature when administered. Glucose monohydrate and fructose were purchased from Haenseler AG (Herisau, Switzerland). In order to maintain the blind differing persons prepared and administered the treatment. Subjects received 300ml of tap water with 75g of glucose or with 25g of fructose, or 300ml pure tap water (placebo) via nasogastric tube over 2 minutes while sitting in the MR room. After administration, the feeding tube was removed and the subjects underwent resting state MRI scanning, which began within 5 minutes after administration of the test solution. After 15 and 60 minutes blood samples were taken and VAS recorded. Visual analogue scales consisted of a horizontal, unstructured, 10-cm line representing the minimum (0.0 points) to the maximum rating (10.0 points). Subjects assigned a vertical mark across the line to indicate the magnitude of their subjective sensation at the present time point. The measurement was quantified by the distance from the left end of the line (minimum rating) to the subject&#x02019;s vertical mark.</p><p>Blood samples were taken after glucose and fructose treatment, no blood samples were collected after placebo treatment. Subjects were told that blood sampling was randomized and hence did not associate no blood samples with placebo treatment. Blood samples were collected into chilled tubes containing EDTA (6 &#x003bc;mol/L blood), a protease-inhibitor cocktail (Complete, EDTA-free, 1 tablet/50mL blood, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (10&#x003bc;l/mL blood, Millipore Corp., St. Charles, Missouri, U.S.A). After centrifugation (3000rpm, 10 min at 4 C), plasma samples were processed into different aliquots and kept frozen at -70 C until analysis. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after each study day.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Laboratory analysis</title><p>Active GLP-1 was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). This kit is for non-radioactive quantification of GLP-1 (7&#x02013;36) in serum and EDTA plasma samples; it is highly specific and does not detect other forms of GLP-1. The lowest level of GLP-1 that can be detected by this assay is 0.5 pmol/L when a 100-&#x003bc;L plasma sample is used. Insulin was measured with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (CIS Bio International, Bagnols, France). This kit is for quantitative determination of insulin in human serum and plasma (EDTA), is highly specific for insulin and shows no cross-reactivity with other peptides, e.g., C-peptide or glucagon. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for this assay are &#x0003c;12.2 and 9.0%, respectively. The lowest level of insulin that can be detected by this assay is 4.6 &#x003bc;U/mL. Plasma glucose concentration was measured by a commercially available glucose oxidase method (Bayer Consumer Care, Basel, Switzerland). This method is highly specific for measurement of glucose in serum or plasma. The lowest level of glucose that can be detected by this assay is 0.6 mmol/L. GIP was measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). This kit is used for non-radioactive quantification of human GIP in serum and EDTA plasma samples and has 100% cross reactivity to human GIP (1&#x02013;42) and GIP (3&#x02013;42). The lowest level of GIP that can be detected by this assay is 4.2 pg/mL when a 20-&#x003bc;L plasma sample is used. The intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation for this assay are below 8.8 and 6.1%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Resting state functional MRI</title><p>For the resting-state scan (5 minutes), subjects were instructed to lie in dimmed light with their eyes open, to think of nothing in particular, and not to fall asleep.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Scanning was performed on a 3 T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Verio) 5 minutes post-treatment.

MELODIC is a powerful data-driven model-free approach for finding independent patterns in multivariate data (i.e. resting state networks such as the basal ganglia/limbic network). Preprocessing consisted of motion correction using MCFLIRT (Motion Correction using FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool) [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], removal of non-brain tissue with BET (Brain Extraction Tool) [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], spatial smoothing using a 5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel, and high-pass temporal filtering equivalent to 111.1 seconds. FLIRT was used to register the functional EPI volumes in each individual subject&#x02019;s high-resolution MPRAGE image and to assign the MPRAGE data to the standard space template (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI152 T1 1 mm3). Preprocessed functional data containing 152 time points for each subject were temporally concatenated across subjects in order to create a single 4D data set. The data set was decomposed into independent components, with a free estimation for the number of components. The number of subjects in each group was equal, in order to avoid skewing independent components in favor of a particular population/treatment. Group independent component analysis (GICA) was used to identify the basal ganglia/limbic network. This network has been previously noted in other resting state fMRI studies using independent component analysis [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A dual regression approach [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with nonparametric permutation (5000) tests (randomize [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], FSL) were carried out to detect statistically significant differences between treatments (placebo vs. fructose, placebo vs glucose, glucose vs fructose) within the boundaries of the spatial map (basal ganglia/limbic network) obtained with GICA. As this is a pilot study with a rather small sample of 12 subjects, we considered a significance threshold of p&#x0003c; 0.05 uncorrected using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used for demographic variables (age, weight, height, and BMI). Hormone and glucose profiles were analyzed by calculating pharmacodynamic parameters: area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and &#x00394;AUC. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal method [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The parameters were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Hormone profiles (AUC 0&#x02013;60 min) were compared using Student&#x02019;s paired t-test. Pearson correlation was used to assess the relation between hormone release 0&#x02013;15 minutes post-treatment and rsFC. The FC strengths were indexed by parameter estimates (z-scaled) but only of the significant voxels obtained from the treatment comparisons of interest.

We first showed that glucose increased feelings of fullness and decreased prospective food consumption compared with fructose. Secondly, glucose ingestion induced significantly greater elevations in plasma glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and GIP concentrations compared to fructose. Thirdly, glucose relative to fructose ingestion increased rsFC of the left caudatus and putamen, precuneus and lingual gyrus, whereas fructose relative to glucose increased rsFC of the left amygdala, left hippocampus, right parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and precentral gyrus within the basal ganglia/limbic network. Finally and perhaps most interestingly, we found that the increased rsFC after glucose correlated positively with the glucose-induced increase in insulin relative to fructose, which suggests a relationship between physiological and neural effects.</p><p>Fructose consumption from industrially produced foods is increasing worldwide, and this may be accompanied by adverse metabolic consequences [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, there were only minimal changes in satiation hormones after fructose ingestion, which is in line with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Various trials have been carried out to answer the question of whether fructose consumption has the same or even stronger satiating effects than glucose or on the contrary results in increased food intake [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In animal studies fructose increased subsequent food intake&#x02014;an orexigenic effect&#x02014;while glucose led to satiation [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In humans, fructose triggers minimal release of satiation hormones and adiposity signals combined with attenuated postprandial suppression of ghrelin; this suggests that food intake may be stimulated by fructose intake as well [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, gastric emptying&#x02014;another important satiety signal&#x02014;is decelerated by glucose ingestion, but apparently not by fructose ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The failure of fructose to influence appetite perception is consistent with this. Of note, placebo values lie in between fructose and glucose (<xref rid="pone.0130280.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) as if fructose led to less satiation than placebo or to put it the other way round: as if fructose might even promote hunger. However, no statistical significance could be reached between the respective carbohydrate and placebo and additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm this finding. Previous fMRI studies investigating hypothalamic reactions have compared intravenous with oral glucose administration and showed that the effect is much stronger after oral ingestion, which emphasizes the importance of gut-signalling [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A recent resting state functional MRI investigation found that glucose ingestion increased FC between the hypothalamus, thalamus and striatum, whereas fructose increased FC between the hypothalamus and thalamus but not the striatum [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although we used a different methodological approach&#x02014;with a focus on the basal ganglia/limbic network rather than on the hypothalamus&#x02014;our results are in line with these findings: glucose but not fructose increased FC of the caudatus and putamen to the basal ganglia/limbic network. Interestingly, Page et al. found a negative correlation between striatal blood flow and the glucose-induced change in insulin levels, which suggests that anorexigenic peptides such as insulin decrease the sensitivity of the brain reward system to food reward [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our study, we found that the increased striatal connectivity to the basal ganglia network after glucose relative to either fructose or water administration correlated positively with the glucose-induced insulin level. This seems to be at odds with Page et al.&#x02019;s finding of an inverse relationship between insulin release and striatal activity [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, besides the fact that they used equicaloric doses of fructose and glucose (75g vs. 75g), there is an important temporal discrepancy in the methodical design of the studies: While Page et al. employed a 60-minute post-ingestion acquisition period of pulsed arterial spin labeling and functional MRI sequences, we examined our subjects directly after glucose and fructose ingestion with one resting state sequence. Our rationale for this time frame is that the peak of hormone release is found at about 10&#x02013;15 minutes post ingestion and fructose is rapidly converted to glucose in the liver so that the time window for distinguishing fructose from glucose effects in the brain is very short [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More importantly, 75g of fructose is a very high load and can cause adverse events even in healthy subjects: 25g is the highest load of fructose absorbed by healthy volunteers and a fructose load of 50g induces unspecific results in 40&#x02013;60% of individuals [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, we used 75g of glucose (as in a standard glucose tolerance test) and 25g of fructose (the highest absorbable load).</p><p>The acute rewarding effect of food intake is probably mediated by dopamine [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, in humans, ingestion of palatable food has been shown to release dopamine in the dorsal striatum in proportion to the self-reported level of pleasure [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This striatal rewarding effect corresponds to the subjective effects of acute drug intake that are mediated by reinforcement signals in the striatum, and may imply that there are overlaps in the brain circuits underlying food intake and drug-intake [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We propose that the acute increase in striatal connectivity to the basal ganglia network after glucose ingestion may mediate a state of satiation, which was modulated by insulin release. This interpretation is consistent with a recent study that showed that glucose ingestion in insulin-sensitive subjects leads to significantly greater dopamine release in the brain reward regions than in insulin-resistant subjects [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, fructose did not increase striatal connectivity to the basal ganglia network as seen after glucose in this study, but increased FC of the amygdala, hippocampus and OFC (orbito-frontal cortex) compared with glucose. One may ask whether this neural pattern corresponds to the fact that food intake in humans might even be stimulated rather than blocked by fructose intake [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The motivation for a continued food intake after chronic fructose exposure may be driven by down regulation of dopaminergic D2 receptors in reward-sensitive pathways [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The decreased activation of dopaminergic targets by the current food consumption might lead to overconsumption to compensate for the weak dopamine signals [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, OFC activity has been positively associated with food craving in lean subjects [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that when lean individuals were asked to inhibit their food craving when exposed to cues, their activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and OFC decreased [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Considering the relevance of these regions in drug addiction, evidence has consistently demonstrated FC between the OFC and amygdala during withdrawal-induced craving [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The OFC appears to be important for stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, i.e., it drives the motivation for new drug intake, during which it is reciprocally connected with the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, OFC activation is correlated with hunger ratings during presentation of food items [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An infusion of ghrelin, which heightens appetite, increases the amygdala response to food images [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both fasting and ghrelin administration also increased hippocampus activation to food pictures [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], whereas insulin decreases OFC activity [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this case, fructose did not stimulate insulin release and did not suppress ghrelin release as shown in previous studies by our group [<xref rid="pone.0130280.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and failed to influence appetite perception; we therefore suggest that the fructose-induced increase in OFC, amygdala and hippocampus FC to the basal ganglia network indicates a drive for renewed food intake. This interpretation is further supported by the positive correlation between the effect of fructose on OFC connectivity and subjective feelings of hunger. We propose that fructose stimulates dopaminergic regions that mediate the reward and reinforcement effect of food intake insufficiently. However, this is clearly speculative at the present time and many more studies are needed to support such an interpretation.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the explicit focus on the basal ganglia/limbic network without considering its interaction with the homeostatic system after glucose and fructose administration; this point should be addressed in future studies. However, we explicitly focused on this network as it includes the key region for reward, i.e. the striatum. Another point of contention may be that our analysis only revealed uncorrected results in terms of appetite perception and resting state functional connectivity. The sample size in this pilot study was modest as these controlled repeated measures within-subject design studies are logistically demanding. Nevertheless, larger sample sizes are required to draw more statistically valid inferences. Furthermore, both sexes should be included and effects of low, equicaloric doses of fructose and glucose should be examined as well (e.g. 25g glucose and 25g fructose).</p><p>In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first resting state functional MRI study addressing the effect of acute glucose and fructose ingestion. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that fructose modulates FC to the basal ganglia network in a different manner to glucose. These distinct effects may help explain why and how glucose and fructose have different behavioral and physiological effects.</p><p>More imaging research with larger sample sizes is needed to understand how glucose and fructose modulate the neural system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130280.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130280.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130280.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Treatment differences of resting state functional connectivity to the basal ganglia network relative to placebo.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130280.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130280.s003"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>TREND checklist.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130280.s003.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130280.s004"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>TREND checklist.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130280.s004.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0130280.s005"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>TREND checklist.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0130280.s005.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the infrastructural support of the Medical Image Analysis Centre, University Hospital Basel.
