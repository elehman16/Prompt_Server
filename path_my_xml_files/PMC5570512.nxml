Despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combined with other drugs as standard of care [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], many patients have asthma that requires either treatment with high-dose ICS plus a second controller, or the addition of systemic corticosteroids to gain control; these patients are considered to have severe asthma [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Patients who have severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, as characterised by elevated blood and/or sputum eosinophil counts, have increased exacerbation rates, impaired lung function, poorer symptom control and lower quality of life (QoL) compared with patients with non-eosinophilic asthma [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Blood eosinophil counts &#x02265;400&#x02005;cells&#x000b7;&#x003bc;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> have a proven association with increased frequency and severity of clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs) and poor asthma control [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This has led to the development of novel therapies that target the molecular regulators of eosinophil function in asthma pathophysiology.</p><p>Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the key regulator of eosinophil maturation, mobilisation from the bone marrow and recruitment to sites of inflammation [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Reslizumab, an intravenously administered humanised anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, has been developed to inhibit the pro-inflammatory action of IL-5 on eosinophils [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Reslizumab has been approved in the USA, the EU and Canada as add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 18&#x02005;years and older with severe eosinophilic asthma [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Owing to insufficient clinical data in patients aged &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years, reslizumab is not currently approved for use in children (aged &#x02264;11&#x02005;years) or adolescent patients (aged 12&#x02013;17&#x02005;years) [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of reslizumab <italic>versus</italic> placebo have been demonstrated in duplicate placebo-controlled Phase III studies, in patients with inadequately controlled asthma and elevated blood eosinophils (&#x02265;400&#x02005;cells&#x000b7;&#x003bc;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) who were aged 12&#x02013;75&#x02005;years [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For inclusion in these studies, eligible patients were receiving at least a medium dose of ICS (&#x02265;440&#x02005;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fluticasone proprionate, or equivalent) with or without another controller drug (long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (LABA), oral corticosteroids (OCS), leukotriene receptor inhibitors (LTRI), lipoxygenase inhibitors or cromolyn sodium) [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], representing Step 3&#x02013;5 treatment according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Data from both studies demonstrated that, compared with placebo, reslizumab significantly reduced the annual frequency of asthma exacerbations by 54% (pooled data, p&#x0003c;0.0001), and reduced the occurrence of CAEs requiring at least 3&#x02005;days of OCS use by 57% (p&#x0003c;0.0001) with a safety profile comparable to that of placebo [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Reslizumab treatment also rapidly improved lung function, with patients showing significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) at the first on-study assessment (week 4) (p&#x0003c;0.05) that were sustained throughout the study [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patient-reported outcomes (Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores) were also significantly improved from first on-study assessment throughout the study, demonstrating increased control of symptoms and improved QoL [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We performed a secondary analysis of the Phase III data to determine the efficacy of reslizumab as add-on therapy in patients receiving asthma treatment per Step 4 and Step 5 of the GINA guidelines at baseline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Both studies included in this analysis were Phase III, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies to assess the efficacy and safety of reslizumab (3&#x02005;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>

Relevant health authorities and local ethics committees or institutional review boards approved the study protocols, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Patients were stratified into GINA Step 4 and Step 5 groups based on their baseline medications at the time they were randomised to treatment arms in the duplicate studies. Patients comprising the Step 4 group were defined as receiving &#x02265;2 controllers (medium-to-high dose ICS plus a LABA or LTRI) plus as-needed reliever medication; the Step 5 group was defined as receiving add-on treatment with OCS. Patients with insufficient information on their baseline medication were excluded from these analyses to ensure the integrity of the Step 4 and Step 5 subsets.</p><p>All efficacy endpoints were assessed in the intent-to-treat population (all randomised patients aged 12&#x02013;75&#x02005;years). CAE frequency was analysed using a negative binomial regression model as previously described [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Rate ratios (RRs) <italic>versus</italic> placebo (with 95% CIs) were estimated using the same model.</p><p>The secondary endpoints were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures with treatment, study visit, treatment by visit interaction and stratification factors as fixed factors, and covariates for baseline value and patient as a random effect. For pulmonary function endpoints, the model also included sex and height.</p><p>The proportions of patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in AQLQ or ACQ-7 scores (a &#x02265;0.5-point change in score) [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were analysed using a stratified Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test. Data were pooled from both studies to perform subgroup analyses for primary and secondary endpoints.</p><p>Further sub-analyses were performed based on the types and doses of medications received at baseline. In the GINA Step 4 group, only 11 patients were receiving ICS and LTRI at baseline (seven in the placebo group and four in the reslizumab group); because of the limited data available for this subgroup, meaningful statistics for CAEs, FEV<sub>1</sub> and patient-reported outcomes could not be calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient population</title><p>Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are summarised in <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.

These benefits can be seen in patients requiring either GINA Step 4 or Step 5 therapy. Patients requiring Step 5 therapy, by definition, have more severe asthma and are more likely to experience a CAE than patients at Step 4. In the previous publication, data were presented for the overall patient populations including Step 3, Step 4 and Step 5 patients. The data from our sub-analyses clearly show that, in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, reslizumab reduces the CAE rate in Step 4 and Step 5 treatment groups, with the most pronounced reduction occurring in the Step 5 group.</p><p>In general, the magnitude of the improvements in CAE rate and FEV<sub>1</sub> with reslizumab <italic>versus</italic> placebo was greater in the Step 5 group than the Step 4 group, which might be attributed to the severity of their disease and the potential room for improvement in patients requiring Step 5 treatment. The Step 5 patient population may represent the proposed T-helper-2-high asthma endotype that is characterised by severe asthma, with airway and systemic eosinophilia, responsiveness to glucocorticoids and inhibitors of type-2 inflammation, such as IL-5 [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such a population is likely to be highly responsive to immune-directed therapies that target regulators of eosinophil function.</p><p>In terms of exacerbations, not only did reslizumab reduce the rate of exacerbations in both groups, it also reduced the occurrence of the most severe exacerbations requiring healthcare utilisation. The use of a therapy that reduces the exposure to OCS and the need for hospitalisation/admission has the potential to decrease the burdens placed on patients with uncontrolled severe asthma and the emergency departments treating them.</p><p>Interestingly, the QoL benefits provided by reslizumab are comparable in Step 4 and Step 5 groups, despite the differences in CAE, FEV<sub>1</sub> and ACQ endpoints in Step 4 and Step 5 groups. Approximately 40% of patients in the study populations have no history of atopy and 42% and 66% in Step 4 and Step 5 groups, respectively, are not allergic (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The improvements in QoL seen upon treatment with reslizumab may not be fully captured by the AQLQ.</p><p>Phase III studies of other antibodies targeting IL-5 or its receptor have also demonstrated reductions in exacerbation rates and improvements in lung function [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Treatment with the anti-IL-5 antibody mepolizumab subcutaneously or intravenously for 32&#x02005;weeks resulted in a 47&#x02013;53% reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared with placebo in 576 patients with recurrent exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation. The mean increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> was also 98&#x02013;100&#x02005;mL greater in mepolizumab-treated patients [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, two Phase III trials of the anti-IL-5 receptor antibody benralizumab have reported comparable reductions in exacerbation rates and improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> after 48&#x02013;56&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; treatment every 4 or 8&#x02005;weeks [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data support the use of therapies targeting IL-5 stimulation in treatment of asthma in patients with elevated eosinophil levels, though differences in patient characteristics, eosinophil levels and trial design preclude direct comparison between trials. Also, efficacy of benralizumab and mepolizumab specifically in Step 4 and Step 5 patients is not reported in these studies. Overall, the data from our sub-analyses are consistent with those previously published for Phase III clinical studies of reslizumab and add to the body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on these data, we conclude that reslizumab reduces exacerbation rates and improves lung function and patient-reported outcomes in adult patients with eosinophilic asthma receiving therapy according to GINA Step 4 and 5.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supplementary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/23120541.00004-2017.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Tables S1 and S2 <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="00004-2017_supp.pdf" content-type="local-data">00004-2017_supp</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="disclosures"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/23120541.00004-2017.Supp2</object-id><p>G.
