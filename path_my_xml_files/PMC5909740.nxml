Enough social support can promote the treatment adherence and outcome of the elderly patients with TB. Exploring effective interventions to improve the social support of patients is of great significance for TB management and control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A community-based, repeated measurement trial was conducted. Patients with TB &#x0003e;65 years of age were allocated into the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group received comprehensive social support interventions, while those in the control group received health education alone. The social support level of patients was measured at baseline and at the first, third and sixth months during the intervention to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive social support interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 201 patients were recruited into the study. Compared with the control group, social support for patients in the intervention group increased significantly over time (&#x003b2;<sub>group*time</sub>=0.61, P&#x0003c;0.01) in the following three dimensions: objective support (&#x003b2;<sub>group*time</sub>=0.15, P&#x0003c;0.05), subjective support (&#x003b2;<sub>group*time</sub>=0.32, P&#x0003c;0.05) and support utilisation (&#x003b2;<sub>group*time</sub>=0.16, P&#x0003c;0.05). The change in the scores in the control group was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention programme in communities, including health education, psychotherapy and family and community support interventions, can improve the social support for elderly patients with TB compared with single health education.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ChiCTR-IOR-16009232</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>the elderly</kwd><kwd>social support</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Social Science Fund of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovation Research Fund of Huazhong University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although great progress in tuberculosis (TB) control has been made over the last two decades,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> TB remains one of the biggest health problems in China.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Concurrently, WHO reported that the burden of TB disease is shifting to the elderly,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> as the proportion of the older population will increase from 12.4% in 2010 to 28% in 2040 in China.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> According to the fifth national TB survey conducted in China in 2010, the TB prevalence increased with age and peaked in the 75&#x02013;79 age group.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> TB in the elderly has already become a problem beyond neglect for TB control in China.</p><p>Advanced age, concomitant diseases and waning immunity make older people vulnerable to developing TB due to the reactivation of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> from infection at a young age.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Compared with other people, elderly individuals with TB need more support because they are more likely to experience negative life events, such as reduced mobility, loss of social status, loneliness after retirement, stigma, social isolation, financial burden and adverse effects of medication.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> A qualitative study found that educational, psychological and emotional supports were needed for these patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Evidence has shown that social support is positively associated with health-seeking behaviours, treatment adherence and health outcomes and that it can act as a stress buffer for the psychosocial well-being of patients.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> However, a study conducted in Zhejiang Province of China reported that patients with TB had a low level of social support.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It is meaningful to explore feasible and effective social support interventions in communities for TB management and control.</p><p>Social support intervention in patients with TB was recommended by WHO for the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB and the new End TB Strategy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Social support via various educational, psychosocial interventions has also been implemented to enhance treatment adherence.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, as the types of support, patterns of intervention, target groups and study settings were different, the magnitude of the benefit of these social support interventions should be considered with caution.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Additionally, most of the studies focused on the effect of social support interventions on treatment adherence or outcomes. Hardly any study assessed the effect of these interventions on the level of social support patients perceived. The social support patients perceived may act as an intermediate variable between the social support intervention and the treatment adherence or outcomes. Exploring the effect of social support interventions on the level of social support of patients can help to understand how social support intervention influences the treatment adherence or treatment outcomes of patients.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no research has explored interventions to improve the social support of elderly patients with TB in China. Therefore, based on the hypothesis that comprehensive social support interventions might increase the social support of the elderly with TB, we conducted this community-based trial to assess the effects of the comprehensive interventions on the improvement of social support of elderly patients with TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study settings</title><p>This study was conducted in Hubei Province, China, from November 2015 to April 2016. Hubei Province is one of the top 10 high TB-incidence provinces in China and the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) strategy has been well implemented among its&#x000a0;communities.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> After treated in hospitals for the intensive phase, patients with TB are treated as outpatients in communities. Community health centres are responsible for the management of these patients with TB. All patients with TB that are newly diagnosed in all medical institutions must be reported to the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the internet-based National Infectious Diseases Reporting System (NIDRS).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> So information on patients with TB, such as gender, age, occupation before retirement, diagnosis date and sputum smear result, was collected from the NIDRS.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size</title><p>As the social support scores of patients were designed to be measured four times during the study, the sample size was calculated according to the repeated-measures formula: M=2 [1+(k-1)&#x003c1;] &#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>(Z<sub>1-&#x003b1;/2</sub>+Z<sub>1-&#x003b2;</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/k&#x003b4;<sup>2</sup>.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The following parameters were used in this formula: power of 85% and type I error of 5% (two-sided), number of repeated times K=4, smallest detected meaningful difference &#x003b4;=4.2, correlation coefficient among measures &#x003c1;=0.70&#x02009;and SE &#x003c3;=10 based on the results of pilot study. Consequently, 195 patients were needed for this study. To obtain sufficient patients, 12 communities in both cities were estimated to be randomly selected.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study sample</title><p>To perform interventions more easily and avoid information contamination among patients, we used a multistage sampling method. Among the 16 major cities in Hubei Province, Wuhan City and Enshi City were randomly selected and assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Then, 12 communities in each city were randomly selected. The elderly patients with TB in these communities who were registered in the&#x000a0;NIDRS were all included in the corresponding group. Because all of the patients in one community were in the same group and because all staff (psychologists, community health workers and administrators) who conducted the intervention could not be blinded to the study group, the patients and staff were not blinded.</p><p>Patients in this study met the following inclusion criteria: (a) diagnosed with TB at a local medical institute for TB control according to the WHO guideline,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> (b) &#x0003e;65 years of age, (c) local residents, (d) registered in the NIDRS, (e) normal communication ability and (f) volunteered to participate in this study. Patients were excluded if they (a) were suffering from mental health disorders, (b) had cognitive impairment or (c) were enrolled in other studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>This study lasted for 6&#x02009;months with an intervention frequency of twice per month. Patients in the control group received the health education intervention alone, and those in the intervention group received psychotherapy and family and community support interventions in addition to health education. Except for the psycho-educational workshops in the family and community support interventions, these interventions were performed in a one-to-one setting rather than a group setting to avoid cross-infection among patients.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Health education</title><p>Health education consisted of basic knowledge about TB (including transmission route, treatment policy, therapeutic regimen), psychological coping skills (including treatment side effects, effective communication, confidence enhancement), reasonable diet (including light diet, low salt and fat diet, high protein diet) and healthy lifestyle (including smoking and drinking cessation, regular physical exercise). TB health brochures were also delivered to the patients. It was conducted by community health workers at patients&#x02019; homes and lasted approximately 30&#x02009;min per patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Psychotherapy</title><p>To eliminate the mental health problems of patients, Morita therapy was delivered to patients at their home by psychologists of the Tongji Research Center of Mental Health at Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. A checklist of the key components of Morita therapy was developed according to prior studies<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> before the intervention and was strictly followed during the intervention. Throughout the study, every patient was asked to complete a diary for psychologists to evaluate the intervention. Every psychotherapy session lasted approximately 30&#x02009;min per patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Family and community support interventions</title><p>This part included home visits, psycho-educational workshops and peer support. During the study, one community health worker and one community administrator conducted home visits to communicate and construct a harmonious relationship with the patients. Simultaneously, family members and friends of patients were invited to attend psycho-educational workshops to receive basic knowledge about TB and encourage them to express their emotional pressure. Additionally, recovered patients with TB and their family members were invited to provide peer support. They shared their experiences with patients and their family members about how to solve problems and improve self-care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measurement</title><p>The primary outcome was the social support level of patients and was evaluated by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). This multidimensional scale consists of three dimensions that measure objective support, subjective support and support utilisation. The total SSRS score ranges from 12 to 66, with a higher score indicating the better availability of support. The reliability and validity of this scale were relatively high when it was applied to measure social support in the Chinese population.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 26</xref> In this sample, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha for the total score was 0.91.

Each patient was given the scale and asked to complete it alone. Investigators could provide an explanation for any confusion about the scale to avoid any error and ensure the data quality. The investigation was supervised and coordinated by a supervisor. Data were double-entered into the EpiData V.3.1 software. Scales with missing data concerning any items were excluded from the final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The normality of the data was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as the means (SD) and frequencies (percentages), respectively, and compared by the t-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, respectively. Considering the structure of repeated-measures data, a multilevel model was performed to assess the changes of social support scores between two groups. These analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System V.9.2, and the sample size was calculated using the Power Analysis and Sample Size software V.11.0. A two-sided P value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographic and TB-related characteristics</title><p>A total of 201 patients were recruited at the beginning of the study (69 in the intervention group and 132 in the control group).

It indicates that TB health education alone is not effective in improving the social support for patients with TB. Effective educational interventions are those that aim to modify patients&#x02019; behaviour rather than simply providing information about the disease.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Considering these, to promote the social support and health behaviour of elderly patients with TB, health education should be provided to those patients combined with other interventions rather than a single one.</p><p>Mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are often complicated with TB<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> due to adverse reactions of drugs, inadequate social support and social stigma.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Mental health interventions are suggested to provide for patients with TB to tackle their mental issues.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12 30</xref> Psychotherapies, such as group psychotherapy,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> have been proved to be effective in improving treatment adherence.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 32</xref>
</p><p>In our study, Morita therapy was implemented for elderly patients with TB. Morita therapy is a psychotherapy that was developed in Japan by Dr Shoma Morita in 1919 and is aimed at eliminating the mental health problems of patients through transferring their attention from negative stress.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This therapy is based on the premise that unpleasant symptoms are a natural part of the human experience.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We found that most elderly patients with TB often isolated themselves from others because of stigma, but many of them gradually participated in social activities and then sought and used help from others during the intervention. Another significant change was that many patients were willing to disclose their disease to others after the intervention. Some studies pointed out that most of the&#x000a0;patients with TB who disclosed their disease status to a wider audience received more positive support.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 34</xref> These suggest that psychotherapy, such as Morita therapy, is effective in improving psychological issues of&#x000a0;elderly patients with TB and should be considered as an essential part of the intervention to facilitate the social support of elderly patients with TB.</p><p>As the place in which elderly patients with TB lived, communities have great potential to provide valuable social support for patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Involvement of family and community members to support patients with TB was found to be one way to improve treatment outcomes and overcome social issues like stigma.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Hence, we incorporated the family and community interventions into the comprehensive interventions.</p><p>Through home visits, community health workers and administrators knew more about the elderly patients with TB and their families. These patients also expressed that they felt they were cared for and supported. They trusted these health workers and were also willing to ask for help from them. These phenomena indicate that the good patient&#x02013;health worker relationship, which can be achieved through home visits, is significant for the support patients perceived and for their treatment, as has been found in other studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16</xref>
</p><p>Simultaneously, a study pointed out that caregivers might lose confidence during the treatment of patients with TB, which would result in reduced social support for patients.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We held psycho-educational workshops for the family members and friends of the elderly patients with TB to lessen their psychological stress and increase their knowledge about TB. Many family members expressed that they experienced isolation by others and lacked knowledge about TB treatment. Through workshops, they gained more confidence and were more active in supporting patients&#x02019; treatment. This suggests that not only does the patients need psychological intervention and health education, but also family members and other caregivers need psycho-educational intervention to better support the elderly patients with TB.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12</xref>
</p><p>Additionally, we invited recovered patients with TB as peer support for the elderly patients with TB. During the intervention, most patients expressed that these former patients with TB understood how they felt. Some elderly patients with TB even developed valuable friendship with the recovered patients with TB. Several studies, which involved other chronic diseases, also proved that peer support was a useful method to support patients.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> It is of practical significance to treat recovered patients with TB as peer support to provide emotional support for the elderly with TB.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Due to the design of the study, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, there might be some bias caused by the differences in the economic and medical level between Wuhan City and Enshi City. Although Wuhan City and Enshi City were selected and allocated into different groups randomly, patients with TB in Wuhan City, which is the biggest city in Hubei Province, might receive better medical services than patients in Enshi City. Second, we did not assess the social support of patients after the end of the study. Therefore, we are uncertain about whether our interventions could consistently influence the social support of patients. Further studies can be done to explore the long-term effects of these interventions on the social support of elderly patients with TB in communities. Third, although the scale used to evaluate the primary outcome in this study was developed based on China&#x02019;s social conditions and tested with a good reliability and validity in China, it was not widely used to assess social support in foreign studies. This made the results of our study less comparable to foreign studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The key aspect of our study was to identify effective comprehensive social support interventions and assess its impact on the social support level of elderly patients with TB in communities.
