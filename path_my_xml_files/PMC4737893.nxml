We aimed to provide conclusive results for the clinical benefits of hyperbaric oxygen in patients with chronic bowel dysfunction after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>HOT2 was a double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 3 randomised study of patients (&#x02265;18 years) with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms for 12 months or more after radiotherapy and which persisted despite at least 3 months of optimal medical therapy and no evidence of cancer recurrence. Participants were stratified by participating hyperbaric centre and randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated list (block size nine or 12) to receive treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or sham. Participants in the active treatment group breathed 100% oxygen at 2&#x000b7;4 atmospheres of absolute pressure (ATA) and the control group breathed 21% oxygen at 1&#x000b7;3 ATA; both treatment groups received 90-min air pressure exposures once daily for 5 days per week for a total of 8 weeks (total of 40 exposures). Staff at the participating hyperbaric medicine facilities knew the allocated treatment, but patients, clinicians, nurse practitioners, and other health-care professionals associated with patients' care were masked to treatment allocation. Primary endpoints were changes in the bowel component of the modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score and the IBDQ rectal bleeding score 12 months after start of treatment relative to baseline. The primary outcome was analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population, excluding patients who did not provide IBDQ scores within a predetermined time-frame. All patients have completed 12 months of follow-up and the final analysis is complete. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN86894066.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Aug 14, 2009, and Oct 23, 2012, 84 participants were randomly assigned: 55 to hyperbaric oxygen and 29 to sham control. 75 (89%) participants received 40 pressure exposures, all participants returned the IBDQ at baseline, 75 (89%) participants returned the IBDQ at 2 weeks post-treatment, and 79 (94%) participants returned the IBDQ at 12 months post-start of treatment. Patients were excluded from analyses of co-primary endpoints if they had missing IBDQ scores for intestinal function or rectal bleeding at baseline or at 12 months. In an analysis of 46 participants in the active treatment group and 23 participants in the control group, we found no significant differences in the change of IBDQ bowel component score (median change from baseline to 12 months of 4 (IQR &#x02212;3 to 11) in the treatment group <italic>vs</italic> 4 (&#x02212;6 to 9) in the sham group; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> score 0&#x000b7;67, p=0&#x000b7;50). In an analysis of 29 participants in the active treatment group and 11 participants in the sham group with rectal bleeding at baseline, we also found no significant differences in the change of IBDQ rectal bleeding score (median change from baseline to 12 months of 3 [1 to 3] in the treatment group <italic>vs</italic> 1 [1 to 2] in the sham group; <italic>U</italic> score 1&#x000b7;69, p=0&#x000b7;092). Common adverse events in both groups were eye refractive changes (three [11%] of 28 patients in the control group <italic>vs</italic> 16 [30%] of 53 patients in the treatment group), increased fatigue (three [11%] <italic>vs</italic> two [4%]), and ear pain (six [21%] <italic>vs</italic> 15 [28%]). Eight serious adverse events were reported in eight patients: two were reported in two patients in the control group (tonsillitis requiring surgery [grade 3]; recurrent cancer of the vulva [grade 4]) and six serious adverse events were reported in six patients in the treatment group (malignant spinal cord compression requiring surgery [grade 3]; malignant paraortic lymph node involvement requiring surgery [grade 3]; recurrence of vomiting and dehydration [grade 3]; diarrhoea and fever associated with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infection [grade 3]; recurrence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, and urinary tract infection [grade 3]; aneurysm [grade 4]), none of which were deemed treatment-related.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We found no evidence that patients with radiation-induced chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, including those patients with rectal bleeding, benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

The results of a single randomised, sham-controlled trial from 2008 (HORTIS) reported significant clinical benefits for patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen 2 weeks post-treatment.

Randomisation was arranged by a telephone call from the treating hyperbaric medicine facility to the Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU). Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks (block size of nine and 12), and participants were stratified by centre. Computer-generated lists were used to allocate patients within a block. To deliver the correct treatment, only engineers and technicians operating the hyperbaric chamber were informed of the allocated treatment by the trials office, and care was taken to ensure that patients, clinicians, nurse practitioners, and other health-care professionals associated with patients' care remained masked to treatment allocation. The most important precaution was to disallow any non-trial patient sharing the chamber with a trial patient.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participants attended the participating hyperbaric oxygen medicine facility most convenient for them, where they were assessed for suitability for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Patients in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group received 40 pressure exposures at 2&#x000b7;4 atmospheres of absolute pressure (ATA; 243 kPa) breathing 100% oxygen for 90 min (including 5-min air breaks at 30-min intervals), whereas patients in the control group received 40 pressure exposures at 1&#x000b7;3 ATA (131 kPa) breathing 21% oxygen (ie, air) for 90 min with two simulated 5-min air breaks. We aimed to deliver the pressure exposures once a day for 5 days per week for 8 weeks for a total of 40 pressure exposures. Additional treatments were delivered beyond the 8-week timeframe if any scheduled sessions were missed.

Secondary clinical endpoints were adverse effects (bowel dysfunction) assessed according to LENT SOMA scales of radiation injury, clinical assessments of gastrointestinal symptoms according to the 11 questions selected from the CTCAE gastrointestinal scale (version 4), and patient self-assessments of quality of life recorded by the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire and QLQ-CR38 colorectal module between baseline and 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of the bowel component of the modified IBDQ primary endpoint. On the basis of results from a previous study,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> we considered a reduction in IBDQ bowel component score of 7 (SD 10) from baseline to 12 months to be clinically relevant. To detect this minimum change at a two-sided significance level of 5% and an estimated power of 80%, we planned to enrol 75 evaluable patients. During the recruitment phase of the trial (February, 2012), the independent data monitoring committee agreed that the significance level of 5% could be split to allow additional analyses in patients reporting rectal bleeding in the IBDQ at baseline. We estimated that 75 evaluable patients would allow us to detect a difference in IBDQ bowel symptom score of 7&#x000b7;5 with 80% power at a two-sided significance level of 3%. On the basis of the assumption that 30 of 75 patients would report grade 2&#x02013;4 rectal bleeding at baseline on the LENT SOMA Management Scale, corresponding to a score of 1&#x02013;5 on the IBDQ rectal bleeding scale, this subgroup would allow us to detect a difference of 70% of patients showing any improvement in rectal bleeding (10% in the control group, 80% in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group) with 80% power at a two-sided significance level of 2%.</p><p>Analysis of primary endpoints was by modified intention-to-treat, which included analysis of data from forms returned by patients within timeframes agreed to by the independent data monitoring committee. All patients who received any treatment (hyperbaric oxygen therapy or sham) were included in the safety population. Forms were processed as follow-up assessments according to the period that had elapsed between start of treatment and time of completion (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). IBDQ questions are scored from 1 to 7 with a low score indicating poorer function or worse symptoms. The bowel component is made up of ten questions, and we used all ten items in the bowel component of the modified IBDQ to analyse overall bowel function and analysed rectal bleeding using the single rectal bleeding question in the modified IBDQ. The difference in change from baseline to 12 months between the two study groups was analysed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test due to the non-normality of the data. We planned sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints and the LENT SOMA secondary endpoint in the population of patients who were registered into the study and returned IBDQ forms, irrespective of timelines (intention-to-treat), and in the per-protocol population, which included all patients registered into the study who received at least 32 pressure exposures within a 10-week period. These sensitivity analyses excluded individuals who received less than three treatments per week for at least 2 weeks or who missed five consecutive treatments.</p><p>For the comparison of change in LENT SOMA scores from baseline to 12 months for rectum and intestine (secondary endpoints; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) between the active treatment and control groups, we scored individual symptoms within each of three LENT SOMA descriptors (subjective, objective, management) using a four-point scale (with high scores denoting worse symptoms) and summed these scores to develop overall subjective, objective, and management scores for each anatomical site (rectum and intestine). We did no formal statistical analyses of other secondary endpoints (CTCAE scales, EORTC QLQ-C30, and QLQ-CR38<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>), although the descriptive results were used to strengthen interpretation of changes in the primary endpoints. In an exploratory analysis we tested for a difference in the proportion of patients reporting an improvement in rectal bleeding at 12 months between the two study groups using all available questionnaires (ie, the CTCAE rectal bleeding questions, rectal LENT SOMA objective and management scores, intestinal LENT SOMA management score, and EORTC QLQ-CR38 question 59 &#x0201c;Have you had blood with your stools?&#x0201d;). Patients reporting no rectal bleeding at baseline on an individual scale were excluded from the analysis of that scale. We did two exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints; one analysis considered the group of patients who received radiotherapy 1&#x02013;5 years before randomisation, and the other considered the group of patients whose trial treatment was delivered by hood (or monochamber).</p><p>We used Stata version 13 for all statistical analyses.

Two-thirds of participants had faecal frequency, incontinence, or both, symptoms that suggest injury to the colon as well as rectum, and a similar proportion reported rectal bleeding. 75 (89%) participants received all 40 planned pressure exposures, and nine (11%) patients received 38 exposures or less (one patient received 38 exposures, one patient received 31 exposures, one patient received 18 exposures, one patient received 11 exposures, one patient received four exposures, one patient received two exposures, and three patients received no exposures). <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> details the number of IBDQ and LENT SOMA assessment forms returned within prespecified timeframes.</p><p>We found no significant differences in the improvement of overall bowel function (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> score 0&#x000b7;67; p=0&#x000b7;50) or rectal bleeding (<italic>U</italic> score 1&#x000b7;69; p=0&#x000b7;092) after 12 months between randomised groups (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>).

Eight serious adverse events were reported in eight patients: two were reported in two patients in the control group (tonsillitis requiring surgery [grade 3]; recurrent cancer of the vulva [grade 4]) and six serious adverse events were reported in six patients in the treatment group (malignant spinal cord compression requiring surgery [grade3]; malignant paraortic lymph node involvement requiring surgery [grade 3]; recurrence of vomiting and dehydration [grade 3]; diarrhoea and fever associated with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infection [grade 3]; recurrence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, and urinary tract infection [grade 3]; aneurysm [grade 4]). No reported adverse event was considered related to treatment. One patient had an improvement in eyesight during treatment. Only two of the patients who stopped treatment early did so for reasons related to treatment (anxiety). No treatment-related deaths were noted.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite some clinical evidence and plausible pathophysiological mechanisms justifying an expectation of therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the HOT2 trial results detected no clinically relevant benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in individuals with a wide range of chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, including rectal bleeding, after curative radiotherapy for pelvic malignancy.

The HORTIS trial randomly assigned 150 patients from Mexico, Turkey, South Africa, and Australia with a 3-month or longer medical history of radiation proctitis to breathe air at 1&#x000b7;1 ATA (sham group) or 100% oxygen at 2&#x000b7;0 ATA (active treatment group) for 90 min for 30 sessions within 6&#x02013;8 weeks, with an additional ten sessions depending on individual responses. Improvements in the LENT SOMA score (primary endpoint) were found in 120 evaluable patients with radiation proctitis; patients in the active treatment group recording significantly lower average scores than patients in the sham group (p=0&#x000b7;015), with an estimated difference of 1&#x000b7;93 points (95% CI 0&#x000b7;38&#x02013;3&#x000b7;48). The HORTIS investigators also reported a significant benefit of hyperbaric oxygen in patients with bowel bother, a group of symptoms that include faecal incontinence, faecal urgency, and pain. The authors of the Cochrane review interpreted these results as non-significant and sensitive to randomised patients excluded from primary analysis but concluded that HORTIS supported the continued use of hyperbaric oxygen for patients with radiation proctitis.</p><p>It is unclear why the results of HOT2 fail to reproduce the HORTIS<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> findings. Although a single-centre study in terms of patient referral and selection, HOT2 trial participants were treated at one of ten UK-registered hyperbaric facilities. Patient selection was unusually rigorous, including assessment by a gastroenterologist specialised in radiation enteropathy and a 3-month run-in period of optimised oral drug treatment to ensure that eligible patients had radiation-induced symptoms that could not be controlled by standard measures. The trial population is considered representative of patients with radiation enteropathy in terms of their symptoms, although patients with severe faecal incontinence or transfusion-dependent rectal bleeding are likely to be under-represented, the former being too restricted to leave their homes and the latter considered too seriously at risk to be considered by their primary physicians for entry into a trial with a sham treatment option. We assessed 20 characteristics relating to bowel dysfunction at baseline, and despite small imbalances in the proportion of patients with a medical history of rectal bleeding (23 [79%] of 29 patients in the control group <italic>vs</italic> 34 [62%] of 55 patients in the treatment group), this imbalance did not apply to baseline IBDQ rectal bleeding scores analysed as the primary endpoint. In other respects, symptom duration in HOT2, at a median 3&#x000b7;7 years (IQR 2&#x000b7;4&#x02013;6&#x000b7;8) post-radiotherapy, is consistent with that of the HORTIS population, and HOT2 patient characteristics are well balanced between randomised groups.</p><p>In a literature review<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> of ten retrospective studies published between 1960 and 2004 reporting favourable results of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with radiation proctitis, patients had an average of 24 treatments each. The randomised, sham-controlled HORTIS trial<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> reported beneficial clinical effects of hyperbaric oxygen after 30&#x02013;40 treatments. Hence, the 40 treatments used in HOT2 can be considered an appropriate test of hyperbaric oxygen. Compliance with treatment in HOT2 was reasonably high, with 75 (88%) of 84 patients eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat population, as required by the analysis plan. Post-hoc analyses in the per-protocol population failed to detect any treatment effect. Pre-trial investigations designed to exclude patients with residual malignant disease ensured that only three patients developed cancer recurrence while participating in the study.</p><p>Other relevant points of difference between the HORTIS<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and HOT2 trials include the immediate post-treatment timepoint for the primary analysis in HORTIS, compared with the primary analysis at 12 months post-treatment in HOT2. Exploratory analyses of the 2-week post-treatment effects in HOT2 showed no difference between randomised groups for any of the primary or secondary endpoints. This included change in total LENT SOMA score, which was the primary endpoint analysed by the HORTIS investigators. Unlike HOT2, in which we analysed the primary endpoint in a modified intention-to-treat population, the primary analysis in HORTIS excluded 30 of 150 randomised patients who did not complete the treatment protocol (plus one patient lost to follow-up), although unplanned analyses of the outcomes of clinical assessments by intention-to-treat were also consistent with a beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen in HORTIS. In other exploratory analyses of HOT2 endpoints (including subgroup analysis of patients completing radiotherapy 1&#x02013;5 years before randomisation and subgroup analysis of patients receiving treatment by hood or hyperbaric chamber rather than mask), we could not identify variables that might explain differences in reported outcomes between these two trials. Randomisation appears to have resulted in a reasonably even distribution of patient characteristics between the treatment and control groups in our study, to the extent that the total effect of these covariates would not be expected to mask any effect of hyperbaric oxygen. The very small number of patients with transfusion-dependent rectal bleeding in this study prevents us from commenting on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients referred for this potentially life-threatening complication.</p><p>Our trial was designed to have a power of 80%; with 69 evaluable patients, we had a power of about 75% to detect a difference of the magnitude expected in the first of the primary endpoints. We did not detect a clinically or statistically significant clinical benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, including rectal bleeding, after pelvic radiotherapy. The findings contrast with previous reports, highlighting an urgent need for more level 1 evidence to determine with confidence whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be recommended as a standard of care for this group of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andreyev</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gastrointestinal symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy: a new understanding to improve management of symptomatic patients</article-title><source>Lancet Oncol</source><volume>8</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>1007</fpage><lpage>1017</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17976611</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Feldmeier</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hampson</surname><given-names>NB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A systematic review of the literature reporting the application of hyperbaric oxygen prevention and treatment of delayed radiation injuries: an evidence based approach</article-title><source>Undersea Hyperb Med</source><volume>29</volume><year>2002</year><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12507182</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Feldmeier</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hampson</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Smee</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Milross</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for late radiation tissue injury</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><volume>5</volume><year>2012</year><comment>CD005005</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Tenorio</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hussey</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyperbaric oxygen treatment of chronic refractory radiation proctitis: a randomized and controlled double-blind crossover trial with long-term follow-up</article-title><source>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys</source><volume>72</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>134</fpage><lpage>143</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18342453</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pavy</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Denekamp</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Letschert</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>EORTC Late Effects Working Group.
