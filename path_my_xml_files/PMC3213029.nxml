In a pilot study of 49 undernourished older, community dwelling people we found that daily treatment for one year with a combination of testosterone tablets and a nutritional supplement produced a significant reduction in hospitalizations. We propose a larger, multicentre study to explore and hopefully confirm this exciting, potentially important finding (NHMRC project grant number 627178).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>One year randomized control trial where subjects are allocated to either oral testosterone undecanoate and high calorie oral nutritional supplement or placebo medication and low calorie oral nutritional supplementation. 200 older community-dwelling, undernourished people [Mini Nutritional Assessment score &#x0003c;24 and either: a) low body weight (body mass index, in kg/m<sup>2</sup>: &#x0003c;22) or b) recent weight loss (&#x0003e;7.5% over 3 months)]. Hospital admissions, quality-adjusted life years, functional status, nutritional health, muscle strength, body composition and other variables will be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The pilot study showed that combined treatment with an oral testosterone and a supplement drink was well tolerated and safe, and reduced the number of people hospitalised and duration of hospital admissions in undernourished, community dwelling older people. This is an exciting finding, as it identifies a treatment which may be of substantial benefit to many older people in our community. We now propose to conduct a multi-centre study to test these findings in a substantially larger subject group, and to determine the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian Clinical Trial Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12610000356066.aspx">ACTRN 12610000356066</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ageing is associated with a physiological reduction of appetite and food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mean body weight decreases after about 60 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], largely due to a loss of muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength is called sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which is present in up to 6-15% of older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of falls, disability and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The combination of muscle loss and reduced food intake predisposes older people to develop under-nutrition, which occurs in up to 10-15% of community-dwelling older people and many more in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Low body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and weight loss, particularly if involuntary, are major markers of harmful under-nutrition in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In frail, malnourished, elderly people in nursing homes or hospital, daily oral nutritional (often high protein) supplementation has been shown to result in increased energy intake and body weight, reduced post-operative complications and length of hospital stay, and even reduced mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The benefits of nutritional supplements have not been clearly established in frail, community-dwelling older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Circulating androgen concentrations decline in both men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with increasing age, and there is increasing evidence that this contributes to the development of sarcopenia and the declining functional status that occurs with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Testosterone administration to older men has been shown to increase muscle mass and decrease fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown to increase muscle strength, albeit modestly and variably, more with high doses and in men with low testosterone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In postmenopausal women testosterone treatment increases lean body mass, energy and libido [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and possibly muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We are unaware of evidence that testosterone improves clinically relevant outcomes, such as physical performance or cognitive function, in older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. There have been a few reports of functional benefits of testosterone administration to older men; testosterone in high doses has been reported to improve standing ability after knee replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], improve timed walking[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and increase the Function Independence Measure and grip strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Whilst androgen replacement therapy is advocated for men with low testosterone concentrations and symptoms of marked androgen deficiency, there is no consensus for its use in elderly men with less severe ageing-related declines in androgen concentrations, or in elderly women.</p><p>Hospitalisation is common in older people and imposes major burdens on the individual and community. Frail older people and those at nutritional risk are at increased risk of hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our research group have previously reported that 43.2% of community dwelling recipients of domiciliary care services in Adelaide were under-nourished (38.4% of subjects at risk of malnutrition, 4.8% malnourished). 45% of these undernourished people were hospitalised in the subsequent year, a significantly higher rate than in well-nourished controls, with a 3-fold higher rate of hospitalization for more than one month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As well as indicating the presence of an illness or illnesses sufficiently serious to require hospital admission, hospitalisation in older people is associated frequently with complications such as delirium, declining muscle strength and respiratory function, and is often followed by functional decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In older people there is a strong relationship between hospitalisation and the later development of disability, including disability severe enough to require moving to residential aged care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Disability in older people is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], is present in approximately 25% of those 74-85 years and 50% of those 85 years or older, and places substantial financial burdens on health care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Hospital admissions is said to account for the majority of health-care costs in developed countries. In Australia and the USA people aged over 75 years spend 7-10 times as much time in hospital as adults under 45 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This is likely to increase in coming years due to the ageing of the population and hospital bed days are predicted to double by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It has been hypothesised that improving nutritional health through the administration of oral testosterone and nutritional supplementation to community dwelling older people over a period of 12 months may result in a reduction in hospitalisation and this will not only result in a reduction in health care costs but also an improvement in quality of life. Our research group have previously published exciting pilot data from a small study that provides further support for this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has now funded this larger study to further investigate these findings.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of this randomized control trial is to determine the effects of treatment for one year with testosterone and high calorie nutritional supplementation compared to placebo testosterone and low calorie nutritional supplementation on the rate of hospital admissions and other endpoints in under-nourished, community-dwelling, older men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study has been approved by the Human and Research Ethics Committee of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia.

In addition, the general practitioner of all subjects will be notified in writing of this assessment and of the subject's participation in the study. This will be designated 'standard care'.</p><p>The two study groups will be:</p><p>a) <bold>Control</bold>: "standard care" + placebo testosterone + placebo- low calorie supplement drink (&#x0003c; 200 kJ in 180 ml/day).</p><p>b) <bold>Combined treatment</bold>: "standard care" + oral testosterone undecanoate (Andriol Testocaps 40 mg orally once a day for women, 80 mg orally twice a day for men) + high calorie nutritional supplement (1084 kJ in 180 ml/day, approx 11 g protein, approx 10 g fat, approx 40 g carbohydrate).</p><p>Testosterone undecanoate capsules are purchased and a packaging company places these capsules in a larger capsule. These larger capsules minus the testosterone act as the placebo. Dissolution testing was conducted to ensure that absorption of the active testosterone medication was not significantly altered. Subjects are advised to take their testosterone/placebo tablets with meals (with breakfast and evening dinner for men and with breakfast for women). The high calorie nutritional supplement used in this study is a 180 ml drink that is taken twice a day. Two flavours are provided, Vanilla 1054 kJ/180 ml and Chocolate 1208 kj/180 ml. Subjects on the active treatment would receive approximately 2108-2416 kJ(360 ml)/day. The placebo consists of a low KJ (&#x0003c;200 KJ) drink made up of artificial sweetener, flavour and xantham gum to match the texture. The vanilla flavoured drink delivers 70.97 kJ/180 mls and the chocolate flavoured drink delivers 95.48 kJ/180 mls. Subjects on the placebo treatment would receive approximately 142-191 kJ (360 ml)/day.</p><p>At baseline the following assessments are conducted.</p><p>a.

The occurrence of any adverse events is actively sought during these calls and visits.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Proposed visits and measurements during the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Screening</th><th align="center">Baseline</th><th align="center">3 m</th><th align="center">6 m</th><th align="center">12 m</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Screening Document</td><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Consent</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Baseline-demographics, illness, medications, Charlson co-morbidity index</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Chair rise test</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Weight</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IPSS (men only)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MNA, SNAQ</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MMSE, MOCA, 15-GDS, IADL, Barthel Index</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Voice Handicap Index (women only)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Frailty, Grip Strength, physical activity (kcal/wk)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">Grip only</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SF-36</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Body composition-resistance, reactance, fat mass, lean mass, TBW</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Urinalysis and per rectal exam for men</td><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">24 hour food diary (%fat, % CHO, %Protein, kcal)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">FBE (hematocrit)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PSA (men only)</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total Chol, Trig, HDL, LDL</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Biochem</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">hsCRP</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Testosterone, SHBG</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LH, FSH, Oestradiol</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td/><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cytokines</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Flag any abnormal blood test results to CI</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Send results to GP</td><td/><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Alterations to testosterone dosage</title><p>The study drug dose will be halved to one tablet twice a day in men, and one tablet alternate days in women if either of the following occur (confirmed by repeat test): hematocrit &#x0003e; 54%; PSA more than 10% above the upper end of the age-related normal range. The abnormal test will be repeated in 6 weeks. If the value normalizes the subject will continue the halved dose. If the result remains elevated the study medication will be ceased permanently (the abnormal value will be re-measured 6 weeks later and then according to the study schedule) and the subject will continue only with the nutritional supplement (or control). Men with persistently elevated PSA values will be referred for further urological assessment. Women who develop androgenic side effects have the option of stopping the drug or halving the dose. If the dose is halved the full dose will not be re-instituted later and the subject has the option of stopping the study drug at any later time.</p></sec><sec><title>Data and Safety Monitoring</title><p>An independent data and safety monitoring committee, consisting of a nutritional expert/scientist, geriatrician and another specialist physician with experience on the drugs and therapeutics committee who are independent of the study investigations and unaware of the treatment assignments will be established and co-ordinated from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. This committee will meet at regular intervals to monitor for adverse events that warrant protocol modification or termination. For instance, emergence of an unacceptable adverse effect profile with treatment which is different to that experienced in the pilot study. Because of the size of the study and the nature of the treatment and endpoints we have not included an option for premature study termination due to high efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</title><p>All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle controlling for the effects of recruitment site. The distribution of the number of hospitalizations in each group will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Times to admission will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression with account taken of within-subject correlation for subjects with multiple admissions. The numbers of days spent in hospital will be compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Other data will be analysed with a linear mixed model using residual maximum likelihood (REML) and including all available time points. A per-protocol analysis will also be undertaken. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken from the perspective of the Australian public health care system and include costs incurred by both the federal and state governments in relation to health care. The primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the quality adjusted life years (QALY) derived from SF_36 via the SF-6D algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Patients will be asked for consent to access their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) records. Consent will also be requested to access patient information from the Integrated South Australian Activity Collection (ISAAC), which contains information on all hospital separations in SA. Consent will also be requested to access patient information from relevant State agencies which will contain information on all hospital separations in each State, and the related information on the costs associated with each hospital separation. Data obtained will include patient admission, and inpatient stay characteristics, as well as providing ICD-10 categorised data on principle and additional diagnoses and procedures. These three data sources will provide sufficient data to inform a detailed analysis of the downstream cost consequences for the different treatment groups.</p><p>Subjects will still be allowed to participate in the study without providing consent to access these data. These three data sources will provide sufficient data to inform a detailed analysis of the downstream cost consequences for the different treatment groups.</p><p>Mean costs and effectiveness between the intervention and control groups will be compared and incremental cost effectiveness ratios presented (ICERs) described. A range of one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to test the effect of uncertainties around the true values of key resource use and effectiveness parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will inform confidence intervals around the ICER and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec><title>Power and Sample Size</title><p>The sample size is based on power calculations performed on the results of the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. To have a power of 90% to detect a significant (at P = 0.05 [2-sided]) difference in the number of days of hospitalisation between the treatment groups 28 subjects per group are required, and to have a power of 90% to detect a significant (at P = 0.05 [2-sided]) difference in the number of subjects with non-elective admissions 30 subjects per group are required. The study is therefore substantially overpowered to address the primary endpoint of hospitalisation. An examination of QALYs in the pilot study indicates that the no-treatment group lost QALYs, while the combined treatment group gained QALYS. 85 subjects per treatment arm would be needed to have a power of 90% to show a significant (P = 0.05 [2-sided]) QALY improvement of 0.05 with the combined treatment. Assuming a net cost of providing the treatment of AUS$2500 per year when used in the community setting, a QALY difference of 0.05 would result in an incremental cost per QALY gained of AUS$50,000, the commonly implied threshold for cost effectiveness (Medicines Australia Inc, A Prescription for the Health of Australia 2002). Allowing for a margin of safety, we therefore plan to study 200 subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>There is limited high level evidence that any specific interventions are effective strategies for community dwelling older people identified as under-nourished who are at-risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Under-nourished older people are likely to have sarcopenia and this provides the basis for the use of an anabolic agent such as oral testosterone. To date, the evidence for functional benefits of testosterone treatment in older people, other than increased strength, is limited. This research group has previously reported that 12 month combined treatment with oral testosterone and nutritional supplement reduced the risk of hospitalization compared to no treatment in a group of under-nourished community dwelling older people. Previous studies have reported that nutritional supplements have modest benefits in older people, particularly in those who are more undernourished, who are in hospitals or other institutions, or who receive larger dose of supplements for longer time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This larger study will provide researchers with further information allowing determination of the effectiveness of this proposed intervention strategy in this group of population (frail, older, community dwelling and under-nourished).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Professor Chapman and Associate Professor Visvanathan have received funding previously from Organon Pty.
