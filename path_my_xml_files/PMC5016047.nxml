2 diabetes mellitus, associated with the behavior adopted by the user with diabetes,
have caused health workers to mobilize in search of educational alternatives for the
promotion of self-care directly related to physical activity and following a diet
plan<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. Accordingly, the telephone intervention has been used as an innovative
educational strategy, being considered an effective form of communication by the
professional and user<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. This is because, through the use of understandable language, adapted to the
reality in which the users and their needs in relation to self-care are the primary
focus, the professional is able to negotiate, motivate and encourage them to take
responsibility for their self-care<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A recent integrative literature review, conducted with 40 experimental and
quasi-experimental studies performed between 2008 and 2013, showed that the telephone
intervention has a positive impact on improving glycohemoglobin levels and self-care in
diabetes<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Complementarily, a randomized clinical trial conducted with 81 users with type
2 diabetes mellitus, carried out in Iran in 2012, showed that the group that received
the telephone intervention for 3 months presented significant improvement in issues such
as knowledge, attitudes, self-care and glycemic control, when compared with the control
group<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Given this scenario, the telephone intervention was carried out in the Primary
Health Units (PHUs) of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, aiming to promote education for diabetes
self-care, valorizing aspects such as the autonomy of users regarding their choices,
decision-making and the development of a care plan aimed at the fulfillment of
goals<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It was assumed that the evaluation of the telephone intervention would provide relevant
subsidies for effective educational practice, allowing future implementations in
diabetes education and representing a new field of practice for health professionals.
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the telephone intervention
for promoting self-care related to physical activity and following a diet plan, in users
with diabetes, compared to conventional monitoring of users over a six-month period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Type and location of the study</title><p>This was a randomized clinical trial, conducted in eight Primary Health Units of the
Eastern District of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study included users who were diagnosed with diabetes, aged 30 to 80 years, due
to the higher prevalence of the disease in this age group<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>, had access to fixed or mobile telephones and participated in at least two
telephone interventions. Users diagnosed with Type I diabetes, who did not answer the
calls after five consecutive attempts and that changed address and phone number
during the study were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The telephone intervention was carried out in a systematic way, aiming to promote
self-care related to the practice of physical activity and following a diet plan,
from the development of a plan to achieve the targets.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, the telephone
interventions were conducted monthly by a nurse during the period from February to
August 2012, in the Nursing School of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, with a
mean of six telephone calls per user. The telephone interventions followed a
previously established protocol and were classified into three types, according to
their purpose, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>The care guidance followed the guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Diabetes (SBD)
and were adapted according to the context and the actual conditions of the user<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. In each telephone intervention the professional sought to enable the users
to practice self-care and achieve the targets and to demonstrate to them that their
participation and responsibility in the daily care could improve their health,
encouraging them to establish one to two targets during each phone call<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The Control Group (CG) continued with conventional monitoring, carried out in the
Primary Health Units, through clinical care, according to the Primary Health Care
protocol of Belo Horizonte Council<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. The users also received an educational booklet containing information on the
pathophysiology of diabetes, prevention of acute and chronic complications,
importance of diet and the practice of physical activity and foot care. Finally,
these users received two phone calls, performed by a nurse, for the application of
the measuring instruments of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure

</p></sec><sec><title>Measuring instruments</title><p>In order to collect the socio-demographic and economic profile data of the
participants, a questionnaire was developed and applied which included the following:
age, marital status, gender, income, duration of disease, education and work
situation. For the evaluation of the nutritional status, the weight was obtained
using a digital scale (Marte<sup>(r))</sup> and the height measured using a portable
stadiometer (Altura Exata<sup>(r))</sup> to the nearest 0.1cm. Regarding the
evaluation of metabolic control, the glycohemoglobin examination was previously
scheduled and collected in the Primary Health Unit. A glycohemoglobin level lower or
equal to 7.0% (53mmol/mol) was defined as an indicator of good metabolic control<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Finally, to check the frequency of the self-care actions recommended for disease
control, for the previous seven days, the Diabetes Self-care Questionnaire - ESM was
applied, which consists of eight items. The responses are presented in a
multiple-choice scale and the total score ranges from zero to eight points, with
scores higher than or equal to five indicating an appropriate frequency of following
an eating plan and practicing physical activity<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>To calculate the sample, the usual values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;were established: i) 95% confidence
interval (&#x003b1;=0.05), ii) power of 80%, iii) a minimum standardized difference of 1.5
standard deviations to be detected between the means of the self-care scores of the
two groups at the three moments, iv) an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05
and v) mean size of 100 users (target population) in each of the eight health
centers. From these values, an expression was used to consider the design effect
(cluster randomized) to calculate the number of users in each health center
(cluster)<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. After considering a participant attrition rate of 20%, 219 users were
included in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The Primary Health Units were allocated to the Control Group (CG) and Experimental
Group (EG), from a draw using a 1:1 ratio, with randomization being performed to
ensure that the two groups could be considered homogeneous regarding the measure of
self-care. The health units were numbered 1 to 8 and, through the drawing of these
numbers (via computer program and without replacement), each unit was allocated to
one of the groups, alternately, giving a total of four in each group. The draw
process and allocation of the Primary Health Units to the study groups was carried
out by a Statistics professional who was not involved in the recruitment phase of the
health centers. At the end, each group consisted of four PHUs each, with the control
group containing 110 users and the experimental group 109 users in total.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>A nurse, blinded to the group allocation of the users, during the period prior to the
start of the study, applied the measuring instrument, remaining blinded until all the
instruments had been completed. The data analysis, in turn, was made by a Statistics
professional also blinded to the group to which the users were allocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection was performed by a nurse and was divided into three phases: 1) prior
to the start of the telephone intervention or conventional care (T0), 2) after 3
months (T3) and 3) after six months (T6). For both groups, experimental and control,
at the T0 moment the first contact with the users, through face to face interviews,
was performed in the Basic Health Units, at which time the sociodemographic,
economic, anthropometric and glycohemoglobin data were collected. The Diabetes
Self-care Questionnaire was applied at the three moments (T0, T3 and T6), with the
application being made via phone call at the last two moments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were processed, using double entry for the control of possible errors, in
the SPSS, version 20, program. The statistical analyzes of the data were performed
using the Minitab, version 15, software. The following statistical tests were used:
1) Student's t-test, for the comparison between groups, 2) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to
verify the validity of the normality assumption, and 3) Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney
tests, when the assumption of normality was not valid.</p><p>The evaluation of the effect of time on each group, in turn, was performed by using a
repeated measures analysis of variance for balanced data, with Bonferroni correction
used in the tests of multiple comparisons. In the case of comparisons between
proportions, the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used. For all analyzes a
5% significance level was considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The development of the study adhered to the national and international ethical
standards for research involving human subjects, according to Resolution 196/96 of
the National Health Council. The project that gave rise to this study was approved by
the Research Ethics Committee of the Municipal Health Department (Authorization No.
0731.0.203.410-12A). All participants, after clarification regarding the aims and
criteria of participation, signed two copies of the terms of consent form.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p> Of the total of 219 users of the sample, nine did not participate in at least two
telephone interventions, with it not being possible to establish telephone contact with
two users of the EG and one user of the CG (incorrect phone number or the user did not
answer the calls), two users hospitalized (CG=1 and EG=1) and one user having died
(EG=1). In the course of the research, three users (CG=2 and EG=1) changed their address
and/or telephone number. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows that, at
the end of six months, 210 users completed the study and were analyzed, these being 104
of the EG and 106 of the CG.</p><p>

contact attempts (95% CI 10.4 to 25.3).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data from this study show that the telephone intervention was effective, since the
mean effect of the self-care scores, measured before and after the program for the users
who received the telephone intervention, presented substantial change compared with the
control group. Thus, these findings corroborate the results of an experimental study
involving 62 users with diabetes, in which the group that underwent telephone
intervention for 12 weeks presented better self-care scores compared to the control
group<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. Complementarily, review studies point out the effectiveness of this educational
strategy, particularly with regard to the improvement of self-care for the reduction of
glycohemoglobin and blood pressure values compared or associated with conventional
care<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>It was observed that the systematic monitoring and the use of an approach centered on
the users and their needs, in which they are the transforming agents of their reality,
contributed to improve the practices of physical activity and following the food plan,
among the users of the experimental group. These data can be related to the fact that
the phone calls make dialogue and reflection possible, therefore, encouraging the
co-responsibility of the users with diabetes in relation to their own health<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, the low educational level, evidenced among the users with diabetes
studied, raised the need to use appropriate and easy to understand language, respecting
their capabilities and limitations. Studies reinforce the role of the health
professional as a facilitator of learning, awakening the users to their potential to
make informed, conscious decisions regarding self-care, thus achieving the autonomy and
skill necessary for their own health care management<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the users of both groups at T0 in this study had a
mean self-care score below 5 points, indicating that the frequency of physical activity
and following the food plan were inadequate, according to the recommendations for the
control of diabetes. Similarly, an intervention study performed in Brazil with users
with diabetes, which used the same measuring instrument, also evidenced low self-care
scores at the start of the study<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the users of the control group, despite the slight improvement in self-care scores
obtained over the six-month period, the results suggest that conventional care provided
by the primary care units was insufficient to achieve or sustain the score of 5 points.
These findings lead to reflection on the fragility of the educational practices
performed by primary health care teams, suggesting that these actions are ineffective or
have limitations in promoting diabetes self-care<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, this reinforces the need to seek innovative strategies, such as the
telephone intervention, aiming to act in a complementary way to boost the self-care
promotion actions of these services<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The use of the telephone is considered an effective method to approach the users in
their homes or communities, with flexibility in the hours and optimization of the time.
Consequently, this means that currently it provides an educational strategy capable of
reaching large numbers of users who have difficulties, such as geographical and
financial barriers, in accessing the health services<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. It should be noted that the telephone access of the population has significant
increased, driven by the growth in mobile telephones, considering that 75.2% of
Brazilians over 10 years of age had a mobile phone in 2013, an increase of 131.4% in
this contingent compared to 2005<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. Thus, it is believed that the telephone intervention demonstrates the potential
reach and viability to address the user with diabetes, promoting continuity of care and
the educational activities provided<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>During the planning and execution of this study, other factors that could influence the
effectiveness of telephone intervention were also considered, such as the training of
the two nurses involved in the study (the first being responsible for performing the
telephone intervention and the second for the application of measuring instruments).
Accordingly, it was sought to standardize the language and the quality of the
information provided, designing a script to guide the calls and organize the days and
times of the calls to ensure the success of the contact.</p><p>Some limitations must be pointed out. These include the short monitoring period for the
evaluation of the educational program that ideally should be more than 12 months, to
better assess the effect of the intervention, and the absence of analysis of the
clinical variables, such as the glycohemoglobin level. Thus, these limitations can be
addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The telephone intervention performed with users with type 2 diabetes mellitus, tested as
an educational strategy, was effective in promoting self-care related to physical
activity and following a diet plan. It is hoped that this study will lead to future
developments, implementing the telephone intervention for diabetes education in Primary
Health Care, and that this strategy can be evaluated for its contribution in the
clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Master's Thesis "Avalia&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o do monitoramento telef&#x000f4;nico na
