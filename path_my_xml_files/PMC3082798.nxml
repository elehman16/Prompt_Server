A list of the names and medical records of 1341 women with breast cancer who came to this center for treatment from 2005 to 2008 were given a survey. After primary survey, 342 women of 50 to 65 years old were selected. These women received surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and they had current hormone therapy. They were in stage I to IIIB. They should not have specific illness and in the past 6 month should not have any experience of a menstrual cycle. Also, they should not have participated in any exercise training or physical activity in past 6 month and their body weight should not have changed in this period (last 6 month) as much as 10% of their whole body weight. All the patients invited to participate in this study by telephone. Among all, 58 women indicated their readiness to participate in this study and 38 women were present in meeting day. The physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) and written informed consent was obtained from all of the subjects. By surveying the questionnaire, it was specified that 32 of them had conditions for taking part in this study. These 32 women divided into two groups randomly; intervention group and control group. At the end of exercise training program 29 women (15 women in control group and 14 women in intervention group) completed the relevant measurements of the post tests. This study was approved by the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences of the University of Guilan.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>Subjects&#x02019; height was measured by stadiometer (Seca model, made in Germany). Body weight of subjects was measured without shoes by a digital scale (Pand Electronic model, made in Iran). BMI was obtained by dividing the weight in kilogram to square of the height in meter. Waist and hip circumference was obtained by band tape in meter. WHR was calculated by dividing the waist circumference to hip circumference. Blood pressure was measured with a Japanese sphygmomanometer model ALPK2 in seated position. Since any activity can increase HR it was measured immediately after waking up. Also, HR is in lowest rate in the morning, immediately after waking up. Therefore, the RHR was recorded using the heart rate monitor belt (Polar model) by the subjects immediately after waking up. For measuring the VO<sub>2</sub>max in two groups modified Bruce protocol was used. Bruce protocol is one of the most common methods for estimating VO<sub>2</sub>max. This test performed on a treadmill. The standard Bruce test was started at 2.74 km/h (1.7 mph) and at incline of 10% for 3 minutes. At three minutes intervals the incline of treadmill increased by 2% and speed increase to 4.02, 5.47, 6.76, 8.05, 8.85, 9.65, 10.46, 11.26 and 12.07 km/h in each stage (10 stages in total), respectively. The modified Bruce protocol started at 2.74 km/h and incline of 0% and 2.74 km/h and 5% incline and third stages corresponding to the first stage of the standard Bruce test. The time taken on the treadmill recorded in minutes (T). The VO<sub>2</sub>max formula for women is :</p><p>VO<sub>2</sub>max = 4.38 &#x000d7; T - 3.9</p><p>All the measurements were obtained twice and recorded by one staff that was blinded to subjects in pre and post tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Exercise Training Protocol</title><p>This protocol was only designed for the intervention group. This group performed 60 minute resistance training twice weekly for 15 weeks at the Foolad Mobarake Sepahan Sport Club. They performed three sets each of nine common resistance training exercises; subjects lifted as much weight as they could for 10 repetitions per set from 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> week, 12 repetitions per set from 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> week and 14 repetitions per set from 11<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> week. The nine resistance training exercises included exercises performed on Cybex strength training equipment (Smith press squats, leg press, leg extension, seated leg curl, lat pulldowns) and with free weights (bench press, overhead press, biceps curls, and triceps kickbacks). Indeed, these subjects took part in supervised walking program for two times per week, differed from resistance training days. The walking program started at 45% of maximum heart rate for 25 minutes in weeks 1-5. Duration of walking from 6<sup>th</sup> -10<sup>th</sup> weeks was 35 minutes and intensity was 55% of maximum heart rate. From 11<sup>th</sup> -15<sup>th</sup> weeks, duration of walking was 45 minutes with intensity of 65% of maximum heart rate. Heart rate controlled by Polar heart rate belt. The control group participated in measurements only and they were asked not to participate in any physical activity or exercise training.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 13.0). For the description of data, mean and standard deviation were used. Also, mean values of two groups in pre and post tests were compared by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for VO<sub>2</sub>max, RHR, blood pressure, body weight, BMI and WHR. The significance level of this study was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref> shows the VO<sub>2</sub>max, RHR, blood pressure, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference and WHR values of two groups in pre and post tests.

In Visovski et al (2005) study functional and aerobic capacity was improved in postmenopausal women with breast cancer after 12 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref> Mustian et al (2006) reported that combination exercise training can improve aerobic capacity of the women with breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref> Schneider et al (2007) reported that mid intensity controlled exercise training maintains or improves the aerobic capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref> Also, Nikander et al (2007) and Mc Neely et al (2006) showed that exercise training can maintain or improve the aerobic capacity in women with breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> The findings of present study confirm the previous studies and shows that exercise training can improve the VO<sub>2</sub>max in the postmenopausal woman with breast cancer. Although the aerobic capacity of women decreases as a result of breast cancer and its treatments, but exercise training may improve the aerobic capacity. It seems that the improvement in the maximum aerobic capacity as a result of exercise training could cause an improvement in the functional capacity of the postmenopausal woman with breast cancer. Also, improvement in the maximum aerobic capacity may decrease the signs of exhaustion resulting from the treatment in postmeno-pausal women with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Resting Heart Rate (RHR)</title><p>In this study, RHR of the intervention group was decreased by 4.65 beat/min and RHR of the control group was increased by 0.93 beat/min. There was a significant difference between RHR of two groups, after 15 weeks. Also, this finding shows that the resistance and aerobic exercise training can have a significant effect on the decrease of RHR in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. This finding is in agreement with others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref> Therefore, it seems that combination exercise training can decrease RHR in the postmenopausal women with breast cancer. The mechanism for reduction of RHR can be due to improvement of cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Blood Pressure</title><p>In the present study exercise training did not have a significant effect on the decrease of blood pressure of the postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Nevertheless, after 15 weeks blood pressure had a 0.72 mmHg decrease in the intervention group and 1.68 mmHg increases in the control group. This finding is not in agreement with others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref> The contradiction of this result and the previous study may be related to the nature of the exercise training. It seems that moderate aerobic exercise training such as walking have better effects on the decrease of blood pressure than the combination or resistance training. Therefore, it can be possible that combination exercise training may not be improving the blood pressure of the postmenopausal women with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8"><title>Anthropometric Variables</title><p>The findings of this study indicated that exercise training has significant effects on body weight loss and BMI of the intervention group. After 15 weeks, body weight and BMI of the intervention group decreased by 0.99 kg and 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. In the control group after 15 weeks, body weight and BMI increased by 1.43 kg and 0.54 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Also, the findings of this study showed that combination exercise training has a significant effect on WHR of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. This finding is in agreement with Wilson et al (2005) and Ohira et al (2006) studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref> However, this finding is not in agreement with McNeely et al (2006) and Matthews et al (2007) studies that reported the absence of significant effect of exercise training on body weight, BMI and WHR of women with breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref> The possible reason for this can be related to the type and duration of exercise training. Because Matthews et al (2007) used uncontrolled walking program for 12 weeks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref> while in the present study supervised combination exercise training was used for 15 weeks. Also, McNeely et al (2006) studied the effect of exercise training on all women with breast cancer at any age with any treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> Whereas, the present study was limited to postmenopausal women with breast cancer who was between 50 to 65 years old and have had surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments and had current hormone therapy.
