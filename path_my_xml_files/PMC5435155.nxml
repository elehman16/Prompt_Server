Subjects were prone with the dominant arm positioned in neutral rotation at 90&#x000b0; of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. A towel was placed under the participant&#x02019;s shoulder to maintain alignment of the humerus within the scapular plane. Emollient was applied to the posterior axillary border to allow the tool to glide smoothly, and all participants were treated using the same instrument (SASTM No. 4). Treatment strokes were administered at approximately a 45&#x000b0; angle to the skin surface for 2 minutes in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the fiber alignment of the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. To ensure standardized dosage between participants, a metronome was set at a rate of 45 Hz for each treatment to monitor frequency of strokes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section17-1941738117702835"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare age, height, weight, subjective outcomes (Pennsylvania Shoulder Scale and Functional Arm Scale for Throwers), and level of competition between the 2 treatment groups. Separate 3-way mixed-model ANOVAs (group &#x000d7; arm &#x000d7; time) were used to determine the underlying treatment effects for each dependent variable. Post hoc planned comparisons were made between sides and groups for the dependent variables of interest (external rotation, internal rotation, total arc of motion, and horizontal adduction) using simple main effects differences. Pearson correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) were calculated to assess the association between humeral torsion and the ROM deficits.</p><p>To further examine the clinical utility of our results, a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) statistic was calculated to examine the change in ROM risk factors between intervention groups. The NNT statistic is useful for examining the comparative effectiveness between 2 interventions when the outcome is dichotomous (ie, success vs failure). In the current study, players no longer displaying ROM risk factors (&#x0003c;15&#x000b0; deficit) after the intervention were considered to have a successful outcome. Conversely, those that still displayed 15&#x000b0; of deficits or more were considered an unsuccessful outcome. Fifteen degrees was selected as a successful outcome threshold based on previous research indicating that baseball players have up to 4 times the relative risk of sustaining a prospective arm injury when values meet or exceed this limit.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1941738117702835" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> NNT statistics were calculated for the following categories of injury risk factors: (1) internal rotation + total arc of motion (&#x02265;15&#x000b0;), (2) horizontal adduction (&#x02265;15&#x000b0;), and (3) those who qualified for both categories (internal rotation + total arc of motion and horizontal adduction). The success and failure rates were calculated as the relative change from pretest to posttest and compared between intervention groups using a chi-square test. NNT statistics were then calculated with an associated 95% CI. G-Power software (version 3.1.6) was used to estimate the required effect size and power based on a moderate a priori estimation of 0.30 and 0.80, respectively.
