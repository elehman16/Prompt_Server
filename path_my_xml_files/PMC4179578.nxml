Patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy are vulnerable to pain and complications of extubation. However, pain control during extubation is still inadequate. Remifentanil, a new opioid with rapid onset and short duration of action, provides adequate analgesia during procedures with minimal effect of respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, controlled parallel-group design. Patients with delayed extubation after intracranial surgery are screened daily. Adult patients ready for extubation are enrolled and assigned randomly to one of the two treatment study groups, labelled as the &#x02018;Remi group&#x02019; or &#x02018;Saline group&#x02019;. Patients in the Remi group receive an intravenous bolus dose of remifentanil 0.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/kg over 60&#x02005;s followed by a continuous infusion 0.05&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/kg/min for 20&#x02005;min. Patients in the Saline group receive an intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride at a volume and rate equal to that of remifentanil. Pain intensity is measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score. Adverse events during drug infusion are documented and reported. Patients will be followed up until hospital discharge, death or 60&#x02005;days after the trial intervention on a first come, first served basis. Details of the incidence of reintubation and reoperation within 72&#x02005;h after extubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital and mortality are collected. The primary end point is the incidence of severe pain (defined as a VAS pain score more than 5&#x02005;cm) during the periextubation period (defined as the period of time from immediately before extubation to 20&#x02005;min after extubation).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University.

In the present study, only remifentanil is investigated for prophylactic analgesia during extubation. This is the main limitation of the study.

So the results of this study will not be applied to all patients after craniotomy, especially for those with consciousness impairments.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinical epidemiology studies have shown that critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk of pain, and that inadequate treatment of pain is associated with adverse outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Appropriate analgesia not only attenuates stress response resulting from pain but also reduces the incidence of iatrogenic complications, as well as shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> In addition to pain at rest, pain related to procedures is common in ICU patients, and inadequate treatment of procedural pain remains a significant problem for many patients.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The revised clinical practice guidelines for management of pain, agitation and delirium from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recommend that prophylactic analgesia should be used to alleviate pain in adult ICU patients prior to chest tube removal and other types of potentially painful procedures, and also suggest that intravenous opioids should be considered as the first-line drug class of choice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Manipulation of the artificial airway, especially endotracheal extubation, is among the high pain-intensity procedures in ICU. By using the patient's self-report pain scale as the pain evaluation method, Gacouin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found that 45% of patients experienced severe pain at the time of endotracheal extubation. Acute pain during extubation is associated with sympathetic nervous system activation, which could result in respiratory and circulatory instability.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore, it is reasonable to control pain and stress responses at the time of endotracheal extubation in some high-risk patients, such as those after intracranial surgery. It has been reported that the proportion of patients who underwent delayed extubation after craniotomy is about 10&#x02013;50%.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These patients are vulnerable to pain and complications of extubation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> On the other hand, despite a greater awareness of pain during endotracheal extubation, clinicians remain reluctant to administer opioids in patients following craniotomy. The major concern is the side effects of respiratory depression and influence on consciousness of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, up to now, no study has been published for adequate management of pain during extubation in patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy.</p><p>Remifentanil is a potent synthetic selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonist with a rapid onset and short duration of action, regardless of the duration of its administration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Remifentanil differs from other synthetic opioids in its metabolism by non-specific plasma and tissue esterases. A study in human volunteers has shown that the respiratory depression of remifentanil by bolus injection is mild and easily treated with requests to breathe or the administration of oxygen.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These pharmacological properties suggest that remifentanil could be a potentially safe and effective analgesic in clinical situations requiring a brief period of intense control of pain, such as painful procedures in the ICU.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> There have been reports of remifentanil being used as a prophylactic analgesia during removal of a chest drain,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> insertion and removal of a long-term central venous access,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> dressing change<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and endotracheal suctioning.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, although plenty of studies have shown that remifentanil facilitates an emergency in the general anaesthesia and weaning process in mechanical ventilation,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> studies for prophylactic use of remifentanil in endotracheal extubation are limited.</p><p>There has been increased interest in the use of remifentanil in brain injured patients. In patients with traumatic brain injury, it has been demonstrated that remifentanil has no significant changes in systematic and cerebral haemodynamics, such as intracranial pressure, mean blood pressure (BP), cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Several studies also compared remifentanil with fentanyl or morphine as an analgesic in neurological ICU patients. A randomised multicentre study in patients with brain injury showed that mean neurological assessment times were significantly shorter with remifentanil than with fentanyl or with morphine, and that patients were extubated significantly faster after remifentanil than after morphine.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Another retrospective study investigated patients with delayed extubation after brain tumour surgery and found that mean extubation times were significantly shorter after remifentanil/propofol than after fentanyl/midazolam, and that LOS in the ICU was significantly reduced.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These results indicate that the rapid metabolism and lack of accumulation of remifentanil facilitate faster waking and neurological assessment, and also suggest that remifentanil might be a better choice of analgesic in patients with brain injury.</p><p>In the present study, remifentanil is used as prophylactic analgesics in patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remifentanil for control of pain and stress responses due to extubation. The primary hypothesis is that the prophylactic use of remifentanil will reduce the incidence of severe pain during endotracheal extubation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design overview</title><p>The present study is a prospective, single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled two-arm trial in patients with delayed extubation after craniotomy.</p><p>Trial schematic diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005635F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005635F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Trial schematic diagram (ICU, intensive care unit; IV, intravenous; LOS, length of stay).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005635f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting and population</title><p>The study setting is a neurosurgical ICU (30 beds) at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital (1100 beds), Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.</p><p>All patients after intracranial surgery with delayed extubation admitted to our ICU are screened daily for study eligibility.</p><p>Inclusion criteria are:

Apart from opioids, other analgesics (such as steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and/or non-pharmacological interventions (such as relaxation) have been shown to alleviate pain in adult ICU patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although the main purpose of the present study is not to clarify the effect of comprehensive approach on manipulation of pain during extubation, we will collect data on the use of analgesics during anaesthesia and ICU stay, and the formulation and dose of the postoperative PCA pump. The use of non-opioids and non-pharmacological interventions during extubation needs to be investigated further.</p><p>Currently, vital signs are not recommended to be used alone for pain assessment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, we still incorporated changes of vital signs during the periextubation period as a secondary end point for two reasons. First, nociceptive stimulus during endotracheal extubation may result in adverse events in patients after craniotomy, such as brain swelling and haemorrhage. These data will help to clarify whether remifentanil could diminish this stress response. Second, since large doses of opioid agents usually result in respiratory and circulatory depression, this secondary end point will provide safe consideration about the use of these agents.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study protocol. First, since there is no proven dose of remifentanil which can prevent sedation and respiratory depression in a neurosurgical patient being weaned off the ventilator, the dose of remifentanyl used in the present study is arbitrary. Second, we assumed a 15% reduction in severe pain after the administration of remifentanil in the calculation of the sample size. There are no previous studies to support this. However, an effectivity of 15% is generally adopted in clinical studies. Third, opioids may result in a change of consciousness. We only observe the response to calling and patting on the shoulder during the infusion of study agents. Documentation of sedation scales (such as the Vancouver interaction scale or sedation&#x02013;agitation scale) will add value to the study. Finally, evaluation of VAS requires the patient's ability to self-report clearly, and this may limit the patient population eligible for the present study. So the results of this study will not be applied to all patients after craniotomy, especially for those with consciousness impairments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e127" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005635.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e128" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005635.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Y-XW and J-XZ participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
