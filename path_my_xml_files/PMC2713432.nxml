Here we tested whether humans, like other mammals, are able to detect emotional stress in others by chemosensory cues. Sweat samples collected from individuals undergoing an acute emotional stressor, with exercise as a control, were pooled and presented to a separate group of participants (blind to condition) during four experiments. In an fMRI experiment and its replication, we showed that scanned participants showed amygdala activation in response to samples obtained from donors undergoing an emotional, but not physical, stressor. An odor-discrimination experiment suggested the effect was primarily due to emotional, and not odor, differences between the two stimuli. A fourth experiment investigated behavioral effects, demonstrating that stress samples sharpened emotion-perception of ambiguous facial stimuli. Together, our findings suggest human chemosensory signaling of emotional stress, with neurobiological and behavioral effects.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The existence of alarm substances in communicating emotional stress via chemosensory cues is well-established in mammals <xref rid="pone.0006415-Pfeiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, with animals exposed to odors secreted by acutely stressed conspecifics expressing neurobiological and behavioral changes consistent with increased arousal and threat-assessment <xref rid="pone.0006415-Kiyokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006415-Inagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In recent years, a significant body of research has explored the role of human chemosensory signals for reproductive function, an area that is controversial <xref rid="pone.0006415-Wysocki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> but which appears to provide some evidence for influence on humans in some of the same contexts in which they exist for non-human mammals <xref rid="pone.0006415-McClintock1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006415-Villemure1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This conservation across species is biologically suggestive, and predicts that human chemosensory signals for emotional stress may also exist and assume functional importance.</p><p>To date, six studies worldwide have published reports on human stress signaling via sweat. Two studies <xref rid="pone.0006415-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006415-Ackerl1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found that individuals were able to identify, solely by smelling sweat collected on axillary pads, whether the sweat donor had been watching a frightening versus benign film. Using a similar collection paradigm with frightening and benign films, one study <xref rid="pone.0006415-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> found that participants, when smelling the stress, but not neutral, sweat showed improved accuracy in completing a word-association task, while another <xref rid="pone.0006415-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> found that stress sweat caused participants to interpret ambiguous expressions as more fearful. Two studies collected sweat from individuals preparing to take a difficult examination with exercise sweat as the control. In one study, females exposed to the stress odor were less likely to judge a face as positive when primed with a positive face <xref rid="pone.0006415-Pause1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, while in the other, auditory stimuli provoked an increased startle response <xref rid="pone.0006415-Prehn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> when participants breathed sweat collected during the stress condition.</p><p>We set out to determine whether breathing the sweat of people who were emotionally stressed produced, in a group of unrelated individuals, neurobiological evidence of emotion-perception. The primary area associated with emotion-processing is the amygdala <xref rid="pone.0006415-LeDoux1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006415-Phelps1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which has been reliably activated in human neuroimaging studies of emotion <xref rid="pone.0006415-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> as well as animal studies using rat alarm substances <xref rid="pone.0006415-Kiyokawa2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>To obtain human sweat stimuli, we first collected axillary samples obtained from 144 individuals participating in a stress condition (first-time tandem skydive) and a control condition (running on a treadmill for the same duration of time at the same time of day). Sweat donors jumped from 4 km (13,000 ft.), with one full minute of free-fall at a vertical speed of 193 km/hr and four minutes under the parachute. Because the tandem-master controlled the descent, the skydiving condition produced a predominantly emotional but not physical stressor for our sweat donors, while the exercise condition produced a predominantly physical but not emotional stressor. Significant increases in both participant cortisol-levels (repeated-measures ANOVA, <italic>pre&#x02212;post Stress vs. Exercise</italic>: <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39.87, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40) and state-anxiety (paired t-test: <italic>t</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10.02, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40), confirmed that the paradigm was successful at inducing emotional stress. The sweat collection and storage protocols were designed to prevent bacterial growth, which gives otherwise odorless sweat its characteristic aversive odor.</p><p>Axillary samples, once extracted and pooled for each condition, were then used as stimuli for four experiments. Two fMRI experiments assessed amygdala activation as well as possible gender interactions that could indicate confounds due to reproductive chemosignals, which have been shown to be sex-specific <xref rid="pone.0006415-Savic1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The amygdala is not only associated with emotion, but also plays a key role in olfactory processing <xref rid="pone.0006415-Zald1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To confirm that test and control conditions differed only with respect to emotion, and not perceivable odor, we used a double-blind forced-choice discrimination task, as well as Likert scales, to verify that participants were unable to detect intensity, valence, or qualitative differences in odor between the stress and exercise sweat. Finally, we tested the behavioral implications of the amygdala activation, to investigate how stress sweat affects threat-perception using psychometric curves generated by participants' responses to morphed neutral-to-threatening faces.</p><p>Participants for all experiments were screened for anosmia prior to testing. For the fMRI and behavioral experiments, presentation of sweat extracts was controlled with synchronized nasal inhalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g001">Figure 1</xref>); for the odor discrimination experiments, individuals were asked to sniff the sample.</p><fig id="pone-0006415-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006415.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>During the fMRI scans, participants' breathing was synchronized via a continuously expanding and contracting circle (a), which cued inhalation and exhalation, respectively.</title><p>Stress and exercise sweat were presented in a randomized block design, with each 20s block comprised of four inhalations-exhalations (b), timed to a five-second cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006415.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>fMRI Experiments</title><p>In the original experiment, we presented sweat from 40 male donors to 16 participants (50&#x00025; female) while their brains were scanned using fMRI.

Sweat collected during an acute emotional stressor, and subsequently presented to an unrelated group of individuals, produced significant brain activation in regions responsible for emotional processing without conscious perception of distinct odor; behavioral data, our own as well as those from previous studies, suggest the emotional processing may be specific to enhancing vigilance and sharpening threat-discrimination.</p><p>Our hypothesis and analyses targeted the amygdala, given its critical role in emotion processing; however, areas associated with vision, motor control, and goal-directed behavior also activated in response to the stress sweat. Previous research has established that emotional stimuli not only activate areas of the brain associated specifically with emotion-perception, but also activate sensory areas associated with perception of concomitantly-presented stimuli <xref rid="pone.0006415-Adolphs1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; this is thought to reflect the increased salience attached to stimuli perceived within emotional contexts. We therefore suspect that increased activation within the cerebellum, BA7, and BA20 most likely resulted from participants&#x02018; enhanced perception during the stress condition of the visual breathing cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g001">Figure 1a</xref>), which required timing inhalation and exhalation to the motion of expanding and contracting rings throughout the experiment.</p><p>Because this was the first neuroimaging study to investigate chemosensory cues to emotional stress, we were careful to rigorously control for a number of potential confounds, both methodological and conceptual. Bacterial contamination of sweat contributes to its strong aversive odor; therefore, we developed sample collection methods that would keep the samples as sterile as possible while still preserving chemical components of interest in apocrine sweat. These were validated using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To ensure that differences observed between the two conditions were not due to differences in participant compliance in following the synchronized cues, we also analyzed trial-specific respiratory parameters for the first experiment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and closely monitored participants&#x02019; respiration in real-time during each subsequent experiment. The lack of donor sex-detector sex interactions suggests that the effect is unlikely to be consequent to reproductive pheromones released during either of the two conditions. This is a critical point, since a serious limitation of previous studies using stress sweat was the tendency to use male donors and female detectors, which made it impossible to identify sex-effects or eliminate reproductive pheromones as possible confounds to the effect. Finally, replication of the neurobiological findings across two independent fMRI studies with different donor and detector participants suggests the effect is robust to individual variability.</p><p>The mean percentage signal change values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g002">Figure 2b</xref>) initially appeared to suggest that, as much as stress sweat increased amygdala activity from baseline, exercise sweat reduced it from baseline; therefore, the effect might have been inflated by our choice of a control condition (although using AIR as a control condition would have been even more problematic since AIR, unlike EXERCISE, would not have controlled for sweat odor). However, statistical analyses that consider the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g002">Figure 2c</xref>) make clear that it was the STRESS condition, and not the EXERCISE condition, that was primarily responsible for the STRESS-EXERCISE effect.

Since both original and replication studies show significant differences for the STRESS-REST contrasts, but not for the EXERCISE-REST contrast, it is clear that results obtained for the STRESS-EXERCISE contrast were not driven by participants' responses to the EXERCISE sweat.</p><p>The behavioral effect of the STRESS sweat was to sharpen emotional discrimination, rather than to lower thresholds for attribution of threat. Our findings are in line with more recent conceptualization of the amygdala's role, in which the amygdala appears to be not simply a marker for fear, but rather involved in evaluating stimuli for potential threat and then coordinating appropriate responses via its cortical feedback connections (see, for example, <xref rid="pone.0006415-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>). The latter view is consistent with a wide range of fMRI results: for example, the amygdala is activated during conditioning to pain <xref rid="pone.0006415-Buchel1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006415-LaBar1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, anticipation of potential pain (<xref rid="pone.0006415-Phelps2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> but not to pain itself <xref rid="pone.0006415-Derbyshire1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006415-Petrovic2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>; likewise, the amygdala is activated in response to social cues to potential threat, such as the aversive outcomes implied by fearful faces <xref rid="pone.0006415-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> but not to unambiguously threatening stimuli such as the object of phobias <xref rid="pone.0006415-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006415-Wik1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. As such, one would expect that a chemosensory cue that facilitates the evaluation and discrimination of threat from non-threat would also activate the amygdala, as well as lowering sensory gating for olfactory, visual, and auditory cues that might further inform risk-assessment.</p><p>One potential limitation of our study design was that we morphed between only two facial expressions (fear versus neutral); therefore, our study could not confirm whether the sharpened discrimination that we observed extended to all emotional expressions or was restricted specifically for threat. However, results obtained by a recent study <xref rid="pone.0006415-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> argue against generalization. Asked to distinguish between &#x0201c;happy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fearful,&#x0201d; in a design similar to ours using morphed facial expressions, participants rated ambiguous faces as &#x0201c;fearful&#x0201d; more frequently in the context of stress sweat, thereby lowering thresholds for detecting fear in others rather than sharpening discrimination. These results suggest that angry and fearful faces communicate distinct types of information that may interact with chemosensory stress cues in complementary ways. <italic>Angry</italic> faces represent a direct threat, and therefore detection of an anxious colleague's alarm cues may elicit greater vigilance in evaluating whether stimuli signal potential for danger. In contrast, when asked to identify whether faces are <italic>fearful</italic> in the context of stress sweat, participants are essentially integrating multi-modal sensory cues in detecting colleagues' anxiety, much as auditory cues such as laughter would bias visual perception of an ambiguous smiling faces towards &#x0201c;joy.&#x0201d; Future research, using a within-subjects design, can more directly test this hypothesis.</p><p>Previous protocols have sampled sweat in response to stressors such as horror films and pre-examination anxiety. These stressors obviously have the advantage of being easier to administer, but are quite removed from alarm pheromones' evolutionary purpose; i.e., fear associated with imminent physical danger. We chose to address this limitation by using first-time tandem skydives, which have shown to reliably induce acute fear (approaching near-pathological states and including traumatic psychological symptoms such as dissociation, loss of awareness, and time-distortion<xref rid="pone.0006415-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006415-Sterlini1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>), in an ethically acceptable and scientifically-controlled manner. The endocrine and self-report measures confirm that the protocol reliably provoked profound emotional stress in our sweat donors. However, debriefing of our donors and their tandem-masters post-jump indicated that while fear markedly increased during the ascent, peaking in the minutes leading up to exiting the plane and during freefall (&#x02265;16 minutes), feelings of relief and/or thrill sometimes followed once the parachute opened and upon landing (&#x02264;4 minutes). Donor sweat pads could not be removed until immediately after landing; therefore, it is theoretically possible that our neurobiological and behavioral results resulted from chemosignals emitted in response to non-affect-specific hyper-arousal or thrill, rather than pure fear. However, it is important to note that while alarm substances are well-established neurobiologically, behaviorally, and chemically in a wide number of species, including mammals <xref rid="pone.0006415-Wyatt1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, and therefore their conservation in humans is a reasonable extension, an equivalent &#x0201c;thrill&#x0201d; pheromone has never been reported for any species. Therefore, we believe it is much more likely that participants excreted an alarm substance during the initial fear portion of the protocol, which was retained in the sample even in the face of later relief.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experiments reported in this manuscript were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stony Brook University.

All participants were between the ages of 18&#x02013;50 (&#x003bc;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25; s.d.&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6), with a Body Mass Index&#x0003c;25, free of cardiac illness, and had not skydived before. Participants wore a digital altimeter (Altimaster Neptune), showing a consistent rise-time of 15 minutes, jump at 13,000 ft, freefall lasting 60 seconds, and parachuting for an additional 4 minutes before landing; this resulted in stress condition of total of 20 minutes (5 minute fall plus 15 minutes of anticipatory anxiety preceding the jump). Salivary cortisol samples were obtained from 40 of the participants using the passive drool method <xref rid="pone.0006415-Gallagher1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> immediately prior to take-off (15 minutes prior to the jump) and again following landing. Cortisol measurements were taken between 1&#x02013;7 pm to minimize diurnal variability and assayed using Salimetrics Salivary Cortisol Kits (Salimetrics, State College PA). Self-reports of skydiver state anxiety were obtained using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (Mind Garden Inc., Menlo Park, CA), 15 minutes prior to the jump as well as 15 minutes prior to the exercise.</p><p>The control condition was conducted on a separate day than the skydive, within 2 hours of the jump-time. During the control condition, each sweat donor was instructed to run on a treadmill at his or her maximum comfortable rate for 20 minutes. We allowed participants to control their own levels of exertion to ensure production of sweat without inducing emotional distress. Salivary samples were obtained immediately prior to start and immediately following the end of the exercise, and were collected and assayed identically to those collected during the stress condition.</p><p>For our skydiving condition we deliberately chose to use only tandem jumps. This meant that the tandem-master took over all physical aspects of the jump, including stabilization and steering, to ensure that physiological measures obtained during skydive condition reflected predominantly emotional, and not physical, stress.

Thus, using both self-report and physiological measures we confirmed that skydives were an effective means of inducing a reliable emotional stress response and that exercise functioned as an acceptable control condition.</p><p>Sweat sample collection methods were identical for test and control collections. Sweat pads were attached immediately prior to participants' boarding and were removed immediately after landing. The total period of sweat collection, during both skydive and exercise conditions, was 20 minutes. Potential participants were excluded from participation in the study if they had used deodorant/antiperspirant on either day of the sample collection. Participants first had their underarms closely shaved. Prior to application of the sweat pads, the participants' axillary regions were washed with a non-ionic detergent (0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100), rinsed with ultra-pure water, dried, and finally, washed with isopropanol. Axillary sweat was collected on sterile cleaned (washed 2x in Methanol, 2x in Hexane; both solvents are 99.9&#x00025; GC<sup>2</sup>, Burdick &#x00026; Jackson, USA) woven gauze sponges (2&#x000d7;2&#x0201d;, Dukal, USA) that were placed on clean thin mylar squares and taped in the underarm with waterproof adhesive tape (2&#x0201d;, HYTAPE, USA). Solvents were fully evaporated prior to sweat pad construction. After the collection of the sweat was completed, the sweat pad was removed and immediately frozen in tightly sealed Teflon-lined and pre-cleaned borosilicate vials (20 ml, VWR Traceclean, VWR, USA) at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, until the sweat extraction.</p><p>To extract the liquid sweat from the sweat pad, we used salivette tubes (Sarstedt, Newton, NC), substituting the sweat pad for the salivette's absorbent insert. Next, double-distilled water was added so that the tube insert was completely filled with both water and the pad. The salivette tubes were placed into an ultrasound bath for 5 minutes and centrifuged to separate the aqueous sample from the cotton pad. The samples were separated into two batches of 20 participants each, each batch of which were pooled and diluted to produce sufficient sample for 8 fMRI experiments.

The protocol for GC was as follows: 1) the temperature was kept at 70C for 5 min; 2) we increased the temperature to 300C ramping by 10 C/min; 3) temperature was kept at 300C for ten minutes.</p><p>A typical total ion count GC trace of our samples is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g006">Figure 6</xref>.

In our study we paid particular attention to optimizing the delivery of semi-volatile molecules because we expect that a putative stress pheromone will be a steroid derivative (such as androsta-4,16-dien-3-one). The physical chemistry of vaporization of solutes in a typical olfactometer is straightforward. While the bubbles travel through the solution the solutes partition into the air and will be carried away <xref rid="pone.0006415-Mackay1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.

In general, for an efficient delivery one needs to consider all parameters in eq.2. The Henry's law constant for a particular solute can be adjusted by the choice of solvent. To deliver a hydrophobic molecule, the Henry's law constant is highest the more water-like the solvent is. Other parameters that can be adjusted are flow rate and the total volume. If one has fragrance molecules in abundance, the best strategy is to have a long exponential decay time which results in a nearly constant rate delivery. In our case, since both the chemical nature of the molecules and their concentration were unknown variables, we chose the most efficient delivery though an aqueous solution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Methods for Presenting Sweat Samples</title><p>For all experiments described here, the STRESS (test) and EXERCISE (control) conditions were obtained from pooled sweat obtained from the Donor stress and exercise conditions (described above), respectively. The AIR condition was room air, which was presented via the olfactometer as an additional control condition.</p><p>For both fMRI and behavioral experiments, all olfactory stimuli were presented via a MRI compatible olfactometer of our own design. The airflow control system was located outside the testing room and was based upon a Lorig-design olfactometer <xref rid="pone.0006415-Lorig1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> ensuring that switching between six samples could be achieved without change in flow velocity to the nostrils (&#x02248;2.5 L/min). Five sample lines and one constant air-flow line were fed into the testing room and were connected to the nebulizer box close to the head of the participant. The stimulus delivery was achieved through nebulizing the aqueous sweat samples in commercially available nebulizers close to the head of the participant. When pressurized, the nebulizer creates a fine mist that rapidly releases semi-volatile components from the aqueous solution into the air. We inserted one-way valves between the nebulizers and the air-mixing manifold to ensure that there was no odor leakage from nebulizers that were not currently pressurized. After mixing of the constant air-flow line (0.5 L/min) with air from one of the nebulizers in the manifold, the air was delivered through a nasal cannula to the participant.</p><p>For both fMRI and behavioral studies, we employed breathing cues synchronized to the delivery of the olfactometer. The breathing cues were continuous throughout the experiment and did not indicate the presence or absence of a condition, nor did they distinguish between conditions. Since all stimuli were delivered via a nasal cannula and we did not want to alert participants that a condition was being presented, participants were instructed and trained to breathe on cue and only through their noses for the entire duration of the experiment.</p><p>For both fMRI studies, the cue was visual and presented on a projected video screen within the scanner. This consisted of an expanding and contracting ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g001">Figure 1a</xref>), which cued inhalation and exhalation respectively. For the duration of the entire experiments, breathing was paced to a 5 second cycle: 2.5 seconds inhalation and 2.5 seconds exhalation, synchronized to the TR of the scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006415-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). In order to verify that participants were, in fact, capable of complying with the breathing cues for the duration of the experiment, for the first fMRI experiment we monitored breathing in real time throughout the scan with a MR-compatible respiration belt (Philips Medical Systems, N.A., Bothell, WA). Respiration data were acquired at 500 Hz and noise was removed from the data using a 5th order low-pass elliptic filter with a 2 Hz cutoff. Filtered data were then passed through a peak detection algorithm, in order to calculate breathing rate and depth for each run. Because the breathing cues that we used for the fMRI experiments were visual, and therefore might have distracted from the visual task, for the behavioral experiment we instead used auditory breathing cues to synchronize inhalation with the olfactometer. Continuously increasing and decreasing pitch, combined with a subtle rhythmic element that conveyed time, signaled inhalation and exhalation respectively. Respiratory compliance was monitored remotely throughout the experiment (Biopac Systems, Goleta CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Validation of Trial-Specific Respiratory Parameters</title><p>To confirm compliance, we collected and analyzed respiratory data from participants tested on the first fMRI study.

In this paper we focus on the breathing conditions, since their time-course is more clearly similar to those produced by emotional, rather than olfactory, stimuli; a separate article will address the sniffing conditions. Each odor period lasted 20 seconds (4 TR), with a 20 second gap between odor presentations (REST). The orders of the six conditions were pseudo-randomized in each of the six runs. Besides the visual inhalation cues and three odor conditions (stress sweat, exercise sweat, and air), no other stimuli were presented to participants during the scans.</p><p>Participants were told that they might or might not smell odors throughout the experiment.

Iterative optimization of all acquisition parameters prior to the experiment ensured that the mean intensity for signal to noise was adequate over our region of interest, the amygdala (<italic>left amygdala</italic>: 179.4; <italic>right amygdala</italic>: 175.0).</p><p>All image pre-processing for the analyses was implemented using the SPM5 program (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). For each participant's GE-EPI dataset: 1) Data were temporally shifted to correct for the order of slice acquisition, using the first slice acquired in the TR as the reference. 2) All GE-EPI images were realigned to each other. 3) The T1-weighted (structural) image was co-registered to the first EPI volume using a mutual information co-registration algorithm. 4) The co-registered high-resolution image was used to determine parameters (7&#x000d7;8&#x000d7;7 non-linear basis functions) for transformation into a Talairach standard space defined by the Montreal Neurologic Institute template brain supplied with SPM5. 5) This transformation was applied to the GE-EPI data, which were re-sliced to 2 mm&#x000d7;2 mm&#x000d7;2 mm using 7<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial approximation to sinc-interpolation. 6) The spatially normalized GE-EPI data were spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full-width-at-half-maximum&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6 mm).</p><p>The fMRI data analysis comprised two levels of voxel-wise General Linear Models (GLMs). The first-level GLM is a participant-separable time series analysis that yields summary measures to be used in the second-level GLM, which affords statistical inference at the population level. In the first-level GLM, conditions were modeled with predictors comprising 20-second duration boxcars convolved with the default hemodynamic response function (HRF) of SPM5. A 0.2 Hz signal (to model the breathing frequency), motion parameters and their squares were included in the model as nuisance covariates. Linear combinations of the estimated coefficients of these predictors (i.e., contrasts) of interest were then computed per voxel per participant. These contrasts were: (1) STRESS&#x02212;EXERCISE; (2) STRESS&#x02212;AIR; and (3) EXERCISE&#x02212;AIR. The first-level contrast images were used as the dependent variables into second-level GLMs. For each contrast, we performed a second-level statistical parametric mapping (SPM) test that was hypothesis-driven and therefore restricted to the amygdala bilaterally.

Pilot studies with 4,16-androstadien-3-one, oestra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol, as well as common odorants, were conducted prior to the experiment in order to optimize experimental parameters; these were set at 14 trials per 9 morph levels, with morph levels and faces chosen randomly for each trial. These 126 trials (14&#x000d7;9 morph levels) were presented under two conditions: while breathing stress sweat (STRESS), and while breathing exercise sweat (EXERCISE). The total experiment ran for 28 minutes. To maximize participant compliance and focus throughout the experiment, testing was divided up into four seven-minute runs: two for the STRESS condition, and two for the EXERCISE condition, with two minutes between runs. STRESS and EXERCISE conditions alternated for each participant, with condition order counter-balanced between participants.</p><p>Participants were instructed to indicate, following presentation of the facial stimuli, whether the face was &#x0201c;more neutral or more threatening.&#x0201d; Participants used a two-button computer mouse to make their choice, and were asked to do so as quickly as possible without making errors. Limits were set so that responses were not accepted after 2500 ms post-presentation; responses provided in fewer than 200 ms were excluded.</p><p>Each individual participated in 5 minutes of training prior to the experiment. Participants first practiced following the auditory breathing cues alone, using only room air. Participants then practiced only using the mouse to identify the faces as neutral or threatening. For the practice sessions, we used 0&#x00025; angry and 100&#x00025; angry poles for the three faces presented in the experiment; this served to perceptually &#x0201c;fix&#x0201d; the endpoints for the psychometric curves for all participants. Finally, after mastering both of these components, participants combined them to practice the behavioral task with the breathing cues, again using only 0&#x00025; and 100&#x00025; angry faces and room air.</p><p>This experiment was optimized for psychometric curve-fitting, a method often employed to exploit the instability linked to ambiguous stimuli in order to test subtle shifts in perception induced by an external manipulation <xref rid="pone.0006415-Newsome1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. For each participant, data for each condition (STRESS, EXERCISE) were fitted with a sigmoid function<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006415.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>p<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>0</sub>&#x0002b;&#x00394;p</italic> define upper and lower asymptotes, <italic>A<sub>0</sub></italic> was the inflection point, and <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> defined slope. The fitting was done using curve-fitting toolbox packaged with Matlab 7.4.0. (Mathworks, Natick MA). This function provided a natural fit to the data with a mean R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.98&#x000b1;0.02, as compared to a simple linear fit with mean R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.89&#x000b1;0.06. Statistical tests (repeated-measures ANOVA) were then performed on individual inflection points and slopes for each participant to assess changes in perceptual threshold and discrimination, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the following individuals for their assistance with the experiments presented in this manuscript: Igor Vostiar (analytical chemistry), Eric Zarahn (fMRI), Bosky Ravindranath (fMRI), Greg Hajcak (behavioral experiment), Bruce Brownawell (analytical chemistry), Mark Wagshul (fMRI), Tsafrir Greenberg (fMRI), Ray Maynard (sample collection), and the tandem-masters of Skydive Long Island (sample collection).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This research was supported by funding from the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center Natick DAAD16-99-C-1033 (LRMP), the Office of Naval Research N0014-04-1-005 (LRMP), and the National Institutes of Health 5-MO1-RR-10710 (Stony Brook University General Clinical Research Center).
