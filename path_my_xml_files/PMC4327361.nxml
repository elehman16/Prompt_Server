Healthy male participants (n=8; age: 28.8 &#x000b1; 6.4 years; body mass: 87.0 &#x000b1; 10.6 kg; body height: 181.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 cm; BMI: 26.5 &#x000b1; 4.1) were randomly separated into two experimental groups. The first group (LG-SM) performed an RT session (3 sets of 10 repetitions and a 2 min rest period) of the exercises in following order: bench press (BP), lat pulldown (LP), barbell shoulder press (BSP), triceps pushdown (TP) and barbell cut (BC). The second group (SM-LG) performed an RT session in following order: BC, TP, BSP, LA, BP. Blood was collected at the end of the last repetition of each session. Control samples of blood were taken after 30 min of rest. Significant differences were observed in the concentrations of total testosterone (p &#x0003c; 0.05), free testosterone (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and cortisol (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) after both RT sessions in comparison to rest. However, when comparing LG-SM and SM-LG, no significant differences were found. The results suggest that, while RT sessions induce an acute change in the levels of testosterone and cortisol, this response is independent of the order of exercising muscle groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>strength training</kwd><kwd>hormones</kwd><kwd>physical fitness</kwd><kwd>athletic performance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the American College of Sports Medicine (<xref rid="b1-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">ACSM, 2009</xref>), the main methodological prescription variables are a load, volume, rest interval between sets/exercises, frequency of sessions, exercise modality, repetition velocity and exercise order. Among these variables, exercise order has been studied less frequently in controlled investigations. Current guidelines for the resistance training (RT) program design recommend that large muscle-group exercises generally should be performed first in a training session (<xref rid="b1-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">ACSM, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b9-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Fleck and Kraemer, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In a recent review, <xref rid="b23-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2012)</xref> showed that exercise order affected repetition performance over multiple sets, indicating that total volume (number of repetitions) was greater when an exercise was placed at the beginning of an RT session, regardless of the relative amount of muscle mass involved. Exercises performed at the end of the session were associated with less repetitions, regardless of whether the movement involved a small muscle group, as in single-joint exercises, or a large muscle group, as in multijoint exercises. In terms of chronic adaptations, greater increases in strength were noted among untrained subjects for the first exercise of a given sequence, while lesser increases in strength were measured for the last exercise of a given sequence. Additionally, based on effect-size data for strength and hypertrophy, research suggests that exercise order should be arranged in priority of importance according to the training program&#x02019;s goal, and irrespective of whether the exercise involves a relatively large or small muscle group (<xref rid="b6-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b24-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b28-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Spinetti et al., 2010</xref>). According to <xref rid="b23-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2012)</xref>, even considering acute responses or chronic adaptations, exercise order should be prioritized so that the exercises that best address individual needs and training objectives are performed first.</p><p>Recently, <xref rid="b22-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2013)</xref> showed that several acute studies had examined the effect of exercise order (<xref rid="b5-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Chaves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b8-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Figueiredo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b16-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b4-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Bellezza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b7-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Farinatti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b10-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Gentil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b25-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b29-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Spreuwenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b26-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b21-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sforzo and Touey, 1996</xref>), but none of those studies investigated the effect of exercise order on hormonal responses to an exercise session. The volume completed during an RT session has been shown to vary with exercise order, and the magnitude of acute hormonal responses can vary in a similar fashion. Therefore, <xref rid="b22-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2013)</xref> examined the acute hormonal responses to an upper-body RT session performed in opposite sequences (larger to smaller vs. smaller to larger muscle-group exercises). The main finding of this study was that exercise order affected the endocrine response to an upper-body resistance-exercise session.</p><p>The relevance of some circulating hormones for muscle adaptations to RT is highlighted by the findings that suppression of circulating testosterone concentrations prevents RT-induced hypertrophy in healthy men (<xref rid="b13-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Kvorning et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="b11-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al. (2001)</xref> showed that strength increased more when exercise sessions included an acute elevation of anabolic hormones. Therefore, an exercise-order effect on the acute hormonal response to RT sessions could help to explain the differences in strength and hypertrophy found when certain exercises are placed first or last in sessions. In addition, because of the lack of studies on muscle group exercise order and hormonal responses to RT sessions, this study evaluated and compared the acute endocrine response of total testosterone (TTE), free testosterone (FTE) and cortisol (CO) during RT sessions performed following two different exercise sequences based on the muscle groups engaged. We hypothesized that different muscle group exercise order is able to alter the acute endocrine responses after a single RT session.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight healthy males with the mean of age of 28.8 &#x000b1; 6.4 years were selected for the study.

Body height was measured on a stadiometer (Cardiomed), with accuracy of 0.1 cm. All individuals were measured barefoot and wearing a swimsuit. The BMI was determined by the ratio of body mass to body height squared [body mass in kilograms (kg) and body height in meters (m)].

To minimize errors during the exercises, a strategy proposed by <xref rid="b24-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref rid="b20-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Senna et al.

Verbal encouragement and free weights were used during the exercises and the weight of the equipment was confirmed on a platform scale.</p><p>To determine the load of each exercise, all participants had a maximum of five trials at each exercise with rest intervals ranging from 3 to 5 minutes. After load assessment, a 10 min rest period was allowed between exercises. The following standardized techniques were applied for each exercise:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>BP - The subject lay down on a horizontal bench with his buttocks in contact with the bench and feet flat against the ground. The bar was held in the hands in a pronation position with a distance of more than shoulder width. To perform the exercise, the bar was removed from the support with the help of an assistant and the bar was lowered to a 90&#x000b0; angle between the arm and forearm (eccentric phase). Next the bar was raised to complete a full extension of the elbows (concentric phase).</p></list-item><list-item><p>LP - The subject began with his elbows fully extended and the pull was performed with the hands pronated until the bar touched lightly on the collarbone (concentric phase).

Sequence LG-SM began with exercises of the large muscle groups and progressed to exercises with the small muscle groups by implementing the sequence of BP to LP, BSP, TP and BC. Sequence SM-LG began with the small muscle groups and progressed to the large muscle groups by the sequence BC to TP, BSP, LP and BP. For all exercises in both sequences, there were three sets of 10 repetitions, with rest intervals of 2 min between sets and 3 min between exercises.</p><p>Venous blood samples (5 mL) were collected using sterile surgical gloves, needles and syringes by an experienced nurse from the superficial veins of the arm (venipuncture). Collection occurred at rest and at the end of the last set of the last exercise of the sequence evaluated. The blood was stored in plastic tubes and transported in an insulated box to the laboratory where the serum was separated and stored at &#x02212;4 &#x000ba;C in a freezer until analysis. To evaluate changes in hormone plasma levels, the chemiluminescent assay (<xref rid="b17-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2008</xref>) was used and for TTE, a radioimmunoassay for CO was carried out as well (<xref rid="b19-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Riad-Fahmy et al., 1979</xref>).

Specific differences were determined using the Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test. An alpha level of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the comparisons. Additionally, to determine the magnitude of the results, effect sizes (ESs; the difference between pretest and posttest results divided by the pretest SD) were calculated for TTE, FTE and CO responses for both exercise sequences, and the scale proposed by <xref rid="b18-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Rhea (2004)</xref> was used to determine the magnitude of the ES.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The analysis of TTE showed significant differences (p &#x0003c; 0.05) for the overall effect between mean levels of TTE at rest when compared with the levels after the LG-SM and SM-LG routines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jhk-44-111">Figure 2</xref>).

(2013)</xref>, 20 men completed 2 sessions (3 sets; 70% one-repetition maximum; 2 minutes of passive rest between sets) of the same exercises in opposite sequences (larger to smaller vs. smaller to larger muscle groups). Total testosterone (TTE), free testosterone (FTE), testosterone/cortisol ratio (TE/CO), sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), growth hormone (GH), and cortisol (CO) concentrations were measured before and immediately after each sequence. The results indicated that GH concentration increased after both sessions, but the increase was significantly greater after the sequence in which larger muscle-group exercises were performed before the smaller muscle-group exercises. No differences were observed between sessions for TTE, FTE, SHBG, CO, or the TE/CO ratio at baseline or immediately after resistance exercise. These results indicate that performing larger muscle-group exercises first during an upper-body resistance-exercise session leads to a significantly greater GH response.</p><p>The main finding of this study is that exercise order does not affect the endocrine response of TTE, FTE and CO following an upper-body resistance-exercise session. These results indicate that from a practical standpoint, both sessions transiently altered the hormonal milieu in favor of muscle tissue building. Our results are in accordance with <xref rid="b22-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al. (2013)</xref>, who did not find any significant difference between exercise order (LG-SM and SM-LG) for TTE, FTE, SHBG, CO, or the TE/CO ratio immediately after resistance exercise. In addition, our effect-size data demonstrated that differences in TTE, FTE and CO were not evident based on exercise order (LG-SM and SM-LG). In <xref rid="b22-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000e3;o et al.&#x02019;s (2013)</xref> study, only the GH concentration showed an increase from LG-SM in the RT session. In our study, we did not measure the GH concentration.</p><p>An important factor should be noted in relation to acute hormonal responses from rest to the end of exercise for both LG-SM and SM-LG, because the exercises were performed based on the individual 10-RM load test. The evaluators provided no help during exercise movement execution. In a creative approach, <xref rid="b2-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Ahtiainen et al. (2003)</xref> submitted 16 subjects to two different protocols: a repetition maximum (RM) protocol, in which participants performed the exercises through 12-RM, and a second protocol of forced repetitions (FR), in which after the 12-RM exercise, a further 15% of the conventional load was added. The subjects were assisted by evaluators in order to conduct 3&#x02013;5 more repetitions, which led to higher levels of responses in TTE and FTE from FR. <xref rid="b14-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Leite et al. (2011)</xref> assessed the levels of GH, CO and TTE after two intensities of different exercises. A significantly greater increase was measured in the levels of CO in sets that were performed with 12-RM. In contrast, an increase in the TE/CO ratio was observed after a 6-RM set was performed. With regard to GH, an increase occurred also after a 12-RM set. Our findings are consistent with these results because we found increased testosterone and reduced CO. This is different than Smilios et al. (2003), who examined the effects of the number of sets (2, 4 and 6) on acute changes in TTE, CO and GH after three different protocols: (1) strength, (2) muscle hypertrophy and (3) resisted force. They reported that the number of sets did not affect the concentrations of CO and TTE in any of the three protocols.</p><p>One limitation of our study was that all subjects had considerable experience in strength training, but none of them had engaged in a training program starting with smaller muscle groups. This factor may have contributed to the differences in our results, namely that we did not find a significant difference in concentrations of TTE, FTE and CO between the LG-SM and SM-LG exercise protocols, which leads us to believe that these responses are associated with individual performance in each type of training, possibly affecting acute hormonal responses. Such hypothesis was tested by Tremblay et al. (2003). The researchers recruited 23 healthy men who carried out resistance training (n = 7), endurance training (n = 8) or remained sedentary (n = 7). They performed measurements after the aerobic training or resistance training sessions and concluded that the hormonal profile was more dependent on the type and intensity of exercise than on exercise volume. They also observed that the strength training practitioners had a higher endocrine response to the exercises.</p><p><xref rid="b15-jhk-44-111" ref-type="bibr">Linnamo et al. (2005)</xref> examined the acute hormonal responses in men and women within three different strength training protocols: (1) submaximal protocol, (2) maximum strength training protocol and (3) maximum explosive strength protocol. Their results indicated that during the maximum strength training protocol there were significant increases in TTE responses only in men while GH had a significant rise for both women and men. In comparison to our study, their participants only performed three exercises: sit-up, bench press and leg extension. Each was executed for 10-RM in 5 sets and with a 2 min rest interval between the sit-up and bench press and a 12 min rest interval before starting the leg extension exercise. In our study, we used a 2-min rest interval between sets and a 3-min rest interval between the exercises. We believe that this variation of intervals may have influenced the hormonal responses in the present study. Currently, no published studies have measured hormone responses after different sequences of exercises during resistance training. This study can be the first step for future research on how to evaluate the influence of exercise order on acute endocrine responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Regarding the order of the exercises and its ability to alter the responses of TTE, FTE and CO, we found increased levels of anabolic hormones TTE and FTE only between post-exercise (LG-SM or SM-LG) and pre-exercise (resting) conditions. Thus, the development and implementation of exercises based on muscle size is not supported based on hormonal responses. According to this reasoning, acute hormonal responses do not change as a function of the order of exercises based on muscle size. This suggests that the order of exercises should be based on the training priority principle.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-jhk-44-111"><element-citation
