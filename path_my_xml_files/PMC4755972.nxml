common causes of visiting a hospital. Such low back pain triggers symptoms of the lower
limbs such as radiating pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is
associated with decrease in strength and flexibility of the lumbar and lower limb
muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. What is important is that such
pain distorts normal signal input into muscles and sensory organs and disturbs postural
balance performance, triggers damage to balance maintenance ability, and causes abnormal
posture, resulting in an increase in biodynamic stress of the musculoskeletal system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous research reported that low back
pain weakened muscle strength of the lower limbs, decreased gait ability, balance ability,
and squeeze; triggered sensory decline such as in visual sense; and decreased sensory motor
adjustment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae and 1st sacral vertebra, where low back pain largely
occurs, are neurologically areas where peripheral nerves of the lower limbs pass, and
dynamic problems of this area trigger weakening of the muscles of the hip and knee joints
due to neurological disability; when this occurs over a long period of time, it triggers
changes in vertebrae posture, decreasing joint range of motion and causing joint
degeneration, and in order to prevent this, maintenance of appropriate posture and of range
of motion through normal muscle tone is important. When muscle are shortened for a long
period of time, they trigger muscle atrophy, a reduction in cross-sectional area, a decrease
in myomeres, accumulation of connective tissues, and an increase accumulation of fat in the
tendons and bring about proliferation of connective tissues within the articular capsule,
union between to cartilage surface and connective tissues, atrophy of the cartilage, and
malalignment of the ligaments<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
resultant abnormal stiffness of the joints and musculoskeletal changes such as restricted
range of motion restrict patients&#x02019; functional movement and movement of the joints<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Nerve mobilization techniques have been recently used as a method to adjust radiating pain
related to disk disease, and in particular, mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves
improve mobility of the sciatic nerves, decrease mechanosensitivity of the nervous system,
and heighten compliance of nerve tissues, relieving low back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through such mobilization techniques, damages to the
sciatic nerves may be removed, pain may be alleviated, and range of motion may be increased,
and dynamic adaptability of the nervous system may be heightened, helping to patients to use
their bodies without resistance. When tension is applied to the nervous system during the
mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves, the cross section of the nerves decreases,
and therefore small blood vessels that cross the epineurium are obstructed, thereby
adjusting the amount of blood to the nerve fibers. This affects the axonal transport system,
and increased flexibility of the shortened nerves and surrounding joint structures leads to
increased muscle strength, as improved flexibility of the sciatic nerves decreases
mechanosensitivity of the nervous system, which in turn heightens compliance of the nerve
tissues<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on nerve mobilization techniques aimed at treating low back pain in patients with
radiating pain has been lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of
self-mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves on the quality of life of patients with
chronic low back pain in the lower limbs accompanied by radiating pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients with low back pain accompanied by radiating pain
who were between 30 and 50&#x02005;years of age and visited J oriental medicine hospital and S
hospital. Their pain indexes were three points or higher, Oswestry Disability indexes were
more than 20%, and straight leg raise test (SLR) results were between 30 and 70 degrees.
They also had no history of surgery in the vertebrae and lower limb joints and no
contracture or modification in the lower limb joints. Those who had a history of mental
disease, neurological problems other than radiating pain, problems with peripheral blood
vessels, and a pathological history of the cervical spine were excluded. Prior to the
experiment, a sufficient explanation on the experimental procedures was provided, and all
subjects provided written consent to participate in this study. This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University. The subjects were divided into two
groups: a group receiving lumbar segmental stabilization exercise training including sciatic
nerve mobilization techniques, which included 8 males and 7 females, and a group receiving
lumbar segmental stabilization exercise training, which included 8 males and 7 females.</p><p>In order to evaluate physical functions and health, the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)
was used to evaluate the subjects twice, once before the intervention and once six weeks
after the intervention. In the 2000s, the SF-36 was used as an inclusive measure of
disability including damage to physical function and structure, limitation of activities,
and restriction of participation in activities, and recently, it was expanded to use as a
measure of a diverse and subjective sense of satisfaction felt by patients.</p><p>Therefore, it was expanded to a complex and pluralistic concept of the quality of life, and
although there is no agreement on its concept, it is the most frequently used term to
express a subjective sense of satisfaction. At present, research on changes in quality of
life resulting from treatment and development of scales to evaluate quality of life in
relation to a diverse range of diseases is actively being pursued<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a contraction test for health, the SF-36 test of
physical and mental symptoms devised by Ware and Sherbourne was recently modified, and eight
items and 36 questions are employed in the new version<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the modified version of the SF-36, Physical functions, role limitation-physical, bodily
pain, and general perception of physical health are classified into physical health, and
social functioning, role limitation-emotion, mental health, and vitality are classified into
mental health. The higher the score is, the higher the health level is. The SF-36 has been
used in many clinical studies to evaluate treatment effects as a means of measuring the
quality of life related to health. In this study, the Korean version of the SF-36 translated
and used by Han, Lee, Iwaya, and Kataoka and Kohzuki was utilized<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The selected subjects were randomly and equally assigned to the group performing lumbar
segmental stabilization exercise including the sciatic nerve mobilization technique (n=15)
or the group performing lumbar segmental stabilization exercise (n=15). Treatment was
conducted three times per week for six weeks. Based on the fact that the lumbar region
segmental stabilization exercise used in this study was effective for coordinated
contraction of the multifidus and the transverse abdominis, the training was composed of one
exercise using a pressure biofeedback unit, two bridging exercises, and two exercises in a
quadrupled position<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the neural
mobilization technique for relaxation of the sciatic nerves was additionally applied using
the three-step methods used by Butler. The patients conducted the exercises by themselves
under the supervision of a therapist who was skilled in application of the treatment
techniques.</p><p>(1) Lumbar Segmental Stabilization Exercise. The patient flexed the hip and knee joints,
placed the pressure biofeedback unit under the lumbar vertebra, lied completely relaxed,
adjusted the pressure gauge to 20 mmHg, and induced coordinated contraction of the
multifidus and transverse abdominis. They increased the pressure to 30 mmHg, held it there
while continuing to breathe for 10 seconds, and then decreased the pressure to 20 mmHg and
rested for 10 seconds. The patient repeated this motion 20 times.</p><p>(2) Sensomotoric exercise 1. The patient got into a quadruped position in which they
maintained the neutrality of the lumbar region and induced coordinated contraction of the
multifidus and transverse abdominis. They then triggered retroversion of the pelvis and
slightly pushed on a ball.</p><p>(3) Bridge 1. The patient flexed the knee joint to 90 degrees and, in a prone position,
placed both hands on the abdomen, maintained a neutral position of the lumbar region, and
raised the pelvis from the floor.</p><p>(4) Sensomotoric exercise 2. The patient induced coordinated contraction of the multifidus
and transverse abdominis while maintaining neutrality of the lumbar region in a quadruped
position, triggered retroversion of the pelvis, and slightly raised both knees.</p><p>(5) Bridge 2. The patient completely flexed one knee and the hip joint and maintained them
toward the chest and held the other knee with both hands, lied in a supine position,
maintained neutral posture of the lumbar region, raised the pelvis from the floor with the
other hip and knee joints flexed at 90 degrees.</p><p>(6) Raising the opposite arm and leg in a quadruped posture. In a quadruped position, the
patient slowly raised the opposite arm and leg with the neutrality of the lumbar region
maintained. For exercise (2) to (6), the patient maintained respiration constant for six
seconds and then took a rest for 10 seconds. The patient repeated this motion 15 times.
These five exercises were repeated in a circular form for a total of three sets.</p><p>Mobilization techniques to relax the sciatic nerves were performed by the patient on
his/her own under the supervision of the therapist. The first step was for the patient to
extend the knee joint only to the range of pain. The second step was for the patient to
extend the knee joint to the range of no pain and to flex the top of the foot within the
range of no pain. The third step was for the patient to extend the knee joint to the range
of no pain and to flex the top of the foot within the range of no pain and flex the neck. As
the steps progressed, the tension of the sciatic nerves heightened, and the neck flexion in
the third step was used as a method to induce maximal tone of the nerves; all the steps were
applied to the lower limb with radiating pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis of all the data collected in this study was performed with PASW
Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0. For the subjects&#x02019; general characteristics, means and
standard deviations were calculated using descriptive statistics, and as normality tests,
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test were performed. According to the results
of the normality tests, physical functioning (PF) and general health (GH) were normally
distributed, and in order to analyze differences between the groups according to group
homogeneity and exercise, the independent t-test was used; differences in each group
according to period were analyzed with the paired t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects were shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSNMG (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LSEG (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.1&#x000b1;6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.6&#x000b1;11.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.6&#x000b1;7.6 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.0&#x000b1;7.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.6&#x000b1;7.6 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.5&#x000b1;7.3 </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SSNMG: self-mobilization of the sciatic nerve group; LSEG: lumbar stabilization

techniques for the sciatic nerves has positive effects on pain and physical and mental
activities in low back pain patients. The results showed was that physical health indicators
such as physical functioning, physical role restriction, general health, and physical and
mental health indicators such as physical role restriction, social functions, vitality, and
mental health were statistically significantly higher in the group to which mobilization
technique for the sciatic nerves were applied than in the classical lumbar segmental
stabilization group.</p><p>This is the result of pain transmission nerve fibers related to nerve tissue inflammation
and functional disability being relieved, adaptability of peripheral nerves being increased,
and nerve pressure, excessive friction, and tone being alleviated<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The increase in adaptability of peripheral nerves led to
a decrease in hypoxia by edema within the nerves<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and alleviation of scar tissues compression in the nervous tissues,
directly decreasing pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result
is consistent with the results of a study by Cleland et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> on chronic low back pain patients, in which the subjects were
divided into a lumbar spine mobilization and exercise group and a lumbar spine mobilization,
exercise, and slump stretching group and there were positive outcomes in numeric pain rating
scale (NPRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and centralization of symptoms. It is also
consistent with the results of a study by Kavlak &#x00026; Uyaur<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, who applied a nerve mobilization technique to carpal tunnel
syndrome patients and obtained positive outcomes in pain, range of motion, and a sensory
test.</p><p>In relation to lumbar intervertebral disk diseases, traditional lumbar stabilization
training has recently been performed with a main focus on promotion of muscular functions
and nerve root adjustment. The techniques to mobilize sciatic nerves have been used as a
method to verify dynamic sensitivity of the nerves and whether this is neuritis, and like
the study of Cleland et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, there have
been many studies that have applied indirect nerve system mobilization to chronic low back
pain patients without radiating pain in the lower limbs. However, a few studies have
indicated that nerve system mobilization techniques improve adaptability of the nerves and
dynamic adaptability and have positive effects that decrease pain and increase range of
motion and reported them as methods of treating low back pain. When low back pain continues
for longer than six months, it is classified as a disease with restriction of muscle
strength, endurance, flexibility, and range of motion and as one with neurological problems
that are secondarily expressed<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Universally degenerative changes in joints and muscles and musculoskeletal problems occur
with agoing, and Pinar et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> noted
that functional weakening and sciatic nerves pain in low back pain patients may become a
major factor triggering tension of the hamstrings and that the resulting decrease in
flexibility of the hamstrings may affect radiating pain. Therefore, this study utilized the
SLR as an evaluation index and made efforts to exclude to a maximal extent problems caused
by musculoskeletal degeneration. In addition, when mobilization techniques for the sciatic
nerves are applied, movement and extension of the hamstrings are triggered, relieving
stimulation of the sciatic nerves, reducing radiating pain in the waist and distal part of
the lower limbs, and having a positive effect that increases the flexibility and
adaptability of the sciatic nerves<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, classical treatment methods and spinal mobilization techniques are important in
therapy to decrease the mechanical stress caused by restriction of the range of motion of
the hip joint or sacroiliac joint due to an increase in tension of the hamstrings resulting
from stimulation of the sciatic nerves, but it is desirable to improve the causes through
direct neural mobilization<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves recommended as a therapeutic method for
patients with chronic low back pain accompanied by radiating pain reduce the burden on the
waist by increasing flexibility as a result of extension of the hamstrings and triggering
good results that reduce oversensitivity and stimulation of the sciatic nerves caused by
radiating pain in the lower limbs<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These techniques are therapeutically recommended for patients with low back pain accompanied
by radiating pain. However, diagnosis of whether radiating pain in the lower limbs is caused
by stimulation of the sciatic nerves is important among others, and the effects of radiating
pain on functional activity of the body, muscular activity, and physical balance should be
studied further.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was conducted to examine the effects of application of
mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves for six weeks on PF and GH in low back pain
patients. According to the study results, application of the traditional lumbar segmental
stabilization exercise with mobilization techniques for the sciatic nerves improved the
functions and health of the subjects. Application for the mobilization techniques of the
sciatic nerves may promote healing of the soft tissues by stimulating the functions of the
nervous system to improve nervous system adaptability and decrease sensitivity, helping to
alleviate symptoms. This method may be selectively recommended for patients with low back
pain accompanied by radiating pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fritz</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cleland</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Speckman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Physical therapy for acute low back pain: associations
