Exercise intolerance and fatigue are major negative contributors to quality of life in individuals with COPD, for whom the activities of daily living may embody a significant exercise challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacological inorganic nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) supplementation reduces the O<sub>2</sub> cost of and enhances high-intensity exercise tolerance in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a placebo-controlled study, dietary nitrate supplementation with beetroot juice (BR) reduced the O<sub>2</sub> cost of submaximal walking and running exercise tolerance in young healthy males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and improves submaximal exercise endurance in club level cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance in healthy individuals has demonstrated that there is a significant moderate beneficial effect upon exercise performance as measured by time to exhaustion (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79 (95% CI, 0.23-1.35)). These benefits were more often observed in inactive to recreationally active individuals, and are present in both acute supplementation as well as chronic supplementation at up to at least 15&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Dietary nitrate supplementation appears to exert its effect via augmentation of the oxygen-independent entero-salivary pathway in which dietary NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> is reduced to biologically active nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and nitrous oxide (NO), resulting in greater NO availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This pathway is conceptualized as a &#x02018;back-up&#x02019; to the oxygen-dependent classical L-arginine NO synthetase system, and is upregulated under acidemic or anaerobic conditions, situations conceivably more commonplace in individuals with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Resultant increased bioavailable NO may lead to enhanced vasodilation and/or O<sub>2</sub> distribution within skeletal muscle, possibly by increasing the driving pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in the microcirculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other proposed mechanisms include increased muscle contractile efficiency and increased mitochondrial efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>It has also been established that nitrate supplementation also lowers blood pressure, due to a vasodilatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This has safety implications for individuals with COPD who are often older, more frail and osteopenic and in whom a fracture may lead to life threatening complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The physiology of individuals with COPD greatly differs to healthy individuals, with a chronic inflammatory state resulting in disruption to pulmonary tissues, gas exchange abnormalities, cardiac dysfunction and skeletal muscle deconditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with COPD appear to have preserved baseline levels of nitrate and nitrite, but NO dynamics are altered, with differences in NO synthetase isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Three recent reports have reported the effects of acute and short term dietary nitrate supplementation on exercise endurance in individuals with COPD, with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We performed a randomized, double blind placebo control crossover trial in order to test the hypothesis that short term dietary nitrate supplementation (3&#x000a0;days of 4.8&#x000a0;mmol twice daily) would exert a beneficial effect on exercise tolerance as measured by submaximal walk test endurance in individuals with moderate severity, stable COPD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Institutional ethics review was sought and received from the Southern Health Human Research Ethics Committee (11335A, approval date 24/1/2012).

This involved timed, accelerating shuttle walking around cones 9&#x000a0;m apart, forming a 10&#x000a0;m course. Standardized procedures were adopted as mandated by the ISWT protocol: these included uniform instructions and coaching and a repeat test to account for a learning effect. The best distance was recorded and used to estimate &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2</sub>max and to calculate the walking speed representing 85% of maximal exercise performance for use in the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The ESWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is a constant paced standardized test of endurance capacity developed for use in patients with COPD. It has face and construct validity as the exercise testing regime suitable validated for use in patients with COPD as a measure reflective of the workload undertaken by an individual with COPD in the course of their daily activities. Participants performed the walk under controlled conditions by walking at a constant predetermined rate around cones 9&#x000a0;m apart (10&#x000a0;m shuttle walk) to a constant, timed audio recording until exhaustion. The ESWT permits measurement of walking time and distance at the speed that represents their estimated 85% &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2</sub>max; hence it is a measure of the individual&#x02019;s sub-maximal exercise endurance capacity.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that it is not necessary to perform repeat determination of either the ISWT or the ESWT in this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Initial ESWT and safety phase</title><p>During visit 2, which occurred approximately a week after visit 1, an initial ESWT was undertaken. Immediately after the ESWT, a Modified Borg Rating Scale for Perceived Dyspnea was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Following this, a safety phase was performed during which participants consumed, un-blinded, active BR and underwent measurement of sitting and standing blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry saturations at 0, 0.5, 1 and 4&#x000a0;hours post dose. The rationale for this was that BR has been previously demonstrated to decrease resting systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As pre-specified, if participants became symptomatic or had a &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;mmHg systolic blood pressure fall in response to the test dose, they were excluded from the remainder of the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Double blinded randomized placebo controlled phase</title><p>Participants were randomized to receive either (active) BR or PL first in a double blind fashion by computerized allocation performed by an independent clinical trials pharmacist.</p><p>For three days prior to visit 3, participants consumed their allocated dose of juice (70&#x000a0;mL) twice per day.

Eaton et al. (2006) reported that the baseline performance by moderate severity COPD patients on the ESWT was 313 meters, with a standard deviation of 193 meters, and the reported improvement in performance in response to exercise rehabilitation of 92% of baseline (302 meters). However, using the reported 92% improvement in ESWT performance in response to pulmonary rehabilitation as the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) results in an effect size of 1.6, leading to a sample size requirement of only 6&#x02013;7 patients in a cross-over study in order for the study to have an 80% power at the 5% significance level. A more conservative estimate of the MCID was used instead.

We observed a decrement in blood pressure in the active arm, suggestive of successful nitrate supplementation, however, quantitative determination of NO3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and/or NO2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> may have provided definite confirmation. Confirmation of return of NO3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and NO2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to baseline values after the four day washout period may also have been useful.</p><p>Our trial also suffered from a high attrition rate: from 35 subjects, only 19 completed the trial. This is significantly higher than in other trials of dietary nitrate supplementation in individuals with COPD, in which withdrawals were limited to a maximum of 1 per trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The attrition rate in our study is reflective of the burden of illness in individuals with COPD, with multiple drop-outs due to underlying illness or intercurrent illness. 10 of our patients withdrew due to medical illness (predominantly COPD exacerbations), and in the safety phase, one withdrew with symptomatic postural hypotension induced by BR, confirming the reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] effect of dietary nitrates on blood pressure. These withdrawals may reflect the tertiary nature of our center, with a high proportion of more unwell patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Comparisons</title><p>The dose and timing of nitrate used in our study differed to that used by other investigators who have examined its effect on exercise endurance in COPD. Kerley et al. and Berry et al., both of whom found positive effects, used acute doses of 12.9&#x000a0;mmol and 7.58&#x000a0;mmol respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, Shepherd et al. used 6.77&#x000a0;mmol twice a day for 2.5&#x000a0;days and found no difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We used 4.8&#x000a0;mmol twice a day for three days with a further dose on the morning of walk test and found no significant difference. Although a trial in healthy cyclists used a wash-in period and demonstrated benefit (three days 0.1&#x000a0;mmol nitrate/kg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it is possible that physiological alterations in aging, or in COPD render wash-in periods less useful, or alternatively, that the dose we used was too low.</p><p>The effect of increased adiposity has been proposed as a modifying factor in the response to dietary nitrate, by means that are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of our study population (29.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.5) was similar to that in Berry et al. (29.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5) who found similar an increase in exercise performance. Kerley et al. had a slightly lighter population and found an increase in exercise endurance with a BMI of 27.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4, whereas Shepherd et al., whose patients were heavier than ours, and found no difference with a BMI of 30.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.2. The influence of adiposity on nitrate supplementation&#x02019;s effect on exercise supplementation remains yet to be defined.</p><p>In healthy older individuals, short term dietary nitrate supplementation at 9.6&#x000a0;mmol/day reduced resting blood pressure but there was no effect on walk time, an effect broadly similar to our findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, although decreases in the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise have been relatively consistently found in younger individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise was not decreased in those healthy older individuals, for reasons that are unclear. Additionally, decreases in the oxygen cost of exercise were not found in the studies of nitrate supplementation of individuals with COPD, suggesting that if exercise endurance is increased in COPD, the mechanisms may be different to that in younger individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We found a heterogeneous response to dietary nitrate in our study population, consistent with Berry et al. who, despite an overall positive effect, found that two of their 11 participants had a decrease in exercise time. This variation in response was also noted by Kerley et al., and its mechanism remains unclear. It may therefore be that individuals with COPD differ in their response to dietary nitrate and that our study population may have been comprised of a greater proportion of non-responders.</p><p>Skeletal muscle in individuals with COPD may affected by myriad factors, which include deconditioning, hypoxia, hypercapnia, systemic inflammation, malnutrition, and drug therapy. Multiple abnormalities result, including redox imbalance, autophagy induction, mitochondrial dysfunction, a protein catabolic state with reduced anabolism and structural abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Intriguingly, it also appears that epigenetic modification may play a role in muscle phenotype and performance in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, exercise limitation may result from not only skeletal muscle factors, but also lung and haemodynamic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These complex, interwoven factors and their varying extents in any given individual with COPD may make prediction of response to dietary nitrate supplementation difficult, and furthermore may render it challenging to precisely identify a mechanism for exercise enhancement, if it exists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Study design</title><p>An important question arising from this study is whether the observed difference in endurance distance (11%) and time to fatigue (6%) is clinically important. A change in distance of 60-115&#x000a0;m has been reported as a minimally clinically important difference in the ESWT in the context of a pharmacological trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, the observed incremental improvement in ESWT was only 79&#x000a0;m whilst the standard deviation of the observed values for in the baseline ESWT was 583&#x000a0;m. These values represent a much reduced effect size of approximately 14% compared with our initial estimate of 55%. Were the sample size larger and the standard deviation reduced, the change in distance may have been clinically significant. An important question is therefore whether the study was under-powered.</p><p>Study sample size estimates prior to this study were based on estimates of effect sizes derived from the published evidence. A meta-analysis of the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance in healthy individuals has demonstrated that there is a significant moderate beneficial effect upon exercise performance as measured by time to exhaustion (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79 (95% CI, 0.23-1.35) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Estimates of the effect size derived from studies of the incremental effect of pulmonary rehabilitation program upon exercise distance and time in the endurance shuttle walk test ESWT yielded an effect size of 1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This was deemed to be a clinically important incremental improvement, and was therefore used as a guide for the choice of effect size for the power calculation for this study. We used the published ESWT data to inform us of the anticipated incremental improvement and the standard deviation for baseline performance.</p><p>The sample size we chose reflected favorably with the sample sizes chosen for recently reported studies of dietary nitrate supplementation in COPD, in which sample size ranged from 11&#x02013;15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our trial, with a final sample size of 19, did not demonstrate an effect of dietary nitrate supplementation in COPD, concordant with the results of Shepard et al. (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This contrasts with the results of Berry et al. and Kerley et al., who found a positive effect on exercise performance for dietary nitrate supplementation in COPD, and whose sample sizes were 15 and 11 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results do not support a role for the routine use of acute dietary nitrate supplementation in individuals with GOLD stage II COPD for the purposes of physical activity limitation. Whilst this trial, to our knowledge, is the largest trial of nitrate supplementation in individuals with COPD, other investigators have reported positive effects on exercise endurance for dietary nitrate supplementation in COPD. A consistent finding is decreased blood pressure, and with the development of symptomatic postural hypotension seen in one individual in our study, the role and risk-benefit ratio of acute dietary nitrate supplementation remains undefined. Overall, it is difficult draw a firm conclusion as to whether acute dietary supplementation for exercise endurance in COPD is effective given study heterogeneity (nitrate dose and form, study setting, exercise methodology).</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Future directions</title><p>Given the discordance between this study and other recently published literature, further studies should recruit larger patient cohorts, in order to minimize the effect of type II error and to examine an interaction between nitrate, medications and comorbidities. The identification of a dose&#x02013;response relationship for both exercise endurance and hypotension would be important if an effect for the former were to be confirmed and nitrate were to be extended to routine clinical use. Further pharmacodynamics studies could also establish whether tolerance develops. An important step would be to identify whether there are distinct phenotypes or subpopulations of COPD that can be classified into nitrate responders or non-responders, and in whom hypotension may be an issue.</p><p>An important study to perform in the future may be to examine for a potential interaction in effects on submaximal exercise endurance between a pulmonary rehabilitation program and dietary nitrate supplementation. Such a study will likely need to be a multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled study enrolling large numbers of subjects to be recruited given the likely drop out rate may approach 50%. The results of this study may help inform sample size estimates for such a study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12890_2015_57_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Safety phase data for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on standing (mmHg) (n=23 unless otherwise stated).</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BR</term><def><p>Beetroot juice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESWT</term><def><p>Endurance shuttle walk test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV1</term><def><p>Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p>Forced vital capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISWT</term><def><p>Incremental shuttle walk test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO</term><def><p>Nitrous oxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup></term><def><p>Nitrite</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup></term><def><p>Nitrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PL</term><def><p>Placebo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLCO</term><def><p>Transfer factor for carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x00056;&#x00307;O2max</term><def><p>Maximum oxygen uptake</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests, financial or non-financial.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>DC, PB, PF and AC conceived the study.
