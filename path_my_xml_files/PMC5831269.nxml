However, randomized controlled clinical trials are still needed for evaluation of this treatment as a standard option. This preliminary study was aimed to evaluate the effect of NFT on continuous attention (CA) and short-term memory (STM) of clients with moderate TBI using a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this preliminary RCT, seventeen eligible patients with moderate TBI were randomly allocated in two intervention and control groups. All the patients were evaluated for CA and STM using the visual continuous attention test and Wechsler memory scale-4th edition (WMS-IV) test, respectively, both at the time of inclusion to the project and four weeks later. The intervention group participated in 20 sessions of NFT through the first four weeks. Conversely, the control group participated in the same NF sessions from the fifth week to eighth week of the project.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eight subjects in the intervention group and five subjects in the control group completed the study. The mean and standard deviation of participants' age were (26.75&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15.16) years and (27.60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.17) years in experiment and control groups, respectively.

No significant improvement was observed in any variables of the visual continuous attention test and WMS-IV test between two groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our literature review, it seems that our study is the only study performed on the effect of NFT on TBI patients with control group. NFT has no effect on CA and STM in patients with moderate TBI. More RCTs with large sample sizes, more sessions of treatment, longer time of follow-up and different protocols are recommended.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>Brain injuries</kwd><kwd>Attention</kwd><kwd>Short-term memory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) means an injury to the brain that is caused by an external physical force. It is well known that TBI is an important cause of mortality and morbidity and it is reported that each year about 1.7 million people sustain a TBI in USA. Some of them die (about 50,000) and some other experience long-term disability (80,000 to 90,000).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The severity of TBI can be categorized based on the Glasgow comma scale (GCS) at the time of injury as follows: mild (13&#x02013;15), moderate (9&#x02013;12) and severe (&#x0003c;9).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> TBI usually affect the brain function such as cognitive status, executive function, memory, data processing, language skills and attention.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> It has heterogeneous aspects and based on the injury location and type. It can have different presentations. Hence it is considered as a difficult one to treat.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p id="p0015">The brain plasticity could help it in rehabilitation phase to restore its normal function after any trauma or disease. But the amount of this ability is poorly understood. Some studies approved that neurofeedback therapy (NFT) can promote neuroplasticity.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In the method of neurofeedback (NF), as a non-pharmacological intervention, the feedback to brain waves which are representative of subconscious neural activity can be observed by the client and then he/she will be able to control and change them.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There are some evidences that show NFT can be useful in some other diseases like Obsessive-compulsive disorder,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and also refractory epilepsy.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> There are also some published studies about the effect of NFT on patients with TBI. Surmeli in 2007 investigated the effect of NFT on 24 patients with mild TBI and reported that NFT can result in significant improvement in test of variables of attention, beck depression inventory and minnesota multiphasic personality inventory.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In a study in 2014, with evaluation of two patients with moderate head injury and without control group, it is reported that electroencephalogram biofeedback can lead to increase the cognitive scores and improve the concussion symptoms and finally concluded that NFT can be effective on the changes in the structural and functional connectivity among patients with moderate TBI.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p id="p0020">Although these published papers reported a positive effect of NFT on the TBI patients, we have not enough data about the standard treatment protocol with NF, and literature still needs more original studies like randomized controlled clinical trial to suggest NF as a treatment option among patients with TBI regarding the two following functions of cognitive status: short-term memory (STM) and continuous attention (CA).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p id="p0025">In this preliminary study, we tried to evaluate the effect of NFT on CA and STM of patients with moderate TBI using a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p id="p0030">All the subjects with the history of TBI were included in our RCT if they met following criteria: the patients' GCS should be nine through thirteen at the time of admitting in the emergency department; the patients' age should be between 15 and 60 years and there should be no history of co-morbid disease, psychiatric or mental disorders or substance abuse which shows patients' state of health. 22 patients with moderate TBI who were admitted at the two university hospitals of Sina or Shariati Hospitals (Tehran, IR Iran) were assessed for eligibility by the neurosurgeons participating in this project. Patients with trauma event more than six weeks and patients with Afghani nationality were excluded. Considering current Afghani immigrants' unstable situation in our country so that we were not sure that they could continue their participation in our prospective study, we excluded them. Seventeen patients enrolled randomly to intervention or control group. All patients were injured through traumatic events in Tehran City and had traumatic injury to their head with GCS between nine and thirteen. Due to lost to follow-up, finally eight subjects in intervention group and five in control group were analyzed. The clients paid nothing for NFT and some of the costs related to their transportation were paid.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Intervention</title><p id="p0035">The patients in the intervention group participated in 20 sessions of NFT through the first four weeks, five sessions in each week. Conversely, the patients in the control group participated in the same NF sessions from the fifth week to eighth week of the project. For considering ethical issues, we did not prevent patients from getting routine cares and medicines for traumatic injury and patients in both groups (experiment and control) were getting related medicine based on prescription of their physicians.</p><p id="p0040">The NFT was performed at the Atieh Clinical Neuroscience Center in Tehran, Iran. Subjects seated in front of a monitor with open eyes and performed the task determined by neurofeedback biograph software which was produced by Thought Technology Company. Our NFT protocols were beta and alpha coherence methods (two-channel). In coherence of beta band, electrodes were positioned on the left hemisphere, pre-frontal and temporal regions (FP1-T3) and the purpose of increasing beta waves was improving the concentration while keeping calm. In coherence of alpha band, electrodes were positioned on the central and occipital regions (Cz-Oz) and the purpose of increasing alpha waves was preparing feeling of relaxation for subjects while performing their alpha task. Each protocol was performed in 25&#x000a0;min and the total time for each session was 50&#x000a0;min. If a participant used any medicine prescribed by their physicians, we would not change them during study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>Wechsler memory scale-4th edition</title><p id="p0045">We used the Wechsler memory scale-4th edition (WMS-IV) for evaluation of short-term memory.

In contrast with our results, Reddy et&#x000a0;al in 2009 in a single case study evaluated the effect of 20 sessions of NFT on a patient with mild head injury. They compared neuropsychological profile of this patient pre- and post-NFT. Finally they showed that NFT was effective in improvement of both verbal and visual learning memory and suggested NFT as a method for rehabilitation of patients with TBI.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Furthermore NFT has been reported as a method for minimal to significant enhancement of several functional tasks in a brain tumor patient with simultaneous TBI.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Authors treated the patient with 40 sessions of NFT.

We think that the whole program including its hardware, software and human resources at the Atieh Clinical Neuroscience Center should be re-evaluated. Also our treatment protocol for neurofeedback and the number of its sessions which was detailed in the method section may need reconsideration for future studies. Moreover, since the effect of NFT can be observed after a relative long period of time (more follow-up of patients), other researchers had better observe the conditions of their patients for a long time.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0120">Our main limitation was about the sample size of this study.

However, we believe that for making an exact decision about use of NFT in TBI patients, more research projects with adequate sample sizes, longer time of treatment and follow-up and different protocols should be done.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0130">Dr. Reza Rostami, the head of the Atieh Clinical Neuroscience Center, had conflict of interest in
