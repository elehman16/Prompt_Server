It is a type of <italic>Vatavyadhi</italic> which mainly occurs in <italic>Vriddhavastha</italic> due to <italic>Dhatukshaya</italic>, which limits everyday activities such as walking, dressing, bathing etc. thus making patient disabled / handicapped. It being a <italic>Vatavyadhi</italic>, located in <italic>Marmasthisandhi</italic> and its occurrence in old age makes it <italic>Kashtasadhya. Vata Dosha</italic> plays main role in the disease. <italic>Shula Pradhana Vedana</italic> is the cardinal feature of the disease associated with <italic>Sandhishotha</italic> with <italic>Vata Purna Druti Sparsha</italic>, lack of movements of the joints or painful movement of the joints.

According to sex 59.18% were female patients, which indicates that <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> is more common in female and here the lack of female hormone (oestrogen) in the pre-menopausal period also plays an important role. Modern text also reflect the same type of prevalence, Osteoarthritis or Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD) may first appear without symptoms between 20 and 30 years of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. The symptoms, such as pain and inflammation, appear in middle age. Till the age of 55 it occurs equally in both sexes; after 55 the incidence is higher in women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>.</p><p>Among the female patients 40.81% were in menopausal state of life. Due to <italic>Dhatukshaya (Rasa Dhatu)</italic> aggravation of <italic>Vayu</italic> occurs that causes the <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>. In the menopausal condition the deficiency of female hormone leads to different bone and joints problem. While 87.75% pateints did not have regular exercise in their routine life. Lack of practice or exercise gradually leads to the weight gain which ultimately leads to <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>. In Prakrutiwise distribution shows that <italic>Vata-Kapha</italic> predominance was found in 55.10% of patients, due to <italic>Vaya</italic> of patients and also intake of the <italic>Vata Vardhaka Nidana</italic>.</p><p>Among the different <italic>Nidana</italic> of the disease <italic>Divaswapna</italic> was found in 65.30%. Day time sleeping increases <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Meda</italic> which leads to weight gain and <italic>Agnivaishamya</italic> which is a common risk factor for <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>. Among the other causative factors <italic>Ati Ruksha Ahara</italic> (51.02%), <italic>Ati Sheeta Ahara</italic> (40.81%), <italic>Ati Vyayama</italic> (38.77%), <italic>Ati Alpa Ahara</italic> (32.65%) also were found. These <italic>Nidana</italic> played an important role in aggravation of <italic>Vayu</italic> and thus causes <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic>.</p><p>In case of chronicity, 48.97% patients were found in chronic stage &#x00026; 85.71% were having gradual type of onset. This data also supported by literary data. While 85.71% were suffering from Osteoarthritis in cold season and in this season <italic>Vata</italic> usually aggravates and causes the disease. Maximum number of patients i.e. 93.88% had involvement of knee joint. Knee is one of the big weight bearing joints and thus mostly affected by Osteoarthritis. Involvement of other joint i.e. hip, ankle, shoulder were found 30.61%, 6.12% and 8.16% respectively.</p><p>Among the risk factors patients of female sex 57.14%, obesity 55.10%, psychological stress 28.57% was found prevalent. These are also supported by the literary data. Osteoarthritis mainly occurs on the weight bearing joints. Data shows 11 pound weight reduction, reduce 50% risk for Osteoarthritis. 5% weight loss in over weight patients gives 18% gain in overall function. So weight reduction is very important in case of osteoarthritis.</p><p>Among the Chief Complaints <italic>Sandhishula</italic> was found in all cases.

No significant change of S. Calcium was found before and after treatment. It shows that there is no direct role of S. Calcium in the etiology or in the prognosis of Osteoarthritis. S. calcium level was found elevated both before and after treatment in female patients of pre-menopausal or menopausal period. That may be due to the Osteoporotic changes of bones, due to lack of oestrogen hormone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Probable Mode of Action</title><p><italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> is <italic>Madhyama Roga Margagata Vatika</italic> disorders in which vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> gets lodged in <italic>Sandhi</italic>. Hence to treat <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> drugs acting on both <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Asthi</italic> should be selected. According to <italic>Charaka</italic>, in <italic>Asthi Dhatu Dushti</italic> the treatment should be given <italic>Tikta Dravya Ghrita</italic> and <italic>Kshira</italic>. In <italic>Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu</italic> predominance of <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> is there.</p><p><italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> has <italic>Vayu</italic> and <italic>Akasha Mahabhuta</italic> in dominance. Hence it has got affinity towards the body elements like Asthi having <italic>Vayu</italic> and <italic>Akasha Mahabhuta</italic> in dominance. Though, <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> aggravates <italic>Vayu</italic> which may enhance the pathogenic process of <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> but, the main principle of <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> treatment is &#x0201c;<italic>Sthanam Jayate Purvam</italic>&#x0201d;. The main site of <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> is <italic>Sandhi</italic> which is the site of <italic>Shleshaka Kapha</italic>. So, by decreasing the <italic>Kapha Dosha Tikta Rasa</italic> fulfils the principle.</p><p>Most of ingredients of <italic>Panchatikta Ghrita Guggulu</italic> have <italic>Tikta Rasa, Ushna Virya</italic> and <italic>Madhura</italic> and <italic>Katu Vipaka</italic>. The <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> increase the <italic>Dhatvagni</italic> (metabolic stage). As <italic>Dhatvagni</italic> increase, nutrition of all the <italic>Dhatus</italic> will be increased. As a result <italic>Asthi Dhatu, Majja Dhatu</italic> may get stable and <italic>Asthi Dhatu</italic> and <italic>Majja Dhatu Kshaya</italic> will be decreased.
