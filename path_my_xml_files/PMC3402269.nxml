Morphological and therapeutic intervention studies have uncovered an inflammatory process in islets of patients with type 2 diabetes characterized by the presence of cytokines, immune cells, &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis, amyloid deposits, and fibrosis. This is attributed to a pathological activation of the innate immune system by metabolic stress and is governed by interleukin (IL)-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above-described islet inflammation with a predominant role for IL-1&#x003b2;, we initiated clinical trials of IL-1 antagonism in type 2 diabetes. In a proof-of-concept study, the naturally occurring antagonist of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1Ra), was tested in a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). At 13 weeks of treatment, glycated hemoglobin was significantly improved as a result of enhanced &#x003b2;-cell secretory function. Of interest, some improvement promoted by IL-1&#x003b2; blockade lasted for at least 39 weeks following treatment withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). More recently, IL-1Ra also was shown to improve insulin secretion in prediabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This indicates the disease-modifying potential of this therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although the results obtained with IL-1Ra in patients with type 2 diabetes are encouraging, IL-1Ra has characteristics that make it unsuitable for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as its short half-life and injection-site reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It would have to be taken on a daily basis to maintain adequate suppression of IL-1&#x003b2;. Moreover, the amount of IL-1Ra required would make treatment an expensive option. Of importance, an anti&#x02013;IL-1 strategy that spares IL-1&#x003b1; may offer safety benefits. Therefore, specifically reducing IL-1&#x003b2; activity with longer-lasting agents would provide a therapeutic improvement in terms of sustained inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated islet-associated inflammation.</p><p>Gevokizumab is a recombinant human-engineered monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human IL-1&#x003b2; with a Kd of 0.3 pmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The predicted circulating half-life of the antibody was 22&#x02013;25 days. The Fc of gevokizumab is the IgG<sub>2</sub> isotype, which unlike IgG1 Fc does not activate the FcRIII on macrophages and other myeloid cells, thereby reducing the probability of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and diabetes- and inflammation-related parameters of gevokizumab in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This first-in-humans, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study was carried out concurrently in the U.S. and Switzerland. The U.S. arm of the study included 68 subjects (56 in the gevokizumab group and 12 in the placebo group) and took place between September 2007 and June 2009. The Swiss arm of the study included 30 subjects (25 in the gevokizumab group and 5 in the placebo group) and took place between November 2007 and July 2009. XOMA (U.S.), the manufacturer of gevokizumab, sponsored the study.</p><p>The eligibility criteria of both arms of the study were similar. Patients were requested to continue stable doses of baseline antidiabetes treatments (metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or insulin) and were asked not to change their diet and exercise habits during the study. Both arms of the study tested single intravenous doses of gevokizumab at the same five-dose levels (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg). In addition, there was a three-part study in the U.S. arm that tested a single intravenous dose of 3.0 mg/kg (part 1), a single subcutaneous dosing at three dose levels (part 2), and multiple subcutaneous dosing at two dose levels (part 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The follow-up of patients was 2 months in the U.S. arm and 3 months in the Swiss arm.

The safety assessments included evaluation of adverse events, clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis); infusion reactions; and immune responses to gevokizumab. The Swiss arm additionally included diabetic foot exams, thyroid physical exams, and ophthalmic exams, and the U.S. arm included assessments of forced expiratory volumes.</p><p>Secondary objectives comprised pharmacokinetics of gevokizumab, standard diabetic parameters (glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and C-peptide), and inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC counts, and ex vivo cytokine production from whole-blood cultures in response to inflammatory stimulants). In the Swiss arm, oral and intravenous stimulation tests of C-peptide release were included. A glucose stimulation test was performed at baseline and at 4 and 13 weeks to assess &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin production/reserve. Subjects ingested 75 g glucose and were sampled for plasma glucose and C-peptide measurements at &#x02013;10, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Immediately at the end of the oral glucose tolerance test, an intravenous injection of 0.3 g glucose/kg body wt, 0.5 mg glucagon, and 4.5 g arginine was administered. Blood then was sampled at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 min. The patients were asked to forgo their antidiabetes medication and fast for 8&#x02013;9 h prior to the test. Whole-body insulin sensitivity index was calculated as 10,000/square root of [fasting glucose (mmol/L) &#x000d7; fasting insulin (pmol/L) &#x000d7; (mean glucose {mmol/L} &#x000d7; mean insulin {pmol/L} during the oral glucose tolerance test)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Whole-blood cultures for ex vivo cytokine production</title><p>Heparinized blood was obtained before and on days 1, 7, and 28 after the administration of gevokizumab.

After last-patient last-visit, the tubes were thawed and assayed for total cytokines. Cytokines assayed were IL-1&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1;, interferon (IFN) &#x003b3;, IL-6, and IL-1Ra using electrochemiluminesence (BioVeris, Gaithersburg, MD).

The data then were analyzed by setting the cytokine concentration per million WBCs before the infusion of gevokizumab at 100% for each cytokine. For each time point (days 1, 7, and 28) following the infusion, the percentage change from the preinfusion level was calculated for each subject. The mean percent change (&#x000b1;SEM) for each cytokine and each dose group or placebo was then calculated for each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Safety and biological activity analyses included all subjects who received any amount of study drug (intent-to-treat analysis). No interim analyses were carried out in the study. Values are expressed as means &#x000b1; SEM. Because of the small sample size, as a result of the dose-escalation design of the study, patients with the single intravenous or subcutaneous injection of gevokizumab were combined to placebo/low-, intermediate-, and high-dose groups, as follows, in order to allow statistical testing. Patients with placebo and the extremely low dose of 0.01 mg/kg were combined as the placebo/low-dose group; patients with 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg as the intermediate-dose group; and patients with 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg as the high-dose group.

Of note, because the IL-1 receptor antagonist used in an earlier trial in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) blocks receptor binding and signaling in response to both IL-1&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2;, this is the first study to show that specific neutralization of IL-1&#x003b2; yields similar effects. If confirmed, this observation provides evidence that IL-1&#x003b2; antagonism alone may be sufficient to reduce &#x003b2;-cell failure, allowing for a therapy that spares the action of IL-1&#x003b1;, providing a safety advantage over IL-1 receptor blockade.</p><p>No evidence of safety or pharmacokinetic issues for gevokizumab was identified. The effects observed on glycemia, C-peptide secretion, and CRP support previous studies using IL-1Ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and are in line with more recent studies using other neutralizing antibodies to IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>We compared ex vivo cytokine production from cultured whole blood from patients treated with either gevokizumab or placebo and observed a consistent reduction in the total TNF&#x003b1; as well as IL-6 synthesized at all doses of gevokizumab. Although such a reduction was anticipated since IL-1&#x003b2; can induce TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6, the greatest reduction in IL-6, but not of TNF&#x003b1;, was observed 28 days after the infusion of gevokizumab, and IL-6 was not reduced at the dose of gevokizumab most potently reducing CRP, suggesting a reprogramming effect of 28 days of IL-1&#x003b2; inhibition in the myeloid compartment of the bone marrow independent of effects on systemic inflammation. However, the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra was unaffected by the same doses of gevokizumab that reduced CRP and glycated hemoglobin. Of importance, the production of IFN&#x003b3; induced by the combination of IL-12 plus IL-18 was unchanged in gevokizumab-treated patients (not shown), in accordance with other studies of gevokizumab measuring the production of IFN&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) as well as in mice deficient in IL-1&#x003b2;. IFN&#x003b3; is a key cytokine in protecting the host from opportunistic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In over 100,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anakinra, there are no reports of increased opportunistic infection, which is in sharp contrast to patients treated with TNF&#x003b1;-blocking therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These data suggest that the IFN&#x003b3;-sparing effects of blocking IL-1&#x003b2; is associated with an advantageous risk profile of gevokizumab and other IL-1 antagonists with regard to opportunistic infections.</p><p>The most beneficial and consistent effects on glycemia, C-peptide secretion, and inflammatory parameters appeared at intermediate doses of gevokizumab. Unexpectedly, with increasing doses, a U-shaped dose-response relationship was observed. Although no toxic effects were observed at the higher concentrations of the anti&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; antibody, a decrease in efficacy was apparent. Assuming that this preliminary observation is confirmed, one explanation may be the physiologic role of inflammation. Indeed, very low concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2; promote insulin secretion and &#x003b2;-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). At higher doses, the potency of gevokizumab in neutralizing endogenous IL-1&#x003b2; may deprive the &#x003b2;-cell of these physiologic levels of IL-1&#x003b2;. Likewise, excessive IL-1&#x003b2; plays a pathological role in many inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but low levels serve host defense, promote healing, and enhance growth factor production. Furthermore, IL-1&#x003b2; governs a large panel of cytokines and chemokines, some having beneficial effects under specific conditions: IL-1&#x003b2; causes recruitment of macrophages to islets, which, depending on the level of activation, may be beneficial or deleterious to the &#x003b2;-cell secretory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6, which also is regulated by IL-1&#x003b2;, promotes &#x003b2;-cell function via glucagon-like peptide-1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We conclude, therefore, that an appropriate dose and duration of gevokizumab treatment will be crucial in order to reshape the immune system in patients with type 2 diabetes. In particular, the very high affinity of gevokizumab with responses observable at concentrations as low as femtomolar concentrations offers obvious pharmacological advantages, such as dosage volume, but its use should be limited at high doses.</p><p>A growing number of animal studies have demonstrated a role for IL-1&#x003b2; in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In humans, studies hint at a role for IL-1&#x003b2; in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and a study in patients with prediabetes treated with anakinra pointed to improvement in insulin sensitivity; however, only in patients without injection site reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In the current study, a tendency toward such effects also was observed. Because of differences in level and type of inflammation, and blood flow between islets and insulin-sensitive tissues, other doses and duration of treatment may be necessary to uncover and make use of these effects. In addition, patients were not subjected to hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, which may have uncovered such effects.</p><p>The improvement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> could be attributed to enhanced insulin secretion or action. On the one hand, the improvement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> did not show a clear correlation with the increase of C-peptide secretion. On the other hand, the improvement in insulin sensitivity failed to reach statistical significance. However, the small sample size of our study does not allow for a definitive conclusion on the underlying mechanism of improvement of glycemic parameters.</p><p>Levels of CRP were consistently decreased by gevokizumab in the current study and consistent with other IL-1 blocking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A reduction in CRP often is interpreted as beneficial and associated with less cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, a large phase 3 study using an anti&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; antibody in 17,000 patients recently has been launched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This should allow uncovering the full potential of IL-1&#x003b2; antagonism in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p></sec>
