static and dynamic balance in chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Nineteen
individuals with unilateral chronic hemiparetic stroke (age, 64.7 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;years; height,
161.7 &#x000b1; 7.9&#x02005;cm; weight, 67.0 &#x000b1; 11.1&#x02005;kg) were randomly allocated to either a Pilates
exercise group (PG, n=10) or a control group (CG, n=9). The PG attended 24 exercise
sessions conducted over an 8-week period (3 sessions/week). Center of pressure (COP) sway
and COP velocity were measured one week before and after the exercise program and compared
to assess training effects. [Results] Pilates exercise positively affected both static and
dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke. For static balance, COP sway and velocity
in the medial-lateral (M-L) and anterior-posterior (A-P) directions were significantly
decreased in the PG after training while no significant differences were found in the CG.
For dynamic balance, measured during treadmill walking, the PG showed significantly
reduced COP sway and velocity in the M-L and A-P directions for both the paretic and
non-paretic leg. [Conclusions] The findings provide initial evidence that Pilates exercise
can enhance static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Exercise training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a cerebrovascular event in which the supply of blood delivered to the brain is
significantly altered<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The resulting deficits or
impairments following stroke vary according to the location and extent of the lesion, but
often include hemiparesis, communication disorders, and cognitive deficits<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In isolation or combined, these deficits
often lead to significant difficulty completing activities of daily living. Even after
extensive rehabilitation, up to 50% of stroke survivors experience lingering motor
deficits<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the majority of stroke patients are able to walk
independently, most do not reach a walking level that enables them to perform all of their
daily activities. Impaired walking function, including reduced gait stability and asymmetric
walking, is a common neurological deficit following stroke<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, Laufer et al. reported that the nonparetic lower limb
assumes 61&#x02013;80% of the full body weight during normal walking in patients with
hemiparesis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asymmetric walking caused
by hemiparalysis can become a cause of instability during daily activities, and these
patients have a higher rate of falls than elderly individuals in the general population<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, gait recovery is a major objective of
rehabilitation programs for patients with stroke.</p><p>Recent studies about hemiplegia include multifaceted explorations of gait and balance
problems. Studies have focused especially on the musculoskeletal effects of stroke, such as
strength and muscle density, which are implicated in gait and balance problems<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diminished muscle activity has been identified as a factor contributing to balance
impairment in patients with hemiplegia, and as such, treatment to increase muscle activity
has been attempted as a method to improve balance capacity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk muscles are activated during the rhythmic movement that is part of the execution of
gait. Core strengthening exercises are used to specifically strengthen the trunk muscles and
have become a specialty area in the field of rehabilitation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, in the United States and Europe, Pilates has become a target of interest as a
useful exercise. Pilates exercises were developed by Joseph H. Pilates (1880&#x02013;1967) as an
exercise method to relax and strengthen the body. The exercises have a scientific, rational
system for adjusting the center of the body<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pilates training is based on 8 principles: control, breathing, flowing movement, precision,
centering, stability, range of motion, and opposition. Mat-based Pilates exercises have been
developed that use equipment for those who cannot exercise more vigorously due to injury or
poor health.</p><p>As strength-based exercises are directly connected to health, they can be an effective
method to improve balance ability and can also be used to correct postural deviations for a
flexible and balanced body<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A recent study on balance and Pilates demonstrated that Pilates can be effective for
enhancing both static and dynamic equilibrium capacity in university students in a 16-week
mat exercise course<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study,
by Changgiun<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance ability was again
improved through a Pilates exercise program.</p><p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that Pilates exercise training could be an
effective post-stroke rehabilitation method to address impairments frequently encountered by
patients with stroke, such as flexibility, somatosensory loss, muscular strength, and
balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, most of the studies on Pilates training programs have focused on orthopedic
remedial exercise<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> or balance improvement in
the elderly<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rydeard et al. reported
that patients with low back pain described a lower level of functional disability after 4
weeks of Pilates intervention<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bird et
al. reported that a 5-week Pilates training course for the elderly contributed to greater
benefits in static and dynamic balance compared to usual activity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fewer studies have investigated the effects of Pilates in
patients with neurologic conditions. Of these, the majority have focused on patients with
multiple sclerosis<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and no studies have been
conducted on the rehabilitation of patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week mat-based
Pilates exercise training program on the static and dynamic balance abilities of patients
with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty participants were initially recruited from the Rehabilitation Center for the
Disabled located in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province, Korea. The inclusion criteria stated that
each participant must be at least 2&#x02005;years post stroke, medically stable with a physician
release granting approval to initiate and complete an exercise program, able to walk
independently without an assistive device, and willing to participate in a Pilates exercise
class. Participants were excluded if they had visual impairment, hearing damage,
uncontrolled high blood pressure, or were unable to understand the nature of the experiment.
Participants who were receiving physical therapy separately were also excluded from this
study.</p><p>In total, 10 participants were excluded because they were participating in individual
physical therapy sessions, and one participant dropped out of the control group due to
hospital admission during the intervention period. Finally, nineteen individuals with
chronic hemiparetic stroke participated in the study (age, 64.7 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;years; height, 161.7 &#x000b1;
7.9; and weight, 67.0 &#x000b1; 11.1). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant
after explaining the study. The research protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>Following participant selection, they were randomized into two groups, a Pilates exercise
training group (PG) and a control group (CG). During the intervention period, the PG was
given Pilates exercise training, while the CG was not given any exercises or treatment at
the Center for the Disabled.</p><p>The Pilates training program was based on mat classes lasting one hour per class, three
times a week for 8 weeks. In this study, two certified Pilates instructors and one physical
therapist were in charge of the class. One instructor demonstrated movements for patients to
follow and the other instructor and the physical therapist assisted patients with the
exercise. All movements included in the Pilates training was based on 8 1 set of 8
repetitions per exercise. To improve core stability, breathing exercises were conducted in a
sitting position before and after all training sessions. The mat based Pilates training was
composed of spine mobility exercises, upper limb exercises, and lower limb strengthening
exercises. The exercises were composed of the following detailed movements: 1) Spine
mobility- chin up and down, forward spine stretch, and side spine stretch in sitting with
theraband; 2) Upper limb exercise- draw a sword, and deltoid lift in sitting with theraband;
and 3) Lower limb strengthening exercise- top leg pulse-down and bottom leg pulse-up in
sidelying using the magic circle, and foot and ankle strengthening in sitting with
theraband. Unlike general Pilates training, lower limb strengthening exercises help to
strengthen the quadriceps, gluteus medius, adductor magnus, gastrocnemius, and anterior
tibialis. Additionally, for gluteal activation, a gluteal series including Charlie Chaplin
exercises, swimming, and a heel squeeze in prone with a ball under the chest were performed,
along with a prone bridge.</p><p>To verify the effects of the 8-week Pilates training course on the static and dynamic
balance of patients with chronic stroke, two data collection protocols were conducted one
week before and after the training. The variables assessed were center of pressure (COP)
sway and velocity.</p><p>To measure static balance, participants wore familiar shoes, and were asked to stand on an
instrumented treadmill (FIT, Bertec Corp., USA)with their eyes open and arms at their sides
comfortably for 30 seconds. Each foot was placed on a separate force plate located under the
treadmill belts and foot position was measured and maintained for each evaluation.</p><p>To measure dynamic balance, participants were asked to walk on the instrumented treadmill
at their self-selected velocity. The over-ground self-selected velocity was determined for
each participant beforehand and the treadmill belt speed was set to match that velocity
during the evaluation. When it was determined that subjects were exhibiting natural walking
movements (after about 3&#x02013;5 seconds), data for 5 consecutive strides were collected.</p><p>A total of 5 static and dynamic trials were conducted for each subject, and average values
from the trials were used for data analysis. Original COP data were collected at 1,000&#x02005;Hz,
and anterior-posterior (A-P) and medial-lateral (M-L) directional COP sway, as well as
velocity with time series, were computed and evaluated.</p><p>Independent samples t-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis were used for homogeneity testing.
The 8-week Pilates training effects were assessed using a paired t-test, and an independent
samples t-test was conducted to compare the differences in subordinate variables between the
groups. The level of significance for all comparisons was set as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in general characteristics were noted between the groups

patients with chronic stroke. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first to show
improvements in static and dynamic balance following Pilates training in this population.
One of the important purposes of this study was to determine whether training that had been
performed for balance improvement in the elderly could be effectively applied to patients
with chronic stroke<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the PG demonstrated 26% and 34% improvement in static balance in the A-P and
M-L directions, respectively (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>,
p&#x0003c;0.05). The results of this study support the findings of studies conducted on the
effects of Pilates training in the elderly. In a study by Newell et al., an 8-week Pilates
training course contributed to a 40% improvement in A-P COP sway in the elderly<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, Bird et al. reported that a
5-week Pilates training course led to a 16&#x02013;22% improvement in M-L COP sway (p&#x0003c;0.001)
during challenging balance tasks<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
our study, the improvement in static balance was attributed to the 8-week Pilates training
course that improved muscle control of the deeper abdominal muscles (i.e., transversus
abdominis, lumbar multifidus, and the respiratory and pelvic diaphragms). Conversely, Bird
et al. found no significant training effects on balance performance while standing on a firm
surface<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason our results
differ may be due to the difference in training period and frequency. In the present study,
stroke survivors were trained for 3 times/week for 8 weeks, while patients in the study by
Bird et al. were trained 2 times/week for 5 weeks<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that there may be a dose response effect that should
be verified in future studies.</p><p>In this study, the PG demonstrated significant improvements (15&#x02013;22%) in dynamic stability
in the A-P and M-L directions for both the paretic and nonparetic foot after training (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">
4</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.05). The results of this study are similar to other intervention studies.
Sator et al. reported that polyneuropathy patients demonstrated a 20% reduction in COP
velocity of the midfoot during walking after a 12-week ankle strengthening program
(p&#x0003c;0.05)<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lim and Yoon revealed
that the elderly exhibited a 32% decrease in COP sway during obstacle walking as a result of
a 12-week underwater training program (p&#x0003c;0.05)<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that in dynamic situations (i.e., walking),
COP velocity is directly related to center of mass (COM) acceleration, which represents
human movement along with COP sway, and that the reduction of COP variables represents
increased balance during walking<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Unlike general Pilates training, lower limb strengthening exercises were added to our
Pilates program. This could help patients increase muscles force production and subsequently
improve their dynamic balance. Given that COP variables in the M-L direction are closely
related to the risk of falls<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, the improvement of COP variables in this direction
increases the expectation that Pilates training may have an influence on the reduction of
fall risk in patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study using Pilates training as an intervention to
improve static and dynamic balance in patients with chronic stroke. Despite the documented
effects on balance, Pilates training has not yet been applied to the rehabilitation of
patients with chronic stroke. However, as a result of this study, the 8-week Pilates
training program has been proven fully effective for the treatment of static and dynamic
balance in patients with chronic stroke.</p><p>However, in using this intervention for the rehabilitation of patients with chronic stroke,
careful attention will be needed on several points. First, unlike general muscular strength
training or aerobic exercises, maintaining the correct posture is very important in Pilates
training, and it should only be carried out by qualified instructors supervising a small
number of participants per session. In this study, the number of participants in a class was
restricted to 8<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the same class was
offered 6 times a week so that patients would not be inconvenienced by attending classes 3
days a week. Second, given the previous finding that a 5-week Pilates training program for
the elderly did not influence balance on firm surfaces<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, a minimum of 8-weeks is suggested as a suitable training
period.</p><p>As Pilates training for patients with chronic stroke has not been reported, this study
could only be compared to studies of Pilates training for the elderly. Moreover, this study
did not include other variables (e.g., gait parameters or EMG activity) that may be used to
assess static and dynamic balance improvements after Pilates training. Therefore, follow-up
studies should be performed to investigate the impact of Pilates training on gait parameters
or lower limb EMG activity related to balance measures.</p><p>This study proved that an 8-week Pilates training program improved the static and dynamic
balance of patients with chronic stroke. If Pilates training that strengthens the deeper
abdominal muscles is sustained for this duration, than these results can be obtained.
Therefore, if these training parameters are used in the clinic when it becomes appropriate
for the patient, a Pilates program can be an effective treatment for the recovery of walking
ability, which is the highest objective of rehabilitation for patients with chronic stroke.
Given these results, Pilates training should be considered as a rehabilitation intervention
for balance improvement in patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park </surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee </surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The Influence of age, lesion side and location on
