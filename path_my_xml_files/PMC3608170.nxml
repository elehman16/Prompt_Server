Pain at injection site was the most common grade 3 solicited symptom, which was reported following 6.5% and 1.0% of overall doses in the PHiD-CV and Control groups, respectively. Within 4 days post-vaccination, the most common solicited local and general symptoms reported with any intensity were pain (48.9% and 31.0% of doses in the PHiD-CV and Control groups) and irritability (58.0% and 40.4% of doses in the PHiD-CV and Control groups). Within 31 days post-vaccination, the incidence of unsolicited symptoms was comparable in both groups (following 12.3% and 14.8% of doses in the PHiD-CV and Control groups, respectively). Throughout the study, 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 9 infants in the PHiD-CV group and 11 SAEs in 6 infants in the Control group.

In Vietnam, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was estimated to be at least 48.7 cases per 100,000 children younger than 5 years of age in a previous study conducted in Khanh Hoa Province in 2005&#x02013;2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most common pneumococcal serotypes detected in children younger than 5 years of age in Hanoi between 1997 and 1999 were serotypes 23F, 19F, 6B, and 14 (ordered according to frequency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In a prospective study conducted in 2008&#x02013;2009, similar serotype distributions have been observed in Vietnamese patients from all age groups, in whom the major pneumococcal serotypes were 19F, 23F, 14, 11, and 6B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In Vietnam, high and increasing rates of antibiotic resistance among pneumococcal isolates have been observed, which may potentially be explained by the frequent and inappropriate use of antibiotics in that country and by the spread of multi-resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although routine vaccination of infants and toddlers with effective pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has been shown to be the best strategy to prevent invasive diseases caused by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> in children younger than 5 years of age, there is no pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently available in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) protein D conjugate vaccine (<italic>Synflorix</italic>&#x02122;, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium; hereafter referred as PHiD-CV), which offers protection against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, has been licensed in more than 110 countries across the world since 2008. Previous clinical trials conducted in various countries have shown that PHiD-CV co-administered with routinely used childhood vaccines in infants or young children was immunogenic and had a clinically acceptable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In Vietnam, the safety and reactogenicity profile of a new vaccine needs to be evaluated in the local target population before the vaccine can be registered in the country.

Eligible participants were healthy infants aged between and including 6&#x02013;12 weeks (42&#x02013;90 days) at the time of the first vaccination. Infants were excluded from participation if they had received previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib and/or <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Written and signed informed consent was obtained before enrolment from the parents or legally acceptable representatives (LARs) of the infants. After the parents or LARs granted informed consent, a study physician assessed the eligibility of the infants by obtaining information on their medical history and performing physical examinations. A transportation allowance was provided to participants for the fourth visit, and no other financial compensation was provided. The study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol and associated documents were reviewed and approved by national and local ethics committees (Institutional Review Boards of Nhi Dong 2 Hospital and Pasteur Institute, Service of Health and People&#x02019;s Committee, Ho Chi Minh City, and Independent Ethics Committee of the Vietnamese Ministry of Health).

Infants in the PHiD-CV group received 2 injections at each vaccination visit while those in the Control group had only 1 injection per visit. The intervals between consecutive doses were to range from 28 to 42 days. Treatment allocation was performed at the investigator site using a central internet randomisation system. A randomisation blocking scheme (block size of 3) was used to ensure a balanced distribution of the infants in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Reactogenicity and safety assessment</title><p>Local (pain, redness, and swelling at injection site) and general (drowsiness, fever, irritability, and loss of appetite) symptoms were actively solicited and recorded during a 4-day period after each vaccination using diary cards that were completed by the infants&#x02019; parents or LARs. Unsolicited AEs were recorded during a period of 31 days after each vaccination. The intensity of each solicited symptom was graded on a scale from 1 to 3. Grade 3 symptoms were defined as follows: pain at the injection site if the limb was spontaneously painful or if the infant cried when it was moved, redness and swelling at the injection site if the diameter was &#x0003e;30 mm, fever if axillary temperature was &#x0003e;39.5&#x000b0;C, loss of appetite if the infant did not eat at all, and irritability if the infant cried and could not be comforted or if it prevented normal activity. All other AEs were considered of grade 3 intensity if they prevented normal activity. The prevalence of concomitant antipyretic (prophylactic or therapeutic) medication during the 4-day post-vaccination period was also recorded. SAEs were recorded throughout the entire study. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, or resulted in disability or incapacity. All solicited local reactions were considered causally related to vaccination as defined in the protocol. Using their clinical judgment, the investigators assessed the causality of all other AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The safety and reactogenicity analyses were performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all infants with at least one vaccine dose administration. In this study, 300 infants were planned to be enrolled (200 in the PHiD-CV group and 100 in the Control group). Incidences of solicited local and general symptoms during the 4-day post-vaccination period and unsolicited AEs during the 31-day post-vaccination period were calculated with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) after each vaccine dose and overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity, and relationship to vaccination. The overall incidence of AEs was calculated as the proportion of vaccine doses followed by at least one type of symptom. The prevalence of concomitant antipyretic medication during the 4-day post-vaccination period was also computed with exact 95% CI. SAEs and withdrawals due to SAEs were described in detail. This study was a descriptive study and although non-overlapping 95% CIs might indicate potential differences between study groups, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution considering that there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons of the various endpoints. The statistical analyses were performed using the SDD (i.e. Statistical Analysis System [SAS] Drug and Development) web portal version 3.5 and SAS version 9.2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Between February 2011 and April 2011, 300 infants were enrolled in this study; 199 in the PHiD-CV group and 101 in the Control group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of these, 199 infants in the PHiD-CV group and 99 infants in the Control group received at least one vaccine dose and were included in the TVC.

In the present study, the reactogenicity and safety profile of PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in Vietnamese infants seemed in line with that observed in previous studies, in which PHiD-CV was co-administered with routine childhood vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Within the 31-day post-vaccination period, 8.2% of overall doses were followed by at least one grade 3 symptom (solicited and/or unsolicited, local and/or general) in the infants who received PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, while this was 3.0% of overall doses in the infants who received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib alone. This difference was mainly due to the higher proportion of doses followed by grade 3 pain during the 4-day post-vaccination period in the infants who received both vaccines co-administered compared with those who received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib alone (6.5% [95% CI: 4.7, 8.8] versus 1.0% [95% CI: 0.2, 2.9] of overall doses). This difference in incidence of pain was not unexpected and could be explained by the fact that the infants of the PHiD-CV group had 2 injections at each vaccination visit while those in the Control group had only 1 injection per visit. The most frequently reported grade 3 solicited general symptom in the infants who received PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib was irritability, which was reported following 1.9% (95% CI: 0.9, 3.4) of doses. The use of antipyretic medication was low in both groups and grade 3 fever was only reported in one infant vaccinated with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib alone.</p><p>The incidence and nature of the grade 3 solicited symptoms reported in this study were in line with those reported in a previous study assessing the co-administration of PHiD-CV and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in Taiwanese infant. In that study, the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited local and general symptoms were pain (following 4.2% of doses [95% CI: 2.8, 6.0]) and irritability (following 6.3% of doses [95% CI: 4.6, 8.4]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In another study, in which PHiD-CV was co-administered with a monovalent vaccine against Hib in Korean infants, grade 3 solicited symptoms were reported following no more than 2.6% of doses, which seems slightly lower than the reporting rates observed in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. When compared to co-administration of PHiD-CV and DTPa-based or Hib vaccines, the incidence of grade 3 symptoms seemed higher when PHiD-CV was co-administered with whole cell pertussis-based combination vaccines, as observed in 2 Asian studies, in which the incidence of grade 3 pain reached 9.4% (95% CI: 6.4, 13.3) and 27.7% (95% CI: 24.4, 31.1) of doses and grade 3 irritability, 2.9% (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 8.3% (95% CI: 6.4, 10.6) of doses in infants in the Philippines and India, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This observation was expected since whole cell pertussis-based vaccines are known to induce more adverse events than DTPa-based vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom with any intensity, which was reported following 48.9% (95% CI: 44.8, 53.0) of PHiD-CV doses co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib. In contrast, redness was the most common solicited local symptom in previous Asian studies conducted in Taiwan and Korea, in which PHiD-CV was also co-administered with DTPa-based vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the previous studies conducted in India and the Philippines, pain was also the most common solicited local symptom following co-administration of PHiD-CV and whole cell pertussis-based vaccines (following 71.0% of doses [95% CI: 67.6, 74.4] and 67.2% of doses [95% CI: 64.0, 70.3]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The incidence of solicited local symptoms was comparable at both injections sites in the infants who received PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, but solicited local and general symptoms seemed more frequently reported in infants who received PHiD-CV in addition to DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib than in those who received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib alone.</p><p>The percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event within the 31-day post-vaccination period was comparable in both groups and the incidences of grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were low. Unsolicited symptoms causally related to vaccination were only reported in one child in each group. Throughout the study, 15 infants (9/199 infants in the PHiD-CV group and 6/99 infants in the Control group) reported at least one SAE. None of these SAEs were fatal or considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.</p><p>This study had a very high compliance rate since 97.0% of the infants who received PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and all the infants vaccinated with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib alone received the 3 vaccine doses. However, potential limitation of the study included its non-blinded (open) design, due to the different number of injections in both groups. The open design might have induced a bias in the reactogenicity and safety profile towards increased reporting of AEs in infants in the PHiD-CV group since their parents or LARs and the investigators were aware that they had received a new vaccine in addition to the antigens received by the infants in the Control group. Another limitation of this study was the fact that there were no confirmatory analyses with regards to the reactogenicity and safety objectives. Due to above mentioned limitations, the study results should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that 3-dose primary vaccination with PHiD-CV co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib at 2, 3, and 4 months of age had a clinically acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile in Vietnamese infants, which was in line with that observed in other South-East Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
