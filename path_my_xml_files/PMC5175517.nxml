There are different views of surgeons in terms of the initial period of rehabilitation after surgery [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Seventy percent of surgeons prefer to mobilise their patients out of bed on the very first day after surgery, 20% on day 2 and 10% leave it until the patient feels able [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, recent reviews on rehabilitation following lumbar disc surgery concluded that there was insufficient evidence that rehabilitation, in general, could lead to a faster decrease in pain and disability. The physiotherapy interventions still remain unclear [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the lack of evidence, we consider that early physical therapy contributes to a better recovery of the patient and leads to a faster return to normal functional status. All our patients were mobilised as early as possible, according to surgeons&#x02019; instructions. They took a sitting position immediately on the first day after intervention. Michael R, (2005) describes that on the day after surgery, the patient demonstrated an expected amount of post-operative stiffness, range of motion (ROM) limitations and functional deficits [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the first thing we demonstrated and explained to the patient was: how to perform movements in bed as in pivoting, not twisting the spine in all transfers and bed mobility. Physical therapy is focused on functional mobility (getting in and out of bed, transfers, and walking). We consider that this contributes to a better recovery of the patients and leads to a faster return to a normal functional state.</p><p>In the last few years, the mean hospital stay has reduced from 6.6 days to 2.6 days (2011&#x02013;2012), which means that the time for training the patients to perform proper ADLs is limited [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since hospitalisation is just a few days, the patients performed the rehabilitation program at home. In our case, the mean hospital stay was 3.8 days. During this period, patients improved their transfer abilities and walking speed, but not sufficient to restore the possibility of normal functional mobility. At discharge, a significant difference between the two groups only in transfers in bed was achieved, probably due to the short time of hospitalisation. Our research shows that for a better recovery of functional mobility after spinal surgery, patients need at least one month.</p><p>The importance of written patient education as an integral component of postoperative rehabilitation is increasing [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This indicates the need for developing a program for home practice and self-performing exercises. Our opinion is that a written educational booklet contributed in the restoration of physical activity. The same opinion is shared by other researchers [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>There are many pieces of evidence for the effectiveness of outpatient physiotherapy post first lumbar discectomy [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. No particular methodology for rehabilitation has proven to be the best yet. Engers A. et al., (2008) compared different types of individual education and did not find significant differences [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is a wide variation in physical therapy practice with respect to proper post-operative management. A home exercise program &#x0201c;HEP&#x0201d; was given by Michael R, (2005) [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Leaflets with information about the behaviour after spinal surgery such as &#x0201c;Get Well Soon&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and &#x0201c;Your Back Operation&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] are available on the Internet. McGregor A. et al (2012), considers that the booklet was welcomed by patients and they valued the information [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our &#x0201c;Instructions To Patients After Discharge From Hospital&#x0201d;, we have also tried to give the most important trends in the performance of ADLs in a way that is safe for the back and does not cause complications after surgery. Restrictions on lifting, sitting and driving showed considerable inconsistencies within the recommendations given by surgeons [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In his study, Danielsen J. et al. (2005) proved that the postoperative disability is reduced at least in the first six months. He recommended intensive, standardised exercise training that ignores the fear of provoking pain and begins four weeks after the surgery [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We started training in proper motion and performance of ADLs immediately after surgery. Also, we gave written explanations of the requirements of performance of ADLs, and added to the description, pictures for easy understanding. Thus, patients gained confidence and self-esteem in their movements even before the discharge from the hospital. Care after discharge shows greater variability. Proper implementation of the ADLs and avoiding bending and rotation, lead to faster recovery and increase the independence in daily living [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The monitored basic activities (TUG test) demonstrate that until the day of discharge from the hospital, patients still have limited abilities in functional mobility, which were normalised on the first month after surgery. TUG was used in the study of Michael R, (2005) and results showed significant improvements. He discussed that TUG is appropriate for monitoring the recovery in patients after spinal surgery [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the survey revealed that early rehabilitation programs consisting of therapeutic exercises and written educational booklet after low back surgery improved transfer abilities and basic activities in one month.</p><p>Further investigations should be made to assure the number of baseline variables which may influence the effectiveness of a physical therapy program and written instructions on functional mobility.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research did not receive any financial support.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mannion</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Denzler</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dvorak</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Grob</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A randomised controlled trial of post-operative rehabilitation after surgical decompression of the lumbar spine</article-title><source>European Spine Journal</source><year>2007</year><volume>16</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>1101</fpage><lpage>1117</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-007-0399-6">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-007-0399-6</uri></comment><comment>PMid: 17593405</comment><comment>PMCid: PMC2200780</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17593405</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deyo</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low back pain</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>344</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>2001</fpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200102013440508">https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200102013440508</uri></comment><comment>PMid: 11172169</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Podsiadlo</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Time &#x0201c;Up &#x00026;
