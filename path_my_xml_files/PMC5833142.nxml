However, there is increasing scientific interest and research into non-operative treatment of appendicitis in adults and children. While a number of studies have investigated non-operative treatment of appendicitis in adults, this research cannot be applied to the paediatric population. Ultimately, we aim to perform a UK-based multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of non-operative treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children, as compared with appendicectomy. First, we will undertake a feasibility study to assess the feasibility of performing such a trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study involves a feasibility RCT with a nested qualitative research to optimise recruitment as well as a health economic substudy. Children (aged 4&#x02013;15 years inclusive) diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis that would normally be treated with an appendicectomy are eligible for the RCT. Exclusion criteria include clinical/radiological suspicion of perforated appendicitis, appendix mass or previous non-operative treatment of appendicitis. Participants will be randomised into one of two arms. Participants in the intervention arm are treated with antibiotics and regular clinical assessment to ensure clinical improvement. Participants in the control arm will receive appendicectomy. Randomisation will be minimised by age, sex, duration of symptoms and centre. Children and families who are approached for the RCT will be invited to participate in the embedded qualitative substudy, which includes recording of recruitment consultants and subsequent interviews with participants and non-participants and their families and recruiters. Analyses of these will inform interventions to optimise recruitment. The main study outcomes include recruitment rate (primary outcome), identification of strategies to optimise recruitment, performance of trial treatment pathways, clinical outcomes and safety of non-operative treatment. We have involved children, young people and parents in study design and delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">In this study we will explore the feasibility of performing a full efficacy RCT comparing non-operative treatment with appendicectomy in children with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. Factors determining success of the present study include recruitment rate, safety of non-operative treatment and adequate interest in the future RCT. Ultimately this feasibility study will form the foundation of the main RCT and reinforce its design.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15830435">ISRCTN15830435</ext-link>.

The lifetime risk of developing appendicitis is 7&#x02013;8%, and the most common age for developing appendicitis is in the early teens. Appendicectomy is considered the gold standard treatment for acute appendicitis by most surgeons, but many parents and patients find the prospect of the need for emergency surgery frightening and one they are keen to avoid if an alternative is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preliminary work we have already undertaken with children and families confirms a high level of interest in non-operative treatment, and indeed a preference for non-operative treatment so long as clinical outcomes are comparable.</p><p id="Par24">Although appendicectomy is considered a simple procedure, it requires a general anaesthetic and an abdominal operation with its associated risks. The complication rate of appendicectomy (including wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess and adhesional small bowel obstruction) is up to 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with a need for hospital readmission in 4&#x02013;5% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A contemporary estimation of these risks is available from the National Appendicectomy Audit, a nationwide audit of outcomes of appendicectomy for acute appendicitis in 19 specialist paediatric surgery centres in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Over a 2-month period, 242 appendicectomies for acute appendicitis were performed. The negative (histologically normal) appendicectomy rate was 10.3%, and the 30-day adverse event (AE) rate (a composite of readmission, re-intervention, pelvic collection and wound infection) was 15.3%. The economic burden to the healthcare system of paediatric appendicitis in England is in excess of &#x000a3;21 million per year and requires significant resource use, including need for out-of-hours surgery (45% of all paediatric appendicectomies were performed between 1800 and 0800 in the National Appendicectomy Audit).</p><p id="Par25">An alternative approach to treating acute appendicitis in children would be treatment with antibiotics and without an appendicectomy. Whilst there is growing scientific interest in the use of non-operative treatment with antibiotics owing to its potential benefits over surgery and existing data to support its safety, the relative efficacy of this approach compared with appendicectomy is not yet known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. By undergoing a non-operative approach to treatment of their appendicitis, patients may avoid the mental and physical stress and trauma of an operation as well as the associated complications. Non-operative treatment has the potential to reduce the quantity of resources used by the National Health Service (NHS). For example, by reducing the amount of theatre time, staff time and surgical resources used for the treatment of appendicitis, there could be significant savings for the NHS.</p><p id="Par26">It has been known for some time that acute appendicitis can be treated successfully by antibiotics alone in the context of remote environments without surgical service capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the role of non-operative treatment as primary therapy has only recently come under consideration in developed healthcare systems, initially in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and more recently in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although studies in adults are sometimes extrapolated to children, to do so is problematic because there are key differences in appendicitis occurring in adults compared with in children. The presentation of appendicitis and the intra-abdominal inflammatory response are different in adults and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and may be more amenable to antibiotic treatment alone, and the psychosocial and economic impact of appendicitis in children affects the whole family rather than just the individual. Therefore, a paediatric randomised controlled trial (RCT) is necessary to compare both treatment options.</p><p id="Par27">There has been just one pilot RCT, recently performed in Sweden, comparing non-operative treatment with antibiotics with appendicectomy in children with acute appendicitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Fifty children (aged 5&#x02013;15 years) with acute non-perforated appendicitis were randomised to antibiotics (<italic>n</italic> = 24) or appendicectomy (<italic>n</italic> = 26). All children in the surgery group had histopathologically confirmed acute appendicitis, and none experienced a significant surgical complication. In the antibiotic group, 2 of 24 underwent appendicectomy within the time of primary antibiotic treatment, and 1 further child required appendicectomy for histologically proven, recurrent acute appendicitis 9 months later. Of the eligible participants, the recruitment rate was 40%; the drop-out rate following treatment allocation was 2% (1 patient); and no patient was lost to follow-up by 1 year. This pilot study was not powered sufficiently to compare the efficacy of antibiotics versus surgery, but it was conducted to inform the design of an international, multicentre RCT which is currently recruiting in non-UK centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Our group recently performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of non-operative treatment and appendicectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Whilst there were limitations related to a lack of RCTs, the existing data support a position of equipoise between these two treatment approaches. Neither our review nor any of the contributing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] identified any safety concerns regarding non-operative treatment.</p><p id="Par29">In addition to outcomes of the acute illness, the development of recurrent appendicitis is an important consideration in children who receive non-operative treatment that is not applicable to children treated with appendicectomy. In adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the incidence of recurrence (within 1 year) is around 15%. A recent pilot study of non-operative treatment of appendicitis in children with 1 year of follow-up reported a recurrence rate of 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and our recent systematic review estimated an incidence of 14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is the best current estimate in children.</p><p id="Par30">Given the current uncertainty regarding the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of non-operative treatment compared with appendicectomy in children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, a definitive RCT is necessary. Although RCTs are ongoing in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], there are important differences in diagnostic techniques and healthcare delivery in the United Kingdom that mandate a UK-specific trial. These include a much lower reliance on diagnostic imaging for confirmation of appendicitis in the United Kingdom than in other countries, as well as a higher negative appendicectomy rate and a lower uptake of laparoscopic appendicectomy in the United Kingdom, all of which may influence relative efficacy of non-operative treatment compared with surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Prior to performing a large efficacy trial, we designed this feasibility study, which includes a feasibility RCT, to inform the design and conduct of a future RCT and establish whether a main trial is possible in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par31">The CONTRACT (CONservative TReatment of Appendicitis in Children&#x000a0;Trial - feasibility) study comprises the following elements:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par32">A randomised controlled feasibility trial of children comparing a non-operative treatment pathway with appendicectomy.

After the initial 12&#x000a0;h period of NBM, oral intake will be advanced as tolerated. Children successfully treated without an operation will be converted to oral antibiotics once they are afebrile for 24 h and tolerating oral intake (per local policies and after the minimum 24&#x000a0;h broad-spectrum IV antibiotics).</p><p id="Par55">Clinical reviews will also be completed at approximately 24&#x000a0;h and 48 h post-randomisation. Any children who show signs of significant clinical deterioration by 24 h or at any point during the trial will undergo appendicectomy. Children who are considered stable or improving will continue with non-operative treatment. At 48 h, any children who have not shown clinical improvement will also undergo appendicectomy. The decision to continue non-operative treatment at these time points or to recommend discontinuation of non-operative treatment and appendicectomy will be made by the treating consultant and based on clinical judgement rather than on any specific features that are not evidence-based. All reasons for change in treatment will be recorded in detail.</p><p id="Par56">Any children who receive an appendicectomy for an incomplete response to non-operative treatment will follow a standardised post-operative treatment regimen already in use at each institution and identical to that used in the appendicectomy arm. The reason for having an appendicectomy will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Appendicectomy group</title><p id="Par57">Children randomised to the appendicectomy arm will undergo either open or laparoscopic appendicectomy at the surgeon&#x02019;s discretion, performed by a suitably experienced trainee (as per routine current practice) or a consultant. A peritoneal microbiology swab will be taken at the time the peritoneum is first opened or from the appendix, and from any peritoneal fluid sent for microbiological culture. The results of this swab will be recorded.</p><p id="Par58">Patients will receive IV antibiotics from the time of randomisation and be treated post-operatively with IV antibiotics according to existing institutional protocols; however, the following recommended regimen is used to guide practice: children with acute uncomplicated appendicitis or a macroscopically normal appendix will receive no further antibiotics. Children with a perforated appendix (defined as a faecolith or faecal matter within the peritoneal cavity, or visualisation of a hole in the appendix) will continue to receive IV antibiotics for a minimum of 3 days and will receive a minimum total course of antibiotics of 5 days (IV and oral). It is not possible to standardise the duration of antibiotic therapy, owing to anticipated variation in intra-operative findings and in response to treatment. The types of antibiotics used will be identical to those used in the non-operative treatment arm within each centre. Any child failing to respond to these first-line antibiotics will be treated as is clinically appropriate with a longer course of antibiotics or a change in antibiotic therapy, with the choice of antibiotic determined by intra-operative swab or fluid culture.</p><p id="Par59">Post-operatively, children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis or a normal appendix will not routinely have a nasogastric tube or a urinary catheter. They will receive oral intake as tolerated after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Discharge assessment</title><p id="Par60">Criteria for discharge to home will be identical to those in both treatment groups and will be as follows: vital signs within normal limits for age, afebrile for &#x02265;&#x02009;24 h, tolerating light diet orally, adequate oral pain relief and be mobile. Patients being treated non-operatively will receive a total course of 10 days of antibiotics following randomisation, unless decided otherwise by the clinician. If more than 10 days of oral antibiotics are administered, this will be recorded (including reason). Children who receive non-operative treatment will not routinely be offered interval appendicectomy, but they will be counselled about the risk of recurrence using best available data.</p><p id="Par61">Once a decision to discharge the child has been made, a member of the clinical team who has not been involved directly in the child&#x02019;s treatment will be asked to complete a discharge assessment. This assessor will not have prior knowledge of the randomisation or treatment received by the child. Upon completion of the discharge assessment, they will &#x0201c;guess&#x0201d; which treatment the child received. If the assessor should become unblinded during the assessment, this will also be recorded. Through this we hope to be able to determine the feasibility of a blinded discharge assessment in a future RCT.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Follow-up</title><p id="Par62">Follow-up appointments for all participants will take place at 6 weeks and at 3 and 6 months following discharge, either in the outpatient clinic or in the clinical research facility at each centre. If a face-to-face appointment is not possible, the 3- and 6-month follow-up can be completed over the phone. Data on resource use, time to return to daily activities and recurrent appendix-related problems (including unexplained abdominal pain and recurrence) will be collected prospectively to ensure high accuracy.

Each centre treats 80&#x02013;100 children per year with acute appendicitis, with an estimate that at least 130 will be eligible out of the 240&#x02013;300 potential patients. Assuming that 40&#x02013;50% will be recruited (i.e., 52&#x02013;65 participants in feasibility RCT), we will be able to estimate a true 40% recruitment rate with a 95% CI of 31&#x02013;49% and a true 50% recruitment rate with a 95% CI of 41&#x02013;59%. A total of 52&#x02013;65 participants in the feasibility RCT will be adequate to test treatment pathway procedures, data collection methods and loss to follow-up. For the embedded qualitative work related to recruitment, we will recruit until we reach data saturation, which we estimate will entail analysing approximately 40 recruitment consultations, 20&#x02013;30 family interviews and 20&#x02013;25 healthcare professional interviews.</p></sec><sec id="FPar13"><title>Clinical trial data analysis</title><p id="Par75">Data analysis will be performed by the study statistician, who will be blinded to treatment allocation by the use of coded data as per the statistical analysis plan. Because this is a feasibility study, all analyses will be treated as preliminary and exploratory and will be mainly descriptive. Feasibility outcomes (number of eligible patients, recruitment/retention rates, reasons for non-participation, success of blinding of the discharge assessor), treatment outcomes and complications will be presented by simple summary statistics with 95% CIs. Clinical outcome measures will be compared between treatment groups in an exploratory analysis, and variability estimates will be used to inform the sample size for a future definitive trial. The study will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement.</p></sec><sec id="FPar14"><title>Trial oversight and safety monitoring</title><p id="Par76">A study management group (SMG) will be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the trial. A trial steering committee (TSC) and data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) will also share independent oversight of the study. The DSMC will review the trial and its data from a safety and ethical perspective and will make recommendations regarding the continuation of the trial to the TSC, who will make the ultimate decision. The roles and responsibilities of each committee are detailed in a separate charter. The SMG will provide feedback to the SSAG and vice versa.</p><p id="Par77">Any patient who does not complete the non-operative treatment pathway within the trial (i.e., deteriorates or does not improve) and undergoes appendicectomy will be reported to the trial manager (TM) within 48 h of appendicectomy. The TM will inform the TSC chairperson and convey the clinical data relating to this patient. The TSC chair will hold responsibility for determining whether to ask the DSMC to meet and review the data from that patient. The DSMC will subsequently advise the TSC on their findings, including an assessment of whether it is acceptable to continue to recruit patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Qualitative substudy</title><p id="Par78">The embedded qualitative substudy comprises audio recordings of recruitment consultations between patients, their families and recruiters (paediatric surgeons and research nurses), as well as follow-up interviews with patients, their families and recruiters about their experiences of recruitment and the trial. Focus groups will also be conducted with paediatric surgeons at non-study sites about their views of the trial. When patients are approached about the study, they will be asked for verbal consent to audio-record the discussion. Seeking written consent for the audio recording at this point would distract from the focus of the consultation; therefore, we will ask patients at the end of the consultation for written consent to keep the recording and use it for analysis. After discharge, a trained qualitative researcher will contact and invite patients and their families to be interviewed either in their homes or by telephone. Recruiters will also be invited to be interviewed either in their place of work or by telephone. All consultations and interviews will be digitally audio-recorded and uploaded for transcription by a professional transcription service and pseudo-anonymised before analysis.</p><sec id="FPar15"><title>Analysis of recruitment consultations</title><p id="Par79">Analyses of the recruitment consultations will use both the recordings and transcripts to document the interactions between recruiters and families, explore information provision and use of communication techniques, as well as intervention preferences and trial participation decisions. If analyses of the audio-recordings suggest that recruitment difficulties are potentially linked to communication during the recruitment consultation, this information will be fed back to the local principal investigators so that training of recruiters can be implemented immediately. The equipoise and views of healthcare professionals recruiting to the trial will also be assessed, as well as the key ways in which their views differ from non-participating surgeons.</p><p id="Par80">The analyses will also draw upon content analytic methods to describe what was said by whom and how often in the audio recordings of recruitment sessions. Constant comparison methods will also inform identification of common or divergent themes, particularly focusing on the impact of statements by the recruiter on parent responses and views. This will focus on key sections of the transcripts, such as when randomisation is offered. The percentage of eligible patients recruited will be documented using site screening logs, noting any families who decline randomisation or do not accept the randomised allocation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar16"><title>Analysis of interview and focus group data</title><p id="Par81">The findings derived from the analysis of the recruitment consultations will be linked with qualitative data from the interviews where patients discuss the acceptability of trial methodology to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a full trial, and also with the recruiter interviews. Analysis of interview and focus group data will draw on the principles of the constant comparative method and thematic analysis. One member of the research team will lead a process of &#x02018;cycling&#x02019; between the developing analysis and new data. Other members of the qualitative study team (including at least one surgeon) will develop and test the analysis by periodic discussion and independent analyses of a proportion of transcripts to compare coding and findings.</p><p id="Par82">Initially, each transcript will be read several times by the lead analyst before development of open codes to describe each relevant unit of meaning, although coding will occur at multiple levels, from detailed descriptions of communication and experiences of the trial, to the general orientation of participants towards clinical research. Through comparison within and across the transcripts, the open codes will be developed into categories to reflect and test the developing analysis. The categories will be organised into a framework to code and index the transcripts using NVivo software (QSR International, Doncaster, Australia). The framework categories will continually be checked and modified to ensure an adequate &#x02018;fit&#x02019; with the data, whilst also accounting for variation in the data and &#x02018;deviant&#x02019; cases. A second member of the team will check the categories and the assignment of data to them. Our analytic approach will be informed by writings on quality in qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p id="Par83">We recognise that PPI is a crucial element of this study, and as such, we will form a SSAG made up of parents, children and young people, some of whom will have experience of treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. This group will provide overarching consultation and collaboration functions for the programme of research, minus the HE substudy. The group will help devise patient and parent documentation (including but not limited to information sheets, consent forms and a recruitment video) and provide insight on the qualitative substudy interview schedule and COS development. They will also help with the dissemination of the results back to study participants via information sources accessed by children, young people and parents and through a variety of media.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Progression to main trial</title><p id="Par84">Through this initial study we aim to inform the design, conduct and feasibility of a future efficacy RCT whilst confirming for the first time the safety of non-operative treatment in UK paediatric surgical centres. The decision to progress to a future RCT will be based on a combination of recruitment rate achieved, safety of non-operative treatment and adequate surgeon interest. These issues will be discussed by the trial management and oversight groups and be reviewed by a new funding panel. Currently, we think that a future main RCT will be considered feasible if the following goals are met:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par85">The lower boundary of the 95% CI of the recruitment rate is above 20%.
