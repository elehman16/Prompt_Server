mobilization on changes in pelvic obliquity and pain level in seventeen female university
students aged in their 20&#x02019;s with sacroiliac joint dysfunction by dividing them into two
groups: a joint mobilization group (MWM) and a control group. [Subjects] Seventeen
subjects were selected from female university students aged in their 20&#x02019;s attending N
University in Cheon-An City, Korea, The subjects had sacroiliac joint syndrome, but
experienced no problems with daily living and had no previous experience of joint
mobilization exercise. The subjects were randomly assigned to a joint mobilization group
of eight and a control group of nine who performed joint mobilization exercise. [Methods]
Body fat and lean body mass were measured using InBody 7.0 (Biospace, Korea). The Direct
Segmental Multi-frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Method (DSM-BIA) was used for
body composition measurement. A pressure footstool (Pedoscan, DIERS, Germany) and a trunk
measurement system (Formetric 4D, DIERS, Germany), a 3D image processing apparatus with
high resolution for vertebrae, were used to measure 3D trunk images of the vertebrae and
pelvis obliquity, as well as static balance ability. [Result] The MWM group showed a
significantly better Balance than the control group. In addition, the results of the
left/right and the front/rear balance abilities were significantly better than those of
the control group. [Conclusion] This study proved that a combination of mobilization with
movement and functional training was effective in reducing pelvis malposition and pain,
and improving static stability control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Joint mobilization</kwd><kwd>Sacroiliac joint dysfunction</kwd><kwd>MWM (Mobilization with Movement)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Due to industrial development and the consequent increase in daily comfort, physical
activities have gradually decreased, leading to increased body weight with reduced physical
strength, as well as more sedentary lifestyles and significantly decreased amounts of
exercise. Due to incorrect exercise habits, even among those who exercise regularly, bad
posture over extended periods, and inappropriate daily life and work habits, excessive load
and tension are exerted on the back. The resulting continuous back tension has increased the
number of patients with low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mennell<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> presented the term joint
dysfunction for arthrokinematic dysfunction in the absence of pathological changes in the
joints, including capsules and ligaments. He also attributed muscular pain and muscle spasm
to difficulties with normal arthrokinematic mobilization in joint capsules, which limit
joint movement when patients attempted to move joints suffering from the symptoms of joint
dysfunction. Joint mobilization can be performed to achieve a neurophysiological effect to
reduce muscle pain and guarding, and a mechanical effect such as stretch or burst of
contracted tissues. One study reported increased active exercise by patients as a result of
joint mobilization<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The physiological effects of joint mobilization, which is aimed at increasing the range of
joint motion and pain reduction, can be explained by the gate control theory proposed by
Melzack and Wall<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vicious cycle of
muscle pain and spasm can be broken by closing the gate where the pain stimulus is largely
transmitted through thin filaments, which have slow stimulus conduction velocity, while
proprioceptive neurons of thick filaments are stimulated.</p><p>The present study aimed to determine the effect of an 8-week program of joint mobilization
on changes in pelvic obliquity and pain level in seventeen female university students aged
in their 20&#x02019;s with sacroiliac joint dysfunction by dividing them into two groups: a joint
mobilization group, and a control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Seventeen subjects were selected from female university students aged in their 20&#x02019;s

and the ilium of the pelvis. With its extremely limited mobility and small joint
mobilization, this joint rarely causes any pathological problem except for body imbalance
due to sacroiliac joint obliquity and changes in iliac, ischium, and length of the
ilium<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The analysis of the pelvis
obliquity showed the intervention of this study provided the greatest statistically
significant interaction effect on left and right pelvis obliquity (p&#x0003c;0.001). Furthermore,
a group performing combined joint mobilization and functional exercise showed statistically
significant differences between before and after the exercise whereas the control group
performing simple joint mobilization did not (p&#x0003c;0.001). In a previous study, Yang<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the measurement results of changes
around the sacroiliac joint after 12 weeks of rolling massage for patients with chronic low
back pain. He found that ilium deviation was reduced by about 2.37&#x02005;mm, sacroiliac joint
deviation by about 2.25&#x02005;mm, and ischium deviation by about 2.5&#x02005;mm, resulting in a
significant difference overall in the sacroiliac joint-related areas (p&#x0003c;0.001). However,
Lee<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that changes in low back
pain found in experimental and control groups after manipulative therapy administered to
patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction with muscle imbalance differed significantly
between the two groups before and after the experiment (p&#x0003c;0.001), whereas changes in
pelvis rotation between the experimental and control groups showed significant difference
between before and after the experiment (p&#x0003e;0.05), in contrast to our study&#x02019;s results. We
attribute difference in these study results to the difference between our joint mobilization
and Lee&#x02019;s manipulative therapy, and to the lack of any functional exercise.</p><p>For pain control, it is advantageous to discover and treat specific lesions causing the
pain (trigger point, over-loaded muscle, weakened or abnormal movement types, or joint
dysfunction), not only to reduce the symptoms (pain) but also to induce functional
recovery<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results for the joint mobilization intervention used in this study show that two groups
of showed statistically significant decreases of pain compared to the control group
(p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In a previous study, Lee<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
significant reductions of low back pain, functional disorder level, and low back instability
in patients with chronic low back pain after lower extremity strengthening exercise along
with low back stabilization exercise (p&#x0003c;0.05). He also claimed that a program of combined
exercise performing low back stabilization exercise and lower extremity strengthening
exercise was more effective at decreasing low back pain, functional disorder level, and low
back instability than a stabilization exercise alone.</p><p>Han<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a combination of
functional exercises resulted in significant pain relief from 4.61 to 1.94 on a subjective
pain index (VAS), while simple exercise resulted in non-significant pain relief from 3.93 to
1.57. Furthermore, Im<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that VAS
showed a significant difference between before and after Chuna therapy and spinal
stabilization exercises for 16 weeks. Significant differences were also found between two
groups: a group of single treatment with Chuna therapy and a group of combined treatment of
Chuna therapy and spinal stabilization exercise. This last result is consistent with our own
study result.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Jerkeset BT, Johnsen LG,
