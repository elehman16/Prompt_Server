electroencephalogram changes in the demented elderly. [Subjects] Fourteen patients were
included in the experimental group and 18 in the control group. [Methods] They had no
regular exercise habits, and walked independently, and scored 11&#x02013;23 points on the
Mini-Mental State Examination, and thus had no apraxia and could communicate. To
empirically verify changes in electroencephalograms of the demented elderly for
depression, sleep disorder, and life quality through their participation in the
therapeutic recreation program, male and female citizens &#x0003e;65&#x02005;years old at a geriatric
hospital were included. The experimental group attended therapeutic recreation programs
regularly for 3 months and control group did not. [Results] Electroencephalogram values
were higher in the experimental than in the control group, demonstrating that the
therapeutic recreation program enhances electroencephalogram values. However, post-program
electroencephalograms between the two groups showed minor differences for all variables,
except for the anti-stress index and brain quotient. [Conclusion] The therapeutic
recreation program caused changes in brain activation, and this method revealed the
relation between the activity program and emotion via the anti-stress index.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Recreation program</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>Dementia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The prevalence of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease or senile dementia, in citizens over 65&#x02005;years old has
been implicated to increase from 8.8% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2020, 11.2% in 2040, and 13.2% in
2050<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently, the understanding of
dementia is increasing, and therapies and interventions are being developed. The concept of
milieu therapy for dementia through therapeutic activities and activity therapy is
increasingly gaining interest. Activity therapy, which can reduce the degeneration rate of
cognitive function, which is a characteristic symptom of dementia, is being attempted, and
its effectiveness has been reported. Regular exercise for a patient with dementia is an
essential factor and an effective strategy to delay the onset of dementia<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the demented elderly, exercise was reported to not only be effective in reducing the
fall risk by improving brain activation, increasing brain blood flow and neurotransmitter
secretion, and enhancing muscle flexibility and the sense of balance, but also in enabling
smooth gastrointestinal motility, increasing joint motion range by increasing physical
strength, and providing an anti-depressant effect<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, exercise can reduce the early-onset rate of stroke and adult diseases such as
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, which cause dementia, thus preventing
dementia progression or delaying disease initiation. Further, exercise is known to prevent
mental and physical malfunction, improving confidence and a sense of accomplishment in
patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, regular exercise results in improvements in
cognitive function, as indicated by the reduced loss of frontal and temporal node tissue
when the brain volume was measured using the magnetic resonance imaging<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is still a lack of direct research on how
activities for health promotion change electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in the demented
elderly.</p><p>If a recreation program is provided for treatment and rehabilitation, it may enhance the
life quality by changing EEG findings of the demented elderly.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how participation in a recreation
program influences changes in EEG findings in the demented elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects included male and female patients over 65&#x02005;years old at a dementia nursing center
and a municipal geriatric hospital. For the final analysis, 14 patients were included in the
experimental group and 18 in the control group. Before the study, the purpose and process
were well explained to the subjects, and then, the study was conducted. These subjects had
no regular exercise habits and walked independently, and scored 11&#x02013;23 points on the
Mini-Mental State Examination, were diagnosed as the first and mid-term dementia, and thus
had no apraxia and could communicate.</p><p>To empirically verify the changes in EEGs of the demented elderly for depression, sleep
disorder, and life quality during their participation in the therapeutic recreation program,
the subjects were classified into the experimental group that attended therapeutic
recreation programs regularly for 3 months, and the control group that did not attended any
therapeutic recreation programs. Their EEG changes were measured before and after
participation in the program. Owing to the characteristics of on-site research, the
experimental and control groups could not be divided evenly, and exact matching of
background variables between groups was impractical; therefore, the non-equivalent control
group design, which is a quasi-experimental design method, was applied.</p><p>The EEG test: The 2-channel wired EEG monitor (LXE 3202; CANS 3000, LAXTHA Inc.) and
Telescan, a data acquisition and analysis software, were used to measure EEG (SP) and ERP
(EP), respectively. To measure changes in EEGs and to analyze the brain functions, balance
index, attention index, emotion index, anti-stress index, and brain quotient (BQ) were
determined.</p><p>In this study, amusement, social activity, and habit-cultural activity were selected, as
the main focus of health-sports activities, to match the health of the demented elderly, and
indoor environment activities were selected by referring to the classification criteria,
such as leisure education, cooking activity, outdoor activity, hobby, etc. (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The protocol in the therapeutic recreation program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Program</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Introduction</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Social activity</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Massage</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Game</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sing a song</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="13" colspan="1">Development</td><td align="center" rowspan="6" colspan="1">Health-sports activities</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02013;9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yoga game</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Music and dance</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02013;14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sing a song and rec-dance</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Mini sports</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="6" colspan="1">Habit-cultural activities</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Korean music</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Paper art</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Magic</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Read a book</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Closing</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Evaluation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Recreation</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>).

left-right asymmetry compared to that in the normal control group, as determined using the
spatio-temporal pattern analysis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
the corpus callosum, which transmits information between the left and the right hemispheres,
became atrophied<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the hemispheric
disconnection syndrome could be explained.</p><p>A normal brain is the one showing balance between the left and right sides, which means
that there must be mutual interchange through the corpus callosum, thus providing stability
in emotional inclination. Therefore, in this study, the left-right hemispheric balance index
displayed more changes after the experiment compared to that before the experiment, implying
partial brain activation. Second, Bryant and Veroff<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed mental health in the social and historical context and
found that the mental health structure can be positive or negative, and that &#x0201c;positive
mental health is the psychological wellbeing and is composed of positive emotion and
emotional relation&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;negative mental health is psychological stress and is made up of
anxiety, depression, and emotional loss of control&#x0201d;.</p><p>Chung<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the estimated values of
self-reported emotion, motif, and positive personality traits in each frontal lobe by
activation groups, and found that the relative left activation group showed a significantly
higher level of positive affect, approach motivation, happiness, hope, and ego-resiliency
than the relative right activation group. Moreover, for the personal affect type, the
relative activation of the frontal cortex has relations with positive affect with respect to
the left side<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study confirmed that the therapeutic recreation program enabled changes in brain
activation and revealed the relation between the activity program and emotion via the
anti-stress index.</p><p>Third, the study on EEG changes with respect to attention and concentration following the
yoga program by exercise intensity showed that absolute and relative alpha waves emitted
during concentration or creative thinking decreased, consequently increasing attention and
concentration.</p><p>In this study, the appropriate intensity of exercise implemented through therapeutic
recreation enabled creative thinking in the elderly, thus increasing their attention
concentration.</p><p>Fourth, catecholamine, one of the stress hormones, is not essential for life support, but
is released rapidly when during stress conditions. Exercise provides an anti-depressive
effect and increases stress resistance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have used surveys to measure cognitive function through motion stimulus in
elderly patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, but these previous studies on the approach of
brain function are from the viewpoint of physiology. Nevertheless, the study on the effect
of resistance training on the brain function index in the elderly with Alzheimer&#x02019;s
disease<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that the brain index increased after exercise both in
the resistance training and gymnastics groups, thus supporting this study result.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">Ministry for Health: Welfare and
