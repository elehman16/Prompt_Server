They are randomly assigned to WAA therapy or sham acupuncture groups (30 patients for each group), and then receive real or sham acupuncture treatment, respectively. In this trial, the primary outcome measure is simple form of McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ), while expectation and treatment credibility scale (ETCS), safety assessment, the COX menstrual symptom scale (CMSS), questionnaire about the feeling of being punctured are included in the secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will be the first study protocol designed to evaluate the immediate analgesia effect of WAA in PD of young females.

Moreover, the vast majority is primary dysmenorrhea (PD), defined as painful menses in women with normal pelvic anatomy. Due to the lack of standard methods for assessing the severity of dysmenorrhea, studies based on the different definitions of the condition have reported the prevalence of PD as between 45% and 95% of menstruating women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PD has negative impact on physical and psychological aspects of health, and its harm to the health will in turn aggravate the symptoms of PD, which is a vicious cycle. It has become an important research field to alleviate the symptom of PD safely and to improve the quality of life and well-being rating of female.</p><p id="Par11">Therapeutically, the conventional pharmacotherapy for the PD is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although NSAIDs and other drugs can alleviate the pain of PD significantly, their application is limited, mostly because of their disability in curing the disease ultimately, along with their side effects and unaffordable high prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Professor Zhang Xinshu and his colleagues from Changhai Hospital of Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China invented and developed wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA), a modern subcutaneous acupuncture technique, in the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. WAA which does not produce any pain or &#x0201c;needling sensation&#x0201d; is quite distinguished from the traditional acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to its unique theoretical system and the clinical evidence, WAA has demonstrated analgesic effects for both chronic and acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, the active principle is considered to have correlation with the threshold of pain, or the regulation function of central nervous system, which is partly consistent with the analgesic mechanism of the traditional acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is a guaranteed guiding significance of WAA for PD&#x02019;s treatment. To date, there are few studies investigating the application of WAA in the alleviation of PD. The present study is aimed at investigating the immediate analgesia effects of WAA for young females with PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par13">The aims of this study are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par14">observe the immediate analgesia effect of WAA in PD of young females;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">provide high-quality evidence-based recommendations on further treatment.</p></list-item></list>

Needling the certain point will relieve the pain on the corresponding zone of the point. If the pain is on the upper (lower) part of the body (with the diaphragm as the demarcation), the needling point at the ipsilateral wrist (ankle) is selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The pain sites of PD patients in the study are primarily located in the lower abdomen. To standardize the selection of the needling site and the treatment protocol, point 1 at both ankles will be needled (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Participants will be randomly assigned to the WAA group or the sham acupuncture group. The intervention will be applied during the first 24&#x000a0;h of the most intense dysmenorrhea&#x02019;s occurrence. A single registered acupuncturist, with at least one year of previous WAA experience, will administer the care to all subjects.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>WAA needling point 1 on the ankle zone (Point lower 1) after insertion.

The target point was disinfected with an iodophordis infectant (Shanghai Likang Disinfectant Hi-tech Co. Ltd.). The processed needles were also held with thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the right hand. The skin near the target point was gently pressed with the left thumb to make it slightly taut. Then, the needle tip was swiftly inserted into the skin at the target point at an angle of 30&#x000b0;. The needle was lowered to the horizontal position and slowly advanced until the entire needle (except the handle) entered the subcutaneous tissue. The handle was then fixed to the skin with an adhesive tape. The needles were retained in the subcutaneous tissue for 30&#x000a0;min.

Thus, both the participants and the assessor won&#x02019;t distinguish clearly which intervention was given.

Acupuncture has been used worldwide for various types of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the evidence from clinical studies also suggested that WAA has confirmed analgesic efficacy for many kinds of pain, like post-TACE pain or some cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Nowadays, the incidence of PD is increasing, especially among young females. At present, there are few attentions paid to the application of WAA for PD. Therefore, a trial about this direction deserves our devotion.</p><p id="Par44">Based on TCM acupuncture theory, filiform needle therapy on the acupionts always needs participants to get the sensation of obtaining qi, which is usually experienced as sourness, numberness, distention and pain. Only the acupuncture trial design with request of obtaining qi can reflect the correct and obvious therapeutic effect of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, patients who experienced acupuncture treatment will perceive the difference between non-penetrating sham acupuncture and real acupuncture easily. For this reason, it is hard for common filiform needle in acupuncture intervention designed as a blind trial. However, Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture doesn&#x02019;t require any needling sensation. In the trial, the subjects were asked to wear an eye mask, so it is hard for them to distinguish the certain intervention in the following treatment. For this reason, we believe that non- penetrating sham acupuncture can serve as an effective placebo intervention in this trial. Meanwhile, participants&#x02019; feeling of acupuncture questionnaire would arrange in the end of treatment in order to exclude breaking blind subjects. Therefore, a randomized controlled single-blind trial with a non- penetrating sham wrist-ankle acupuncture group was designed, and it will be able to evaluate the immediate analgesia effect of WAA in PD of young females and provide useful advice of evidence-based medicine for further treatment.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par45">The trial is currently recruiting patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CMSS</term><def><p id="Par5">COX menstrual symptom scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p id="Par6">Primary Dysmenorrhea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-MPQ</term><def><p id="Par7">Simple form of McGill pain questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TACE</term><def><p id="Par8">Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WAA</term><def><p id="Par9">Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>This work was supported by Incubation of Acupuncture and Tuina, Second Military Medical University.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par46">This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par47">Upon the completion of the study, supporting data will be available upon request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SS designed the methodology.
