The effects of apixaban on pharmacokinetics (PK) of multidose Lanoxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (digoxin) and single-dose Tenormin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (atenolol) and the effects of single-dose atenolol on apixaban PK in healthy subjects were investigated in two Phase 1 studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The digoxin DDI study was an open-label, multidose, two-treatment, single-sequence study in which subjects received digoxin 0.25 mg q6h on day 1, then once daily on days 2&#x02013;10, followed by apixaban 20 mg and digoxin 0.25 mg once daily on days 11&#x02013;20. The atenolol DDI study was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-period, three-treatment, crossover study in which subjects received a single oral dose of apixaban 10 mg, atenolol 100 mg, or apixaban 10 mg plus atenolol 100 mg. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of geometric means of peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC<sub>tau</sub>), with and without apixaban were calculated. Absence of effect was concluded if the point estimates and 90% CI were within the equivalence interval of 80%&#x02013;125% (digoxin) or 70%&#x02013;143% (atenolol). A similar analysis was performed to assess the effect of atenolol on apixaban.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Apixaban had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of either atenolol or digoxin: point estimates and 90% CI for both digoxin and atenolol C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were entirely within their respective no-effect intervals. Apixaban C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> were slightly decreased (ie, 18% and 15% lower, respectively) following atenolol coadministration. No serious or major bleeding-related adverse events were reported during either study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Apixaban had no effect on the PK of digoxin and there was no clinically relevant interaction between apixaban and atenolol. Coadministration of digoxin or atenolol with apixaban in healthy subjects was generally well tolerated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>oral anticoagulant</kwd><kwd>factor Xa inhibitor</kwd><kwd>drug&#x02013;drug interaction</kwd><kwd>Phase 1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apixaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).<xref rid="b1-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Apixaban has also been approved for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery,<xref rid="b1-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> as well as for the treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for the reduction of the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Apixaban is often coadministered with treatments for cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Therefore, it is important to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between apixaban and possible concomitant cardiovascular treatments.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of apixaban in healthy subjects are characterized by a time to peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of 3&#x02013;4 hours and a mean elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of ~12 hours.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Apixaban is 87% bound to serum proteins, and is eliminated through multiple mechanisms, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-mediated metabolism, and renal, biliary, and direct intestinal excretion.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition to CYP3A4, apixaban is also a substrate of the drug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp).<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase and decrease apixaban exposure, respectively.<xref rid="b15-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Apixaban does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4 or other CYP isoenzymes, and does not inhibit P-gp.<xref rid="b14-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b17-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, it is unlikely that apixaban would alter the metabolic clearance of concomitant medications that undergo CYP enzyme-mediated metabolism, and an interaction between apixaban and P-gp substrates is not expected.</p><p>Lanoxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (digoxin), a cardiac glycoside used for the treatment of congestive heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation,<xref rid="b18-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> has a narrow therapeutic index. Because it is likely that apixaban and digoxin will be coadministered in some patients, it is important to evaluate the potential for apixaban to alter the PK of digoxin. Oral digoxin is rapidly absorbed, with a T<sub>max</sub> of 1&#x02013;3 hours, and is eliminated slowly, with a mean t<sub>1/2</sub> of 1.5&#x02013;2.0 days.<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Approximately 25% of digoxin in the plasma is protein-bound, and only 16% of the dose is metabolized, with 50%&#x02013;70% excreted unchanged in the urine.<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Metabolism of digoxin is independent of CYP, and digoxin does not appear to induce or inhibit the CYP system.<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The potential for a drug&#x02013;drug interaction (DDI) between apixaban and digoxin was considered to be low on the basis of their individual absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles. Digoxin also serves as an acceptable P-gp probe substrate to predict the effects of P-gp modulators used in the clinical setting.<xref rid="b20-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Tenormin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (atenolol) is a cardioselective beta-blocker that is prescribed to treat hypertension.<xref rid="b21-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The PK of oral atenolol is characterized by a T<sub>max</sub> of 2&#x02013;4 hours, and a mean elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> of 6&#x02013;7 hours. Atenolol minimally binds to plasma protein (6%&#x02013;16%). Half of the oral atenolol dose is excreted unchanged in the feces; most of the remainder is eliminated through renal excretion, with little or no metabolism by the liver.<xref rid="b21-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Beta-blockers may reduce hepatic blood flow<xref rid="b22-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; however, apixaban clearance is not expected to be limited by reduced hepatic blood flow because it is not a high extraction ratio drug.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although atenolol is not metabolized by CYP enzymes and does not inhibit P-gp-mediated transport, both apixaban and atenolol are P-gp substrates.<xref rid="b14-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Two separate Phase 1 studies were conducted to evaluate the risk of clinically meaningful DDIs between apixaban and digoxin or atenolol. Based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs, interactions between apixaban and digoxin and between apixaban and atenolol were expected to be minimal. The primary objective of the digoxin DDI study (NCT02262520) was to assess the effect of multidose apixaban on the PK of multidose digoxin in healthy subjects. The primary objectives of the atenolol DDI study (NCT02262533) were to assess the effect of atenolol on the PK of apixaban and the effect of apixaban on the PK of atenolol in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The digoxin DDI study was an open-label, multidose, two-treatment, single-sequence study in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cpaa-9-019">Figure 1A</xref>).

Subjects underwent screening evaluations within a 21-day period prior to dosing to determine eligibility. Both trials excluded female subjects who were pregnant or nursing. The digoxin study excluded all women of childbearing potential; the atenolol DDI study allowed them to participate if they used accepted methods of contraception, excluding use of hormonal contraception, within 3 months of study start.

All AEs reported in the digoxin DDI study were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without treatment. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs were an increase in ALT and ocular or scleral hyperemia, each reported in three subjects, and dizziness and pharyngolaryngeal pain, each reported in two subjects. Elevated ALT occurred during digoxin treatment and prior to the administration of apixaban in two subjects, one of whom discontinued the study before the start of apixaban treatment. A single bleeding-related AE of gingival bleeding occurred in one subject on day 18, and resolved after 4 days without requiring interruption of study drug. The event was considered to be mild in intensity and possibly related to study drug by the investigator. Bruising around the intravenous catheter site occurred in one subject on day 12. This event was considered to be mild in intensity and was considered unlikely to be related to study medication. The subject completed the study without interruption of study therapy. No significant vital sign or ECG findings were reported.</p><p>Few AEs (five for apixaban and four for apixaban + atenolol) occurred during the atenolol DDI study, none of which were bleeding-related, with no appreciable difference between treatments. The most common AE was headache (three subjects). One subject discontinued due to moderate cellulitis that began on day 4 after administration of a single dose of apixaban + atenolol; this AE was considered unrelated to study treatment. No significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG findings were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The two DDI studies reported here investigated potential pharmacokinetic interactions between apixaban and digoxin and apixaban and atenolol in healthy subjects. The results of both studies confirmed the hypothesis of little potential for a DDI between apixaban and either digoxin or atenolol.<xref rid="b14-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b17-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These studies are in agreement with previous studies indicating a low potential for apixaban to interact with concomitant medications.<xref rid="b12-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In the digoxin DDI study, administration of multidose apixaban 20 mg once daily did not affect the PK of multidose digoxin. With a multidose regimen, the digoxin DDI study was designed to evaluate the potential for a DDI at steady-state levels. Both apixaban and digoxin reached steady state (based on C<sub>min</sub> values) by the time of the individual pharmacokinetic evaluations. The achievement of apixaban steady state is consistent with previous observations.<xref rid="b10-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The 90% CIs for digoxin C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>tau</sub> geometric mean ratios were within the equivalence interval of 80%&#x02013;125%, indicating absence of an effect of apixaban on digoxin PK. Apixaban did not appear to affect the GI absorption of digoxin. The T<sub>max</sub> of digoxin was unchanged following coadministration of apixaban. The findings provide support for the low potential for apixaban to affect the PK of other P-gp substrates, as digoxin is a commonly used P-gp probe substrate.<xref rid="b20-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It should be noted that the apixaban dose in this study (20 mg) is expected to result in steady-state exposure (i.e., AUC<sub>tau</sub>) that is ~1.5&#x02013;2 times higher than that achieved in most patients treated with the highest approved apixaban dose, 10 mg twice daily, for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which provides further assurance that apixaban-mediated interactions with other P-gp substrates (eg, quinidine) are unlikely.</p><p>There was no impact of apixaban on the PK of atenolol observed in this study. The atenolol T<sub>max</sub> was slightly shortened from 3 to 2 hours; however, the point estimates for atenolol C<sub>max</sub> and AUC ratios with and without apixaban coadministration are close to 1 (0.98&#x02013;1.00), with the 90% CI for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> ratios within the prespecified no-effect interval of 70%&#x02013;143%. It is even more important to note that the CIs observed for all of the exposure parameter point estimates fell between 0.84 and 1.13, and would have also met the usual and narrower typical bioequivalence criteria of 80%&#x02013;125%. Atenolol PK is reported to be impacted by fruit juices, most likely due to atenolol being a substrate of transporters such as OATP2B1.<xref rid="b37-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Based on the results of this study, apixaban does not modulate transporters for atenolol nor affect its GI absorption. Although coadministration of apixaban and atenolol did result in a small decrease in apixaban exposure (18% decrease in C<sub>max</sub> and 15% decrease in AUC<sub>inf</sub>), the 90% CIs for the point estimates fall within the prespecified no-effect criteria. Based on our review of the literature and product label, atenolol does not appear to be a modulator of CYP enzymes or transporters, and has limited potential to be a perpetrator of pharmacokinetic drug interactions. This decrease in apixaban exposure is similar to other factors that impact apixaban exposure, such as body weight, for which subjects &#x02265;120 kg have 23% lower AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 31% lower C<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="b39-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This modest decrease in exposure was deemed not clinically relevant, and the dose of apixaban was not adjusted based on body weight alone.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In addition, in the exposure&#x02013;response prediction for VTE prevention following orthopedic surgery, an 18% decrease in apixaban exposure resulted in a hazard ratio for bleeding of 0.97.<xref rid="b40-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Therefore, the decrease in apixaban exposure in the presence of atenolol is not considered clinically meaningful.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The doses used in the atenolol study represent the high end of the recommended dose range for both atenolol (100 mg) and apixaban (10 mg). Thus, it is expected that concomitant administration of apixaban and atenolol at a dose of 100 mg or lower is unlikely to result in a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interaction. The results of these studies indicate that there is no reason to exclude digoxin or atenolol as concomitant medication for patients who are treated with apixaban.</p><p>Apixaban is 87% protein-bound, while atenolol and digoxin are minimally protein-bound (&#x02264;25% bound).<xref rid="b2-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b19-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cpaa-9-019" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These differences in protein-binding properties eliminated concerns about either drug displacing the coadministered drug from protein-binding and affecting unbound levels of coadministered drug. Apixaban has multiple pathways of metabolism and elimination, and does not interfere with the corresponding elimination pathways of atenolol or digoxin.</p><p>The single bleeding-related AE of gingival bleeding in the digoxin study does not signal a DDI effect because coadministration of digoxin resulted in an overall decrease in apixaban exposure. Furthermore, digoxin is not associated with a bleeding risk on its own.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>These studies did have a few limitations, including a small population composed of healthy subjects and the controlled clinical settings. In the real world, comorbidities and polypharmacy issues would also need to be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Apixaban had no effect on the PK of digoxin and there was no clinically relevant interaction between apixaban and atenolol. Based on these results, there are no restrictions on apixaban coadministration with either digoxin or atenolol. Coadministration of digoxin or atenolol with apixaban in healthy subjects was also generally well tolerated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was conducted by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Inc.
