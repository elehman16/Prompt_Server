Its antiepileptic action is based on noncompetitive inhibition of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, decreasing excitatory synaptic transmission. Evaluation of efficacy in three placebo-controlled randomized Phase III studies showed that add-on therapy of PER decreased seizure frequencies significantly compared to placebo at daily doses between 4 mg/day and 12 mg/day. PER&#x02019;s long half-life of 105 hours allows for once-daily dosing that is favorable for patient compliance with intake. Long-term extension studies showed a 62.5%&#x02013;69.6% adherence of patients after 1 year of treatment, comparing favorably with other second-generation antiepileptic drugs. Whereas these trials demonstrated an overall favorable tolerability profile of PER, nonspecific central nervous system adverse effects like somnolence, dizziness, headache, and fatigue may occur. In addition, neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from irritability to suicidality were reported in several case reports; both placebo-controlled and prospective long-term extension trials showed a low incidence of such behavioral and psychiatric complaints. For early recognition of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, and aggression, slow titration and close monitoring during drug introduction are mandatory. This allows on the one hand to recognize patients particularly susceptible to adverse effects of the drug, and on the other hand to render the drug&#x02019;s full potential of seizure control available for the vast majority of patient groups tolerating the drug well.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

PER modulates the receptor in a noncompetitive manner, thus decreasing Na<sup>+</sup> influx and reducing the postsynaptic depolarization resulting from presynaptic glutamate release. With glutamate being the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain,<xref rid="b1-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> decreasing excitation by blockade of glutamate receptors has long been discussed as a therapeutic option to rebalance excitation and inhibition in epilepsy patients.<xref rid="b2-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In earlier times, the NMDA subreceptor had been investigated as a potential target for reducing excitability, particularly as this type of glutamate receptor plays a key role in use-dependent synaptic potentiation, including long-term potentiation.

In contrast, aside from somnolence, neuropsychiatric side effects occurred more frequently than with placebo treatment. These adverse effects mostly occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment, were not limited to patients with a history of psychiatric disease, and could become reasons to discontinue PER. In the following, clinical results on efficacy and tolerability of PER are given with particular emphasis on long-term retention, compliance, and neuropsychiatric tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>PER is readily absorbed following oral ingestion with a bioavailability of 100%.

PER is bound to proteins (predominantly albumins) by &#x0003e;95%, corresponding to a low free serum fraction of &#x0003c;5%. Liver metabolism is slow, resulting in a negligible first pass effect and in an unusually long mean <italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> with considerable interindividual variance (mean 105 hours, range 53&#x02013;136 hours) in subjects without concomitant exposure to enzyme-inducing AED. Metabolism occurs by oxidation via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, with mainly CYP 3A4 and CYP 3A5 involved, and secondary glucuronidation. The metabolites are inactive and are excreted up to 70% via feces.<xref rid="b24-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Based on the hepatic metabolism, PER is subject to various interactions. Co-administered enzyme-inducing drugs increase PER clearance considerably: with carbamazepine, AUC is decreased by 67%, with phenytoin and oxcarbazepine by 50%, and with topiramate by 20%. On the other hand, PER is a weak enzyme inducer, decreasing levonorgestrel levels by 40% and lowering midazolam AUC by 13%; there may be decreases to a minor degree (&#x0003c;10%) in the levels of other AEDs. In contrast, oxcarbazepine clearance is reduced by 26% resulting in markedly elevated serum levels.<xref rid="b25-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Focal epilepsy is a complex and etiologically diverse disease; accordingly, susceptibility to individual drugs in controlling arising seizures has been limited to subpopulations so far.

Three Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials (studies 304, 305, 306) have demonstrated the efficacy of PER.<xref rid="b26-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Based on these regulatory trials, PER has been approved in the US and Europe for the adjunctive treatment in adolescents and adults (aged 12 years and older) with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization.<xref rid="b29-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In preparation of these trials, there have been two consecutive Phase II studies with dose escalation and placebo-controlled for dose finding.

One hundred and fifty-three patients included in trial 206 received placebo or a maximum of 4 mg PER once daily or twice daily with uptitration from 1 mg to 4 mg every 2 weeks following a 4-week baseline period. Once- and twice-daily administration were tolerated similarly well, with overall rates of adverse effects being similar in all groups with 62.7% (placebo) versus 66.7% (PER). Adverse effects were followed by discontinuation in six subjects (placebo =3, BID =2, QD =1). Four were reported as severe adverse effects, two with placebo, and all of them associated with seizure activity. Neither abnormal laboratory tests nor electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities occurred in the PER group.</p><p>In trial 208 with corresponding design, 48 patients received PER or placebo with dose adjustment every 2 weeks up to higher daily doses of 12 mg/day to assess the maximum tolerated dose. Thirty-two percent of patients reached the dosage of 12 mg/day. Overall rates of side effects were similar in all groups with 80.0% (placebo) versus 84.2% (PER). Adverse effects led to drug discontinuation in three subjects (placebo =1, PER =2).

The most frequently reported adverse effects were dizziness and somnolence. Here, 87.4% represented side events of which 73% were mild or moderate. A severe adverse event (in &#x0003e;1% of patients) was only mentioned based on occurring seizures. A single case of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was registered in trial 307.

Suicidality was accompanied by other adverse effects like dizziness and blurred vision, evolving into sensitivity, irritability, and adversity or feeling thin-skinned, abnormally sensitive, and aggressive. In the third case, onset of symptoms was &#x0201c;bad thoughts&#x0201d; and repeated visualization of death-related &#x0201c;film scenes&#x0201d;. In cases 1 and 2, the phase of suicidality was accompanied by irritability and sensitivity, whereas case 3 had also signs of depression. Thus, depending on the preexisting disposition of patient cohorts, suicide risk might be higher than reported in controlled trials where patients with psychiatric disease are less common.<xref rid="b40-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms</title><p>A 13-year-old female patient with focal epilepsy and cognitive impairment with a baseline medication of lamotrigine and valproic acid developed a rash, cough, and fever as first symptoms 5 weeks after introduction of PER adjunctive treatment at a dose of 4 mg/day. After 1 week, she developed a lethargy combined with an increasing intensity of rash, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Leukocytes were elevated without eosinophilia, increased liver enzymes, acute renal failure with oliguria, and a perihilar infiltrate on chest X-ray. As she presented lesions surrounding lips and nose with xerosis, desquamation, and generalized erythroderma, a skin punch biopsy revealed superficial perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic/eosinophilic infiltrates indicating the diagnosis of a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. After hospitalization, with interruption of all AEDs (suspecting PER as responsible), and treatment with methylprednisolone and low immunoglobulin G, her clinical status normalized. The alleged attribution to PER remains uncertain as all AEDs were stopped and as the patient was not reexposed to any of them.<xref rid="b41-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory abnormalities</title><p>Laboratory monitoring was performed in all regulatory and long-term extension trials. The incidence of laboratory abnormalities with adjunctive use of PER was low, and it remained undetermined if any of them were PER-related. Observed abnormalities in the largest long-term extension study<xref rid="b55-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> included hyponatremia (3.7%; in 98% of patients in whom carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine was co-administered), low neutrophils (5.7%), or white cell counts (3.0%), which again are commonly found with various AEDs given as a baseline medication.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Recommended dosing and contraindications</title><p>The recommendations for dosage and administration vary between the US and Europe.<xref rid="b29-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> As suggested by the above-mentioned open-label long trials, tolerability considerably depends on the dosing strategy. The best balance between efficacy and tolerability shows major variability between patients, necessitating an individual titration according to the patient&#x02019;s clinical response and tolerability. The drug requires administration orally and is taken once daily before bedtime, with or without food. It should not be chewed, crushed, or split but swallowed whole with a glass of water.<xref rid="b42-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> According to the long plasma half-life, there is a danger of overdosing when increasing intake at times when a steady state condition is not reached which would allow to assess safety and efficacy.</p><p>In Europe, the starting dose recommended is 2 mg/day followed by 2 mg/day increments until achieving a maintenance dose of 4&#x02013;8 mg/day or up to a maximum target dose of 12 mg/day. It is advised that in patients without concomitant medicinal products that can shorten the half-life of PER or with mild/moderate hepatic impairment titration, increments should not exceed 2-week intervals. With concomitant enzyme inductors like carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and topiramate, they should not go below 1-week intervals. Although a risk of withdrawal seizures is unclear, dose reduction is recommended stepwise. Missing a single dose will have only minor effects on plasma levels due to the long half-time of the drug, and dosing should be continued without additional replacement in this case. If more doses have been missed but for a continuous period &#x0003c;5 half-lives, treatment should be resumed from the last dose level, and if misses exceed 5 half-lives, treatment should be restarted at initial dosing. In elderly people, no dose adjustment is recommended, but administration should be monitored carefully especially in polymedicated patients to account for possible drug interactions. Dose adjustments are not recommended with mild renal impairment, but PER use is not recommended in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment, or in patients undergoing hemodialysis. If mild or moderate hepatic impairment is present, reported dose and uptitration should be managed according to clinical response and tolerability, not exceeding 8 mg/day.<xref rid="b24-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In the US, treatment is recommended to start off at 2 mg/day without concomitant enzyme-inducing AED and at 4 mg/day with concomitant enzyme inducers. The titration is recommended with increments of 2 mg/week up to a maximum target dose of 12 mg/day or 6 mg/day in patients with mild hepatic impairment or 4 mg/day in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.<xref rid="b43-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> This reflects the predominantly hepatic metabolism of the drug, which suggests that alterations in renal clearance will not have a major effect on PER plasma concentrations.</p><p>Use of PER is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients or the active substance.<xref rid="b24-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>For treatment during pregnancy, PER is categorized as substance with &#x0201c;developmental toxicity in animals; no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women&#x0201d; belonging to category C<xref rid="b43-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> in the US. The European product information does not recommend PER in women of childbearing potential without contraception and neither during pregnancy, even though data of pregnant women using PER are limited (&#x0003c;300) and animal trials have not reported any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, whereas embryotoxicity was witnessed. Also, at breastfeeding, PER is expected to be excreted in human milk leaving infants at risk.<xref rid="b24-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient adherence and acceptability</title><p>Key prerequisites for any successful long-term treatment as required for prophylactic intake of AEDs are compliance and adherence of patients to the recommended drug regimen. Aspects relevant for compliance and adherence are thus important when choosing between different treatment/drug options to guarantee optimal satisfaction and consequential efficiency. More than one-third of the reviewed patients in the safety analysis had a baseline medication with additional three AEDs. Treatment cohorts had a baseline median seizure frequency of 10&#x02013;13/28 days, and more than two-thirds suffered from secondary generalized seizures. In the ITT analysis, 12% of the patients had also prior surgical treatment of their epilepsy, and 6% underwent vagal nerve stimulation. Even though the trials investigating efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the drug were thus performed in patient populations with several features of highly refractory epilepsy, PER is considered to be a well-tolerated and useful drug.<xref rid="b34-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The previously described long-term extension trials also point out that many, but not all, patients over time may tolerate doses of 10&#x02013;12 mg. Whereas adverse events played a major role in patients discontinuing PER in the conversion and early treatment phase following randomized trials (in 52%/53% of patients withdrawing), it becomes a more and more rare reason for drug discontinuation over time, playing a role in about 10% of patients discontinuing after 84 weeks of treatment and more.<xref rid="b32-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Overall, most patients discontinuing the drug did so during the randomized blinded phases of the core trials and during conversion to high doses (overall retention about 70%), whereas during further treatment from weeks 35 to 150, about 60% of patients remained on the drug.<xref rid="b32-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Patient adherence depends on both tolerability and efficacy of treatment. The available long-term extension studies show constant responder rates over time: the median reduction in seizure frequency in one study was 43.7% after 1 year, 52% after 2 years, 49.7% after 3 years, and 48.4% after 4 years; 50% of responders similarly remained in the range of 43%&#x02013;50%.<xref rid="b44-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> A similar maintenance of efficacy was reported by Krauss et al.<xref rid="b32-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Responder rates were 32%&#x02013;35% during the first 3 months, 42%&#x02013;48% during months 4&#x02013;6, 52% during months 7&#x02013;9, and 58% after 10&#x02013;12 months. Although these data do not give evidence for an increased efficacy over time as they are influenced by drop-outs, these data do not suggest the development of tolerance to the antiepileptic effect of PER over time.</p><p>Unlike talampanel, another studied AMPA receptor antagonist, PER advances with a long half-life in humans ensuring the sufficiency of a once-daily administration.<xref rid="b45-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The key role of a once-daily administration for improving compliance with intake has been proven both for AEDs and other medications applied in chronic diseases.<xref rid="b47-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b49-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Patient compliance and the prescribed number of doses per day were consistently found to correlate inversely.<xref rid="b50-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>Given comparatively good long-term retention in open-label continuation studies, the infrequent neuropsychiatric side effect played a relevant role in drug withdrawal.

Its rather specific modulation of this glutamate subreceptor is assumed to exert its antiepileptic action by reducing excitability, relatively independent of presynaptic transmitter release.<xref rid="b54-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> This novel mechanism opens up new options for a rational combination therapy in focal epilepsy. Aside from this new pharmacodynamic approach, the pharmacokinetic profile is also attractive: the long plasma half-time allows for once-daily dosing, favorable for long-term adherence.<xref rid="b22-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with other AEDs are limited to an elevation of oxcarbazepine levels, whereas the presence of enzyme inducers may shorten the half-life and thus decrease efficacy of PER. Overall, the handling of the drug in adjunctive therapy of epilepsy is easy for prescribing physicians and for patients.</p><p>Not only in short-term treatment during regulatory trials but also in prospective open-label trials, efficacy and tolerability were overall good with favorable retention rates over periods of 1&#x02013;4 years.<xref rid="b44-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In a comprehensive review of safety data<xref rid="b35-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> also, weight gain was found in PER-treated patients. Even if the mean weight gain on average was low (mean 0.8 kg overall), individual weight increases may be disturbing, and it remains to be seen if this can be an unwanted effect leading to drug withdrawal in patients carefully monitoring their weight. With &#x0003c;1% increases in liver function tests and &#x0003c;2% increases in creatine kinase (CK), laboratory tests did not raise safety concerns so far.<xref rid="b55-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><p>Whereas overall tolerability is regarded as good, there are concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including irritability, aggressive behavior, changes in mood, and even suicidality; these unwanted effects occurred at a total rate of &#x0003c;5% in prospective regulatory and extension trials but were highlighted in individual case reports. A higher rate of psychiatric side effects in specific subpopulations compared to published trials may be related to the exclusion of patients with recently manifest psychiatric disease from controlled studies, in contrast to a relevant prevalence of psychiatric disease in the overall group of patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy.<xref rid="b56-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Whereas central nervous system toxic side effects like somnolence and dizziness may occur at individual thresholds but are clearly dose-related in their incidence, neuropsychiatric side effects may individually occur at various dosages, including the common starting dose for long-term treatment of 4 mg/day.<xref rid="b37-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In individual case reports, neuropsychiatric side effects mostly occurred during titration or within several weeks after dose increases, whereas in long-term studies, few new treatment-emergent adverse effects were found. A close monitoring of tolerability is thus advisable already during early titration, in particular when patients with a history of psychiatric disease and possibly with a background of intellectual disability are treated.</p><p>Long-term data do not give evidence of loss of efficacy over time due to tolerance. In contrast, individual uptitration to high dosages may improve in particular the control of generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures.<xref rid="b31-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus, long-term treatment may offer efficacy gain with individually selected high PER doses. It remains an important result of studies, however, that efficacy of adjunctive PER treatment starts at relatively low dosages and that many patients do not need to have doses increased beyond a daily dose of 8 mg. Like with other drugs with long plasma half-time, a slow and deliberate drug introduction and a careful analysis of efficacy and tolerability considering the time periods needed to reach steady state are crucial to obtain the best efficacy in the individual patient.</p><p>Experience with PER is limited. There are yet open questions as to which combinations with other drugs of different mechanisms of action provide best efficacy and possibly synergy with PER, and if the concomitant administration of enzyme-inducing AED which reduces PER plasma levels impairs its efficacy in clinical practice.<xref rid="b57-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="b58-ppa-9-1143" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors received no financial or other support from the pharmaceutical industry for the preparation of this manuscript.
