This modulates calcium influx in presynaptic nerve terminals to reduce excessive release of several excitatory neurotransmitters. Pregabalin is structurally related to the naturally occurring amino acids <sc>l</sc>-leucine and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, and treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. The dose range is 150&#x02013;600&#x000a0;mg per day given in either two or three divided doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Pregabalin is absorbed rapidly (peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5&#x000a0;h) after oral administration and exposure to single (25&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mg/day) or multiple dosages (75&#x02013;900&#x000a0;mg/day) is dose proportional. The oral bioavailability of pregabalin is high (&#x02265;90&#x000a0;%) and independent of dose. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food, resulting in a decrease in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (maximum observed plasma concentration) of approximately 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% and an increase in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> (time to maximum concentration) to approximately 3&#x000a0;h. However, administration of pregabalin with food has no clinically relevant effect on the total absorption of pregabalin. Therefore, pregabalin can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin does not bind to plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration is approximately 0.5&#x000a0;L/kg. Metabolism of pregabalin is negligible with most of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine with a mean elimination half-life of 6.3&#x000a0;h in subjects with normal renal function. Pregabalin plasma clearance and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pregabalin pharmacokinetics is linear over the recommended daily dose range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the European guideline, two medicinal products containing the same active substance are considered bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives and their bioavailabilities (rate and extent) after administration in the same molar dose lie within acceptable predefined limits. These limits are set to ensure comparable in vivo performance; that is, similarity in terms of safety and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test formulation of pregabalin 300&#x000a0;mg and those of the European reference medicinal product (Lyrica<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), administered as a 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;300&#x000a0;mg capsule under fasted conditions, a surrogate for therapeutic equivalence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Volunteers and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>An independent ethics committee approved the clinical study protocol and a letter of no-objection was obtained from the Canadian authorities on 5 May, 2011.

The clinical part of the study was conducted at Algorithme Pharma Clinical Research Facility (Mount-Royal, QC, Canada) and the bioanalytical part at Anapharm Europe, SL facility (Barcelona, Spain).

Clinically significant diseases were not captured in the medical history, and no evidence of clinically significant findings on physical examination and/or clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, biochemistry, ECG and urinalysis) was found. The following procedures were performed at screening: medical history, demographic data (including sex, age, race, body weight [kg], height [cm], and BMI [kg/m<sup>2</sup>]), vital signs measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, urine ethanol and drugs of abuse screen, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C [HCV] antibodies, and hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).</p><p>The sample size was estimated from Algorithme&#x02019;s in-house data on intra-subject coefficients of variation (ISCVs) for AUC (area under the plasma concentration curve) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>.

The intensity of AEs ranged from mild to severe, and one AE (dizziness) had no assigned degree of severity. Five severe AEs (fatigue, headache, somnolence [two occurrences] following test, and somnolence following reference) were observed during the study. None of the AEs judged to be related to the investigational products were unexpected. No serious AEs or deaths were reported during this study.

The absorption is rapid (peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5&#x000a0;h) after oral administration and exposure to single (25&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mg/day) or multiple dosages (75&#x02013;900&#x000a0;mg/day) is dose proportional and oral bioavailability is high (&#x02265;90&#x000a0;%) and independent of dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Pregabalin is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class I compound (highly permeable and highly soluble) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, pregabalin does not have a narrow therapeutic index and the formulations were not modified release. Taking these in consideration, the concept of biowaiver based on BCS should be considered as a surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A generic medicinal product is considered bioequivalent to a reference medicinal product when the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval around the estimated ratio of geometric means (GMR) of AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> is between 0.80 and 1.25. As per regulatory and scientific requirements, when a generic medicinal product and a reference medicinal product are compared, a single-dose crossover design is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The treatment periods should be separated by a washout period of at least 5 elimination half-lives in order to guarantee that the drug concentrations are below the lower limit of bioanalytical quantification (LOQ) in all subjects at the beginning of each period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 7&#x000a0;days to ensure that no carry-over effect is observed, corresponding to more than 10 times the expected half-life of the measured moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The means of the individual ratio of AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> over AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;)</sub> (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub>/AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;)</sub>) were 97.64 and 97.69&#x000a0;%, respectively, for the test drug product and reference drug product. This implies that the blood sampling schedule was defined adequately to characterize at least 80&#x000a0;% of the area under the curve for both products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Other authors conducted bioequivalence studies of pregabalin with different washout periods and blood sampling schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The intra-subject variability reflects the residual variability observed in the pharmacokinetic metrics after accounting for possible differences between sequence, period, and formulation effects as well as accounting for between-subject variations.
