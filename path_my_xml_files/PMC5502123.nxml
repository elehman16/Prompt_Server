They jointly comprise 5% to 6% of all malignant tumors and are the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The 2016 revision of the classification of lymphomas by the World Health Organization divides HL into two groups: nodular lymphocyte predominant HL and classic HL with nodular sclerosis, lymphocyte-rich classic, mixed cellularity classic, and lymphocyte-depleted classic HL. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into two categories: precursor lymphoid neoplasms and mature cell neoplasms.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The most frequent subtypes of NHL are diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) comprising 30% and 22%, respectively.

Most of the discordances were in patients with PR (n = 13 [14.3%]), which were confirmed as CRs, and sensitivity and specificity were low. The most frequent reason for the overestimation of response was the detection of residual lymphadenopathy of pathological size lacking malignant infiltration (n = 8). Regarding the extranodal lesions, the most frequent reason for incorrectly detecting lymphomatous infiltration in the lung was the detection of nonspecific inflammation. One patient had lung infarction diagnosed with CT angiography as a pulmonary embolism. Another discrepancy was due to discovery of a tonsillar mass with cervical lymphadenopathy initially interpreted as disease progression, finally determined to be a primary squamous carcinoma of the tonsil with complete lymphoma remission.

Our findings confirm that both imaging tests provide accurate staging. It is important to note that, similar to the findings of Fuertes et al,<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> the percentage of correct staging reached 89.5% with CT and 97.8% with FDG PET/ceCT. The difference between both tests was not significant, but because of sample size limitations [(1 &#x02212; &#x003b2;) was 0.73], no firm conclusion can be recommended regarding initial imaging for the 3 lymphoma types considered here. On the other hand, FDG PET/ceCT was clearly superior to ceCT64 for EOT evaluation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with (1 &#x02212; &#x003b2;) = 0.85.</p><p>Sixty-four-slice multi-detector row CT correctly identified all patients with stage III lymphoma. One patient classified as stage IV because of suspected bone and bone marrow infiltration was determined to be a false-positive finding, with no lymphomatous infiltration. One patient with central nervous system involvement was classified as stage IV, although it would now be classified as stage IE, as at the time of participant recruitment the new Ann Arbor (Lugano 2014) classification had not been published yet.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Six patients with confirmed stage IV were incorrectly downstaged. Downstaging was most frequently due to insensitivity of CT for the detection of bone marrow infiltration. Our CT results have improved with respect to previous studies,<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> although we confirm what has been described in the literature regarding the limitations of CT in the detection of bone marrow infiltration.</p><p>Prospective studies comparing PET/CT versus CT, including the one published previously by our group that compared the diagnostic accuracy of 2 PET/CT options with both PET and CT in the initial staging of HL and NHL,<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> concurred with our results indicating the limitation of CT due to false-negative findings. However, previous studies did not indicate the numbers of CT detectors,<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> except that our previous study was done with a 4-detector row CT.</p><p>Staging accuracy with PET/ceCT was excellent, with a higher proportion of patients correctly staged in locations with extranodal disease and bone marrow infiltration where CT was less accurate.</p><p>FDG PET/ceCT correctly staged all of the patients with stages I, III, and IV.</p><p>Our results coincide with the published literature regarding the superiority of FDG PET/ceCT compared with CT in the detection of extranodal disease. It is reasonable that bone marrow biopsy can be excluded from the diagnostic workup when FDG PET/ceCT demonstrates focal marrow disease.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Other studies report a low sensitivity with a high specificity of FDG PET/CT in the detection of bone marrow involvement.<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>A recent study in 87 patients with DLBCL demonstrated that most cervical lymph nodes with FDG uptake that appeared after treatment were ultimately benign. However, FDG uptake appeared earlier in the malignant group.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Our results agree with previously reports<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> except in the initial staging of HL, DLBCL, and FL, where we noted no significant differences between ceCT64 and FDG PET/ceCT. Thus, although perhaps not as effective as FDG PET/ceCT, ceCT64 can be used for initial staging of lymphoma.</p><p>The results of our study are excellent for FDG PET/ceCT compared with ceCT64, particularly at EOT. Sixty-four-slice multi&#x02013;detector row CT overestimated residual lymphadenopathy in the absence of malignancy (n = 8). Nonspecific pulmonary inflammation was a frequent confound. One patient developed a new pulmonary opacity associated with a lung infarction confirmed by CT angiography. Another discrepancy was due to the appearance of a tonsillar mass with cervical lymphadenopathy interpreted as disease progression, but biopsy confirmed a primary squamous carcinoma of the tonsil with a complete remission of the lymphoma.</p><p>All HL patients who had been assigned to the ceCT branch (n = 37) and FDG PET/ceCT (n = 35) were evaluated at the EOT with CT and also with FDG PET PET/ceCT. Concordance with the reference standard was perfect.

However, FDG PET/ceCT provides the most accurate results in the evaluation at EOT, especially in HL.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>Study limitations include modest sample size that was underpowered to confirm differences in initial staging and imperfection of the criterion or reference standard based on all available clinical data rather than histology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our study demonstrates that both ceCT64 and FDG PET/ceCT provide accurate initial staging when compared with the reference standard.
