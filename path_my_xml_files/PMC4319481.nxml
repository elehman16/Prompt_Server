The randomization ratio was 8:3 for vaccine to placebo, with equal allocation between 3 age strata (6&#x02013;35 months, 3&#x02013;8 years, and 9&#x02013;17 years). Immunogenicity against the vaccine strain was assessed 21 days after the first and second vaccine doses for all vaccinees, at day 182 for half, and at day 385 for the remaining half.

Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to complications associated with novel influenza viruses. In a study including 193 children (age, &#x0003c;18 years) with confirmed H5N1 infection from 13 countries, the case-fatality rate was 48.7% [<xref rid="JIU548C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, during the 2009 pandemic of swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) rates of infection with influenza virus and associated hospitalizations among children (age, &#x0003c;18 years) were higher than those among elderly individuals (age, &#x02265;65 years) [<xref rid="JIU548C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIU548C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The pandemic potential of novel influenza viruses should not be underestimated, and the continued development of vaccines against avian-origin H5N1 influenza viruses remains a public health priority.</p><p>There are 2 H5N1 vaccines currently licensed in the United States, manufactured by Sanofi-Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, and various H5N1 vaccines are licensed in Europe [<xref rid="JIU548C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIU548C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

The study was conducted in the United States, Canada, and Thailand. Healthy children aged 6 months through 17 years at the time of first vaccination were included. Exclusion criteria included previous receipt of H5N1 vaccine; receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine within 14 days (inactivated vaccine) or 30 days (live vaccine); receipt of any vaccine not foreseen by the protocol up to 42 days from baseline; receipt of any investigational or nonregistered product from 30 days before to 42 days after study vaccination; any significant acute or chronic uncontrolled illness; temperature of &#x02265;38&#x000b0;C (&#x02265;100.4&#x000b0;F) at baseline assessment; cancer diagnosis within previous 3 years; immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions; receipt of glucocorticoids within 1 month of the start of and throughout the study; receipt of cytotoxic, immunosuppressive drugs within 6 months of the start of and throughout the study; receipt of immunoglobulins within 3 months of the start of and throughout the study; and history of allergy to influenza vaccine.</p><p>All protocols and study documents were approved by independent/local ethics committees in accordance with good clinical practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory requirements.

The antigen component and the adjuvant were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, resulting in a final volume of 0.25 mL per dose. The placebo was 0.25 mL of saline.</p><p>Randomization was performed using a blocking scheme, and treatment allocation at study sites was done using an Internet-based system. Children were randomized at a ratio of 8 to 3 to receive H5N1 vaccine or placebo, respectively, with equal allocation between 3 age strata (6&#x02013;35 months, 3&#x02013;8 years, and 9&#x02013;17 years).</p><p>Vaccine or placebo injections were administered in the nondominant (dose 1) and dominant arm (dose 2) 21 days apart.

HI antibody parameters were geometric mean titer (GMT), seroprotection rate (SPR; defined as the percentage of children with HI titers of &#x02265;1:40 following vaccination), seroconversion rate (SCR; defined as the percentage of children achieving an increase in HI titers from &#x0003c;1:10 to &#x02265;1:40 or at least a 4-fold postvaccination increase in HI titer from a prevaccination titer of &#x02265;1:10), and mean geometric increase (MGI; defined as the geometric mean of the ratio of postvaccination to prevaccination reciprocal HI titers).

The 50% neutralization titer of serum was calculated by use of the method of Reed and Muench [<xref rid="JIU548C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The assay cutoff titer was 1:28. A nAb response was defined as a minimum 4-fold increase from the prevaccination reciprocal titer (titers of &#x0003c;28 were assigned a value of 14); the vaccine response rate was the percentage of subjects making a response. Assessment of nAbs was a secondary objective performed on randomly selected subsets of 40 subjects for each age stratum in the study vaccine group and 10 subjects per age stratum in the placebo group for homologous and drift variant assays. The same subjects were to be analyzed for homologous and heterologous strains at day 0 and day 42. Separate subsets of the same numbers of subjects per group were evaluated at day 182 and day 385.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Reactogenicity and Safety Assessments</title><p>Solicited local symptoms (ie, those at the injection site) and general symptoms were assessed during the 7-day postvaccination period after each dose of H5N1 vaccine or placebo.

General symptoms were drowsiness, irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite, and fever, for children aged &#x0003c;6 years; and fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, shivering, and sweating, for children aged &#x02265;6 years.

The study evaluated which formulation provided the best balance of immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety. It showed that, in children aged 3&#x02013;5 years and those aged 6&#x02013;9 years, HI responses against the vaccine-homologous strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) fulfilled CBER licensure criteria with all 3 formulations, whereas local events in the half-dose formulation tended to be lower than those in the other formulations [<xref rid="JIU548C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our study, we evaluated 2 doses of vaccine that contained 1.9 &#x000b5;g of H5N1 HA adjuvanted with AS03<sub>B</sub> but were made using a different production process and strain, A/Indonesia/5/2005, to expand the clinical experience with this type of vaccine in children as young as 6 months and as old as 17 years.</p><p>We observed robust HI antibody responses after 2 doses of vaccine containing 1.9 &#x000b5;g of H5N1 HA adjuvanted with AS03<sub>B</sub>, thus confirming the antigen-sparing potential of the vaccine.

Interestingly, a modest age-dependent decrease in GMT was observed, with lower responses with increasing age. The unexpected strength of the immune response in the youngest children suggests that those with the least previous exposure to influenza A virus are able to mount the greatest HI antibody response to the adjuvanted vaccine. Following H5N1 influenza vaccination, low postvaccination antibody titers have been reported in subjects who had previously received seasonal influenza vaccination, compared with those who had not [<xref rid="JIU548C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU548C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Also, it has been hypothesized that previous vaccination with a nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine might lead to the shifting of the T-cell and/or B-cell repertoires toward epitopes specific for the antecedent vaccine, thus affecting the ability of immune system to evoke an immune response against subsequent vaccination and resulting in lower HI titers [<xref rid="JIU548C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>HI antibodies persisted for 1 year after vaccination in the vast majority of children, although some age-related differences in persistence were observed.

No cases of narcolepsy were recorded in this study, which was not designed to detect rare events such as narcolepsy.</p><p>To conclude, the potential threat posed by avian-origin H5N1 influenza viruses should not be underestimated, and the development of vaccines suitable for use in vulnerable groups such as children is a public health priority. In this study, we showed that 2 doses of vaccine containing 1.9 &#x000b5;g of H5N1 HA adjuvanted with AS03<sub>B</sub> provided robust immune responses in children aged 6 months to 17 years, with &#x0003e;94.6% remaining seropositive for vaccine-homologous nAb for at least 1 year. AS03<sub>B</sub>-H5N1 vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but overall no major safety concerns were identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu548/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
