The importance of treating not only hyperglycemia, but also the associated comorbidities, is recognized as necessary to reduce the risk of complications, particularly cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Lifestyle modification can improve glycemic control as well as body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles; however, behavioral modifications are inherently difficult, and most patients eventually require multiple medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although several classes of antihyperglycemic medications are currently indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, most of them do not improve the comorbidities and several are associated with weight gain.</p><p>Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes through multiple mechanisms of action: increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion, attenuated postprandial glucagon secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and increased satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The twice-daily formulation of exenatide (exenatide BID) improves both fasting and postprandial glucose control, resulting in A1C reductions of roughly 0.8&#x02013;1.0% in placebo-controlled trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and 1.0&#x02013;1.4% in open-label trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These improvements in glucose control were maintained in patients completing 3 years of treatment (&#x02212;1.0%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Exenatide therapy is also associated with weight loss and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure and serum lipid profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, the glucose-dependent mechanisms of action of exenatide minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. GLP-1R agonists have recently been added to the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus algorithm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an option after the addition of metformin in patients in whom body weight and hypoglycemia risk are concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Exenatide BID is administered within the 60-min period before the morning and evening meals and primarily exerts its pharmacodynamic effects on glucose concentrations during the postprandial period. A long-acting once-weekly formulation of exenatide (exenatide QW) has been developed. Weekly administration of 2 mg exenatide QW results in therapeutic plasma exenatide concentrations within 2 weeks and steady-state plasma exenatide concentrations within the therapeutic target range 6&#x02013;7 weeks after initiation of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in A1C, Weight and Other Factors Through Intervention with Exenatide Once Weekly (DURATION-1) trial was designed as a two-stage protocol. We previously reported the first stage, a randomized open-label comparison of exenatide QW to exenatide BID in patients with type 2 diabetes over 30 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Both therapies improved glycemic control, and the improvement in A1C observed with exenatide QW treatment was significantly greater than that observed with exenatide BID (&#x02212;1.9 vs. &#x02212;1.5%, respectively). Similar improvements in body weight, blood pressure, and fasting lipids were demonstrated with both forms of exenatide therapy. We now describe 52-week results from the second phase of the DURATION-1 trial which examined the safety and efficacy of <italic>1</italic>) switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW after 30 weeks of treatment and <italic>2</italic>) continuing exenatide QW treatment for an additional 22 weeks (52 weeks total).</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Randomization and interventions</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of two open-label treatment groups: weekly subcutaneous injections of 2 mg exenatide QW or 5 &#x003bc;g exenatide BID for the first 28 days followed by a required dose increase to 10 &#x003bc;g BID for the remainder of the 30-week assessment period. The inclusion and exclusion criteria and results from the initial 30 weeks have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). At 30 weeks, participants entered a second, open-ended treatment period in which all patients received exenatide QW. Patients who switched from exenatide BID to exenatide QW treatment and were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea (SFU) were required to reduce their SFU dose to the minimum recommended dose until week 40. Subsequently, the SFU dose was up-titrated based on daily glucose measurements to reach a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of &#x02264;110 mg/dl. Patients originally randomly assigned to exenatide QW maintained their treatment regimen.</p><p>A common clinical protocol was approved for each site by the appropriate institutional review board. Patients provided written informed consent before participation. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki, including all amendments through the South Africa revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>For this second phase of the study, glucose control during the transition from exenatide BID to exenatide QW was examined, as well as the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 52 weeks of exenatide QW treatment. Plasma analytes and A1C were quantitated by Quintiles Laboratories (Smyrna, GA) using standard methods. A1C was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma antibodies to exenatide were measured by Millipore Corporation Drug Discovery (St. Charles, MO) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Titers of antibodies to exenatide were determined by serial 1:5 dilutions after an initial dilution of 1:25 (also expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sample serum that tests positive in the assay). Blood pressure was measured after &#x0223c;5 min of quiet rest in a sitting position, repeated after at least 30 s, and the two measurements were averaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all randomly assigned patients who received at least one injection of exenatide in the previously reported phase of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The 52-week evaluable population consisted of ITT patients who completed the study visits to at least week 48 in compliance with the protocol. Descriptive statistics on demographics, analysis of primary glycemic end points, body weight, and fasting lipid concentrations are provided for the 52-week evaluable population. All safety analyses, including blood pressure measurements, are provided for the ITT population. The analyses of A1C were based on a general linear model (ANOVA) including original treatment assignment, baseline A1C stratum, and concomitant SFU use at screening. Baseline FPG, body weight, and blood pressure were added in the model (ANCOVA) for FPG, body weight, and blood pressure, respectively. Data for these efficacy end points are expressed as least squares means. There were no substantial differences in A1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>) or other measures (data not shown) when the evaluable population, the 52-week ITT population, or those who participated after 30 weeks were examined. Therefore, only data for the evaluable population were reported. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as those occurring during or after the first injection of exenatide QW in the open-ended assessment period. Treatment-emergent adverse events during the initial 30 weeks of the trial were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Hypoglycemia was categorized as major if the event <italic>1</italic>) in the judgment of the investigator or physician, resulted in a loss of consciousness, seizure, or coma and resolved after administration of glucagon or glucose or <italic>2</italic>) required third-party assistance to resolve and the subject had a glucose value of &#x0003c;54 mg/dl. Minor hypoglycemia was defined as a report of symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia and a glucose value of &#x0003c;54 mg/dl before treatment of the episode.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 295 ITT patients, 258 patients (87%) continued into the second phase of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Nausea was predominantly mild in intensity. No severe nausea was reported. Twenty-one patients (8%; <italic>n</italic> = 4 for exenatide QW-only and <italic>n</italic> = 17 exenatide BID&#x02192;exenatide QW) reported injection-site related adverse events including bruising, erythema, hemorrhage, induration, pain, and pruritus. Mild to moderate injection site pruritus was observed after switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW in six patients (five of these patients did not experience pruritus during the initial 30-week assessment). No injection site&#x02013;related adverse events led to withdrawal. There were no episodes of major hypoglycemia; the incidence of minor hypoglycemia was low and was limited to patients using a concomitant SFU during weeks 30&#x02013;52 (9% of patients receiving an SFU) (supplementary Table 1, available in an online appendix). Antibodies to exenatide titer peaked at week 6 for both treatment groups (geometric mean &#x000b1; SE 33.2 &#x000b1; 8.2 and 12.6 &#x000b1; 3.4 for exenatide QW-only and exenatide BID&#x02192;exenatide QW groups, respectively).

Antibodies to exenatide were not predictive of individual A1C change or incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. One patient withdrew because of an adverse event (worsening of type 2 diabetes) during the 22-week assessment period (exenatide QW-only group).

Patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW exhibited further improvements in glycemic control. Similar improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and cardiovascular risk factors were observed at week 52 regardless of initial randomized treatment. Although the absence of a comparator arm is a limitation of this study and the open-label trial design inherently offers the potential for bias and can affect patient expectations, the results of this study demonstrated reductions in A1C and body weight comparable to those in a previously reported double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exenatide QW at the same dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and were consistent with continuous exenatide exposure. These improvements were greater than those previously observed with exenatide BID in both placebo-controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and open-label comparator trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). It is important to note that improvements in A1C were observed across the spectrum of baseline A1C values and weight loss categories. Treatment with exenatide QW was generally well tolerated and treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate. As in the initial 30-week phase, the only incidences of mild to moderate hypoglycemia occurred in patients concomitantly receiving an SFU.</p><p>It is noteworthy that patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW experienced a transient elevation in FPG, which generally improved within 2 weeks after initiation of QW therapy. This transient rise in FPG can be largely attributed to the time required for plasma exenatide levels to reach the therapeutic range after initiation of exenatide QW and was of a magnitude (&#x0223c;15 mg/dl) that is unlikely to be associated with symptoms or harm over a short period of time. In addition, subjects who switched treatment and were using a concomitant SFU were required to reduce their SFU dose to the minimum recommended dose for initiation of exenatide QW treatment. Therefore, the transient rise in FPG concentration may also reflect SFU dose adjustments. It is important to note that the highest point in the transient FPG rise represented a mean decrease of &#x02212;16 mg/dl from baseline. There was no clinically significant effect on overall glycemic control after the switch to exenatide QW (mean rise in mean A1C was &#x0223c;+0.1%). A1C values subsequently declined below those observed with 30 weeks of exenatide BID treatment and by week 44 matched those observed with continuous exenatide QW treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that switching from exenatide BID to QW, although associated with a transient increase in glycemia, ultimately leads to significantly improved glycemic control.</p><p>Achieving glycemic targets remains an elusive goal for many patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, improving weight and cardiovascular risk markers and avoiding hypoglycemia are desired components of a diabetes treatment program. GLP-1R agonists were recently recommended as second-step treatment option in patients in whom avoidance of hypoglycemia or promotion of weight loss is a major concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the present study, the transition from exenatide BID to exenatide QW was made without additional safety and tolerability concerns. Furthermore, the clinical benefits of exenatide QW were maintained and resulted in a mean A1C of 6.6% after 52 weeks of treatment.</p></sec>
