The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intranasal (IN) ketamine in patients with moderate to severe limb trauma (visual analog scale (VAS)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;mm).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial; 154 patients with isolated orthopedic trauma and visual analog scale (VAS) &#x02265;60&#x000a0;mm were included on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups of ketamine-IN (0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg IN ketamine and an equal volume of placebo saline intravenously (IV)) and ketamine-IV (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine IV with 0.5&#x000a0;ml saline IN) on the basis of balanced block randomization method. At 5, 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;min, patients were assessed for VAS measurement and adverse events. Repeated measure ANOVA, independent t-test and chi square test were employed. The level of statistical significance was considered to be less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean VAS in IN ketamine and IV group at minute 30 was 31.50&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.40 and 29.35&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11.73, respectively. At minute 30, 31 patients (20.39%) required a low-dose of morphine as rescue analgesia (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.427). The results showed that mean change score of VAS (difference of time 0 and time 30) in IN ketamine and IV ketamine VAS were 43.8 (95% confidence interval: 41.1&#x02013;46.5) and 46.4 (95% confidence interval: 42.8&#x02013;50.1) and there is no difference between two groups in case of score change of VAS (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.245).

The study was based on the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ministry of Health and Medical Sciences and Ethics Committee of Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran (registered clinical trial number: IRCT2015061722777N1) as patients entered the study voluntarily with complete satisfaction. The information obtained from patients were kept confidential. Moreover, no cost was imposed on patients.</p><p>This study was carried out in &#x02026;. Hospital ED, &#x02026; in Vali-asr Hospital , Arak, Iran, &#x02026;; a teaching general hospital with 600 visits per day in ED. Including criteria were 16&#x02013;60 year old individuals with isolated limb trauma and pain severity (visual analog scale (VAS)) over 60&#x000a0;mm and exclusion criteria were as follows: lack of patient's consent to participate in the study and having a history of diseases, such as migraines, cardiac ischemia, head trauma with loss of consciousness, unstable vital signs, blood pressure over 180/100, schizophrenia, pregnancy, deformity, or nasal injury preventing administration of nasal medication, inability to express their pain for any cause during the study, a history of sensitivity to opioids and ketamine, taking strong painkillers such as tramadol, methadone, and opiates in the past 4&#x000a0;h, history of addiction and other trauma and instability of vital signs. Patients were not discharged in case of sedation and anesthesia until full consciousness.</p><p>The sample size was estimated at 70 patients in each group with respect to an alpha error of 5% and power of 90% with mean (and standard deviation) VAS in two groups of intravenous and subcutaneous ketamine at 1 (0.3), and 1.3 (0.7), respectively, using Stata statistical software and considering the probability of 10% lost to follow-up, 77 patients were considered in each group, resulting in a total of 154 patients.</p><p>Each patient was visited by a study investigator for acquisition of written informed consent and determined to meet study including criteria. After completing the questionnaire, including patients' demographic information and obtaining informed consent, in order to maintain a balance between the number of patients among groups, patients were divided into two groups of IN (A) and IV (B) based on balanced block randomization method by research supervisor. Four blocks were used, to conceal the process of patients' group allocation from the researcher and to balance the groups during the study. To achieve this, blocks (AABB, ABAB, ABBA, BBAA, BABA, and BAAB) were randomly selected and allocation pattern of patients was based on that block. The blocks were used as follows: for each 4 patients, one block was selected and nasal and intravenous drugs were given accordingly and to conceal the type of medications prescribed for patients, for the other four patients, another block was selected randomly and this technique continued until the sample size was completed.</p><p>The pain severity was assessed by the second physician who was unaware of the grouping and the type of prescribed medication (using a VAS measure) at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;min(s) and the data were recorded. A third person administered 0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg IN ketamine (50&#x000a0;mg/ml) to group A, sprayed equally by atomizer in each nostril, and simultaneously an equal volume of placebo saline was slowly injected IV. Group B received slow IV injection of 0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine (50&#x000a0;mg/ml) with 0.5&#x000a0;ml diluted in saline, while the same volume of 0.5&#x000a0;ml saline was equally sprayed in both nostrils. Drugs in group A were labeled with N<sub>A</sub> and V<sub>A</sub>, for IV and IN drugs; and drugs in group B were labeled with V<sub>B</sub> and N<sub>B</sub>, respectively, which was calculated by the supervisory assistance research for each patient based on weight and were labeled and given to nurses that were blinded to the study. At 5, 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;min, patients were assessed for adverse events such as dizziness, dysphoria, nausea, etc. Patients with reduced VAS scale in T10 less than 13&#x000a0;mm (based the primary VAS) were excluded from the study and received routine morphine dose combined with routine monitoring. If the patient's pain level decreased significantly (at least 13&#x000a0;mm based primary VAS), but have not attained the minimal clinically significant change noticeable by patients (30&#x000a0;mm),<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> half of the initial dose was given with placebo according to their group category (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg IN and 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg IV). In T20, if the decreasing pain based on initial pain score and patients' satisfaction was not at an acceptable level, half the initial dose (up to 0.8&#x000a0;mg/kg IN totally dose) for group A and a maximum total IV dose of 0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg was given IV for group B. All cases requiring the second and third doses were calculated by the supervisory assistance with labels A and B and given to the nurse; by the end of the study (T30) in the absence of acceptable pain relief with a maximum dose of IV or IN, 0.05&#x000a0;mg/kg dosage of IV morphine (rescue analgesic drug) combined with routine monitoring labeled V<sub>m</sub> was given and the data was recorded.</p><p>The exact primary outcomes focused on pain reduction at 30&#x000a0;min; while secondary outcomes include assessment of adverse events e.g. nausea, vomiting, dizziness etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was done in a blinded manner and the approach of analysis was not intention to treat analysis.

The limitations of the present study necessitate future high-quality trials on adults in different clinical conditions with a bigger sample size.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conflict of
