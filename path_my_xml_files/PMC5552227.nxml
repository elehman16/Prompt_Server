In that study, 98.5% of <italic>Shigella</italic> deaths occurred in low and middle income countries and 33% in children younger than 5&#x000a0;years old. These data agree with data from more geographically limited studies: the estimated incidence of disease in Asia alone is approximately 125 million cases per year (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Bardhan et al., 2010</xref>), with approximately 122,000 annual deaths (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Lozano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These estimates are supplemented with incidence data from specific sites of the Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS) in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>) that found that shigellosis is one of the top causes of moderate and severe diarrhoea (MSD) in under 5&#x000a0;year olds. <italic>Shigella</italic> was the fourth, second and first cause of medium or severe diarrhoea (MSD), in children aged 0&#x02013;11&#x000a0;months, 12&#x02013;23&#x000a0;months and 24&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months, respectively (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>).

Antibiotic resistant strains of <italic>S. sonnei</italic> also cause disease and local outbreaks in people who have not travelled to endemic countries (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a <italic>S. sonnei</italic> monovalent vaccine may also have public health value.</p><p>No vaccine is widely available to prevent shigellosis (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Mani et al., 2016</xref>). So far, vaccine candidates based on O Antigen (OAg) conjugates and live attenuated strains have shown protection against homologous strains in Phase 3 clinical studies (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kaminski and Oaks, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Passwell et al., 2010</xref>). Vaccines using inactivated bacteria and vaccine candidates based on sub-cellular components are currently under development. Most of these also contain OAg (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kaminski and Oaks, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The central role of the serotype specific OAg repeating unit of <italic>Shigella</italic> LPS in clinical protection has been demonstrated in various settings. More specifically, i) subjects naturally exposed to <italic>Shigella</italic> develop a serotype-specific immunity, but remain susceptible to disease caused by heterologous serotypes (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Ferreccio et al., 1991</xref>); ii) subjects previously infected/challenged with either <italic>S. sonnei</italic> or <italic>S. flexneri</italic> develop protection only against the challenge strain as shown with re-challenge experiments (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kotloff et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Herrington et al., 1990</xref>); iii) subjects lacking homologous anti-LPS antibodies have a significantly higher risk of contracting shigellosis of the same serovar type (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1991</xref>); iv) subjects with a high level of anti-LPS serum antibodies show significantly reduced disease severity (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Wahid et al., 2013</xref>); and v) subjects vaccinated IM with a conjugate vaccine containing <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> O polysaccharide bound to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> recombinant exoprotein A develop a serotype specific 71&#x02013;74% efficacy in older children and adults and show a significant association between anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS serum antibody and clinical protection (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Passwell et al., 2010</xref>). These findings demonstrate that natural immunity against <italic>Shigella</italic> is primarily serotype-specific; the OAg of the <italic>Shigella</italic> LPS is the dominant protective antigen and anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS antibody is a strong marker of acquired immunity.</p><p>The vaccine development approach pursued by the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) is based on Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA). GMMA are approximately 50&#x000a0;nm outer membrane blebs derived from bacteria genetically modified to enhance shedding and to reduce reactogenicity of the integral lypopolisaccharide. Unlike detergent extracted OMV, these contain all of the components of the bacterial outer membrane and enclose bacterial periplasm (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Maggiore et al., 2016</xref>). GVGH has developed a monovalent <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> vaccine with OAg (1790GAHB) as the first step in the development of a broadly protective, multivalent vaccine including GMMA with OAg from different <italic>Shigella</italic> serotypes. In this paper, we report the results from two parallel Phase 1 clinical studies performed in healthy adult volunteers in Europe with 1790GAHB vaccine. In absence of an accepted serologic threshold of protection for <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>, we compare the vaccine-induced anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS antibody with the levels and distribution in Israeli convalescent subjects after natural infection (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>Between February 2014, and April 2015, we performed two parallel, phase 1, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation studies: study 1 (H03_01TP) at one site in France and study 2 (H03_02TP) at one site in the United Kingdom. The dose escalation approach reflected the caution needed in Phase 1 studies for the safety evaluation of a novel vaccine. The two studies are registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0020">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02017899" id="ir0025">NCT02017899</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02034500" id="ir0030">NCT02034500</ext-link>. We enrolled healthy adults (aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years old), as established by medical history, physical examination, screening for relevant haematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis tests, investigator judgment, and compliance with protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. A qualitative agglutination test was performed by investigators at baseline as part of the screening to exclude subjects with high antibody titres against <italic>S. sonnei</italic>. Eligible women had negative results on pregnancy tests, before each vaccination, and agreed using an acceptable birth control measure during study participation. Relevant approvals were obtained before study start from respective institutional ethics review committees and national regulatory authorities. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) was appointed to oversee safety of study participants. During studies, DSMB met after safety data from each cohort became available, to assess the safety profile of study vaccine and advise on progression to subsequent cohorts. Written informed consent was obtained before enrolment. Studies were designed and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and current version of Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Vaccine</title><p>Details of the production of the vaccine, and pre-clinical studies have been published (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the test vaccine was a preservative-free, liquid formulation of <italic>S. sonnei</italic> 1790-GMMA containing 11.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL of OAg and 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL protein adsorbed to 0.7&#x000a0;mg Al<sup>3&#x000a0;+</sup>/mL Aluminium hydroxide (Alhydrogel 2%, Brenntag Biosector, Denmark) in Tris-buffered saline, pH&#x000a0;7.4 (TBS) in single dose vials containing 0.7&#x000a0;mL of vaccine. The vaccine was used at different antigen doses (that were obtained by bed-side mixing using placebo as diluent). For a more precise information about vaccine composition, each dose is defined by both OAg and protein quantity: a dose containing 5.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of OAg and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g protein is specified as 5.9/100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. The clinical lot (SH-13-002) was the same for both studies. In the absence of a licensed <italic>S. sonnei</italic> vaccine, the control agent was a placebo of Alhydrogel (0.7&#x000a0;mg Al<sup>3&#x000a0;+</sup>/mL) in TBS, as single dose vials containing 0.7&#x000a0;mL of injectable solution.

For ELISA testing, the minimum measurable antibody level was determined in each assay and varied from 3.08 to 4.06 ELISA units. For calculating geometric mean antibody levels, subjects below this level were assigned an antibody level of half the minimum measurable ELISA units. Subjects defined as positive for pre-existing antibody had a baseline anti-LPS IgG greater than the minimum measurable ELISA units. We defined &#x0201c;seroresponders&#x0201d; as individuals with a change of antibody concentration of at least 25 ELISA units or a 50% increase in antibody over baseline levels, whichever was greater. As a guide to the relevance of the magnitude of the IgG responses, the median anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS serum IgG concentration was compared to the median level in convalescent patient sera from 87 subjects previously infected with <italic>S. sonnei</italic>, as reported by <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al.

All but one of the remaining 8 subjects developed detectable antibody after the second vaccination, but two of these (and the non-responder) did not meet the criterion for seroresponse. At the higher doses, most subjects developed maximum antibody after the first vaccination. On average, there was a 47% decrease (median 56%) in antibody levels from day 85 to the last sample at day 225, although this was variable (range: 11% increase to a 100% decrease). Median antibody responses for all high dose subjects peaked at 151&#x000a0;units, thus higher that the reference 121&#x000a0;units in convalescent sera, while peak median antibody in the lower dose groups was 26&#x000a0;units.</p><p>For subjects with detectable antibody at baseline (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B), all subjects, regardless of dose, had an increase in measured antibody response following the first vaccination, including all of the subjects receiving the two lowest doses.

Antibody decayed more slowly from day 85 to day 225 (average 19%, median 30% with a range from a 60% decrease to a 43% increase) than in the group with no detectable antibody at baseline.

In these studies, we saw a correlation between dose and local reactions, but even at the highest dose of 5.9/100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g the vaccine had an acceptable reactogenicity profile, which was less than that reported for the licensed, Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) containing vaccine, 4CMenB (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Toneatto et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, as 1790GAHB comprises the outer membrane of <italic>Shigella</italic>, it contains appreciable levels of lipid A, which in the 1790-GMMA producing strain is genetically modified to be penta-acylated (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2015</xref>) (320&#x000a0;nmoles of lipid A per 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein, data not shown) and other potential activators of innate immune responses (e.g. lipidated proteins). In pre-clinical studies, rabbits receiving 5.9/100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g IM had an average temperature increase of 0.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C compared to controls at 4&#x000a0;h after injection (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2015</xref>). In the clinical studies we saw no consistent temperature change as a function of dose and no significant pyrogenic response over the 4&#x000a0;hour post vaccination. As the ratio of lipid A to protein is relatively constant and the structure of the outer membrane is similar in GMMA from related organisms (e.g. from other <italic>Shigella</italic> species), doses of up to at least 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein are likely to be acceptable even though the OAg content may vary considerably, depending on the average size of the OAg in each GMMA.</p><p>These studies compared three routes of immunization (IN, ID and IM), which have different theoretical advantages: IN provides a needle free vaccination route and may elicit stronger mucosal immunity (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Zaman et al., 2013</xref>), ID may provide dose sparing (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Zehrung et al., 2013</xref>) and IM may provide strong systemic immunity and, as the standard vaccination route, may be easier to introduce into routine public health vaccination programs. All three routes gave strong IgG responses in rabbits when tested at the maximum human dose (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gerke et al., 2015</xref>), with the ID route giving significantly higher antibody responses than IM, and the IN route lower peak responses than the IM. These preclinical data contrast with the clinical results, which show no detectable immune responses in most human subjects vaccinated via the ID or IN routes, even at the maximum doses tested. Therefore, data suggest that ID vaccination is unlikely to be a useful route for GMMA adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide.</p><p>Alternatively, IN results seem to be consistent with human IN vaccination studies of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> 2a LPS adsorbed onto detergent extracted <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> OMV where no or minimal circulating antibody was detected after two doses of 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of LPS, but significant IgG and serum IgA was measured following 360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of LPS (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fries et al., 2001</xref>). While these subjects were given a different formulation, and a different serotype of <italic>Shigella</italic>, measured in a different way (&#x003bc;g of total LPS vs &#x003bc;g of OAg), never-the-less, these data suggest that the maximum IN dose in our study of 4.8/80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g is too low to definitively rule out the use of IN route with substantially larger doses. They also suggest that immunogenicity responses in rabbits are not predictive of human results.</p><p>There is an interest in <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccines that induce strong mucosal immunity (i.e. sIgA responses) (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Mani et al., 2016</xref>). Our limited results, from subjects immunized with 1790GAHB in cohort 3 of trial 2, did not show any significant IgA response at the tested doses (i.e., 0.59/10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g ID, 4.8/80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g IN and 0.29/5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g IM). We acknowledge that these results do not preclude the possibility that the use of an adjuvant, like double mutant LT, might induce a more robust mucosal response using the ID or IN routes. However, the key pathogenic step in shigellosis is the invasion of gut epithelial cells from the basal surface by bacteria that have crossed into the systemic circulation via M cells (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Zychlinsky et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, although sIgA may play a role in reducing the bacterial inoculum, IgG is likely to play a key role in preventing disease. This central role for systemic IgG is consistent with the demonstrated field efficacy of an IM conjugate vaccine (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>) and the correlation between natural induced anti-OAg IgG levels and subsequent risk of infection (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1991</xref>). Patients recovering from infection with <italic>Shigella</italic> have strain specific immunity against subsequent infection (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1989</xref>). As strain specificity is determined by the anti-OAg response, we postulate that magnitude of anti-IgG OAg responses in convalescent patients is an indicator of the relevance of the IgG responses elicited in the studies with 1790GAHB. Importantly, in the study 1, subjects receiving &#x02265;&#x000a0;1.5/25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose IM had a reverse cumulative antibody distribution similar to that of convalescent patients, but with a higher median antibody level (305 vs 121 ELISA-units) and a relatively slow decay in antibody responses (median level of 241 at day 225, still exceeding the median level in convalescent patients).</p><p>Approximately half of the subjects in these studies had detectable anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS antibody prior to vaccination. What induced these antibodies is not known: e.g., asymptomatic or undiagnosed prior infection with <italic>S. sonnei</italic> or exposure to organisms with a related O antigen e.g. the Gram-negative <italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides</italic> serotype O17, which may cause mild waterborne gastroenteritis in humans (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Kubler-Kielb et al., 2008</xref>). As subjects with pre-existing antibody tended to have stronger responses to the vaccine and different pattern of boosting and decay kinetics, it will be important to consider the impact of pre-exposure in future trials by evaluating the response to different levels of pre-existing antibody in populations that may benefit most from a <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccine.</p><p>These data support the development of a multivalent GMMA Shigella vaccine. More importantly, the peak antibody response occurred at a dose of 1.5/25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and the maximum dose tested of 5.9/100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was well tolerated. These results not only support development of a multivalent <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccine, but also other vaccines, built around the affordable GMMA technology, with the potential to impact on major global diseases of developing countries.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><title>Supplementary Fig. 1</title><p>Median anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS IgG (EU/mL), at baseline, 1&#x000a0;month after first, second and third vaccination and at 6&#x000a0;months after third vaccination &#x02013; modified FAS vaccine group (all subjects, all groups).</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.pdf"><alt-text>Supplementary Fig. 1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0010"><caption><title>Supplementary Fig. 2</title><p>A: median anti-<italic>S. sonnei</italic> LPS IgG (EU/mL), at baseline, 1&#x000a0;month after first, second and third vaccination and at 6&#x000a0;months after third vaccination, in subjects with detectable antibodies at baseline (subjects with data at all visits).
