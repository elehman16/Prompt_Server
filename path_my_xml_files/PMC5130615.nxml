Because ELBW infants are often born to low-income parents, the cost of parking may be an important unappreciated barrier to frequent visitation in many urban centers. With ongoing changes in the organization and reimbursement of healthcare, enlightened administrators in urban hospitals might consider underwriting parking costs for families of ELBW infants if it were shown to augment infant care, bolster parent satisfaction, and/or shorten hospital stay.</p><p id="P7">To test the value of such a program, our hospital administration agreed to provide free parking to the parents of a sample of ELBW infants. We then conducted a randomized trial of free parking to fairly make it available to parents and avoid biased study results.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The primary outcome was length of stay (<bold>LOS</bold>) as a simple objective indicator of resource costs and the potential clinical benefits of more frequent visitation (e.g., increased staff attentiveness to the infant, better feeding and growth, a reduced risk of infection, and increased parental education and readiness to care for the infant at home). Secondary aims included assessing parental visitation frequency and length, infant breast milk intake, and parent teaching/knowledge, skills, and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><p id="P8">The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (<bold>UTHealth</bold>) approved this randomized trial, with all participants providing verbal consent.</p><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Participants and Procedures</title><p id="P9">The project was conducted between November 2007 and February 2011 at Memorial Hermann Hospital (Houston, TX) in our 118-bed NICU (housing 38 private rooms with beds available for parents to sleep). Eligibility criteria included birth weight &#x02264;1000 grams, age 7&#x02013;14 days, and deemed &#x0201c;likely to survive.&#x0201d; Exclusion criteria were uncertain custody status or anticipated hospital transfer. Participants who did not own a car were eligible if they reported reliable automobile access from another household member or family/friends. Infants were randomized using opaque, consecutively numbered, sealed envelopes stratified by birth weight (&#x02264;750g; &#x0003e;750g) and mechanical ventilation status (yes/no) on postnatal day seven.</p><p id="P10">The free parking (<bold>FP</bold>) group received 7 parking vouchers at a time (value: $10/each) from the hospital&#x02019;s central research coordination office, a 3-minute walk from the NICU, and continued to receive vouchers until infant discharge. Each voucher allowed free entry and exit for a 24-hour period (including reentry). The garage is a 5&#x02013;7 minute walk from the NICU and connected by an enclosed skybridge. The usual care (<bold>UC</bold>) group did not receive vouchers.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Assessments</title><p id="P11">Health data were collected from medical records, including LOS after randomization until discharge home (including days in another NICU/convalescent facility). Number of visit days, hours/visit, feeding (breastfed, expressed breastmilk, formula fed), and parent involvement in infant care (e.g., feeding, kangaroo care) were extracted from nursing notes by blinded research assistants. Parental knowledge and infant-care skills were assessed on a 100-point scale (greater scores indicated greater knowledge/skills) with a research-staff interview, during the first high-risk-infant clinic visit after discharge. For example, medication familiarity and car seat safety were assessed. A multi-area, 11-item survey assessed parental satisfaction with NICU care.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Seven items were summed (range: 7&#x02013;35) to measure &#x0201c;Support&#x0201d; (e.g., information sharing; see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table Note</xref> for specific items). Three items measured &#x0201c;Emotional Connection&#x0201d; to the infant (range: 3&#x02013;15) and one item assessed family involvement in infant care (responses: not enough, just right, too much). Greater scores indicated higher perceived support, connection, and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Data Analyses</title><p id="P12">Based on LOS data available from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (i.e., total LOS <italic>SD</italic>=24 days), a type II error rate of &#x003b2;=0.2, &#x003b1;=0.05 (two-sided), and a projected mean LOS reduction of 12 days in the parking group, the required sample size was 64 per treatment group. Adjusting for an 8.6% expected number of infant deaths after enrollment, the recruitment goal was 140.</p><p id="P13">Frequency counts were compared using chi-squared tests. Continuous variables (including our primary outcome) were assessed via a mixed effects regression model (PROC MIXED), accounting for sibling correlation, due to the enrollment of 7 sets of twins, using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). When mixed effects models failed to converge, ANOVA (PROC GLM) was used, accounting for singleton status as a covariate (where necessary). Pearson correlations were used to provide magnitudes of associations. No correction for multiple comparisons was employed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S10"><title>Results</title><p id="P14">Five infants met exclusion criteria. Patients who met inclusion criteria (N=278) were not enrolled if staff could not contact parents of infants between 7&#x02013;14 days old (n=85) or if the infant died prior to randomization (n=53). Two participants were excluded due to staff inability to determine group allocation (i.e., randomization errors). Randomized participants (N=138) were allocated to FP (n=72) and UC (n=66) groups.</p><p id="P15">Mean gestational age was 25.8 weeks and mean birth weight was 782g. Half of the infants were female (48.5%); 24.3% were White, 34.6% Black, 30.2% Hispanic, 3.7% Asian, and 7.4% identified as &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; races/ethnicities. On postnatal day seven, 46.7% of the infants were receiving mechanical ventilation. Participants (most often mothers&#x02019;) average age was 29 years, 82.5% had a high school diploma/GED, 35.5% reported an annual income &#x02264;$20,000, and 50.4% were married. No significant differences were found across group characteristics at baseline (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table</xref>).</p><p id="P16">A total of 21 infants died before discharge.

Small-to-moderate positive associations were found for breast pumping with both visitation indices, and bottle feeding, diapering, bathing, and medication provided by the parent correlated with one or both of the visitation indices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Low parental visitation to ELBW infants is a multi-faceted and complex problem, particularly for families with few financial and other resources. Indeed, free parking was not a sufficient intervention strategy to significantly increase parental visitation in a sample for which a third of households fell below the U.S. federal poverty level for a family of three.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Parents of ELBW infants will likely need greater psychosocial support, as well as other incentives, to achieve infant health and parent satisfaction gains with similarly socioeconomically disadvantaged families.</p><p id="P21">Observational studies have shown that when families are more involved in the care of their infants, the families and the infants do better.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Other work suggests establishing parental involvement early in life may have lasting effects. A small observational study from Finland reported that NICU infants visited daily had fewer behavioral and emotional problems at 7 years of age. Interestingly, visitation was a stronger determinant of outcome than gestational age, birth weight, or the medical risks of the infant.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P22">Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on increasing visitation or reducing LOS have produced encouraging results with similar NICU populations.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> For example, an RCT with preterm infants (N=260) demonstrated that a 4-session educational/behavioral intervention with parents led to a 3.8-day shorter NICU stay compared to infants in the control condition. The effect was more pronounced for a sub-sample of very-low-birth-weight infants (&#x02264;1500g), as the intervention group had a stay reduction of 8.3 days.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our free-parking approach did not demonstrate similar effects on LOS for our sample of ELBW infants.</p><p id="P23">Free parking was chosen based on anecdotal parental statements to our staff that parking costs were a major visitation deterrent. In hindsight, a more thorough assessment of the causes of infrequent visitation may have generated additional worthwhile intervention strategies. Such an assessment would likely uncover other significant time and financial costs, potentially more important to parents, such as other childcare and other transportation barriers (e.g., gasoline costs). Indeed, our data and others have found that childcare responsibilities for other children in the home affects visitation.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">Parental stress and perceived communication with NICU staff have been hypothesized as important factors affecting visitation<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and potentially infant LOS.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Specifically, it has been postulated that NICU staff may subtly and inadvertently discourage families from visiting their infants, instead of encouraging infant holding and active participation. For example, most NICUs have 24-hour visitation policies but exclude parents from aspects of care that they might provide or ask parents to leave during shift changes or procedures&#x02014;a practice that may communicate potentially conflicting messages to families about their role and increase parental stress.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Parents and medical staff should view themselves as joint caregivers, working toward a common goal of timely discharge of a healthy infant.</p><p id="P25">Distance from the hospital and difficulties with transportation are also major contributing elements to visitation,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which may be exacerbated in large metropolitan areas. Parents visiting from greater distances (&#x0003e;1 hour travel time) may stay for longer periods on days when they visit, making both frequency and duration of visitation important variables to measure accurately in future research.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Further, car ownership (compared to relying on other family/friends for rides) emerged as a likely determinant of visitation. Visitation data from fathers and other family/household members may be important for understanding mothers&#x02019; visitation and infants&#x02019; LOS as well, with observational studies tending to show that fathers visit less often and are less active in their infants&#x02019; care.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p id="P26">Failing to educate families about benefits of participating in care could also lessen visitation. For example, breast milk feeding has been associated with a reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Kangaroo care (skin-to-skin holding) has been reported to reduce infection,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> improve neurodevelopment,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and a randomized trial found it was associated with increased head growth compared to traditional holding among premature (&#x02264;32 weeks; &#x02264;1500g) infants. However, most NICUs may not go far enough to highlight the likely benefits of parental participation in the infants&#x02019; care. Further, associations between visitation frequency and length and care-by-parent measures shown with our data underscore the importance of increasing parental visitation to potentially increase these positive parenting behaviors.</p><p id="P27">Our power to identify benefits from free parking was limited as over 15% of infants in our sample died after randomization (almost twice as many as projected). Further our approach to providing free parking might have been more effective. For instance, distributing free parking passes at the front desk at all hours might have increased visitation. Of the 85 parents not approached within the inclusion window, intervening sooner and continuing attempts beyond 14 days may have increased enrollment and ultimately reduced the length of this trial for this difficult-to-reach population.</p><p id="P28">Frequent parental visitation is a necessary component for ELBW infants to receive numerous benefits while being cared for in the NICU.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Our design was not powerful enough to recommend free parking as a stand-alone intervention in similar urban NICUs to increase visitation. We encourage more work on this understudied area by interviewing parents about reasons for non-visitation (including perceptions about the NICU staff and environment). These data may generate simple ways to increase parental visitation that could reduce overall costs if hospital stays were shortened. Transportation, other childcare duties, work-related demands, and a multitude of other psychosocial stressors will likely emerge as worthwhile investigative targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS805227-supplement-1.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e521" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS805227-supplement-2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e525" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><p id="P29">The authors would like to acknowledge the diligence and dedication of Josephine Turner at the UTHealth Clinical Research Unit at Memorial Hermann-TMC, Michelle Celestin for her help preparing the references&#x02019; section of this manuscript, and the staff of the UTHealth High-Risk Infant Clinic.
