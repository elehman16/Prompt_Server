However, this practice is seldom used because uncertainty about diagnosis, and fear of consequences of discontinuing antibiotic therapy, as well as perceived pressure to continue prescribing antibiotics and potential conflict with patients are more of a concern for GPs than antibiotic resistance. The main objective of this study is to determine whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy when a GP no longer considers it necessary has any impact on the number of days with severe symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial. The study was conducted in 10 primary care centres in Spain. We included patients from 18 to 75 years of age with uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infections&#x02014;acute rhinosinusitis, acute sore throat, influenza or acute bronchitis&#x02014;who had previously taken any dose of antibiotic for &#x0003c;3 days, which physicians no longer considered necessary. The patients were randomly assigned to the usual strategy of continuing antibiotic treatment or to discontinuing antibiotic therapy. A sample size of 240 patients per group was calculated on the basis of a reduction of 1&#x02009;day in the duration of severe symptoms being a clinically relevant outcome. The primary outcome was the duration of severe symptoms, that is, symptoms scored 5 or 6 by means of validated symptom diaries. Secondary outcomes included antibiotics taken, adverse events, patient satisfaction and complications within the first 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethical Board of <italic>Fundaci&#x000f3; Jordi Gol i Gurina</italic> (reference number: 16/093).

In primary care, the response to treatment in respiratory tract infections is mainly judged by clinical rather than microbiological criteria.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common reasons for a healthcare encounter in Western countries, accounting for about 15% of all visits.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most episodes are caused by viruses, and in otherwise healthy adults these infections are typically self-limiting and do not require a visit to a physician or a prescription medication. Nevertheless, many patients with uncomplicated, self-limited RTIs seek care in primary care offices. A recent study found that 72% of primary care visits due to an acute respiratory tract infection did not seem to require an office visit,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which subsequently increases healthcare costs and often leads to inappropriate antibiotic prescription.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Very importantly, inappropriate overuse of antibiotic medications can be very detrimental and may lead to antibiotic resistance,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> which has a tremendous impact on the economy,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and patients often experience adverse effects such as diarrhoea, thrush, nausea, urticaria and rash, which give rise to further office visits and time off work. Despite being uncommon, patients might also experience serious complications such as anaphylaxis and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, medicalisation of a self-limited condition makes it more likely for patients to visit a healthcare provider the next time they have a similar episode.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>General practitioners (GPs) have generally been told to continue an antibiotic regimen once the patient has initiated it in order to prevent the patient from acquiring resistant organisms. However, this dogma of completing an antibiotic regimen once initiated might not be associated with less antimicrobial resistance. Some studies have shown that short-course regimens can be as effective as longer courses of therapy, resulting in less emergence of antibiotic resistance, which is consistent with what we know about natural selection, the driver of antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> The use of shorter therapies, defined as the taking of an antibiotic for 5 days or less, is commonly used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Short course regimens&#x02014;from 3 to 5 days&#x02014;have also shown to be as effective as longer therapies in community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but are seldom used by GPs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When it comes to pneumonia, despite the efforts of infectious committees and guidelines developed by different societies, the duration of antibiotic use is still a major issue for which there is a lack of adherence both in primary and secondary care worldwide.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>This often-heard statement of completing an antibiotic course once initiated and the perceived need to treat beyond resolution of symptoms is usually driven by a desire to prevent worse outcomes and relapses. Giving the right antibiotic at an adequate dose, along with good compliance with the daily regimen by the patient (ie, taking the correct dose at the appropriate intervals), has been said to be the most important strategy for treatment success in bacterial infections.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, GPs very often see patients with suspected viral infections of the upper and lower airways, for which antibiotic treatment makes little or no difference in terms of clinical outcomes and, conversely, can cause some side effects and might also prompt the acquisition of resistant organisms.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>Since 2011, the Spanish Society of Family Medicine has recommended GPs to ask their patients to stop taking antibiotics given by other clinicians when they suspect a viral infection.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Despite this recommendation, this strategy is seldom used in routine clinical practice. GPs are reluctant and feel that it is unsafe to discontinue an antibiotic once the patient has already started it, mainly due to the ambiguity about the appropriateness of discontinuing medication felt by GPs, and in part because the clinical guidelines do not encourage discontinuation of medication, as they offer GPs a weak rationale for discontinuation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, some studies have also shown that other issues such as uncertainty about diagnosis, ease of follow-up and fear of consequences of non-prescribing as well as perceived pressure to prescribe and potential conflict with patients which might lead to consequences for the future doctor&#x02013;patient relationship are more of a concern for GPs continuing to prescribe antibiotics than antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> When it comes to acute infections, GPs might feel uncomfortable to discontinue antibiotic therapy from a patient who subsequently deteriorates, especially if the patient needs to be admitted to hospital.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There is limited evidence about the efficacy and safety of continuing an antibiotic regimen if not needed, but concomitantly, evidence as to whether discontinuing antibiotic therapy for these conditions is safe is lacking, and studies demonstrating the safety of this practice should be carried out.</p><p>Discontinuing an antibiotic regimen could be undertaken in one of the following two situations:</p><p>1.&#x000a0;Patients diagnosed with infectious diseases for which antibiotics&#x02014;prescribed by other physicians&#x02014;are not necessary, that is, an antibiotic course for suspected viral infections</p><p>According to WHO, 80% of the RTIs in the community have a viral origin. Most of these infections are self-limiting, and recent systematic reviews have suggested that antibiotics only slightly modify the course of most of these infections. A recent systematic review suggested that antibiotics do not improve the duration of symptoms in patients with common cold compared with those receiving placebo.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Antibiotics are associated with modest benefits in sore throat; they reduce soreness and fever, the duration of symptoms and the incidence of suppurative and non-suppurative complications compared with placebo mainly in patients with infection caused by group A &#x003b2;-haemolytic streptococcus.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This modest effect of antibiotics has also been observed in acute rhinosinusitis in which antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five participants per 100 cure faster at any time point between 1 and 2&#x02009;weeks if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In acute bronchitis, no difference has been shown between antibiotic and placebo groups in terms of the percentage of patients described as achieving clinical improvement at follow-up.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the participants in all these clinical trials had a significantly greater risk of adverse effects with antibiotics than with placebo.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p><p>Despite the low percentage of bacterial infections, antibiotic prescription is very high in these infectious diseases, with over 60% of adults presenting with acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis and acute sore throat receiving an antibiotic in Spain.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Antibiotic prescription in our country has increased over the last years and Spain now constitutes one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to the percentage of antibiotics prescribed.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> This unnecessary antibiotic prescription in RTIs has also been seen in other affluent countries; in addition, these antibiotics are increasingly broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Even in Holland, the country with the lowest antibiotic consumption in Europe, 46% of the antibiotics prescribed for RTIs are not needed while in only 4% of the situations in which antibiotics are not prescribed they should have been recommended according to the Dutch guidelines.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This unnecessary antibiotic prescription might mainly be explained by uncertainty in the diagnosis and by GPs&#x02019; perceptions regarding patient expectations for a prescription.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Data from the Genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe study clearly show that antibiotics are expected by 45% of the patients with lower RTIs.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>2.&#x000a0;Patients who have taken several doses of an antibiotic not prescribed by a health professional for an infectious disease for which antibiotics are not necessary, that is, from leftovers found in the household or an antibiotic bought without prescription at the pharmacy.</p><p>The sale of antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines without a prescription remains widespread, with many countries lacking standard treatment guidelines, thereby increasing the potential for overuse of antimicrobial medicines by the public and medical professionals.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This practice is common outside Northern Europe and North America. The percentage of non-prescription access to antimicrobials is often underestimated and also depends on the methodology used for making estimations. In 2016, the European Commission published a questionnaire-based study (Eurobarometer), which was carried out in 28 European countries, including 1053 respondents in Spain. This study described that 6% of users reported having obtained antibiotics in the previous year without a prescription or stated that they had used the leftovers from a previous course.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, when more reliable methods are used to know how many individuals obtain antibiotics from sources other than their GPs, these percentages clearly increase.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Self-medication with antimicrobials is also widespread, occurring among the population in the same countries in which over-the-counter sales are available.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

Baseline data were collected in the clinic by the physician or with the help of the nursing staff. To standardise data collection, all of the participating healthcare professionals were trained by the coordinating centre. Only experienced GPs (those who have worked for 15&#x02013;25 years) and those who feel comfortable with the design of the study participated in the study. This was achieved by the administration of a questionnaire with clinical questions, recommendations of local guidelines and vignettes to check if they were confident and comfortable with the strategy of stopping an already commenced antibiotic course. The patients received information on the study and, if they were interested in participating, they provided with an informed consent form to read and sign. A maximum length of 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;min was expected for the interview and the introduction of the data. The study scheme and the visit programme were explained to the patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>). GPs filled out a screening log with all the patients who met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria regardless of whether the patients consent to participate or not. This allowed us to evaluate the percentage of patients who accepted to participate in the trial and determined the reasons why they did not wish to participate if they refuse.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Visit schedule during the clinical trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visit 1,&#x000a0;day 0</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visit 2*,&#x000a0;day 2&#x02013;3</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visit 3, day 14&#x02013;28&#x02020;</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visit 4*,&#x000a0;day 90</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical history and physical examination</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Informed consent form</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Randomisation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Giving out of symptom diaries</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evaluation of clinical evolution</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessment of adverse events</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Collection of symptom diaries</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reporting of recurrences, medical visits or hospital admissions due to the baseline infection</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn5"><p>*Phone call.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn6"><p>&#x02020;Depending on the infection (14 days for influenza and sore throat; 28 days for acute bronchitis and acute rhinosinusitis).

Patients who made the decision to take an antibiotic by themselves (either purchased at the pharmacy or taken from leftovers stored at home) and were assigned to the usual strategy of continuing antibiotic treatment were&#x000a0;provided with a medical prescription of the same antibiotic until completing the recommended therapy duration according to local guidelines, even if the antibiotic was not first-line treatment.</p><p>After randomisation, information on the strategy to which they have been allocated was given to the participants, and they were informed as to the appropriate measures to take in case their condition worsened or there was no improvement. In addition, they were given a diary with a validated questionnaire of symptoms for each condition, which they had&#x000a0;to complete while symptoms related to the respiratory condition were present. The degree of satisfaction or concern with different aspects of the therapy as well as the use of antibiotics was also recorded in this diary.</p><p>Patients were interviewed by telephone 2 or 3 days after their inclusion in the study. At this first follow-up visit, a worsening of the clinical situation of the patient was evaluated to determine whether antibiotic treatment was necessary among patients in the group assigned to discontinuation (first-line antibiotics were recommended in this case) or whether the antibiotic regimen should be continued or changed to the first-line drug in patients in the group allocated to continuation. We provided the patients with the opportunity to ask questions and discuss any problems with diary completion. In addition, compliance and possible secondary effects of the treatment were evaluated.&#x000a0;The second follow-up visit was scheduled at 14&#x02013;28 days after inclusion and depended on the infection involved at patient recruitment as established in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;guidelines.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> On this visit, the clinical evolution of the signs and symptoms were&#x000a0;evaluated and the need to change or continue the antibiotic treatment, respectively, was determined in the case of worsening of the clinical manifestations. The symptom diaries were collected on this visit. Participants who did not return their diary were telephoned by the trial team as a reminder and to enquire whether they needed&#x000a0;any assistance in returning their diary. Possible secondary effects of the treatment were also assessed. Patients were asked to revisit if symptoms continued or they presented recurrence of the infection. On the last follow-up visit, scheduled at day 90, recurrences, medical visits or hospital admissions due to the baseline infectious disease were&#x000a0;reported.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Data analysis procedure</title><p>The characteristics of the study population will&#x000a0;be described using frequencies for categorical variables and mean and SD for quantitative variables.

To compare the two strategies studied, we will&#x000a0;use the t test for continuous variables. To compare the duration of symptoms across strategies, we will&#x000a0;use the t test for continuous variables for each symptom, and a linear regression model per symptom, with symptom duration as the dependent variable, and both antibiotic consumption and symptom duration prior to the visit as the independent variables. The same approach will be made to compare the severity of symptoms between the two strategies, but the dependent variable for each model will be symptom severity. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test will&#x000a0;be used to compare antibiotic consumption, satisfaction, percentage of adverse effects and the appearance of complications between the two groups.

This was a clinical trial based on the outpatient setting, and neither patients nor researchers received any monetary compensation. From an ethical point of view, this is to certify that the objective of the study was relevant for primary care, the power of the study may be considered as reasonable, this was an original study, the risks which the participants may incur justify the study being carried out with a totally favourable benefit/risk quotient and we ensured the external validity of the study to the primary care reality, with clearly described inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The results of this study will be applicable to patients diagnosed with clinical conditions for which antibiotics are not or might not be necessary. Few GPs ask patients to discontinue antibiotic therapy because of fear of possible worsening of symptoms and the appearance of complications even in cases of suspected viral infections. Guidelines usually provide dominating triggers for prescribing and weak priming for discontinuation. In other situations, GPs do not wish to contradict the decision made by other doctors because it might look unfair. If the results of this study do not find any difference between the two groups, there will be no reason to continue an antibiotic regimen when a GP no longer considers it necessary. We believe that there is no risk&#x02014;and every advantage&#x02014;in stopping a course of an antibiotic immediately after a bacterial infection has been excluded or is unlikely, as Gilbert recently suggested.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The most obvious circumstances in which it is appropriate to stop antibiotics are when the antibiotics are initiated without certainty of what infection is being treated, if any treatable bacterial infection is present at all, and for infections that are almost always self-limiting, for example, episodes of acute bronchitis. Patient expectation often plays a role in the decision to start antibiotic treatment in these cases.</p><p>The impact of our trial is likely to be important since the evidence available in this field is still limited, and adequately designed and conducted clinical trials are warranted to clarify the efficacy and safety of discontinuing antibiotic therapy in these cases. Similarly, the inclusion of most of the uncomplicated RTIs and the fact that only patients with &#x0003c;3&#x02009;days of antibiotic therapy will be invited to participate will increase the validity of the results. These characteristics make this study innovative and relevant to this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e388" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015814.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e389" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015814.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CL, AM, JMC and CB were involved in the conception and design of the study.
