<bold><italic> Methods:</italic></bold> The present study was single-blind,
quasi-experimental study. A total of 60 patients were selected using the purposive
sampling method. Quality of sleep was measured with PSQI on the first day in admission,
then after three nights of admission without any intervention for control group and for
the experimental group quality of sleep measured by white noise with intensity of 50-60 dB
then Quality of sleep was measured with PSQI. Data were analyzed by SPSS 13 software.</p><p>
<bold><italic> Results:</italic></bold> The average total sleep time in the control group
before the study reached from 7.08 (0.8) to 4.75 (0.66) hours after three nights of
hospitalization, while in the experimental group, no significant changes were seen in the
average sleep hours (6.69 &#x000b1; 0.84 vs. 6.92 &#x000b1; 0.89, P = 0.15).The average minutes of sleep
in the control group before the study reached from 12.66 (7.51) to 25.83 (11.75) minutes
after a three- night stay, while in the experimental group, no significant changes were
observed in the average sleep duration (12.16 &#x000b1; 7.50 vs. 11 &#x000b1;6. 07, P = 0.16).</p><p>

those in other units.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>They occur as a
result of the inadequacy of sleep periods and stages.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> There is little knowledge about the quality of patients' sleep in CCU.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The sleep process is essential for patients'
well-being and recovery<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>and acts as a
modulator/moderator of cardiovascular function in both physiological and disease
conditions.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Sleep consists of two
general phases: rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep, and each phase is distinguished
by physiological, psychological, and neurological functions.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> Sleep disorder in critical care patients is defined as inadequate sleep or inadequate
sleep duration, which results in inconvenience and disorder in people's quality of
life.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Increased sympathetic activity,
and decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity, and subsequent tachycardia, cardiac
arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability are among the physiological complications of sleep
disorder.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p> Moreover, unfavorable quality of sleep as a stressful condition may aggravate ischemia and
myocardial infarction.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The reason of
interrupted sleep in the coronary care unit is multi factorial of which noise is one
important factor.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Noise is defined as
unwanted sounds that could have negative psychological and physiological effects.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Noises are an unavoidable part of our life,
Noises may be made following environmental factors or human activities. The World Health
Organization (WHO) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggest that the level of noise
at night in hospitals will not be higher than 35-40 dB.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, a study showed that
the level of noise in CCU at night became higher than 80 dB.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A study performed by Xie et al., showed that noises comprised
17-57.6% of patients' awakening triggers in CCU, and among the noise sources were sounds of
monitors, staff conversations, phone ringing, ventilation and heating systems, and other
medical devices. The patients are most disturbed by staff conversations and
alarms.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> Furthermore, Zakeri Moghaddam's et al.,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> study performed in Iran showed that most of the patients admitted to the
coronary care unit reported the staff conversations, patient conversations, telephone
ringing, and alarms of monitors and devices as the environmental factors of sleep disorder.
The noise intensity of staff conversations, monitors, and infusion pumps are 59-90 dB, 72-77
dB, and 73-78 dB, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Another
study revealed that most of care delivery is performed at 8:00 pm, midnight, and 6:00 am,
which showed noisy times in coronary care units.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> It is necessary for nurses take measures in order to play a crucial
role in diagnosing and eliminating factors contributing to sleep disorders and treat
it.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p> Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used to treat insomnia. The
most common way of treating or coping with sleep problems is using drugs. Pharmacological
methods are frequently used in the treatment of insomnia but they have many side effects.
One of the complementary approaches of the medical treatment of sleep problems or the
improvement of the sleep quality of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit is
using non-pharmaceutical methods. Varied non-pharmaceutical methods such as reducing
environmental factors,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> mental
imagery,&#x000a0;gradual and progressive relaxation, auditory masking, music therapy, and massage
are used in the treatment of sleep disorders.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p> Auditory masking is a phenomenon in which perception of a sound is reduced by another
sound (sound masker).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> White noise is
used for noise masking. The white noise is a noise that makes hearing threshold level
reaching its maximum rate, and this means in the presence of such sounds in the background
of the environment, the more intense auditory stimuli are less capable of stimulating the
cerebral cortex during sleep. The sounds that are used mostly in this regard include sounds
like the sound of rain and the sound of ocean waves.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A study on students and infants revealed that white noise triggered
sleeping and reduced night waking problems.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The objective of the present
study was to determine the effect of white noise on the quality of sleep in older patients
admitted to the CCU. The hypothesis was that masking the environmental noise and reducing
sleep disorders by generating white noise can improve the quality of patients' sleep.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> The current study is a quasi-experimental intervention study. This article is extracted
from a student thesis at Tehran University of Medical Sciences and has been approved by the
ethics committee of the university.</p><p> The study population included the patients admitted to the coronary care unit of Shariati
Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2013. The sample size was estimated 62 patients (31 subjects in
each of the control and experimental groups) with respect to the values reported in previous
studies with a standard deviation of 3, accuracy level of 3, confidence level of 95%, test
power of 0.8 and accounting for the possibility of attrition rate. The patients were
included in the study using the purposive sampling method with the inclusion criteria as
follows: minimum age of 30 years old; CCU stays, at least for three nights; awareness of
time, place and people; having hemodynamic stability; capable of hearing; non- receiving of
anesthetic medications, drugs and diuretic drugs during three- night stay in CCU.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> To
minimize the sleep disrupting factors, the study was conducted in the same CCU for both
groups.&#x000a0;At the beginning of the study, the objectives of the study were explained to all
candidate patients. The confidentiality of information obtained from them was also mentioned
to them, and they were assured that they could opt out of the study at any stage of it
without there being any impairment in their treatment, then, the amount of noise was
measured for three nights in the coronary care unit from the change time of night shift in
the morning (from 7 PM to 7 AM of the next day).</p><p> The quality and mean hours of precious sleep of the control group samples on the first day
of hospitalization were measured and assessed by using&#x000a0;the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI) and the sleep log to evaluate the average sleep time. In the following, with the
interval of three nights stay in the CCU without any action, the quality of sleep for three
nights was measured again with the same instrument. After completing the control group
sampling, the sampling of the experimental group was started, and similar to the control
group, the quality and average time of the patients' previous sleep were initially measured
on the first day. Then, the white noise was broadcasted for the patients with the intensity
of 40-50 dB for one hour during three nights in the noisy hours of the ward, which were
previously determined through measuring the sound intensity over the night (8 PM to 9 PM at
night and 11 to 12 PM at night).&#x000a0;After this period, the quality of sleep in patients was
again measured with the same tool for three nights.</p><p> Data collection tool included three parts of&#x000a0;demographic characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI). The demographics and disease characteristic included age; gender;
marital status; employment status; education; history of hospitalization; history of drug,
alcohol, painkiller use or the use of drugs affecting sleep; history of midday sleep; and
duration of midday sleep. The demographics form was prepared using previous studies. In
order to make it as valid as possible, it was given to 10 faculty members in the School of
Nursing and Midwifery with a conceptual expertise (teaching about sleep, having published
books or articles on the subject, being an expert in psychiatric nursing, or intensive
care), and an interdisciplinary methodological expertise. After studying and analyzing the
faculty members&#x02019; ideas, the necessary changes was made.</p><p> Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) has nine questions in seven sections of subjective
sleep quality, late sleeping, sleep sufficiency, sleep duration, and sleep disorders, use of
sleep medications and defective performance during the day. Each section is rated from zero
to three scores, indicating the normal situation, the mild, moderate or severe problems
respectively. The minimum and maximum scores are zero and 21, respectively, and the higher
score shows lower sleep quality. The sensitivity and specificity of this tool was
respectively as 89.6% and 86.5%, and its reliability in test-retest was r= 0.85.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>In Iran, reliability of the questionnaire was
estimated at 0.77 with Cronbach&#x02019;s coefficient alpha.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p> Given the normal distribution of sleep quality determined through the Kolmogorov - Smirnov
test, descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, frequency) and statistical
inference methods (Fisher's exact test, Chi - square, Pearson test, independent T and paired
t-test) were used by SPSS ver.13 software to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> In this study, a total of 62 patients admitted to the CCU (control group: 31 patients,
experimental group: 31 patients) were enrolled (one patient due to transfer to another ward
in an interval less than three nights and one patient due to critical conditions was
excluded from the study). The average age in the control and experimental groups were as
60.6 &#x000b1; 11.53 and 58.87 &#x000b1; 10.92 years, respectively. The cause for admissions of 24 patients
in the control group and 25 patients in the intervention group was unstable angina. Other
causes of hospitalization included DVT (6 patients) and with heart failure (5 patients). All
patients were hemodynamically in stable condition, and hearing ability and education of
patients were approximately at the same levels.</p><p> The patients in both groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics (age,
gender, marital status, history of hospitalization, employment status, and admission cause)
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p> No significant difference was found on the average score of PSQI sleep quality between the
two groups before the study (P=0.941).</p><p> However, the mean sleep quality score in both groups after the study showed significant
differences (P&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p> Comparison of sleep quality for each group separately revealed that the average score of
sleep quality in the control group reached from 5.20&#x000b1;1.8 to 11.23&#x000b1;2.3 (P&#x0003c;0.001). In the
experimental group, significant changes were observed between the mean score of sleep
quality before and after the study (5.17&#x000b1; 1.66 vs.&#x000a0;4.53 &#x000b1;1.27, P = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of study patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td style="border-style: solid none solid none; border-width: 1px" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

with study by Schiza et al., on patients admitted to the CCU on the third day after
admission, sleep problems of patients in this study were include: reduction of total sleep
time and poor sleep quality.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p> A study by Stanchina et al., showed that white noise in combination with the recorded
noises improved the sleep quality of patients in ICU. Therefore, they concluded that white
noise increases stimulation threshold of healthy people exposed to the noises recorded in
ICU environment.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In another study,
Williamson<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>showed that applying of
white noise increased the score of sleep depth, getting back to sleep, and night sleep
quality of patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Also, in a study
on the effect of white noise, Aghaie found that the intervention group had lower levels of
anxiety and restlessness compared with the control group.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The researchers believes that white noise improves patient&#x02019;s quality and quantity of sleep by reducing the effects of
noise and inducing relaxation. However, since white noise is a natural sound, it seems that
a natural sound like that of an ocean sounds leads to the individual&#x02019;s relaxation and this
leads to the improvement of the patient&#x02019;s sleep quality.</p><p> Limitations of the study include the lack of isolated units for admitting each patient,
inability to control all medications of patients due to their probable effect on sleep, the
short time of examining sleep, and unequal causes of patients' admission. The researchers
recommend future studies to select a larger sample size with encompassing all ages of
patients admitted to the CCU and to examine the effect of continuous application of white
noise during the night on patients. Furthermore, the relaxing or blocking effect of white
noise may not be fully evident; this can be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> Sleep disorders are more common among patients in intensive care units.</p><p> Environmental factors like noise is a common cause of sleep disorders. Based on the
findings of this study, the use of white noise is recommended as a method for masking
environmental noises, sleep induction, improving sleep, and maintaining sleep in the
coronary care unit.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> The authors are grateful to the Vice-president of Research of Nursing and Midwifery
