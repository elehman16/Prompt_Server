It is unclear whether music listening may reduce the amount of opioids used for pain management in critical care, postoperative patients or whether music may improve patient experience in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p></sec><sec id="section2-1178633717716455"><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 41 surgical patients were randomized to either music listening or controlled non-music listening groups on ICU admission. Approximately 50-minute music listening interventions were offered 4 times per day (every 4-6&#x02009;hours) during the 48 hours of patients&#x02019; ICU stays.

Listening to music, whether it is the classical notes of a Bach concerto or the hard beat of rap, produces powerful emotional, mental, and perhaps even spiritual feelings. These complex qualities and attributes of music are not easily explained.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Admission to a critical care unit, especially after surgery, often produces fear of the unknown. This fear is intensified by the unfamiliar environment of critical care units which is often described as less than &#x0201c;patient-friendly.&#x0201d; The result, coined &#x0201c;intensive care unit (ICU) anxiety,&#x0201d; is often attributed to higher levels of noise and light pollution in critical care settings<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>; however, this ICU anxiety is truly multifactorial,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> often affected by postoperative pain.

The critical care unit is staffed by critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, and intensivists. The surgical patients are jointly managed by surgeons and intensivists. Acute pain management techniques involve intravenous opioids and/or peripheral or epidural PCA. Postoperative management commonly involves epidural catheters and PCA devices. Nurses usually care for a maximum of 2 patients. On ICU admission post-surgery, subjects were randomized to either music listening or control groups. Randomization criteria included the ability to verbally answer questions regarding pain and anxiety. Patients who were intubated were not randomized. In addition, an active order for pain medication using a PCA device was required. Randomization was conducted using opaque, sealed envelopes with group designations that had been prepared previously by the statistician using a computer-generated, permuted block randomization schema. The research staff was blind to the contents of the envelopes. Once the patient was randomized, the appropriate bedside booklet was provided that listed all the measures and time points for ease of documentation by the nurses in the ICU. Prior to beginning the study, this booklet and all the study measures were reviewed by the ICU staff.</p><p>The music listening group was exposed to the MusiCure Dreams album (Gefion Records, Copenhagen, Denmark) using noise-canceling headphones for approximately 50-minute intervention(s) during their ICU stay.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Patients were instructed to listen to the entire selection.

No restrictions were placed on nursing care or medical care during interventions. However, each nurse was asked to perform a &#x0201c;settling routine&#x0201d; before the intervention to prepare the surgical patient. Repositioninng, mouth care and dimming lights were part of this routine. Both groups received this settling routine. Initially, music listening patients received a maximum of 3 sessions each day, at approximately 8-hour intervals. Music intervention periods did not occur more often than within 4 hours of the previous session. Other than these limitations, patients could ask to listen to the music at any time during their 48-hour ICU stay. After enrolling the first 3 patients to the protocol, music interventions were increased to every 4 to 6 hours to maximize the frequency of interventions among patients who were discharged earlier than 48 hours. The control group also followed these guidelines.</p><p>Before and after each resting period or music intervention, anxiety and distress were measured using the ETs, and postoperative pain was determined using both the NRS and VAS. Opioid intake was measured using PCA devices (Gemstar; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) during the entire ICU stay. Study participants were categorized by PCA opioid administration route, with epidural and intravenous PCA routes measured separately, in units of micrograms of fentanyl or milligrams of morphine. All opioids were calculated for each patient, including both PCA-delivered and additional doses of analgesia. All nonepidural opioids were converted to milligrams of morphine using a standard equianalgesic table calculation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1178633717716455">Supplementary Appendix B</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Opioid administration was recorded during each intervention. Music or resting interventions were conducted for a maximum of 48 hours.

Descriptive statistics were performed on all study variables at each time point. Bivariate relationships of the main outcomes (pain, anxiety, and distress) were examined by correlations (Spearman correlation coefficient) for all cases. The Fisher exact test, <italic>t</italic> test, 1-way analysis of variance, and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test were used to examine the differences in demographic, clinical variables, and the main outcomes between groups. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as mean values and their standard deviations.</p><p>Linear mixed models were used to examine whether there was a change in pain, anxiety, or distress between groups during the first 4 interventions. The difference scores were calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the post-intervention score for each intervention. A separate set of mixed models examined whether a statistical difference existed between the 2 groups, prior to and following the first intervention. Intravenous and epidural PCA opioid intakes were compared between music and control groups in the first and second 24-hour periods. A restricted maximum likelihood procedure was used for model parameter estimation. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to compare models.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In linear mixed models, the response depends on both population-level parameters (fixed effects) and subject-specific random effects. Linear mixed modeling does not require the same number of observations in each subject. It also does not require that all the measurements be taken at the same time. In this repeated measures study, missing data can be predicted by the model.

Independent thematic analysis was conducted by 3 research team members. This was followed by 2 consensus building meetings on the initial themes generated. These themes were placed in NVivo (Version 10, Burlington, MA, USA) to better visualize theme patterns and understand the prevalence of each theme. These themes were reverified by a team member (N.A.) with clinical ICU experience to further establish credibility and reproducibility of the generated themes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section13-1178633717716455"><title>Results</title><sec id="section14-1178633717716455"><title>Sample demographics</title><p>A total of 62 patients were preoperatively screened and consented to this protocol.

Besides anxiolytics and medications ordered for sleep, very few patients were ordered other medications prior to surgery. The most common class of drugs was sedatives.

Other comorbidities including substance abuse, alcohol use, smoking, and hypertension were compared between the music and control groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1178633717716455">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section16-1178633717716455"><title>Postoperative data</title><p>All of the 41 randomized patients started at least 1 intervention, and 66% completed at least 4 interventions. One patient started the intervention but refused to listen to the music. Two other patients in the music group did not listen to the entire first selection. This attrition was caused by patients transferring out of the ICU early, requesting not to listen to music for numerous other clinical reasons. The nurses were instructed to offer the interventions every 4 to 6 hours for the first 48 hours. Most of the interventions were offered every 6 hours, but the requirement was to complete at least 4 interventions per day with at least 4 hours between interventions.</p><p>Three opioids were used in this study for PCA delivery: fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1178633717716455">Table 1</xref> displays the type of PCA ordered between the music and control groups. During the first 24 hours of the study, 20 patients (48%) received epidurals with fentanyl used as the opioid. In all the 20 patients, bupivacaine in concentrations of either 0.0625% or 0.1250% was coadministered in the same fluid with the fentanyl. One patient received only bupivacaine (0.125%) in the epidural and received hydromorphone via intravenous PCA. Orders for the intravenous PCAs were written by surgeons and nurse practitioners, whereas epidural orders were prescribed and managed by an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist. Because the CC is both a research and teaching institution, many surgeons prescribed postoperative opioids, and the practitioners in the anesthesia department routinely ordered epidural medications postoperatively. In addition to the PCA opioids, data on other drugs administered during the study were collected. Extra doses of hydromorphone, outside of the PCA, were administered to 9 patients (6 in the music group, 3 in the control group) during the first 24 hours. Only 1 patient was administered hydromorphone in the second 24 hours. Other opiates administered in the first 24 hours included 3 patients who had fentanyl (2 patients in the music group, 1 in the control group). One patient in the music group had 1 dose of Demerol. Ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was administered to 9 patients (4 in the music group, 5 in the control group) in the first 24 hours and 7 patients (3 in the music group, 4 in the control group) in the second 24 hours. In the first 24 hours, 14 patients had ON-Q pumps (Kimberly Clark Health Care Company, Irvine, CA, USA).

Three patients in the music group were not interviewed either because they refused or had been taken off the study. Seventeen music interviews were completed and analyzed qualitatively for common themes. Two researcher assistants and a nurse very experienced in qualitative techniques (G.R.W.) independently reviewed the transcribed interviews. Most of the interviews were performed by the principal investigator (N.A.). None of these reviewers had participated in the original interviews. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1178633717716455">Table 5</xref> describes the major themes and illustrative quotes for each theme.

Although none of the patients used the phrase &#x0201c;zone out,&#x0201d; 4 patients described that the music helped them as described in this quote, &#x0201c;the music shut down the outside environment.&#x0201d; Although directly asked about pain management, 2 patients specifically stated that the music reduced pain. Eight patients talked about the environment of the ICU. Patients discussed the noise and the frequency of being checked to &#x0201c;hearing stuff and you just instantly panic.&#x0201d; Three patients complained that the ICU was &#x0201c;noisy&#x0201d; due to beeping monitors, staff conversations, and frequent interruptions. Four patients mentioned the ICU and lack or disrupted sleep. Some patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) described how the headphones felt and noted that the noise-canceling headphones blocked ambient noise. For some, this was a benefit, but others felt more anxious because they were unaware of their surroundings during the music listening interventions. Furthermore, some patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) did not like the predetermined music selection. These patients said that they would have preferred a different genre of music with lyrics.

Three patients were only offered the intervention 3 times a day when the protocol first started. One patient refused to listen after starting the first music listening period as reported above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section17-1178633717716455"><title>Discussion</title><p>Music listening had no significant effect on opioid use between control and experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1178633717716455">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1178633717716455">3</xref>).

However, to date, the effect of music listening on pain is small, subjective, and inconsistent.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In the Cochrane review of 51 studies examining the effect of music on pain, only 14 studies were included that examined postoperative pain. Among these 14 studies, only a small percentage examined the effect of music on pain in a critical care environment.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Recently, a meta-analysis examining music in pediatric surgery patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;196) recommended music as a useful intervention for clinical use.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Although music demonstrated a significant effect in the abovementioned studies, there are other examples in the literature that conflict with these studies, demonstrating conflicting or no significant differences between music listening interventions and standard care in reducing sedative or opioid use.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="bibr42-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr43-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Many studies used only a single intervention and shorter intervention lengths of only 20 or 30&#x02009;minutes,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> whereas this study implemented approximately 50-minute music listening or quiet resting periods. One recent study that demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety allowed the ventilated patient to listen to music as often as requested.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> This ventilator study demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety in intubated patients. Interestingly, the mean minutes per day for the ventilated patients who listened to music were 79.8 (SD: 126) with a median time of 12&#x02009;minutes and a range of 0 to 796&#x02009;minutes.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> We chose a music selection that was approximately 50 minutes in an attempt to standardize the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of music that was received by each participant.

Using linear mixed modeling, this first intervention was unique from other time points and several factors contributed to this difference. Time point 1 examined pain scores in 37 patients (complete pre- and post-interventions)&#x02014;one of the largest samples in this study. These measurements, pre-and post-NRS during the first intervention, were recorded shortly after surgery and reflected the unsettled nature of patients being admitted to the ICU from the operating room. Once the patient was admitted to the ICU, they were assessed and started on pain medication with a PCA. The patients began to experience pain relief after opioid administration and music listening. This combination might have contributed to decreased pain in the music group when measured pre- and post-intervention as compared with the control group. A significant interaction effect means that for the 2 groups, namely, music and control, there was a different trajectory before and after the first intervention. The control and music groups reacted differently to the first intervention.</p><p>Postoperative pain is linked to numerous, negative health outcomes, including poor wound healing, decreased immune function, increased length of hospital stay, and a prolonged recovery period.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr50-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The identification and development of an integrative, alternative modality that could decrease patients&#x02019; pain and anxiety throughout their recovery from surgery would be important. We hypothesized that music listening would have an effect in reducing pain, distress, and anxiety scores over time. We identified a significant difference in self-reported pain scores before and after the first intervention. No other effect of music listening was identified.</p><p>A strong significant correlation was also found between State and Trait Anxiety Inventories, ETs, and GAD-7 questionnaires. The STAI is a validated tool that has been the first choice of many researchers for quantifying anxiety; however, both the shorter and less-intensive GAD-7 and the Distress and Anxiety ETs were better suited for critical care and other clinical environments. This finding supports the use of the ETs in the critical care setting based on less burden to respondent and provider alike.</p><p>The major limitations of this study include not only decreased sample size, but also lack of choice of music type, duration of listening, and lack of an objective measure of pain. The most important limitation in this study was sample size. The study was stopped after a discovery that the PCA device could not accurately deliver 2&#x02009;mL or fewer per hour in the continuous mode. Recognizing that this alert would significantly change prescribers&#x02019; practices, the study was ended. Prior to this alert, only 1 patient in this study had been ordered a 2&#x02009;mL/h or fewer continuous infusion. This patient received that rate for approximately 3 hours. In addition, the sample size was decreased as many (18) failed the randomization criteria postoperatively. Despite this small sample size and the exploratory nature of the study, interesting trends were identified. In addition, the small sample size prevented the stratification of results to surgery type. It would be important in future work to examine either one type of surgery or to randomize on surgery type such as abdominal or thoracic.</p><p>There is little agreement in the literature on the optimum time adults should listen to music to have the greatest effect. However, the recent study by Chlan et al<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> suggests that participants should be allowed to listen to music unobstructed by the study parameters. Another limitation became clear as more participants were interviewed after listening to the music selected by the study team. An alternative design may include querying patients prior to surgery to select music genre.</p><p>Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate could be used as objective measures of pain. However, in this study, because of surgery and anesthesia, these signs would not be appropriate as many patients may experience complications such as hypovolemia. Recently, investigators have been examining skin conductance as an objective measure for pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> With more research, this might be a useful tool to measure pain.</p><p>The 50-minute &#x0201c;quiet resting period&#x0201d; may have affected the control group as this was not part of the standard postoperative care. Furthermore, despite frequent education and reminders, the nursing staff did not always complete all study interventions. In addition, many of the patients transferred out of the ICU sooner than predicted.</p><p>Another important limitation was the subjective nature of music listening and its potentially small effect on opiate use. A modality such as music listening may be more appropriately measured in a qualitative way rather than through a single outcome measure such as opiate use. &#x0201c;Music-induced analgesia,&#x0201d; as it was termed in one recent study of the effects of music on MRI findings, explained the intricate neural physiologic response caused by listening to music while invoking a painful stimulus.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> This study underscores the complexity of music&#x02019;s effects and further emphasizes that additional research is needed to understand the influence of music on pain.</p><p>One of the more surprising qualitative findings of this study was that music listening interventions inspired polarizing opinions and subjective experiences. Some patients had positive responses to music listening, but many were bothered by the music and/or the headphones. Although patients reported that music was a distractor, some patients disliked feeling disconnected and unaware of ambient noises. This response to wearing headphones, increased anxiety due to a reduction in ambient noise, has not previously been described in the ICU environment. In fact, just the opposite has been reported. In a recent publication, ventilated patients expressed that noise-canceling headphones helped them sleep and block out the noise of the unit when they were awake, therefore, decreasing anxiety.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1178633717716455" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Currently, many critical care environmental studies examine how to decrease ambient noise without taking into account the patient&#x02019;s need to be able to hear what is happening in the immediate surroundings. These studies should consider that patients desire auditory awareness in this setting. Therefore, the use of headphones in the ICU requires further study. Another issue points to the subjectivity of music. It is possible that allowing patients to choose their own music from a library of instrumental music with slow tempo, major key tonality, and other soothing attributes, such as nature sounds, would have made patients&#x02019; opinions more universally positive toward the music listening experience. Additional studies focused on the ICU environment, music, and its effect on critical care patients should be planned.</p><sec id="section18-1178633717716455"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Music is an integrative, complementary modality that could provide a safe and simple intervention to critical care patients. In this study, some patients really enjoyed the music and felt that it was able to assist them with remaining calm and comfortable after their surgery. Because music listening is such a subjective experience, a larger sample size would be important to demonstrate significance and would be important in planning future studies. At the present time, offering patients music as part of their standard postoperative care is not done in most critical care units. More work is needed to characterize music listening as an intervention. However, this study suggests that this nonmedicinal approach to symptom management could have a place in this environment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="IMI716455_Supplementary_Material_REV1629.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1843" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Pamela Horwitz, RN, BSN, nurse manager of the intensive care unit and all the patients, nursing, and medical staff of the 3SWS unit who supported this research.
