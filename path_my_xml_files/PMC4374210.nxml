Typical products from krill are krill oil and krill meal. Fish oils contain EPA and DHA predominantly bound in triglycerides. The difference in the chemical binding of EPA and DHA has been suggested to affect their bioavailability, but little is known on bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill meal.</p><p>This study was undertaken to compare the acute bioavailability of two krill products, krill oil and krill meal, with fish oil in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, single-dose, single-blind, cross-over, active-reference trial was conducted in 15 subjects, who ingested krill oil, krill meal and fish oil, each containing approx. 1 700&#x000a0;mg EPA and DHA. Fatty acid compositions of plasma triglycerides and phospholipids were measured repeatedly for 72&#x000a0;hours. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the 72&#x000a0;hour incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipid fatty acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A larger iAUC for EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipid fatty acids was detected after krill oil (mean 89.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33.36% &#x000d7; h) than after krill meal (mean 44.97&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18.07% x h, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) or after fish oil (mean 59.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;22.22% &#x000d7; h, p=0.003). Mean iAUC&#x02019;s after krill meal and after fish oil were not different. A large inter-individual variability in response was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>EPA and DHA in krill oil had a higher 72-hour bioavailability than in krill meal or fish oil. Our finding that bioavailabilities of EPA and DHA in krill meal and fish oil were not different argues against the interpretation that phospholipids are better absorbed than triglycerides. Longer-term studies using a parameter reflecting tissue fatty acid composition, like erythrocyte EPA plus DHA are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02089165">NCT02089165</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Omega-3 fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Eicosapentaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>Docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>Krill oil</kwd><kwd>Krill meal</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In Western countries, like Germany or the United States, mean levels of the marine omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid are below the range defined as optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In large parts, this is due to a decline in uptake of EPA and DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but also due to the fact that, under Western dietary conditions, only a very low percentage (if any) of alpha-linolenic acid can be converted to EPA, and almost no conversion to DHA occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, sources of EPA and DHA have to be ingested directly. Since the production of fish oil cannot be increased easily, other sources of EPA and DHA are currently investigated.</p><p>One of them is krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that feeds off algae in deep ocean waters. Krill is rich in both EPA and DHA. In Krill, 30&#x02013;65% of EPA and DHA are in phospholipid fatty acids, while in fish or fish oil, EPA and DHA are mainly in triglycerides (sn-2 position) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast to triglycerides, phospholipids are amphiphilic and thus have emulsifying features, which might contribute to enhanced absorption. However, as discussed in more detail elsewhere, bioavailability of EPA and DHA depends on a host of factors, like composition of food ingested with EPA and DHA (if any), other matrix effects, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the bioavailability of any new source of EPA and DHA has to be investigated in humans. Indeed, some reports have demonstrated that EPA and DHA in krill oil are bioavailable, and some indicating superior bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill oil, as compared to EPA and DHA in fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge (medline search on Dec 17, 2014), bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill meal remained to be investigated in humans.</p><p>Therefore, we compared the acute bioavailability of EPA and DHA in two different krill products, krill meal (Rimfrost Genuine, 40% oil content) and krill oil (Rimfrost Sublime), to the bioavailability of EPA and DHA in fish oil. In a randomized, cross-over trial, we provided a single dose of about 1,700&#x000a0;mg EPA and DHA to human volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Study participants were recruited through an advertisement in the local newspaper from the area of the Northern Savo (Kuopio, Finland).

Profiles of EPA and DHA were measured in fatty acids of plasma phospholipids and triglycerides. We found a larger incremental area under the curve for EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipid fatty acids (primary endpoint) after krill oil, as compared to the other two sources of EPA and DHA.</p><p>By and large, plasma phospholipid fatty acid composition reflects dietary intake from hours to weeks, whereas triglyceride fatty acid composition reflects dietary intake from hours to days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The evening before and during the first 24-hour period of each consumption of test products, participants consumed standardized meals. In addition, participants were instructed not to consume any other sources of EPA and DHA, and not to change the consumption of vegetable oil during the study. We conclude that acute changes observed in the measured fatty acids pools were attributable to the single administration of test products, rather than any other dietary changes.</p><p>The iAUC<sub>PL</sub> after krill oil had a mean of 89.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33.36% &#x000d7; h, significantly larger than after ingestion of krill meal (mean 44.97&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18.07% &#x000d7; h, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) or fish oil (mean 59.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;22.22% &#x000d7; h, p=0.003). Our results are similar to a previous 4&#x000a0;week study, comparing identical doses of EPA plus DHA (600&#x000a0;mg) in krill oil vs. fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in one previous single dose study, differences failed to achieve significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other studies of krill oil in humans did not compare identical doses, and are therefore difficult to compare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One explanation for the better bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill oil was that some krill oils contain substantial concentrations of EPA and DHA as free fatty acids, found in some, but not all, studies to have a better bioavailability than EPA and DHA in phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The content of free fatty acids in krill oils varies, depending on a number of factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The content of free fatty acids in the krill oil used in this study, however, was low (2.6% of EPA and DHA as free fatty acids), supporting the view that the phospholipids, and not the free fatty acids, in krill oil are responsible for the higher bioavailability we found.</p><p>This view, however, is now challenged by our finding that the iAUC<sub>PL</sub> after krill meal was non-significantly smaller than after fish oil, but was identical, if corrected for the dose given. While this finding was not reflected in the iAUC<sub>TG</sub>, it argues against the interpretation that the differences in bioavailability we found are due to differences in the chemical form of phospholipids vs. triglycerides, as the fat in krill oil and krill meal is identical. Rather, differences in the food matrix seem to be responsible. However, based on our data, we cannot provide a mechanistic explanation, why EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA had a better bioavailability in krill oil than in fish oil.</p><p>The response to study products varied largely from participant to participant (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Before consumption of the study meals and capsules in the morning, participants were provided a standardized evening meal, followed by an overnight fast. This was done to minimize the large effects of concomitant food or fat intake observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that the high interindividual variability in response in plasma phospholipids (iAUC<sub>PL</sub> krill oil 3.45-144.92% &#x000d7; h; fish oil 6.68-94.98% &#x000d7; h; krill meal 4.09-76.57% &#x000d7; h) and plasma triglycerides (iAUC<sub>TG</sub> krill oil was 0.56-51.49% &#x000d7; h, fish oil 2.24-97.74%, krill meal 0.05-80.63% &#x000d7; h) is not explained by the concomitant food intake or daytime of ingestion. All maximum iAUC<sub>PL</sub>-levels were detected in the same study subject, and in individuals 3, 12, and 13, krill oil did not display a higher bioavailability than fish oil. Taken together, our findings confirm the large inter-individual differences in uptake of EPA and DHA we and others observed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These differences remain to be explained mechanistically.</p><p>The variability of our findings on incorporation parameters into plasma phospholipid fatty acids, like maximum increase from baseline or time to maximum proportion of EPA, DHA or both combined, probably reflects the high inter-individual variability just discussed.</p><p>Overall, we found smaller AUC&#x02019;s in response to all three forms of EPA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DHA in triglyceride fatty acids than in phospholipid fatty acids, and there was no significant difference among them. Generally, triglyceride fatty acids contained smaller percentages of EPA and DHA than phospholipid fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The incorporation kinetics of our study support the interpretation that a smaller proportion of EPA and DHA is being incorporated into triglyceride fatty acids as one mechanism. Other mechanisms, like increased clearance, might also contribute. Clearly, however, incorporation into plasma phospholipid or triglyceride fatty acids does not appear to be a random phenomenon, but rather a regulated process.</p><p>Consistently, tmax of EPA in plasma phospholipids or plasma triglycerides occurred faster than tmax of DHA after all three preparations studied. However, both tmax of EPA and tmax of DHA had a shorter timeframe in plasma triglycerides than in plasma phospholipids. This argues against a simple crossing of large amounts of phospholipid or triglycerides molecule across the gastro-intestinal border, and for a differential handling of EPA and DHA during absorption among the preparations.</p><p>The single administration of krill oil and krill meal was well tolerated. Few subjects reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms after krill product ingestion. Clinical laboratory evaluation did not show any clinically significant changes in laboratory measurements.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of our study is that the omega-3 preparations studied not only contained comparable doses of EPA and DHA in total but also of each fatty acid individually, which has not been done in all bioavailability studies of krill oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Moreover, we used a cross-over design in order to limit the effects of the large inter-individual variability of fatty acid uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Limitations of our study also exist: Although the capsules we used disintegrated in the stomach, we did not use identical numbers of identical capsules, as has been suggested recently for krill oil bioavailability studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, although it cannot be excluded, it is difficult to envision a large impact of 16 vs 10 capsules or of 8 vs. 5&#x000a0;g fat ingested on the objective parameters we measured. Clearly, however, our results need to be substantiated in a longer-term trial using a longer-term parameter of omega-3 fatty acid bioavailability, like erythrocyte EPA and DHA, i.e. the Omega-3 Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a randomized, single-dose, single-blind, cross-over, active-reference trial in 15 healthy subjects, we compared the 72-hour bioavailability of approx. 1 700&#x000a0;mg EPA plus DHA in krill oil to krill meal and fish oil. Primary endpoint was the incremental area under the curve in plasma phospholipid fatty acids, reflecting recent dietary intake. According to the primary endpoint, EPA plus DHA had a higher bioavailability in krill oil, as compared to krill meal and fish oil. This was less well reflected in the secondary endpoints measured. Bioavailability of EPA plus DHA was not different between krill meal and fish oil, which argues against the interpretation that phospholipids are better absorbed than triglycerides. Our findings need to be substantiated in a longer-term trial using a parameter reflecting tissue EPA plus DHA.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>EPA</term><def><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHA</term><def><p>Docosahexaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PL</term><def><p>Phospholipids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TG</term><def><p>Triglycerides</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>AK, ES, NT and TN have none to declare.
