It is the most common neurological disorder of childhood. The present study was conducted to examine the increase in attention span in 43 ADHD-affected children treated with different approaches. The reaction time was measured using a Vernier chronoscope (electronic). Selected children of both sexes in the age-group of 6&#x02013;16 years were divided into three groups. In group A, 17 patients received syrup <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> compound I; in group B, 14 patients were treated with syrup <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> compound I + <italic>Shirodhara</italic> with milk; and in group C, 12 patients received syrup <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> compound II (placebo). The dose of the drug was 1.0 ml/kg body weight and the duration of treatment was 3 months. Group B showed highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001) improvement in total reaction time, while in group C the change was statistically nonsignificant <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.10. It was found that while the drug and <italic>Shirodhara</italic> were both effective in improving the reaction time of ADHD-affected children, the drug combined with <italic>Shirodhara</italic> was superior to the drug used alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADHD</kwd><kwd>Vernier chronoscope</kwd><kwd>reaction time (RT)</kwd><kwd><italic>Shirodhara</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As modern medicine has failed to provide a cure for a variety of health problems, more and more people are turning to the alternative and complementary medical sciences, especially <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, in search of relief. Among the problems for which modern medicine has failed to find a solution are the behavioral or psychiatric disorders of childhood.</p><p>Many of these problems are of a transient nature and often go unnoticed. However, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder of children that comprises perhaps 50% of referrals to child neurologists, behavioral pediatricians, and child psychiatrists. It is characterized by inattention, with increased distractibility and difficulty in sustaining attention, poor impulse control, and decreased self-inhibitory capacity, as well as motor overactivity and motor restlessness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The incidence of ADHD in school-going children in the West and India ranges from 5%&#x02013;10%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Two to four times more boys than girls are affected.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It often continues into adolescence and adulthood and can cause a lifetime of frustrated dreams and emotional pain.</p><p>A number of researches show that children with ADHD have slower reaction times or attention span than the general population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Reaction time is the time from the onset of a stimulus to the time the organism responds. The cerebellum is one of the areas of the brain concerned with making quick responses and so a poor reaction time is consistent with the theory that a weak or underdeveloped cerebellum is partly to blame.</p><p>Reaction time is determined by modality and summation of stimulus, foreperiod and preparatory set, motivation, sensory and motor attitudes, individual differences, fluctuation of attention, fatigue, use of drugs, practice, age, sex, intelligence, finger tremors, left vs right hand, vision (direct <italic>vs</italic> peripheral), sobriety, breathing cycle, and intake of stimulant drugs (e.g., caffeine).</p><p>Essentially, the faster one processes information coming into the brain, the more information one has at one's disposal to make a decision. Imagine filling a bottle with water from a tap; how fast you can fill the bottle depends on how fast the water comes out of the tap and how wide the neck of the bottle is. This analogy holds true in the case of the role of the cerebellum in ADHD. A lot of sensory information pours into the cerebellum, and when the cerebellum is immature it acts as a bottleneck. Any sensory input that cannot be coped with by the cerebellum will be discarded rather than be processed. So when a child with ADHD does not hear your instructions, it may be that the sounds were &#x02018;heard&#x02019; but were discarded before the signals reached the consciousness and the processing parts of the brain.</p><p>In view of the poor outcomes of ADHD-affected children, we studied a herbal drug compound and <italic>Shirodhara</italic> for their abilities to improve the reaction time in ADHD and also to achieve a homeostasis of the vitiated <italic>Doshas</italic> in the affected child.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The present study was conducted to examine the efficacy of an <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> compound in decreasing reaction time in ADHD-affected children, using the Vernier chronoscope (electronic) test.</p><p>For this study, we selected all affected children attending the OPD of the Department of <italic>Bal Roga</italic>, National Institute of <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, Jaipur, and also screened the students of the schools in the area around the National Institute of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> to identify cases.

Two types of sounds (fine and coarse) are provided as auditory stimuli, with their respective keys. For recording the visual reaction time, the yellow, green, and red lights were presented one at a time to the subject, who was asked to press the respective key in response to the stimuli; the time taken to respond was recorded.

By the <italic>Prerana</italic> (channelizing or motivation) property of <italic>Sara Guna, Prerana Karma</italic> of <italic>Vata</italic> becomes normalized and attention span is improved. <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> increases the qualities of the <italic>Tarpaka Kapha</italic> and thereby nourishes the <italic>Mana</italic> and Indriyas. Brain tissue is exceptionally rich in lipid, especially in complex essential fatty lipids; <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> is similar to these lipids and thus it can be assumed that these drugs, due to their <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic>, nourish the brain.</p><p><italic>Vipaka</italic>: <italic>Vipaka</italic> of all ingredients present in the trial drug compound were <italic>Katu</italic> and <italic>Madhur Vipaka</italic>. The metabolism of our body, including the brain, is accelerated by <italic>Katu Vipaka</italic>, which helps in absorption of micro- as well macronutrients as per the body's needs and thus brings about a reduction of nutrient deficiencies.

Ushna Virya</italic> also improves blood circulation in the brain. In 1989, Lou[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] reported abnormal regional blood perfusions in the straital region of ADHD-affected children. Thus it seems that ADHD-affected children have improper perfusion as well as glucose metabolism in the brain, which should be improved by virtue of <italic>Ushna Virya</italic> of the trial drug.</p><p><italic>Doshaghnata</italic>: All the drug ingredients have the property of <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic>. In ADHD, vitiation occurs in <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> that simultaneously vitiates <italic>Pitta</italic> and ameliorates <italic>Kapha</italic>. The <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic> effect of drugs may help in breaking the <italic>Srotorodha</italic> and digestion of <italic>Ama</italic> that leads to the proper functioning of systems of the body and brain. <italic>Kapha Shamaka</italic> drugs have properties that are opposite to that of <italic>Tama Dosa</italic>, which may help in dispelling the <italic>Avarana</italic> and normalizing <italic>Tama Dohsa</italic>, thereby maintaining the equilibrium of <italic>Triguna</italic> and the proper functioning of <italic>Mana, Chitta</italic> and <italic>Buddhi</italic>. The <italic>Tridosha Shamaka</italic> effect of drugs brings about homeostasis in <italic>Tridosa</italic> and <italic>Triguna</italic> as <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Mana</italic> interrelated with each other because Vata is responsible for vitiation of <italic>Sharirika</italic> as well <italic>Manasika Dosha</italic> and produce disease.
