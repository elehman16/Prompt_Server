Conventional care for migraine is suboptimal; overuse of medications for the treatment of episodic migraines is a risk factor for developing chronic daily headache. The study of non-pharmaceutical approaches for prevention of migraine headaches is therefore warranted. Craniosacral therapy (CST) is a popular non-pharmacological approach to the treatment or prevention of migraine headaches for which there is limited evidence of safety and efficacy. In this paper, we describe an ongoing feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of CST in the treatment of migraine, using a rigorous and innovative randomized controlled study design involving low-strength static magnets (LSSM) as an attention control intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that, compared to those receiving usual care plus a treatment with low-strength static magnets (attention-control complementary therapy), subjects receiving usual medical care plus CST will demonstrate significant improvement in: quality-of-life as measured by the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6); reduced frequency of migraine; and a perception of clinical benefit. Criteria for inclusion are either gender, age &#x0003e; 11, English or Spanish speaking, meeting the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for migraine with or without aura, a headache frequency of 5 to 15 per month over at least two years. After an 8 week baseline phase, eligible subjects are randomized to either CST or an attention control intervention, low strength static magnets (LSSM). To evaluate possible therapist bias, videotaped encounters are analyzed to assess for any systematic group differences in interactions with subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>169 individuals have been screened for eligibility, of which 109 were eligible for the study. Five did not qualify during the baseline phase because of inadequate headache frequency. Nineteen have withdrawn from the study after giving consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This report endorses the feasibility of undertaking a rigorous randomized clinical trial of CST for migraine using a standardized CST protocol and an innovative control protocol developed for the study. Subjects are able and willing to complete detailed headache diaries during an 8-week baseline period, with few dropouts during the study period, indicating the acceptability of both interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00665236</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Migraine affects approximately 20 percent of the adult population, developing in the second and third decades and often persisting into late middle age and beyond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, there are clearly genetic, vascular and neural mechanisms involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Frequency and duration are highly variable and the onset is said to be triggered at times by stress, history of head or neck trauma, certain foods and hormonal changes in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Symptoms can be difficult to control and quality of life may deteriorate substantially.</p><p>Management includes modification of diet, and recommendations for sleep, exercise, and stress reduction through bio-behavioral interventions as well as the use of a range of medications for prevention and acute treatment of migraine. Many of these medications are associated with significant side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, overuse of medications for the treatment of episodic migraines is a risk factor for developing chronic daily headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The study of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment or prevention of migraine headaches is therefore warranted. Because conventional care for migraine is suboptimal, many individuals seek alternative treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Craniosacral therapy (CST) is one popular non-pharmacological approach to the treatment or prevention of migraine headaches for which there is limited evidence of safety and efficacy.</p><p>CST involves manually identifying restrictions in the craniosacral system which includes the bones, membranes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surround the brain and spinal cord, and using soft, gentle hands-on techniques to both normalize the CST fluid rhythm and correct restrictions in perispinal tissues and fascia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Manual palpation and manipulation of this system theoretically affects sensory, motor, cognitive and emotional processes in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>CST is often used as adjunctive therapy by physical therapists, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors and massage therapists. It is purported to reduce the use of conventional pain medications and improve daily functioning in a variety of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the conventional medical literature of the use of CST for migraine, either alone or in combination with standard medical care. Several reports of CST in general headache suggest the possibility of significant benefit for some patients, including reduction of intensity of pain, reduction in medication use and improved function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These reports suffer from a lack of specific headache diagnoses and poor documentation of how CST was integrated with conventional care. Criteria for diagnosis, numbers of treatments, co-morbid conditions, psychosocial status, coping strategies for pain, prior trauma, qualifications of the practitioner, longitudinal follow-up, and changes in quality-of-life and overall function are not reported. Moreover, these study designs lack control groups and randomization.</p><p>In this paper, we describe an ongoing feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of CST in the treatment of migraine. This is the first rigorous approach to the study of CST for migraine. The aims of the study are as follows:</p><p>1) To determine the feasibility of developing a clinical trial comparing usual medical care plus craniosacral therapy (CST) <italic>versus</italic> usual medical care and low-strength static magnet therapy (LSSM &#x02013; attention-control) as treatments for the prevention of migraine;</p><p>2) To identify relevant secondary outcomes associated with usual care plus adjunctive CST; and</p><p>3) To identify and find solutions for potential problems in conducting a future large clinical trial to assess the efficacy of CST for the prevention of migraine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study examines the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial that compares CST to low strength static magnets (LSSM). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the overall design and subject flow through the study.

The rationale for headache frequency criteria is that patients with more than 5 headaches per month could be considered to have failed conventional therapy, especially if function is significantly impaired, while those with more than 15 headaches per month are considered to have chronic migraine and may be physiologically different than those with episodic migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Children are included because migraine is a significant problem in children, with limitations in pharmacologic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Eligibility of Subjects for Clinical Feasibility Trial of Craniosacral Therapy, 2006&#x02013;2008</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Inclusion Criteria</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Exclusion Criteria</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Subjects &#x0003e; 11 years of age</td><td align="left">Marked depression, anxiety or psychosis</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Either gender</td><td align="left">More than 2 visits/month for mental health care</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Meet ICHD* criteria for migraine</td><td align="left">More than one psychiatric medication</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Headache frequency/month: 5&#x02013;15</td><td align="left">Major medical illness under treatment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Headache history &#x0003e; 2 years</td><td align="left">Pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Willing to complete daily diary</td><td align="left">Clotting disorders</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Able to attend 8 weekly treatments</td><td align="left">Head or neck trauma in past 2 years</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Cranial/neck surgery in past 2 years</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Cardiac Pacemaker</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Other implanted or external electrical device (e.g. insulin pump)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*International Classification of Headache Disorders, defined by expert members of the International Headache Society</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Exclusion criteria include marked depression, anxiety or psychosis; more than two visits/month for mental health care; more than one psychiatric medication; major medical illness under treatment; pregnancy; clotting disorders; recent head or neck trauma within two years, and presence of a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted or external electrical device (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). While there is no evidence that CST or magnet therapy would harm either the mother or the fetus, the frequency of migraine is often affected by hormonal fluxes such as during and following pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hence, women were excluded who were pregnant, nursing, or initiating hormone replacement therapy. Those with mental illness requiring multiple medications, and those with diagnoses of major depression, anxiety or psychosis, were excluded because of the requirement of detailed daily diary completion as well as the effects of active mental illness in exacerbating migraine. To increase the believability of the LSSM intervention, those with cardiac pacemaker or other electrical devices were excluded, even though it was unlikely that the extremely low-strength magnets would affect these devices.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Subjects are recruited from the following sources: 1) University of North Carolina (UNC) Headache Clinic; 2) local neurology practices; 3) local primary care clinics; 4) broadcast email to UNC students and employees; and 5) advertisements in the regional press. Subjects receive eight sessions of CST or magnet therapy at no cost. They are reimbursed for completing their diaries and questionnaires up to a maximum of $170 for the entire study. Recruitment and study materials are available in both Spanish and English. Hispanic subjects are recruited through advertisements in Spanish-language newspapers and through clinics serving the Hispanic community. A Spanish interpreter is available for help with consenting and to accompany subjects at each treatment session.</p><p>The recruitment strategy has been intentionally broad, targeting headache specialty care, primary care and non-care populations with migraine to avoid missing qualifying subjects and to include subjects with differing levels of care and a range of migraine symptoms. Although migraine is a common disorder, many sufferers either do not seek medical attention or, when they do, are not treated for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Random digit surveys of the general public suggest that less than 50% of those with migraine are currently seeing a physician for that problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, limiting recruitment to those under active medical care for migraine would potentially eliminate more than half the eligible individuals from consideration. In addition, only a small subset of migraine patients seek specialty care; these individuals may be fundamentally different from the global population of migraine patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Limiting recruitment to those individuals would restrict the pool of potential subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening, consent, and enrollment</title><p>Those interested in being part of the study contact the research staff for a telephone screening interview. Those identified through the screening process as potentially eligible subjects are scheduled to meet with the study coordinator for the consenting process and to undergo a baseline medical assessment, including a complete medical history and physical examination by the study neurologist. The study neurologist confirms the diagnosis of migraine and excludes from the study those individuals with other medical problems that could put the patient at risk or confound the study results, e.g., recent head trauma, untreated or uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, or depression. Excluded patients are referred back to their physicians for further medical management. Enrolled subjects are asked to avoid changes in medications, dietary supplements, and non-pharmacologic treatments for headache during the course of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline Period</title><p>Eligible subjects are instructed in the maintenance of a daily headache diary for eight consecutive weeks while continuing usual care. Subjects have the option of completing the diary either on paper and mailing it to the study coordinator, or on a secure internet website. After they have completed 4 weeks of diaries, their entries are reviewed with the study neurologist to determine eligibility for the treatment phase of the study. Eligibility consists of completion of at least 80% of headache diaries and report of at least 5 migraines. Eligible subjects are called and scheduled to visit the therapist for eight weekly sessions. They are asked to continue their headache diaries for the full 20-week duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Subjects are randomized to one of the two treatment arms using a concealed allocation protocol. At the subject's first treatment visit, the study therapist performs a brief intake interview and then opens an opaque, sequentially numbered envelope that identifies which treatment group has been randomly selected for this subject. The randomization scheme uses a permuted block method to generate the intervention assignment sequence being implemented at the treatment location to assure that the randomization balance is maintained throughout enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study therapist</title><p>The study therapist, Laurel J. Wilkinson, is a NC licensed massage and body therapist and registered nurse. She trained in CST under John E. Upledger, M.D. in Michigan in 1979&#x02013;1980 and then completed advanced CST training at the Upledger Institute <italic>[Upledger Institute, 11211 Prosperity Farms # D325, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410]</italic> from 1986&#x02013;1989. Ms. Wilkinson has utilized CST full-time in her practice for the past 18 years. She is an approved Upledger Institute Instructor for CST classes.</p><p>We chose to use only one therapist because, with training and close monitoring, we theorized that a single experienced individual was more likely to achieve a standardized approach to each subject than several therapists in a modality where only weak reliability between practitioners in diagnosis and palpation techniques has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Also, there is evidence that using more than one CST therapist in a study can dilute the outcome effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate possible therapist bias, half of all encounters with subjects are videotaped. Selected recordings are analyzed qualitatively to assess for any systematic differences in her interactions with subjects in the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Masking</title><p>Because of the nature of the interventions, the therapist and subjects cannot be masked. In addition, those individuals on the study team who review the video tapes are unmasked. Other study personnel may learn of treatment assignment in the course of reviewing diaries or other data. Because the study neurologist conducts post treatment exit interviews with the subjects, his masking is broken at that time. Only the biostatistician is completely unaware of the treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>The Intervention Group &#x02013; CST</title><p>Subjects in the intervention group receive usual medical care plus one CST treatment per week for 8 weeks. Because no studies have reported usual or evidence-based treatment schedules for CST, the number of treatments was based on data from our initial, unpublished CST practitioner survey and opinions of experienced therapists in the field. The subject lies supine and fully clothed, except for belts, watches, and shoes, while the therapist proceeds with an evaluation of the craniosacral system. She then assesses and treats connective tissue restrictions of the lower and upper body, the neck, all of the cranial bones and underlying tissues.</p><p>The CST protocol for each subject follows the Upledger Institute approach using the elements shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The therapist keeps detailed notes on an assessment and treatment form developed for the study. Because CST may vary among individual migraine patients based on the therapist's assessment, complete standardization of the treatment protocol was not possible. The therapist may elect to work on any fascial restrictions she finds, as in an ankle or shoulder. At each visit, the protocol calls for a symptom history covering the previous week, blood pressure and heart rate determinations before and after treatment, and a summative global assessment of the craniosacral system (CSF rhythm and points of restricted movements).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of procedural sequence at each visit for craniosacral therapy (CST), 2007&#x02013;2008</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="right">1.</td><td align="left">Brief review of recent headache symptoms and general symptoms and assessment of any adverse effects of treatment</td></tr><tr><td align="right">2.</td><td align="left">Evaluation of the craniosacral rhythm*, including amplitude, quality, and rate</td></tr><tr><td align="right">3.</td><td align="left">Arcing, palpating for active lesions &#x02013; checking for fascial restrictions<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="right">4.</td><td align="left">Fascia releases at pelvis, dural tube traction, L5-S1 decompression, sacro-iliac decompression<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="right">5.</td><td align="left">Fascia releases at lower respiratory, thoracic inlet, hyoid, and cranial base</td></tr><tr><td align="right">6.</td><td align="left">Vertical membrane (falx cerebri) system evaluation and treatment using frontal and parietal bone and soft tissue manipulations</td></tr><tr><td align="right">7.</td><td align="left">Horizontal membrane system (tentorium) evaluation and treatment using sphenoid and temporal bone and soft tissue manipulations</td></tr><tr><td align="right">8.</td><td align="left">Mandibular compression and decompression</td></tr><tr><td align="right">9.</td><td align="left">Hard palate intra-oral evaluation and treatment</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x02003;a. illary-palatine: flexion/extension, torsion, shear, compression</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x02003;b. vomer evaluation: flexion/extension, torsion, shear, compression</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x02003;c. palatine</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x02003;d. zygoma and nasal bones</td></tr><tr><td align="right">10.</td><td align="left">Dural tube evaluation &#x02013; mobility, tension and restrictions<sup>#</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="right">11.</td><td align="left">Still-point induction**</td></tr><tr><td align="right">12.</td><td align="left">Global assessment with percentage improvement</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* The craniosacral rhythm is palpated by the practitioner (at the feet) and assessed for rate, quality, and symmetry.

First, the therapist was videotaped to establish the sequence of activities for subjects undergoing craniosacral and magnet therapy. A standardized sequence of CST was developed to permit a similarity of treatment among the CST subjects. The LSSM protocol was designed to mimic the CST protocol in terms of length of treatment sessions, sequence of interactions with the therapist, and overall treatment experience. During treatment, the subject lies supine on a table surrounded by small magnets, half of which are completely inactive. The active magnets are positioned such that they exert no field strength on the subject's skin or body. At each visit, the therapist confirms this by measuring the strength of the magnets with a Gaussmeter <italic>[DC Magnetometer, Model 1, AlphaLab, Inc., 1280 South 300 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84101]</italic>. Gaussmeter readings are designed to both improve the believability of the therapy and give the therapist something to do during the magnet sequence.</p><p>To further enhance active therapist involvement and simulate the CST maneuvers, additional inactive magnets contained within moveable pads are positioned on the subject in the same body areas treated in the CST protocol and moved to different sites at similar intervals.</p><p>The therapist then practiced the protocol every two weeks for 3 months to achieve a level of comfort with it that would approximate her comfort in administering CST. Although the therapist does not believe that magnet therapy will be effective, she is able to mask her doubts. In the videotaped encounters, we see her giving subjects copies of articles endorsing magnet therapy and we hear her explaining a plausible rationale for its efficacy.</p><p>A sham CST intervention was rejected as unfeasible. First, since the mechanism of CST is not completely known, it is unclear whether a sham procedure might exert a specific and unmeasurable therapeutic benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Preliminary studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have shown a mean HIT score of 63.7 with a standard deviation of 5.2 among migraine patients. Keeping the control values of HIT at this level, we estimate that with 45 subjects in each arm the study will have 80% power to detect a 3.5 points change in the HIT score. Based on our clinical experience we also estimate that, on average, migraine patients experience two headaches per week. With 45 patients per group, the study will have 80% power to detect a reduction in the headache frequency to one per week.</p><p>Regression modeling strategies will be used to test the primary hypothesis. A simple linear regression model with the HIT score at end of the study (16 weeks) controlling for HIT score at the baseline will be used to test for significant treatment effects. We will use repeated measures analysis on HIT measures to detect whether the change in HIT scores are significantly different between the two groups. Because of the correlated nature of the repeated measures, regression models using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach will be used to test the hypothesis of change. A significant time and treatment interaction will detect significant changes in the score. A similar analysis strategy using GEE methods will be used to analyze daily records of headache. All data analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. The GEE method assumes that missingness in data are completely at random. Under the missing at random assumption, it is possible to conduct analysis using multiple imputation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recruitment into the study has proceeded as planned (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).

Since the online diaries have been available, 86% have chosen to use them; 14% have chosen the paper diaries.</p><p>We have found that the online diary is superior to the paper diary for several reasons: (1) Missing data on the online diaries can be identified earlier and subjects can be prompted to remedy it. The paper diary is completed weekly and mailed in; it is not feasible to have subjects correct missing days once mailed to us. (2) Online diary data goes directly into a text file. Although there is still a potential for subject input error, this method eliminates the errors of secondary data entry. The time required for secondary data input is also eliminated. (3) Perhaps because they can type into it, subjects add more comments to the online diaries. We believe this provides a richer data set. (4) Finally, the online diaries are easier to copy. Several of our subjects have asked for a copy of the diary to share with their provider. Their individual diaries can be extracted from the online diary and sent to them at the end of their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Migraine is a common condition associated with significant disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because pharmaceuticals for migraine provide incomplete relief of symptoms and are associated with significant side effects, many individuals seek complementary therapies, such as CST. Up to now, CST has not been studied rigorously. This report supports the feasibility of undertaking a rigorous randomized clinical trial of CST for migraine, using a standardized CST protocol and an innovative control protocol developed for this study.</p><p>In any study of complementary therapy in which there is the likelihood of a substantial placebo and expectation effect, a methodology is needed that permits detailed evaluation of the interaction between therapist and subject. We find that the Noldus system of interactional analysis using videotapes of the treatment sessions is a feasible, though time consuming, technique for achieving this goal. A detailed analysis of the videotapes will lead to refinements of the control (LSSM) protocol such that it more closely matches the intervention (CST) in terms of credibility and expectations of benefit. In addition, a qualitative evaluation of the post-intervention interview will yield important information about subject's satisfaction with the therapies.</p><p>We have established that it is possible to recruit enough subjects with migraine to obtain comparison groups with sufficient analytic power, though an enrollment period of 18 months would be needed to obtain at least 45 subjects in each group. Our data analyses, comparing CST with LSSM will allow us to determine effect sizes appropriate for a larger, definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Authors JDM, SAG, PC, KRF, and LW were involved in developing the original idea for funding.
