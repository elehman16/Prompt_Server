Modern surgical techniques and improved perioperative care have significantly lowered the mortality rate. Infectious complications, however still are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in colorectal surgery. Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is aimed at cleansing the large bowel of fecal content. Bowel preparation by orthograde cleansing prior to colorectal surgery is still commonly recommended in several practical guidelines.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The main intention of such practice is to reduce post-operative complication in addition to easing the intraoperative handling of the bowel. Emptying of colon of its content seemed to be a logical step prior to interventions thus pre-operative cleansing was established as a dogma in the early 70s.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Traditionally, bowel cleansing was achieved using enemas in combination with oral laxatives. More recently oral cathartic agents to induce diarrhea and cleanse the bowel from solid feces were developed. These new bowel preparation agents such as Polyethylene Glycol and Sodium Phosphate provide superior cleansing and are used by most surgeons in preparation for colorectal surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is however paucity of data showing that MBP by itself, separately from other operative and perioperative measures, actually reduces the rate of infectious complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective and randomized control study comprising of 63 patients over the period of March 2008 to May 2010 at Department of General Surgery of a tertiary care institution admitted in inpatient department (emergency as well as elective) who underwent resection and primary anastomosis of left colon and upper rectum. Patients with co-morbid conditions such as Diabetes mellitus and advanced malignancy were excluded, so were the patients with proximal colostomy and those undergoing abdomino-perineal resection. A total sample populations were divided into two equal arms (Patients receiving bowel preparation and patients without bowel preparation) and the outcome of this study were compared between the two groups and also with accepted standards of colorectal surgery. Oral Polyethylene glycol preparation as per manufacturer's instruction along with Phosphate enema All patients were received intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole &#x02013; 1 h prior to Incision and continued for 36 h post-operatively.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Patient refusal, any known allergy or contraindication to polyethylene glycol, hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholism, diabetes, long-term drug therapy, bleeding diathesis, local skin site infections are excluded from this study.</p><p>In pre-operative assessment the patients were enquired about any history of drug allergy, previous operations or prolonged drug treatment. General examination, systemic examinations and assessment of the airway were done. Pre-operative fasting of minimum 6 h was ensured before operation in all day-care cases. All patients received premedication of tablet diazepam 10 mg orally the night before surgery as per pre-anesthetic check-up direction to allay anxiety, apprehension and for sound sleep. Patients also received tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the previous night and in the morning of operation with sips of water.</p><p>Outcomes of surgery were studied clinically, radiologically and by hematological parameters. Complications with reference to anastomotic dehiscence, intra-abdominal septic complication, wound infections; hospital stay-specifically post-operative hospital stays in days and fluid and electrolyte imbalance were recorded. Post-operative total blood investigation and wound swab culture done after 48 h, on 5<sup>th</sup> day and thereafter if necessary. Routine ultrasonographic examination was done on 5<sup>th</sup> day and thereafter if necessary. Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan of abdomen and contrast radiographic examination done in suspected anastomotic dehiscence.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</title><p>In this prospective study 37 (58.73%) patients were between 40 and 60 years. age group, 17 (26.98%) patients were more than 60 years. and 9 (14.28%) patients were between 20 and 40 years [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

All patients received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis before and during surgery. No information on anastomosis technique is given. This study enrolled a total of 380 patients with 78% (296 patients) suffering a neoplastic condition. There was a statistically insignificant decrease in anastomotic leak, wound infection and abdominal abscess rates in the no MBP group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>In 1994, Burke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared orthograde MBP, with sodium picosulfate solution, versus no MBP in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. All patients received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) during and after surgery for 24 h. The anastomosis technique was either manual or mechanical. 17 patients were excluded because bowel continuity was not restored after surgery or a colostomy was performed. This study enrolled a total of 186 patients with 79% (133 patients) suffering a neoplastic condition. No statistical difference in wound infection and anastomotic leak rates were seen between the two groups. Hughes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported on a small randomized trial in 1972. The 46 patients who underwent MBP fared no better than those 51 who did not.</p><p>In 1987, Irving and Scrimgeour[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] wrote a seminal article on 72 consecutive elective and emergency colectomies with primary anastomosis, where all MBP was omitted and the patient was only covered by a single pre-operative dose of cefuroxime and Metronidazole. No anastomotic dehiscence was clinically apparent and wound infection was noted in 8.3% of patients. In 1998, Platell and Hall[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] gave an excellent review of the literature and performed a meta-analysis of three trials in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations. It revealed a markedly greater incidence of wound infection in patients who received MBP (10.8% vs.7.4%).</p><p>In our study, 32 patients were operated after MBP with oral Polyethylene glycol preparation as per manufacturer's instruction along with Phosphate enema and 31 patients without MBP. All patients received intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole &#x02013; 1 h prior to Incision and continued for 36 h post-operatively. The anastomosis technique was manual by a single layer interrupted serosubmucosal suture as advised by Matheson and Irving.</p><p>Among the post-operative complications, anastomotic leakage was detected clinically and radiologically in 2 patients in each group (6.25% with MBP and 6.45% without MBP) and intra-abdominal collections was detected radio logically in 4 patients in each group (12.5% with MBP and 12.9% without tMBP). <italic>P</italic> value was more than 0.5 in both situations, indicating statistically no difference between results of two groups. Wound infections were detected in 12 (37.5%) patients with MBP group and 11 (35.48%) patients without MBP. No statistically significant result was seen in post-operative incidence of persistent fever after 2<sup>nd</sup> post-operative day, post-operative change of blood picture indicating infections and post-operative hospital stay. Pre-operative electrolyte imbalance was more commonly noticed in older age group patients who presented with intestinal obstruction, but statistically no difference was found in between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Utilization of pre-operative MBP in colorectal surgery has been evaluated in many clinical and experimental studies. Fecal loading and spillage have been reported as contributory factors to anastomotic leakage. Therefore, MBP can prevent fecal content from coming in contact with the small gaps between the sutures on the anastomotic line and thereby prevent fecal soiling of the peritoneal cavity. Based on these assumptions, most colorectal surgeons believe MBP is necessary for safe colorectal surgery. The present results suggest that the omission of MBP does not impair healing of colonic anastomosis; neither increases the risk of leakage.</p><p>Due to the small sample size in this study, there remains a chance of statistical error. There is a need for more prospective clinical studies with large sample size to evaluate the role of MBP in outcomes of colorectal surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Glenn</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>McSherry</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Carcinoma of the distal large bowel: 32-year review of 1,026 cases</article-title><source>Ann Surg</source><year>1966</year><volume>163</volume><fpage>838</fpage><lpage>49</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5933798</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duxbury</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Brodribb</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Oppong</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hosie</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of colorectal cancer: Variations in practice in one hospital</article-title><source>Eur J Surg Oncol</source><year>2003</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>400</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12711298</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Fazio</surname><given-names>VW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current preoperative bowel cleansing methods.
