Hormone replacement therapy is often either undesirable or contraindicated. Safe, effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. We investigated whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help breast cancer survivors to effectively manage HFNS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women from breast clinics in London, UK, who had problematic HFNS (minimum ten problematic episodes a week) after breast-cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either usual care or usual care plus group CBT (1:1). Randomisation was done in blocks of 12&#x02013;20 participants, stratifying by age (younger than 50 years, 50 years or older), and was done with a computer-generated sequence. The trial statistician and researchers collecting outcome measures were masked to group allocation. Group CBT comprised one 90 min session a week for 6 weeks, and included psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage HFNS. Assessments were done at baseline, 9 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in HFNS problem rating (1&#x02013;10) between CBT and usual care groups at 9 weeks after randomisation. Analysis of the primary endpoint was done by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered, ISRCTN13771934, and was closed March 15, 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between May 5, 2009, and Aug 27, 2010, 96 women were randomly allocated to group CBT (n=47) or usual care (n=49). Group CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 9 weeks after randomisation compared with usual care (mean difference &#x02212;1&#x000b7;67, 95% CI &#x02212;2&#x000b7;43 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;91; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and improvements were maintained at 26 weeks (mean difference &#x02212;1&#x000b7;76, &#x02212;2&#x000b7;54 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;99; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). We recorded no CBT-related adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Group CBT seems to be a safe and effective treatment for women who have problematic HFNS after breast cancer treatment with additional benefits to mood, sleep, and quality of life. The treatment could be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes and delivered by trained breast cancer nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Cancer Research UK.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK and, as a result of improved early detection and treatment, more women are now living longer with or surviving the disease.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) affect 65&#x02013;85% of women treated for breast cancer, often occurring while women are still adjusting to the effects of cancer treatments.

Women attending breast or oncology clinics in southeast London, UK, were offered the trial by clinicians and research nurses. They could also apply for inclusion by responding to leaflets and posters displayed in clinics.</p><p>English-speaking women older than 18 years were eligible if they had had at least ten problematic HFNS per week (confirmed by a 2-week diary and a screening interview) for a duration of 2 months or more, had completed medical treatment for breast cancer (surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy), and had no evidence of other cancers or metastases. Women taking adjuvant endocrine treatment were eligible. Because many women use treatments for HFNS but still have troublesome symptoms and seek further treatment, they were not excluded if they had been using the treatment consistently for 2 months or more, and planned to continue at the same dose during the trial. Those unable to attend sessions or who were seeking treatment for mood disorders rather than for HFNS were not eligible. All participants gave written, informed consent before taking part. Ethical approval was obtained from the UK NHS Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Randomisation was done in cohort groups. After baseline assessment and receipt of consent from 12&#x02013;20 participants, the trial clinical psychologist (MJS) sent participants' identification details to a programmer at the Clinical Trials Unit at King's College London, UK, for randomisation. The number of women in each cohort was determined on the basis of an estimation of an optimum of six to ten participants in group CBT. The programmer created a computer-generated randomisation sequence, allocating participants in a one-to-one ratio, stratified by age (&#x0003c;50 years, &#x02265;50 years), with randomly varying block size. This process was repeated for each cohort group so that allocation did not affect the allocation sequence of subsequent cohorts. The clinical psychologist, who did the group CBT treatment, was sent the allocation results and then informed participants of their treatment allocation. Although neither participants nor the clinical psychologist could be masked to group allocation, researchers collecting outcome data and analysing results were masked. Specifically, at 9-week and 26-week assessments, women were met by a separate researcher who collected questionnaires and who also asked the women not to disclose their treatment allocation to the researcher who did the outcome assessments. To check whether the trial coordinator (EM) was successfully masked, after 9-week assessments for each cohort she noted which group she thought participants had been allocated to. Masking was successful, with the allocation of 51% of participants correctly identified. The trial statistician was masked to group identity until analyses were complete.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Assessments took place at baseline, 9 weeks after randomisation (typically 2 weeks after treatment), and 26 weeks after randomisation. About 2 weeks before participants attended a baseline assessment, a researcher explained the study, assessed eligibility by telephone, and posted written information and a 2-week diary to be updated on a daily basis to record HFNS frequency. At baseline assessment, eligibility was confirmed; participants were able to ask questions before signing a standard consent form. Women were asked about their breast cancer treatment history, menopause symptoms, and medical history. They completed a questionnaire covering demographic characteristics and baseline measures and were given a small SSC monitor and a magnetic event marker bracelet worn for 24 h. They were asked to indicate when they had an HFNS by passing the magnet over the monitor; they were encouraged to do usual activities and were shown how to remove the monitor to shower or bathe.</p><p>Participants allocated to receive group CBT attended a 90 min session every week for 6 weeks, between June, 2009, and October, 2010 (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 1</xref>). A treatment manual was produced in advance of the study, which contained detailed session content, presentation slides and handouts, and notes for facilitators. A clinical psychologist was trained to deliver the sessions with the help of an assistant (five assistants took part over the course of the study). All sessions were audio taped, then 10% were randomly selected (with a computer-generated random number sequence) and a psychologist (MSH) experienced in cognitive behavioural therapy for HFNS, rated them for adherence to the treatment manual, by indicating on coding sheets the extent to which the group leader covered each topic. Coding sheets included specific components of the intervention (eg, reviewing homework, providing information about the role of stress, demonstrating paced breathing in the session, group discussion of behaviours relating to HFNS) developed for the trial (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>All participants received usual care&#x02014;they had access to clinical specialists and cancer support services, either through routine follow-up appointments or as part of a breast cancer survivorship programme in southeast London (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 1</xref>). At the second assessment (9 weeks after randomisation) they repeated the baseline questionnaires and 24-h SSC HFNS monitoring, and documented any health and lifestyle changes as well as use of services and treatments in the previous 9 weeks (the latter was used to index usual care in both treatment groups). At 26 weeks after randomisation, questionnaires were sent containing the same measures; face to face or telephone interviews were done by an independent psychologist after final measures were completed to obtain women's responses to being in the trial and their views about the treatment (for those in the CBT group). HFNS treatments used during the trial were recorded for each participant at each timepoint. Follow-up was completed by March 15, 2011.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the HFNS problem rating (hot flush rating scale<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>) at 9 weeks after randomisation.

A 6-cm by 6-cm monitor measured SSC every 10 s by passing an electric current across two electrodes attached to the sternal region of the chest. Women also indicated occurrence of a hot flush by passing a magnetic event marker over the monitor, which recorded the time. HFNS were defined by increases of 2 &#x003bc;S or more occurring within 30 s, and not within 15 min duration since the previous HFNS.

The WHQ is comprised of 37 items that assess, for example, an individual's depressed mood, anxiety or fears, and problems sleeping. Participants rate each item on a 4-point scale, according to the extent to which they are experiencing each item, and subscale scores are calculated, ranging from 0&#x02013;1 (higher scores indicate poorer wellbeing). The depressed mood subscale has concurrent validity with the GHQ and the WHQ has good internal reliability for subscales (Cronbach &#x003b1; 0&#x000b7;70&#x02013;0&#x000b7;84) and test-retest reliability (0&#x000b7;78&#x02013;0&#x000b7;96). Five subscales were included: depressed mood, anxiety or fears, sleep problems, memory or concentration, and somatic symptoms.

Number and type of adverse events were examined in both groups to assess treatment safety in accordance with the protocol. The trial data management committee reviewed adverse events and assessed whether they were related to the intervention. Recurrence of breast cancer, skin irritation due to the hot flush monitor, and clinically significant deterioration in mood were identified as possible expected unrelated adverse events, and clinically significant deterioration in mood as a result of group CBT was identified as a potential treatment-related adverse event. The trial clinical psychologist recorded incidents of mood deterioration and referred patients for treatment, as appropriate.

Analyses were based on modified intention-to-treat sample (excluding those who contributed no data). We assessed the primary outcome with a linear mixed model; covariates were treatment group, baseline HFNS problem rating score, the stratification factor age (as a dichotomous category, split at 50 years), and time. A time-by-treatment interaction term was included to allow estimates at the individual timepoints to be summarised. The model for problem rating incorporated two levels of random intercepts by participant and cohort group. The modelling was done with the assumption that data were missing at random and predictors of missing data (treatment group) were included in the modelling. We used a logistic model to assess predictors of missing data, and to examine all baseline clinical and demographic variables. Categorical outcomes, including adverse events were compared with Fisher's exact test. We also analysed secondary outcomes with mixed linear regression models with random participant and cohort group intercepts and a time-by-treatment interaction term; covariates in the model were treatment group, baseline value of outcome, the stratification factor age, and time. Proportions and associated CIs were estimated from Wilson's binomial distribution. Results from all analyses were summarised at 9 weeks and 26 weeks with two-sided 95% CIs. We used Stata (version 11.0) for all statistical analyses.

We recorded small improvements in memory and concentration of participants in the CBT group compared with those in the usual care group, but no statistically significant differences in somatic symptoms (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). At 26 weeks, women in the CBT group reported significantly better social functioning, physical functioning, and improved general health (at both 9 weeks and 26 weeks) than did women in the usual care group, according to the SF-36 assessments (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Compared with women in the usual care group, women in the CBT group reported better mental health at 9 weeks and less bodily pain at 26 weeks (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). We recorded no significant differences between the groups in emotional role functioning or vitality subscales (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p><p>Although we did not record a mean two-point difference between treatment groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>), a greater percentage of individuals had reached this two-point threshold in the CBT group than in the usual care group at both 9 weeks (65% [95% CI 50&#x02013;78] <italic>vs</italic> 38% [25&#x02013;52]) and 26 weeks (78% [62&#x02013;88] <italic>vs</italic> 33% [20&#x02013;48]). This exploratory analysis suggests that improvement from baseline was clinically better in the CBT group than it was in the usual care group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In the 10% of sessions assessed for quality assurance, CBT was delivered according to the treatment manual, with 98&#x02013;100% adherence. Training and clinical supervision were provided by a consultant clinical psychologist (MSH) throughout the study. Participant adherence to treatment was good; 39 (91%) of 43 participants who received CBT attended at least four of six sessions, and relaxation or paced breathing was practised, on average, 29 times each week (SD 26&#x000b7;93).</p><p>Individuals taking prescribed drugs for HFNS tended to continue them throughout the trial. Exceptions were one participant who stopped taking fluoxetine (CBT group), and one woman who stopped taking clonidine (usual care group). Three women started homoeopathy or herbal remedies (one in the CBT group, two in the usual care group), and one woman in the usual care group started acupuncture. When the adjusted primary analyses were repeated excluding these five participants, the estimates and CIs remained within the same margins (week 9 hot flush problem rating, CBT <italic>vs</italic> usual care mean difference &#x02212;1&#x000b7;58, 95% CI &#x02212;2&#x000b7;38 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;79; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001; week 26 hot flush problem rating, CBT <italic>vs</italic> usual care mean difference &#x02212;1&#x000b7;77, &#x02212;2&#x000b7;59 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;95; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p><p>We recorded six adverse events, three in the CBT group and three in the usual care group. One participant died of an unrelated disorder before the treatment phase (usual care group), we recorded two reoccurrences of breast cancer (one in each group), and one woman reported low mood unrelated to the trial (CBT group). Two women (both in the usual care group) had mild reactions to the hot flush monitor (a reaction to the adhesive used on the electrode patch). None of the adverse events were related to CBT.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that CBT is safe, acceptable, and effective in helping women to manage hot flushes and night sweats after breast cancer treatment, with additional benefits to mood, sleep, and some aspects of quality of life. After group CBT, women reported less problematic HFNS than did those receiving usual care, and these improvements were maintained at both the 9-week and 26-week follow-up. Although the pre-specified endpoint of a between-group difference of 2 points on the problem-rating scale was not met, there was a statistically significant improvement in the CBT group, and a large proportion of women (78%) who had received CBT achieved a reduction of 2 points compared with the usual care group (33%) at 26 weeks. However, we recorded no significant difference in the frequency of HFNS between the two groups at either 9 weeks or 26 weeks. Similarly, we recorded no significant differences between groups in 24 h rate of HFNS after the treatment phase, either physiologically (SSC) defined or participant recorded (event monitor). Nevertheless, the effects of CBT on HFNS problem rating were substantial and robust. Most women participating in group CBT reported reductions in problem rating that are regarded as clinically important, and there were sustained significant differences in problem rating between CBT and usual care. These differences were not unduly affected by outliers or other influential points (ie, the average group changes were significant), and the sample contained more precise standard deviations than we expected.</p><p>Additionally, group CBT provided sustained benefits to depressed mood and sleep and some improvements in dimensions of quality of life. At baseline, on average, participants had higher scores for sleep problems, somatic symptoms, and memory and concentration (WHQ) compared with norms for healthy women (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> and data not shown).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> According the the SF-36 scale, they had lower scores (lower quality of life) than did healthy women, especially for physical role functioning, general health, vitality, and bodily pain. The significant improvements in mood and sleep, as well as memory and concentration, after CBT are clinically important because difficulties with mood sleep and cognitive functions are commonly reported by patients with breast cancer, particularly by those with HFNS.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Moreover, the improvement in social functioning after CBT is relevant because women report finding hot flushes especially difficult to deal with at work and in other social situations.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Although randomised controlled trials of non-hormonal drugs for HFNS have shown moderate reductions in HFNS frequency, they have recorded little evidence of improved quality of life.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Similarly, some studies show only weak relations between frequency of HFNS and quality of life.<xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref></p><p>The results of our study are very similar to the preliminary findings of a parallel trial of CBT for HFNS in a sample of healthy women (MENOS2).<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This consistent pattern of results suggests that the CBT might work by affecting symptom perception and cognitive appraisal of HFNS and possibly mood, rather than physiological mechanisms of HFNS, such as temperature regulation or the thermoneutral zone in the hypothalamus.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Further analyses of moderators and mediators of HFNS are planned to clarify this issue through identification of the underlying causal pathways to improvement on the hot flush problem rating scale.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> For example, changes in sleep after treatment might partly mediate the improvements in mood and quality of life. We postulate that hot-flush beliefs and behaviours, as well as mood and sleep, will act as potential mediators. For the moderator analysis, baseline clinical and demographical characteristics, such as anxiety and depression, will be considered alongside factors such as drug use and health behaviours. Further studies should examine particular components of the intervention to test these analyses experimentally.</p><p>We postulated that CBT would reduce HFNS frequency to a greater extent than would usual care, especially because paced breathing has been shown to reduce HFNS frequency measured both physiologically and subjectively.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Women receiving CBT reported practising paced breathing daily. Paced breathing, once learnt, is practised for 2&#x02013;5 min throughout the day and at the onset of a hot flush, so an average of 29 times per week is a realistic rate at which to practise. However, participants in both groups reported improvements in HFNS frequency. Women in the usual care group did receive psychoeducation, advice (which included paced breathing), and nursing support, which could have led to reductions in the usual care group, although we did not record paced breathing or other techniques done by these women. CBT treatment effects could have been attributable to the placebo effect of additional attention in the group CBT. However, we controlled for usual care and assessment effects and we should gain some insight into the placebo effects of usual care through the planned mediator and moderator analysis.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Further research could compare different types of control conditions with differing levels of information, advice, and support. The group CBT programme should be generalisable to other breast cancer settings because it is delivered in a hospital setting, is done by use of easily transferable guidelines (the treatment manual), and adherence to the guidelines was high. Drop-out rates were low, and the preliminary results of qualitative interviews done at the end of the trial suggest that the CBT was highly acceptable. The cost of delivering the treatment needs to be assessed, with a need for comparison with non-hormonal drugs. The most cost-effective method of delivering the group CBT would probably be to include it as part of survivorship support programme, delivered by trained and supervised breast-care nurses.</p><p>To date, the best available treatments have been non-hormonal drugs including SSRI and SNRIs, clonidine, and gabapentin.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> These treatments have produced moderate reductions in HFNS frequency (averaging 37% across trials<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>), but have had little effect on quality-of-life measures. By contrast our findings suggest that both CBT and usual care resulted in a 38% reduction in frequency, and compared with the usual care group, those who received CBT showed statistically significant and lasting reductions in problem rating and improvements in quality of life. CBT could, therefore, be an important alternative or additional treatment option for patients with breast cancer (<xref rid="box2" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 2</xref>).</p><p>Limitations of this study include the frequency measures, which had high variability. The main subjective measure (hot flush rating scale) is retrospective&#x02014;daily diary measures might be more reliable. However, findings from another study show evidence of the validity of this scale compared with daily diary measures.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Estimation of the frequency of night sweats with the hot flush rating scale can be more difficult because women do not report night sweats that they sleep through, but this limitation is common to all self-report measures. The physiological measure was used for 24 h at baseline and at 9 weeks after randomisation; in view of the variability of this measure, future studies might include a longer time of SSC monitoring and also include this measure at follow-up assessments. Additionally, we did not control for all potential confounding factors that could have an effect on menopausal symptoms, such as the use of drugs to manage HFNS and the use of adjuvant hormone therapy. Health behaviours might also have affected HFNS and other secondary outcomes, but were not controlled for in the analyses (eg, caffeine intake). Finally, we do not know whether HFNS were caused by breast cancer treatments or whether women were naturally menopausal when they had breast cancer. However, treatment options are still restricted for these women, so a need still exists for non-hormonal interventions.</p><p>Our findings suggest that this cognitive behavioural treatment, designed to be delivered by trained health professionals such as breast-care nurses, has the potential to improve long-term health outcomes for patients with breast cancer, and could be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group

Paced breathing and relaxation were practised at each session and participants were given a relaxation and paced breathing audio CD to practise at home daily and during hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). Women recorded their HFNS in weekly diaries.</p><p>Session one introduced the cognitive behavioural model including physiological, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional components of HFNS; provided information about the physiology of HFNS; and introduced paced breathing. Participants described their experiences of HFNS in the context of breast cancer, outlined their goals for treatment, discussed and recorded particular triggers of hot flushes, and practised relaxation.</p><p>Session two focused on the role of stress in potentiating HFNS and CBT strategies for the reduction of stress and anxiety. Paced breathing was introduced and practised as homework.</p><p>Session three focused on cognitive (eg, catastrophic thinking and overly negative beliefs about hot flushes) and behavioural reactions (eg, avoidance of activities) to hot flushes. Participants planned ways to manage flushes in social situations and paced breathing to manage flushes was introduced. They practised paced breathing at onset of a flush and implemented cognitive behavioural strategies to manage hot flushes as homework. They also completed sleep diaries in preparation for the sleep sessions.</p><p>Session four focused on understanding night sweats and improving sleep habits and the application of behavioural strategies to reduce wakefulness after night sweats. Participants identified ways in which they could change sleep habits, which they implemented as homework.</p><p>Session five focused on the cognitive component of sleep problems, including sleep-related anxieties or general worries leading to further wakefulness. CBT strategies were developed for the management of night sweats.</p><p>Session six was a review session and participants made action plans to maintain cognitive and behavioural changes, including dealing with setbacks.</p><p><bold>Usual care</bold></p><p>All women had completed active breast cancer treatment and were typically followed up every 6 months by an oncologist or clinical nurse specialist, with additional appointments as needed. Additionally, those treated in UK National Health Service hospitals in southeast London were offered telephone support as part of the cancer survivorship programme. Women were sent an information leaflet produced by Breast Cancer Care and offered telephoned support every 2 weeks (average seven telephone calls, maximum ten). Nurses gave information about HFNS, advised on treatment options and practical ways of symptom management, and offered instructions for paced breathing and relaxation. 77 (80%) participants had access to the survivorship programme. The remainder were no longer attending follow-up appointments at the hospital (n=7), or were not treated at hospitals in the southeast London cancer network (n=12). Therefore, individuals in the usual care group received information and had access to high quality support services.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="box2"><label>Panel 2</label><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Systematic review</bold></p><p>We searched OvidSP using a combination of the terms cognitive &#x0201c;behavio*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hot flush*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hot flash*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;menopaus*&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;breast cancer&#x0201d;. We found three relevant studies. One study was the MENOS1 single-group pilot trial,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in which weekly 1&#x000b7;5 h sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 6 weeks resulted in an average 49% reduction in problem rating and 38% reduction in hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) frequency, maintained at 3 months' follow-up. A larger randomised controlled trial of CBT and exercise,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> which used the group protocol manual developed for MENOS 1,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> reported preliminary findings in which frequency and problem-rating reduced compared with usual care, although detailed findings are not available. In another single-group trial,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> an instructional DVD of paced breathing and distraction used over the course of 1 week resulted in small reductions in bothersomeness and interference of HFNS and no change in physiologically measured hot flush frequency. CBT shows some promise but adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>Our findings show that group CBT can reduce the effect of hot flushes and night sweats for women who have had breast cancer treatment. These reductions were sustained and associated with improvements in mood, sleep, and quality of life. Group CBT seems to be a safe, acceptable, and effective treatment option which can be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes and delivered by trained breast cancer nurses.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
