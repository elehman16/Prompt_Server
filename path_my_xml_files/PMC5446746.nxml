Recent research found a potentially important role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in delirium of critically ill patients on non-surgical ICU or in non-cardiac-surgery patients. We tested the hypothesis that AChE and BChE have an impact on patients after cardiac surgery with postoperative delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from the local ethics committee, this mechanistic study gathered data of all 217 patients included in a randomized controlled trial testing non-pharmacological modifications of care in the cardiac surgical ICU to reduce delirium.</p><p>Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (<italic>CAM-ICU</italic>) and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (<italic>Nu-DESC</italic>) twice a day for the first 3&#x000a0;days after surgery. Further outcome variables were somatic laboratory parameters and variables regarding surgery, anesthesia, and postsurgical recovery. 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l venous or arterial blood was drawn and AChE and BChE were determined with <italic>ChE check mobile</italic> from Securetec.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 217 patients, 60 (27.6%) developed postsurgical delirium (POD). Patients with POD were older (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005), had anemia (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), and worse kidney function (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006). Furthermore, these patients had lower intraoperative cerebral saturation (NIRS) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and higher intraoperative need of catecholamines (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Delirious patients showed more inflammatory response (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). AChE and BChE values were mainly inside the norm. Patients with values outside the norm did not have POD more often than others. Regarding AChE and BChE patients did not differ in having delirium or not (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.10).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Postoperative measurement of AChE and BChE did not discern between patients with and without POD. The effect of the cardiac surgical procedure on AChE and BChE remains unclear. Further studies with patients in cardiac surgery are needed to evaluate a possible combination of delirium and the cholinergic transmitter system. There might be possible interactions with AChE/BChE and blood products and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, which should be investigated more intensively.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>German Clinical Trials Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/setLocale_EN.do">DRKS00006217</ext-link>

The symptoms tend to fluctuate during the day and cannot be explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Delirium is a complex symptom which is very common in operative and non-operative disciplines in the course of hospital stay. The incidence is especially high among patients undergoing heart surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The incidence in this patient population has been described to be from 30 up to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The duration of delirium has a relevant negative impact on various clinical outcomes. Patients stay longer on the ICU, they suffer from more complications, are immobilized for a longer period of time, have a higher 6-months-mortality, and have long-term cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The causes for delirium are numerous. Intoxication, drugs, alcohol, hypoglycaemia, hypoxia, or anemia might lead to cognitive dysfunction. The pre-, intra-, and postoperative status of patients might also trigger symptoms of delirium. Especially, a pre-existing dementia, fluid loss, abnormal electrolyte concentrations, use of benzodiazepines, and hypotension belong to those trigger factors. Especially older patients tend to develop delirium more often. This might be a result of hearing impairment, changes of the environment, and a limited bladder- and bowl function; in particular, during stay in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Other hypotheses assume an influence of infection and stress (also postoperative stress) with a higher level of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6) and a higher level of cortisol inside the cerebrospinal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition, neuronal metabolism and changes in transmitter interaction have been implicated to play a central role in delirium (e.g., acetylcholine and dopamine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies show that patients with preoperative lower levels of cholinesterase are postoperatively more often diagnosed with delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Those patients might have a higher function of serum-cholinesterase. Additionally, pilot studies show that the use of indirect parasympathomimetics (e.g., physostigmine) may reduce the severity of delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Worek et al. found a procedure which provides a simple method for sensitive and precise determination of AChE in whole blood samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Due to recent studies that found a potentially important mechanistic role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in delirium of critically ill patients on non-surgical ICU or in non-cardiac surgery patients, the main focus of this paper was to examine AChE and BChE in patients after cardiac surgery and their association with postoperative delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>We designed a mechanistic study of data from all patients included in a randomized controlled trial.

Patients were classified as ASA-PS III in 92.6% (patients with illnesses with marked impairment). All patients received a balanced anesthesia with propofol, sufentanil, remifentanil and sevoflurane. Most patients had coronary surgery (40.6%). The mean duration of the anesthetic procedure was 5.5&#x000a0;h, surgery lasted about 4.75&#x000a0;h. Cardiac bypass time was 2&#x000a0;h in average. Patients were sedated and ventilated for about 3.5&#x000a0;h in postoperative ICU care. All patients got opiates for analgesia. In case they developed delirium, they got lorazepam or haloperidol.

Results of this study did not show a difference in AChE and BChE of patients suffering from delirium than those who did not.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This analysis was designed as a mechanistic study from all patients included in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators were blinded against each other. Those two facts show the quality and strength of this study. Additionally, patients were visited twice a day which takes the cycling of delirious symptoms into account. Furthermore, most patients undergoing heart surgery participated and responded very well. The dependent variable (the occurrence of postoperative delirium) was assessed with CAM-ICU and Nu-DESC. Both screening tools are characterized by its good test quality criteria (sensitivity and specificity) and the easy use for critically ill patients on the ICU. Additionally, testing was performed by a qualified investigator who was independent of the work on the ICU. As shown in the section of results, this study could reproduce previous findings in delirious patients. The differences in patients with and without delirium are plausibly significant. As well as other studies have already shown patients with delirium were older, had more often anemia, were mechanically ventilated longer, had longer ICU and hospital stays; furthermore, as previously shown, those patients had a higher rate of cognitive dysfunction. These facts indicate the strength and validity of this analysis.</p><p>Limitations of this study might be the short duration of 3&#x000a0;days measurement, no preoperative values of AChE and BChE as well as no long-term follow-up was performed. Blood was taken from each patient; in case the analysis could not be performed immediately, the sample was cooled down in a refrigerator. Maybe values of AChE and BChE changed in combination with lower temperatures. During analysis, the blood needed to be mixed with a substance in the cap; maybe there is a difference in strength of shaking and final discrepancies of the mixed samples. Furthermore, it was only one measurement performed with each sample, so no control values could be achieved.</p><p>In addition, not all patients got a measurement due to technical problems (long wait for material) and removed central line catheters which implicated missing values afterwards.</p><p>Previous studies assumed an interaction of delirium and the immune and cholinergic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and identified plasma cholinesterase activity as a useful biomarker to identify patients with a higher risk for postoperative delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As shown in this study AChE increased within the first 3&#x000a0;days after surgery and BChE decreased. We do know from previous studies that serum cholinesterase (BChE) is the major enzyme hydrolysing AChE in the blood. The role of this enzyme during inflammation has not been fully understood yet. However, studies show that the reduction of BChE activity could early indicate the onset on the systemic inflammatory response. Therefore, BChE could decline due to the inflammatory response in the neurosystem after surgery.</p><p>Studies with an interventional approach using cholinesterase inhibitors such as physostigmine were performed. Dawson et al. proposed the use in anticholinergic delirium that did not respond to non-pharmacological delirium management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, Jackson et al. assumed that simple enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission may not be sufficient enough to treat delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Most studies which were previously performed did not include patients undergoing cardiac surgery. There are various studies with patients in general surgery or on the internal ICU.</p><p>Potentially, there is an interaction of AChE and BChE and the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass. A different medication is used for those patients as well. Furthermore, patients after cardiac surgery are critically ill and do need transfusion of blood products. Until now no studies were performed which evaluated AChE and BChE and possible interactions of blood products. A recent study with patients undergoing venoarterial ECMO therapy after cardiac surgery however revealed BChE as a strong predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Another fact to mention is the different concentration of AChE at the perisynaptic space and the blood. Although previous studies show that the blood concentration is strongly related to the rate of delirium and a method for testing was developed, the pathophysiology is not clearly understood yet.</p><p>The latest systematic review about published RCTs evaluated the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for delirium treatment. No efficacy for the prevention or management of delirium could be found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Incidence of delirium measured with CAM-ICU was much lower than with Nu-DESC. Possible reasons might be more subjective evaluation of patients with Nu-DESC. Patients just need two points out of ten to be marked positive for delirium; that means already two items can be judged as low remarkable. Patients after cardiac surgery might easily be scored with positive items due to long duration of surgery. In general, those patients are more often very critically ill which also supports this statement. Another aspect might however also be that delirium assessment with Nu-DESC might identify patients in a prodromal stage of delirium. Furthermore, both methods have a different approach. Nu-DESC is a test with external assessment, <italic>CAM-ICU</italic> needs a reaction and interaction of the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we could reproduce results regarding delirium as previously shown. Delirium is a serious complex of various symptoms, which need to be recognized early to initiate a correct and effective treatment. In this analysis, no difference of AChE and BChE in cardiosurgical patients with or without postoperative delirium could be found.</p><p>Further studies are needed to evaluate a possible connection of delirium and the cholinergic transmitter system. Studies which investigate the pathophysiology of the cholinergic system are essential. Furthermore, a possible association of cardiosurgical patients on the ICU and the cholinergic transmitter system should be examined. Studies measuring acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in surgical patients should include preoperative values and need to be continued during surgery and postoperatively (probably over more than three days after surgery). Not to mention the fact that the use of anticholingeric medication should be handled with care. Furthermore, the measurement should be performed more than twice a day and probably even at night. Due to the fact that mostly patients after cardiac surgery develop delirium, and due to the negative impact on clinical outcomes, more studies with this patient population should be conducted in the future.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title><bold>Abbreviations</bold></title><def-list><def-item><term>AChE</term><def><p>Acetylcholinesterase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMT</term><def><p>Abbreviated mental test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA-PS</term><def><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists&#x02013;Physical Status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BChE</term><def><p>Butyrylcholinesterase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIS</term><def><p>Bispectral index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAM-ICU</term><def><p>Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p>Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK-MB</term><def><p>Creatine kinase, myocardial subtype</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-5</term><def><p>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECMO</term><def><p>Extra-corporal-membrane-oxygenation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS-D</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#x02014;German version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-1/IL-6</term><def><p>Interleukin-1/-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LVEF</term><def><p>Left ventricular ejection fraction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M</term><def><p>Mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIRS</term><def><p>Near-infrared spectroscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p>Numeric rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Nu-DESC</term><def><p>Nursing Delirium Screening Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>p</term><def><p>
