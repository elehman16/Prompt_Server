strengthening due to squat with isometric hip adduction and hip abduction in side-lying
exercise on knee joint function index and pain in meniscal surgery patients. [Subjects and
Methods] This study selected sample of 26 patients who had meniscal surgery more than 4
weeks ago. The patients were divided into squat with isometric hip adduction exercise
group I (n=8), hip abduction in side-lying exercise group II (n=9), and combined exercise
group III. The lysholm score was used to evaluate knee joint function and visual analog
scale was used to evaluate pain index of knee joint. [Results] Two-way repeated measures
ANOVA was used to analyze the lysholm score and visual analog scale and showed significant
interaction between the groups and durations. [Conclusion] Strengthening vastus medialis
oblique and gluteus medius improved functional recovery and pain reduction of knee joint
in meniscal injury surgery patients. Gluteus medius strengthening exercise is essential to
meniscal injury surgery patients and should be included in rehabilitation program in early
stages to be conducted systematically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Meniscus injury</kwd><kwd>Gluteus medius</kwd><kwd>Muscle stength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Meniscus used to be considered as nonfunctional structure. However, in fact, it increases
efficient contact surface between femur and tibia and minimizes loads per unit area to
decrease contact pressure to articular cartilage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meniscal injury causes knee extension block in daily life as a
characteristic finding, pain, limping gait, crepitus and giving way during stair or gravel
gait<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, knee joint stiffness because of locking leads to
limitation of motion.</p><p>Therefore, remarkable atrophy in vastus medialis oblique (VMO) among quadriceps femoris
occurs without exception<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscular
imbalance of VMO with vastus lateralis (VL) and delayed muscle onset time during knee
extension generate excessive lateral movement of patella<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Change in pathway of patella during movement causes excessive loads
on subchondral bone<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This will result in lower extremity malalignment.</p><p>Instability of knee joint can change neuromuscular control system of lower limbs followed
by abnormal changes in core muscles that control hip joint such as gluteus maximus (Gmax)
and gluteus medius (GMed)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gmed
malfunction and decreased muscle activity cause adduction and internal rotation in hip joint
during weight bearing while walking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Like in the case of VMO weakness, this
increases Q-angle, causes genu valgum and moves patella to lateral side to increase valgus
vector<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, importance of VMO strengthening and selective strengthening of GMed should be
emphasized to consistently improve symptoms of knee joint meniscal injury<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, recent studies relating to knee joint rehabilitation after meniscal surgery only
analyzed comparison of muscle activity ratio between VMO and VL or muscle activity of
GMed.</p><p>Therefore, this study analyzed the effect of improvement in muscle strengths of both VMO
and GMed after meniscal surgery on knee joint function index and pain to provide effective
and useful information for the physical therapeutic treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected sample of 26 patients who were aged from 20 to 40, diagnosed with

abduction in side-lying (ABD), and combined exercise group III.</p><p>For the intervention method of group I, the participant&#x02019;s knee joint flexion was set to 45
degrees using a goniometer. The participant stood with his back to the wall. For femur and
tibia to maintain neutral position, the patient was controlled to avoid hip joint adduction
keeping the center of patella in line with the second toe. A pillow was placed in the middle
of both patella and the knees were flexed to 45 degrees (squatting position) and then the

squatting 10 times, the participant had 10-second break between the 20-minute exercise. For
the ABD starting position of group II, the hip and knees were fixed to be flexed to 45
degrees and 90 degrees retrospectively in a side lying position and the back and foot-floor
were fixed on the wall. The participant abducted the hip to 40 degrees with the thera-band
looped around the knees and came back to the original position<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis of 10RM (repetition maximum), ability to
repeat the movement 10 times, the participant had 10-second break between the 20-minute

patients who had meniscal surgery 4 weeks ago in terms of VMO strengthening and selective
strengthening of GMed and analyzed the lysholm score and VAS.</p><p>Squat is a closed kinetic chain exercise that uses various joints and muscles in one
action. It is an effective and safe intervention method because co-contraction of
surrounding muscles of knee increases and tension on anterior cruciate ligament is
minimized<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the squat intervention,
a pillow was placed between the knees to maintain neutral position and semi-squat to 45
degrees flexion was conducted to selectively strengthen VMO and induce isometric hip joint
adduction<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, the lysholm
score of the squat group increased. This result occurred because femur and tibia maintained
neutral position and SIHA exercise was performed with knee joints flexed to 45 degrees in
this study. Thus, VMO activity was strengthened rather than VL and iliotibial tract and
lateral knee vector quantity was controlled so that patella could move through normal
pathway. Nyland et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the
squat exercise with isometric hip joint adduction would increase GMed activity because it is
related to pelvic stability and controls femur internal rotation.</p><p>GMed weakness causes overactivity and shortness of tensor fasciae latae and Iliotibial
tract and gonarthritis because of lack of lateral knee joint stability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This means that patients with meniscal surgery need
selective strengthening of GMed.</p><p>This study conducted ABD exercise with SIHA for GMed strengthening. As SIHA exercise group,
ABD group showed that the lysholm score increased and VAS decreased. The combined exercise
group (SIHA with ABD) showed more improvement than SIHA and ABD group: knee functional index
increased and pain decreased. This result is consistent with a previous study in that hip
joint adduction and internal rotation due to failure of hip abductor and hip external
rotator to handle increased stress on knee joint caused excessive knee valgus due to
weakness and atrophy of VMO and this produced lateral movement of patella<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hip joint abduction exercise in a side lying position is commonly used open kinetic chain
exercises. A study about strengthening hip muscles by Distefano et al. revealed that GMed
had the greatest muscle activity in a side lying position after 12 exercise programs<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, clinical use of GMed
strengthening exercise with hip joint abduction in a side lying position should be conducted
carefully.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that surgical method the patient received before the test,
whether it was menisectomy or meniscus repair, was not specified. In addition, whether the
patient had medial or lateral meniscal injury was also not specified.</p><p>Therefore, GMed strengthening for the patients with meniscal surgery improved knee joint
function recovery and pain in this study and systematic rehabilitation program should be
actively suggested to patients and conducted in early stage.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rangger</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Klestil</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Gloetzer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Osteoarthritis after arthroscopic partial
