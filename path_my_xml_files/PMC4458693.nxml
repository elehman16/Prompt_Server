This fear response is aggravated by negative and irrational beliefs about the feared object. Cognitive reappraisal can target these beliefs, and therefore has a fear regulating effect. The presented study investigated if neurofeedback derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) would facilitate anxiety regulation by cognitive reappraisal, using spider phobia as a model of anxiety disorders. Feedback was provided based on activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right insula, as indicators of engagement and regulation success, respectively.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighteen female spider phobics participated in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study.

In addition, only neurofeedback participants achieved down-regulation of insula activation levels by cognitive reappraisal.

Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health condition, with a year-prevalence of 12&#x02013;18% (Wittchen and Jacobi, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Moreover, 16&#x02013;47% of these patients cannot be treated successfully with a currently standard treatment such as cognitive behavior therapy (Ost, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Further integration of cognitive regulation strategies into the treatment of anxiety disorders has therefore been suggested (Kamphuis and Telch, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Amstadter, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Farmer and Kashdan, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). &#x0201d;Cognitive reappraisal,&#x0201d; the reinterpretation of the meaning of a stimulus, is an effective emotion regulation strategy, with beneficial long-term impact on anxiety symptoms (Kamphuis and Telch, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Sloan and Telch, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Amstadter, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Farmer and Kashdan, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This method targets negative, anxiety-provoking beliefs, which undermine regulation and prevent an adaptive response to the perceived threat (Gross, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Amstadter, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Spider phobics, similar to patients with other anxiety disorders, hold these beliefs (Arntz et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), and are expected to benefit from training reappraisal. The aim of this study was to investigate if providing neurofeedback during cognitive reappraisal would facilitate regulation success in spider phobia as a specific form of anxiety disorders.</p><p>Neurofeedback training based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly gaining interest as a novel approach in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. This method suggests that the presentation of feedback derived from patients' current neural activation can train the voluntarily regulation of selected brain processes. The goal is to achieve a normalization of deviant brain processes, and thus improve the related behavioral symptoms. Previous studies found that neurofeedback is an efficient tool in shaping mental strategies toward a given goal (DeCharms et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Caria et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Linden et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Scheinost et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Young et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Exploratory investigations have also indicated a benefit of fMRI neurofeedback training in clinical populations with chronic pain, tinnitus, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and mood disorders (DeCharms et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Haller et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Subramanian et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Linden et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sitaram et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Young et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Neurofeedback training methods have not been applied in patients with anxiety disorders, but it has been demonstrated that subclinical levels of anxiety can be successfully reduced by learning self-regulation of select brain activation levels (Scheinost et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Spider phobia, as other anxiety disorders, is characterized by an exaggerated fear response when encountering the feared object, in this case spiders. This strong fear response is accompanied by hyperactivation of a network of brain regions involved in anxiety expression (the anxiety expression network), such as the amygdala and insula (Etkin and Wager, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Both amygdala and insula have been proposed to belong to a core anxiety network implicated across different anxiety disorders (Etkin and Wager, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). While the amygdala has been linked to initial automatic fear processing during fear expression (Carlsson et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Straube et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), the insula represents sustained anxious emotion (Somerville et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Successful fear regulation in healthy subjects is characterized by down-regulation of this anxiety expression network (Delgado et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and reduced activation levels in this network have been linked to a positive treatment response (Schienle et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Beyond the anxiety network, a reduced regulatory capacity during anxiety provocation was shown in spider phobics, marked by hypoactivation of a frontal regulatory network (New et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Manber-Ball et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This frontal network encompasses cingulate and prefrontal cortices, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and is known to be activated during the regulation of negative affect in healthy participants (Ochsner et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Engagement of the dlPFC during cognitive reappraisal is delayed in patients with anxiety disorders, with the delay predicting levels of anxiety (Goldin et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, dlPFC activation levels during fear regulation are inversely associated with the severity of anxiety and functional impairment (New et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Manber-Ball et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Also, an increase in dlPFC activation levels predicts treatment success (Hauner et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In healthy participants, dlPFC has been implicated in safety learning and successful anxiety regulation (Delgado et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Pollak et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The neurofeedback training implemented in this study provided patients with a novel dual feedback display. Participants received feedback on both their current activation levels of the insula (sustained anxious emotion) and the dlPFC (engagement in regulation) during anxiety regulation. Neurofeedback participants were asked to continuously improve their regulation strategy according to the feedback, while a non-feedback control group was asked to learn based on intuition. We expected reduced insula activation in combination with high dlPFC activation in the neurofeedback group in comparison to the control group. Additionally, we hypothesized that this normalization of brain activation patterns in the neurofeedback group would predict reduced immediate- and long-term subjective levels of spider fear. A link between successful self-regulation of brain activation levels and long term behavioral change would provide first evidence that neurofeedback may be an efficacious tool for enhancing anxiety regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eighteen women were recruited through public advertisement at Maastricht University. They were screened for high spider fear [Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) Score &#x02265; 14, (Klorman et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>)] and diagnosed with spider phobia according to the criteria of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV TR (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). All were free of psychotropic medication and were not affected by other current or previous neuropsychiatric comorbidities as evaluated by means of a structured clinical interview [Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, MINI, (Sheehan et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>)]. None of the participants had previously received cognitive behavioral therapy. All participants were students, or currently employed. To balance the two experimental groups for age, self-reported use of reappraisal strategies [Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Reappraisal score, ERQ-R, (Gross and John, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>)], and spider fear (SPQ score), we used a restricted randomization procedure shown to be efficient for small sample sizes [sequential balancing, (Borm et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>)] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

An instructor (clinical psychologist) guided the participants to reinterpret a situation by &#x0201c;finding out calming aspects&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;engaging in anxiety provoking thoughts.&#x0201d; Participants were told that the rationale was to normalize some of the most common negative beliefs held by spider phobics (Arntz et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), drawing the focus to the safety of the situation. They were asked to select from four sorts of strategies: (1) detecting the aesthetics of the spider, (2) focusing on its powerlessness, (3) changing its connotation by humanizing it, or (4) changing its context by imagining approaching it in a safe environment. Each participant was invited to write down their own personal credible version of each strategy. They were then familiarized with the MRI procedures and requested to rehearse aloud during eight practice trials <italic>(regulate trials</italic>). Last, participants were asked to practice refraining from changing their thoughts in another eight practice trials, letting thoughts occur spontaneously (<italic>watch trials</italic>).</p><p>Neurofeedback participants were introduced to the dual feedback display and explained the feedback rationale. They were instructed to adjust the reappraisal strategy based on the provided feedback throughout the experiment. They were told that the goal was to achieve high prefrontal activation (&#x0201c;reappraisal activation&#x0201d;) and reduced insular activation (&#x0201c;anxiety activation&#x0201d;). Participants were asked to primarily consider the feedback from the regulatory network, if dual feedback information was challenging. The control group was presented a visually similar display, and was instructed that it indicated a short break in-between trials. Control participants were asked to adapt their strategy based on intuition throughout the session. All participants were told that experiencing high anxiety levels may be an essential part of the regulation process, and is generally not harmful. They were reminded that they could stop at any time, asked to pay attention, and to refrain from any movements in the scanner. Immediately before the imaging session, all participants completed the Questionnaire of Current Motivation [QCM, (Rheinberg et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>)], which measures individual differences in current motivation and expectation of success.</p><p>The 50-min imaging session started with one 5-min anatomical imaging run, followed by four 11-min functional imaging runs. Participants performed the practiced task during all four functional runs, alternating <italic>regulate</italic> and <italic>watch</italic> trials (presented in a blocked design, e.g., 4 <italic>watch trials</italic>, 4 <italic>regulate trials</italic>, 4 <italic>watch trials</italic>, 4 <italic>regulate trials</italic>, counterbalanced order). Data from the first functional run were used for delineation of the dlPFC and insula target regions (localization run). Neurofeedback was presented from the second to fourth functional run (neurofeedback training). To keep the training challenging throughout the experiment, the presented stimuli were selected to be increasingly anxiety provoking with each run (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All stimuli were selected based on a behavioral pilot study with spider phobics (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), and presented only once per condition. Each trial started with a 1.5-s cue (pictogram: <italic>watch</italic> or <italic>regulate</italic>), followed by 1-s fixation and the 12.5-s active trial period of anxiety regulation during presentation of the spider photograph (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Participants then rated their subjective anxiety on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 = &#x0201c;not fearful at all&#x0201d; to 4 = &#x0201c;extremely fearful&#x0201d; using a button box (Current Designs, Philadelphia, PA, USA). The feedback display was presented to the neurofeedback group after regulate trials, 2.5 s after the trials elapsed. During watch trials, and in the control group the &#x0201c;break display&#x0201d; was shown. All displays were presented using Presentation (Version 16; Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, USA). Between trials there was a jittered resting period of 8.75 &#x000b1; 2.5-s. We chose to present intermittent feedback to avoid cognitive overload and distraction, improve signal to noise ratio of the feedback signal, and accommodate hemodynamic delay (Stoeckel et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Intermittent feedback paradigms have been empirically demonstrated to be effective in shaping neural activity and learning (Bray et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Johnson et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>fMRI study design</bold>. The stimuli used were selected to be increasingly anxiety provoking with each run, based on a behavioral pilot study (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>).

The functional echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was optimized for imaging of limbic and prefrontal regions (Weiskopf et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Morawetz et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>): repetition time = 1250 ms, echo time = 25 ms, flip angle = 67&#x000b0;, slice thickness = 2.5 mm, 20% gap, in-plane = 3 &#x000d7; 3 mm, slice angle of 25&#x02013;30&#x000b0;, grappa acceleration = 2. We compromised for coverage of parietal cortex to achieve higher sampling rate for real-time imaging analysis. Heart and breathing rates were monitored using Siemens pulse oximeter and breathing chest band (recording the first 5 min of each 11-min functional run). Anatomical images were collected with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (3D MPRAGE) sequence: repetition time = 1900 ms, echo time = 2.52 ms, flip angle = 9&#x000b0;, voxel size 1 &#x000d7; 1 &#x000d7; 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, with duration 4:26 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time imaging analysis</title><p>During the imaging session all functional images were analyzed with Turbo-BrainVoyager (Version 3.0; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands). The images were pre-processed using motion correction, drift confound predictors, and high-pass filtering with a general linear model (GLM) Fourier basis set (2 cycles). An incremental GLM was computed using two task predictors (<italic>watch, regulate</italic>) convolved by a standard two-gamma hemodynamic response function, as well as predictors for events of no interest. Functional maps were thresholded (<italic>t</italic> = 3, cluster threshold = 4 voxels). Target regions were individually defined based on the contrasts <italic>watch</italic> vs. resting (insula) and <italic>regulate</italic> vs. resting (dlPFC). The cluster closest to the target coordinates was manually selected. The target coordinates were defined unilaterally based on previous research: <italic>x</italic> = 37, <italic>y</italic> = 11, <italic>z</italic> = 3 in the right insula and <italic>x</italic> = &#x02212;43, <italic>y</italic> = 28, <italic>z</italic> = 30 in the left dlPFC (Etkin and Wager, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Delgado et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ochsner et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). During experimental runs, neurofeedback values were computed by contrasting the activation increase during stimulus presentation (last 10-s) relative to a baseline previous to stimulus onset (7.5-s) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The feedback was displayed on a thermometer, which had its maximum adjusted to average activation during the localization run (max thermometer = 2<sup>*</sup> average activation localization run).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Neurofeedback calculation</bold>. The dual neurofeedback display showed current individual activation level in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (blue), and insula (red).

Our results demonstrate that neurofeedback participants exhibited lower levels of anxiety than control participants at the end of training. Second, neurofeedback participants, compared to control participants, achieved down-regulation of a region important for anxiety expression (insula), which in turn correlated with improvements in long term anxiety symptoms in these participants.</p><p>All participants maintained high prefrontal activation levels during reappraisal, indicating recruitment of regions supporting cognitive reappraisal (Delgado et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ochsner et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, only the neurofeedback group showed a concurrent attenuation of the response in the insula, which grew stronger over time, as expected during successful anxiety regulation (Schienle et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hauner et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Decrease of insula activation levels has been shown to be a valid predictor of long term reduction of spider fear (Schienle et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hauner et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Neurofeedback participants hence demonstrated the expected modification of brain activation pattern, suggesting the efficiency of cognitive reappraisal strategies for anxiety regulation. Accordingly, achieved attenuation of insula activation levels was accompanied by a reduction of subjective anxiety levels in neurofeedback participants relative to controls. Second, only neurofeedback participants achieved down-regulation of insula activation levels by cognitive reappraisal during regulation in comparison to watch trials. Capacity to down-regulate has been linked to safety learning and successful regulation in healthy subjects (Delgado et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Pollak et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Group differences in achieved down-regulation of insula activation levels were not reflected in subjective anxiety ratings, nor physiological control data. A possible explanation is that subjective ratings measured on a five-point Likert scale, as well as heart and breathing rate measured during scanning may not be sensitive enough indicators for capturing subtle differences in regulation success. It has previously been shown that heart rate is not a sensitive measure of anxiety regulation even in much larger samples (Aldao and Mennin, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cristea et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and breathing rate is generally not strongly correlated with anxiety levels (Prigatano and Johnson, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Sarlo et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Importantly however, observed individual differences in down-regulation of insula activation levels were predictive of long-term changes in fear. While a sustained group difference in fear could not be shown, individually achieved down-regulation of insula predicted fear reduction 3 months after the training. This demonstrates that achieved self-regulation of insula during training was indeed relevant for later behavioral improvement.</p><p>Generally, the presented findings add to accumulating evidence that regional changes in brain activation levels can be a valid indicator of therapeutic change (Schienle et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Goldin et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; New et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hauner et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Manber-Ball et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Observed group differences could not be attributed to differences in engagement or compliance. Participants showed similar baseline levels of subjective anxiety, right insula response, and left dlPFC response, as well as baseline ability to regulate anxiety. Also, both groups reported equal levels of motivation, and expectation of success prior to the training, reported a high level of comfort in the scanner, high helpfulness of the reappraisal instruction, and indicated a comparable desire to return for future sessions.</p><p>fMRI neurofeedback training has been previously conceptualized as a method that combines principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy with brain stimulation approaches (Linden et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Within this framework, the advantage of neurofeedback training in comparison to physical brain stimulation is that voluntary self-regulation is a self-controlled process, and therefore more accessible in the long run. The assumed mechanism in neurofeedback training is learning. Feedback is expected to facilitate learning through at least two mechanisms: &#x0201c;explicit representational learning&#x0201d; of the strategy and &#x0201c;implicit reinforcement learning&#x0201d; after successful trials (Goebel et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Weiskopf, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sulzer et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Additionally, it has been suggested that learning during neurofeedback training may be enhanced by increasing the individuals' self-efficacy (Sarkheil et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The presented data support a facilitating effect of neurofeedback for learning of fear regulation, as group differences emerged gradually and became more pronounced over time. The current study therefore corroborates previous studies showing that healthy participants can learn to self-regulate activation levels in various brain regions (Caria et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Weiskopf, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), including the insula (Caria et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The presented results also show for the first time that patients with high levels of anxiety can achieve self-regulation of insula activation levels when guided by feedback. Furthermore, our data supports previous research demonstrating that cognitive strategies can be successfully shaped by neural feedback, leading to symptom reduction in chronic pain patients (DeCharms et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), depressed patients (Linden et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and participants with subclinical levels of anxiety (Scheinost et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A previous study with patients with subclinical levels of contamination anxiety provided participants with feedback on activation levels of a brain region implicated in anxiety provocation (orbitofrontal cortex) during anxiety regulation. The neurofeedback group achieved a sustained reduction of anxiety in comparison to a sham feedback control group. The presented data further substantiate these results, showing that neurofeedback can enhance learning of anxiety regulation.</p><p>In the current study feedback was presented intermittent, using a novel dual feedback display. Intermittent feedback paradigms have been previously applied in healthy participants, but not in patients (Bray et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Johnson et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Stoeckel et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The rationale for presenting dual intermittent neurofeedback was to provide patients with a richer representation of their current brain processing than possible with single region neurofeedback. Different to newly emerging methods for network-based connectivity neurofeedback, which capture the interaction between brain regions (Ruiz et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zilverstand et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), dual neurofeedback is not a direct measure of brain processing between two select brain regions. It is however a method of maximizing relevant information content of the feedback signal, as it allows to simultaneously target several aspects of a complex behavior through training. While a dual neurofeedback display may be challenging for certain groups of patients, the participants in the presented study reported that the feedback provided was helpful in selecting the reappraisal strategy. The presented results show that the approach is feasible, and may be used in clinical populations. While the current results confirm that behavioral effects can be achieved within a single session of neurofeedback training (Sulzer et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), patients groups with more severe anxiety disorders may benefit from receiving multiple sessions of training (Scheinost et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the current study is the modest sample size. To increase homogeneity of the sample only females with spider phobia were recruited, and the generalization of the results to males remains to be determined. The lack of a sham feedback group may also be seen as a limitation. However, previous research found that sham feedback may induce a negative performance bias, which can limit performance of the control group (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Stoeckel et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A non-neurofeedback control group with blinding of participants therefore seemed the strictest design choice available. The presented data confirmed that motivation and expectation effects were well controlled for.</p><p>In summary, the conducted study provides first evidence that dual intermittent neurofeedback has a facilitating effect on anxiety regulation in spider phobia. Our results support the idea that self-supervising anxiety regulation by neurofeedback is feasible and can facilitate anxiety regulation. We therefore suggest that neurofeedback training may be incorporated as a therapeutic tool in future clinical trials. Because of common cognitive-behavioral trajectories and neurophysiological pathways, we believe that the presented approach could be extended to a broader range of anxiety disorders.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Valentin Kemper and Federico De Martino for their support with optimizing fMRI data acquisition, Michael L&#x000fc;hrs, Joel Reithler, and Jan Zimmermann for providing custom data analysis tools, and Scott Moeller for his helpful comments regarding the manuscript.
