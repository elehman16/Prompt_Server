INTRODUCTION</title><p>Caries is today, regardless of the good knowledge about its multiclausal etiology and the possibilities for its effective prevention still the most widespread disease of our civilization, which affects about 95% of our population (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It affects all populations and age groups (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), this is a disease that is very difficult to completely eradicate due to a complex interaction of biological factors, dietary habits, social status, etc. (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Because of its high incidence and socio-economic importance, the World Health Organization in 1982 defined the objectives, which should be achieved in the field of dentistry until 2000. These are:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>That 50% of children aged 5-6 years is free of cavities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>That the DMF index in twelve year olds is less than 3.</p></list-item><list-item><p>That 85% of the population in the age of 18 years is without a lost tooth.</p></list-item><list-item><p>That in the age group 35-45 years is reduced by 50% the number of extracted teeth (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Over 70% of countries in the world have managed to achieve this goal, as well as most European countries. The reasons for the improvement of oral health are numerous and complex, but is most often attributed to: the implementation of systematic school prevention programs and health education, then the massive and continuous application of fluoride, improved oral hygiene, more sensitive approach to the consumption of sugar, as well as changes in lifestyle and living conditions (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The lowest DMF value is registered in Switzerland 0.84, followed by the Netherlands and Sweden 0.9 (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A similar decrease in caries prevalence was recorded in Finland, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Germany and Iceland, where the DMF was below 1.5 and 23-49% of twelve years old were without caries. DMF-index in 1999 was 1.8 in Slovenia, 3.0 in Macedonia, 3.5 in Croatia, while the average DMF-index of twelve years old in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina according to WHO data for 1997 amounted to 6.2 (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Information about DMF-index in Europe is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>DMF index in Europe among twelve year olds in 2014 (according to WHO)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MSM-28-397-g001"/></fig><p>Caries is a disease of modern life, which is a financial burden both to the individual and society. Substantial financial resources are allocated for the treatment of caries.</p><p>For dental health care is allocated 5% of public health spending while from the private funds is allocated additional 16% of health care in OECD countries. Members of E27 spend about 79 billion &#x020ac; per year, while it is assumed that this figure in 2020 will be around 93 billion &#x020ac; per year for dental care (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>EU countries spend on average 4.1 to 8.6% of gross national income on health, provided that this trend is increasing.</p><p>The term preventive measures imply total medical-dental measures for protection from disease and disease control, and in order to preserve the health and ability of people until old age (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Childhood and early school age is the time when permanently are acquired habits and when the health-educational information is timely provided, and school prevention programs represent around the world one of the most effective and economically most profitable methods in conducting oral-prevention programs (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, to early school age should be paid special attention in order to promote oral health.</p><p>Preventive measures to combat tooth decay in children and young people, as well as its distribution among different social categories has always been of interest to all countries (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The implementation of preventive measures in dentistry should start as early as possible, because healthy milk dentition is a good prerequisite for good oral health of permanent teeth (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) Preventive measures, to be implemented in the field of preventive dentistry and represent an integral part of health care for the child. These measures do not apply only to the prevention of dental disease as most prevalent disease diseases today, but ensure proper growth and development of the maxillofacial complex, then prevent the development of diseases of periodontal tissues, as well as other diseases that can occur on this organ system (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Primary preventive measures are:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Oral hygiene;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of fluoride;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Control of sugar consumption or proper diet and;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The local measures aimed at preventing caries and periodontal disease (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In addition to basic primary measures in caries prevention is also very important to educate children and parents about the importance of oral health.</p><p>The prevention of oral diseases should be a priority in relation to the treatment of the consequences of oral diseases. In countries where the DMF-index is low emphasis is placed on individual prevention, as opposed to countries with high DMF-index which recommended and implemented the preventive measures for the general population. Since the state of oral health in the Bosnia-Podrinje Canton is really poor, the prevention program was made, which has been implemented for more than five years in urban primary schools of the municipality of Gorazde, and in the focus of preventive programs are:</p><p>

DISCUSSION</title><p>This study, which followed the connection of caries and implementation of preventive measures in Bosnia-Podrinje Canton, verified the importance of preventive measures on the incidence and prevalence of dental caries. The importance of continuing education and local fluoridation is clearly reflected in the different values of DMF-index, which was the subject of this research. The first group of subjects, in which was carried out continuous education and local fluoridation value of DMF index was 2.7, in the second group of subjects, in which was carried out local fluoridation, this value is 3.56, while in the third group of respondents, where preventive measures was not carried out continuously the value DMF index was 5.93.</p><p>Share of carious tooth in DMF-index, as well as the need for treatment is much lower in children where preventive measures were implemented.</p><p>In extensive research on 800 respondents, where respondents were children from first to eighth grade, which was carried out on the territory of Bosnia-Podrinje Canton in 2009 was examined the effects of short-term continuing education for a period of three months on oral health in children was as follows:</p><p>Score of repaired: non repaired teeth are changed in favor of restored teeth in children, where they conducted continuing education in most of the class (in the second and third there was no significant change) by about 20%.</p><p>There was no significant change in values of DMF-index, or with respect to the take a short follow-up period (six months) could not even expect to reach significant changes</p><p>Oral hygiene improved by about 40% in children, when continuing education was conducted in all grades except first grade (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Research for a period of three years from the application of preventive measures in terms of local fluoridation and continuing education is done in Banja Luka in children grades I-IV, where there was an improvement of oral health (DMF-index in fourth grade in 2005 amounted to 4.39 the value of oral hygiene index was 1.60. In 2008, DMF-index in fourth grade was 2.91 and the value of oral hygiene index 0.95 (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Similar research for a period of six months was carried out in Pancevo on a sample of 112 respondents of the second and seventh grade, where also after continuing education was reduced the frequency of children with gingivitis, as well as improved oral hygiene (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In Iran, the influence of continuing education on school-age subjects for a period of three months, which are also oral hygiene habits improved in the group of respondents with education (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The results of this research are very difficult to compare with other studies, because Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have data for similar research. In other countries have done the economic analysis but cannot be compared because of differences in health care systems, different financing and presentation of dental services. Thus, in Japan also registered positive economic indicators prevention of oral diseases, where it was found that fissure sealing and local fluoridation produce saving in material resources (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>5.
