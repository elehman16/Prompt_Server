The primary endpoint was grade II&#x02013;IV acute graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease incidence rate by day +180. One hundred and thirty-eight patients (A 46, B 45, C 47) with a median age of 64 years (range: 24&#x02013;75), varying malignant diagnoses and disease risk (low 14, intermediate 96, high/very high 28) received 7&#x02013;8/8 HLA-mismatched (40) or matched unrelated donor (98) grafts. Median follow up in survivors was 30 months (range: 14&#x02013;46). Despite early immune reconstitution differences, day +180 grade II-IV acute graft-<italic>versus</italic>-host disease rates were similar (A 32.6%, B 31.1%, C 21%; <italic>P</italic>=0.53 for A <italic>vs</italic>.

Secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of aGvHD, NRM, relapse, chronic (c)GvHD, and PFS, OS and GvHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). The study was designed for the primary comparisons of the grade II-IV aGvHD rates in arm A <italic>vs</italic>. B and arm A <italic>vs</italic>. C in parallel. We projected the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD as 40% in arm A and 15% in arm B and in arm C. With the sample size of 46 per arm, there is an 80% power to detect a 25% difference in grade II-IV aGvHD rate between two arms. This power calculation is based on Fisher&#x02019;s exact test at one-sided type I error rate of 0.05. The primary analysis was performed per the modified intent-to-treat principle (mITT), i.e., all patients who were randomized and received any amount of the study treatment were included in the primary analysis. Cumulative incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD, relapse and NRM were estimated in the competing risk framework. Relapse with or without death was considered a competing risk for NRM, and similarly NRM for relapse. Death or relapse without developing GvHD was a competing event for GvHD. GvHD incidences occurring after relapse, in the setting of relapse interventions (e.g., immunosuppression [IS] taper, donor lymphocyte infusion [DLI]), were counted in the estimation of cumulative incidence of GvHD in order to obtain comprehensive estimates, and both inclusive and exclusive estimates are presented for aGvHD endpoints. GRFS, PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. GRFS was defined as the time from stem cell infusion to incidence of grade III/IV aGvHD, cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression agents, relapse or death, whichever occured first. PFS and OS have been defined elsewhere. Cumulative incidences in the presence of competing events were compared using the Gray test, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were compared using the log-rank test.<sup><xref rid="b16-1030522" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For time-to-event endpoints, <italic>P</italic>-values reflect comparing entire distributions along with point estimates for ease of presentation.

Multivariable analysis adjusting for variables, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-1030522">Table 1</xref>, were performed for OS and PFS using a Cox model, and a Fine and Gray model was used for grade II-IV aGvHD.<sup><xref rid="b17-1030522" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Immunophenotype data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at each time point without adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Based on encouraging phase I/II results in HLA-mismatched T-replete RIC HSCT, we undertook a prospective randomized evaluation of aGvHD prophylaxis with conventional tac/mtx (arm A) <italic>vs</italic>. two novel regimens of short-course bort for transplantation recipients lacking 8/8 HLA-matched related donors: bort plus tac/mtx (arm B), and bort plus sir/tac (arm C).</p><p>In our study, Bort, limited to three doses peritransplantation (day +1, +4 and +7), did not add toxicity. No bort doses were missed or modified. No subjects developed toxicities of prolonged/delayed bort administration (e.g., neuropathy, colonic necrosis). Comparing treatment arms, no increase in hepatic VOD, AKI or TMA/HUS was noted for bort-based regimens <italic>vs</italic>. tac/mtx.</p><p>Engraftment was rapid and sustained, with robust donor chimerism by day 30 that was sustained and comparable across treatment arms. The addition of bort alone did not appear to impair immunologic recovery, with similar counts of T cells (CD4, CD8), B cells and NK cells in the conventional tac/mtx <italic>vs</italic>. bort/tac/mtx arms. Count recovery for arm C (bort/sir/tac) was lower, as we previously documented for other sir-based cohorts.<sup><xref rid="b10-1030522" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> As hypothesized, there was relative sparing of Treg reconstitution with arm C (bort/sir/tac), with no impairment of Treg count recovery and elevated Treg:Tcon ratios.</p><p>The clinical impact of these systematic immunologic differences, however, remains unclear. Importantly, the 2-year NRM incidence was low (ranging from 6.4% to 16%) and did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Relapse was in the expected range after RIC HSCT (ranging from 24% to 36%), and did not differ significantly between treatment arms. In this study, survival, while not differing significantly between treatment arms, with 2-year OS ranging from 61% to 62% (<italic>P</italic>=0.98), appeared better than anticipated for 7/8 and 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, plateauing at 50% and 66%, respectively, in contrast to 1- and 3-year registry benchmark survivals recently reported for 7/8 and 8/8 donor recipients, of 48% <bold>&#x02192;</bold> 30% and 55%&#x02192;38%, respectively<sup><xref rid="b2-1030522" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. We highlight a lack of significant difference between treatment arms with regard to the primary endpoint of grade II-IV aGvHD rate by day +180.</p><p>In the context of delayed T-cell reconstitution noted for arm C, this suggests that the combination of a CNI (tac) plus mTOR inhibitor (sir) provides IS without long term tolerizing effects. While it is possible that longer duration of tac/sir immunosuppression in arm C beyond day +180 may have better prevented aGvHD, ultimately, aGvHD deferral rather than long-term amelioration remains a possibility. In subgroup analysis for the 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, bort-based regimens had a borderline trend towards grade II-IV aGvHD benefit <italic>vs</italic>. tac/mtx, with a cumulative incidence of 17% <italic>vs</italic>. 33%, respectively, (<italic>P</italic>=0.08). However, grade III-IV severe aGvHD rates were not improved, and for 7/8 MMD grafts a similar trend for aGvHD benefit of bort-based regimens was not appreciable, though sample size was limited.</p><p>Our trial has strengths due to its appropriate size in the phase II context, and its direct prospective randomization to conventional tac/mtx <italic>vs</italic>. two novel bort-based GvHD prophylaxis regimens. Concerns regarding open-label treatment assignment are ameliorated by the minimal dropout rate and the mITT analysis to further avoid bias, while the &#x02018;hard&#x02019; endpoints of GvHD, NRM, relapse and survival additionally obviate assessment bias concerns.</p><p>Our primary finding is that, as tested, bort-based regimens did not appear to provide additional benefit for grade II-IV aGvHD prevention in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT, failing to meet the protocol-specified 25% reduction in aGvHD incidence for success. Our phase II RCT requirements for success were stringent, which limits our ability to detect lower, albeit potentially clinically meaningful benefit with bort. However, it is also notable that conventional tac/mtx outcomes were better than anticipated, a finding similar to that recently reported in other contemporary randomized HSCT trials.<sup><xref rid="b21-1030522" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>These data highlight the inadequacy of non-randomized comparators for evaluating early phase single arm interventional studies, and document, as an updated standard, the improved MMD and MUD RIC HSCT outcomes achievable with conventional tac/mtx in this study (2-year OS of 58% and 62%, respectively). In the future, prospective trials of alternative donors (e.g., UCB, haplo) and novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens (e.g., maraviroc, PTCy) may need to benchmark these outcomes. In contrast, the bar for the novel GRFS endpoint appears far lower, ranging from 8% to 12% in our study, with no significant difference between treatment arms (<italic>P</italic>=0.53).</p><p>In summary, mature data from this open-label 1:1:1 three-arm phase II RCT indicates that the bort-based regimens evaluated appear to provide lower than anticipated grade II-IV aGvHD benefit compared to conventional tac/mtx in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT. While we note the potential benefit of bort for 8/8 HLA-matched transplants, direct phase III prospective randomization is required in order to confirm such a benefit. Overall, however, the lack of benefit for other transplantation outcomes (NRM, relapse, chronic GvHD, and survival) suggests limited utility for bort prophylaxis in the doses and combinations assessed. Alternative proteasome inhibitor combination regimens (e.g., with PTCy) should also be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank clinical research nurses Susan Stephenson RN and Mildred Pasek RN.
