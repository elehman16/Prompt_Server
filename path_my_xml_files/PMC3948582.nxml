There is growing recognition of the potential role of primary care in cancer follow-up. This paper describes the protocol for a phase II multisite randomised controlled trial of a novel model of shared care for the follow-up of men after completing treatment for low-moderate risk prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The intervention is a shared care model of follow-up visits in the first 12&#x02005;months after completing treatment for prostate cancer with the following specific components: a survivorship care plan, general practitioner (GP) management guidelines, register and recall systems, screening for distress and unmet needs and patient information resources. Eligible men will have completed surgery and/or radiotherapy for low-moderate risk prostate cancer within the previous 8&#x02005;weeks and have a GP who consents to participate. Ninety men will be randomised to the intervention or current hospital follow-up care. Study outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months and include anxiety, depression, unmet needs, prostate cancer-specific quality of life and satisfaction with care. Clinical processes and healthcare resource usage will also be measured. The principal emphasis of the analysis will be on obtaining estimates of the treatment effect size and assessing feasibility in order to inform the design of a subsequent phase III trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Western Australia and from all hospital recruitment sites in Western Australia and Victoria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>of this phase II trial will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and in conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12610000938000</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Primary Care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial of a model of shared care for men with prostate cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is also the first trial to use the distress thermometer in primary care and the first to test a specific checklist to identify unmet needs of cancer survivors in primary care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As a phase II trial of a complex intervention it is designed to provide preliminary estimates of the feasibility and the efficacy of the shared care intervention for phase III planning purposes.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer among men worldwide, with the highest estimated incidence rates being in Australia and New Zealand, north America and western and northern Europe.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Age-standardised incidence rates in 2008/100&#x02005;000 men were 104.2 in Australia and New Zealand; 93.1 in western Europe and 85.6 in northern America.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Australia 19&#x02005;438 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the incidence is projected to increase to approximately 25&#x02005;310 by 2020.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the USA, there were an estimated 246&#x02005;000 new prostate cancer cases in 2010 and this is projected to rise to 322&#x02005;000 by 2020.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These changes in prostate cancer incidence are largely due to the growing use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening test but also due to the ageing population.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Although prostate cancer is a common cause of death from cancer, a 5-year survival is relatively high. Between 2006 and 2010, the 5-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Australia was 92%, with survival being the highest for men aged 50&#x02013;69&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Most recent data from the USA show a 5-year relative survival for prostate cancer of 99%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Men who have completed treatment for prostate cancer require long-term follow-up, to detect recurrence or progression of the disease, monitor any adverse effects of treatment and to identify and address any ongoing psychosocial needs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Men with prostate cancer also frequently have a range of comorbid conditions requiring management.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Prostate cancer: high burden of illness</title><p>Observational studies from the USA and the UK have demonstrated that men treated for prostate cancer frequently experience distressing and ongoing side effects, most notably urinary and bowel incontinence, sexual dysfunction and significant psychological issues.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The severity and duration of side effects vary by treatment modality. A recently published study from the USA of 1655 men treated for localised prostate cancer with a 15-year follow-up found that men having a prostatectomy were more likely to have urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction at 2 and 5&#x02005;years post-treatment than those undergoing radiotherapy, but less likely to have bowel urgency.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Research also demonstrates that following prostate cancer treatment the majority of men have unmet psychological and supportive care needs. A cross sectional survey of 1001 men with prostate cancer living in seven European countries found that 81% had some unmet supportive care needs, including psychological, sexual and health system and information needs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a population-based cohort of 978 Australian men with recently treated prostate cancer, 54% had unmet psychological needs, particularly &#x02018;uncertainty about the future&#x02019; (21%) and 47% unmet sexual needs.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A larger Australian longitudinal study with a 3-year follow-up compared men treated for prostate cancer with matched controls to account for potential effects of normal ageing. Men treated for prostate cancer had lower sexual function, especially those on androgen deprivation therapy (97% impotence at 3&#x02005;years), compared with 53% under active surveillance.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> At 3&#x02005;years, 67.9% of men who had nerve sparing radical prostatectomy and 86.7% of men who had non-nerve sparing radical prostatectomy were impotent. Men treated with radical prostatectomy reported worst urinary function (16% incontinence at 1&#x02005;year, 12% at 3&#x02005;years) compared with 3% incontinence after 3&#x02005;years in the active surveillance group; and bowel function was worst in those receiving external beam radiotherapy (15% moderate or severe bowel problems at 3&#x02005;years; compared with 3% after 3&#x02005;years of active surveillance.)</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Current care of men with prostate cancer in general practice</title><p>The role of general practitioners (GPs) in prostate cancer screening is well recognised. General practice is also heavily engaged in managing men with prostate cancer including long-term treatment and related health problems. Longitudinal data from the UK on nearly 5000 survivors with prostate cancer (5&#x02005;years or longer post diagnosis) found that these men consulted their GP up to three more times annually compared to controls, a trend that continued even 15&#x02005;years after diagnosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Compared to matched controls, prostate cancer survivors had 39% more consultations over a 3-year follow-up period, partly due to monitoring and administration of hormonal treatments. Data from the Netherlands also showed that patients with prostate cancer consult their GP more than controls at 2&#x02013;5&#x02005;years after diagnosis, for both cancer-related health problems and chronic disease management.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In Australia, data from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) study showed that, of 2385 general practice consultations about prostate cancer in 2008 only 9% were for prostate cancer as a new problem (The BEACH Project: Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health Australian General Practice Statistics and Classification Centre, 2009, personal communication). The following services were provided: PSA test request (21%); counselling, advice and education (15%); local injection/implant insertion (12%); prescription, predominantly for opioids and antiandrogens (approximately 30%); and referral, predominantly to urology or oncology (10%).</p><p>An expanded role for primary care in the follow-up of people with cancer is increasingly seen as critical for long-term sustainability of the health system in many developed nations.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This is recognised in UK's National Cancer Survivorship Initiative<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and, specifically in relation to prostate cancer, by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A systematic review of primary care-based follow-up in trials with breast and colon cancer survivors found no statistically significant differences between primary and secondary care follow-up in terms of patient well-being, psychological morbidity and patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A randomised controlled trial of GP-led follow-up of people with melanoma found no significant difference in health status or anxiety and depression between intervention and control groups. However, there were significant improvements in some aspects of patient satisfaction with care for those receiving GP-led melanoma follow-up.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A recent rapid review of the evidence reported on seven trials of shared care in cancer; most of these focused on increasing the primary care team's involvement in managing symptoms during or immediately following treatment for cancer.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These trials found that shared care models of cancer follow-up can improve a range of important process outcomes including patient and provider satisfaction, provider confidence and knowledge and patient perceptions of care. No trials of shared care have tested a structured approach to sharing cancer surveillance, management of treatment-related effects and psychosocial support between hospital and primary care after completion of treatment. Furthermore, there are no trials reported to date of prostate cancer follow-up in primary care.</p><p>Previous trials of primary care follow-up have focused on detection of recurrence to the exclusion of the multiple needs and comorbidities of patients which may be more appropriately dealt with from a generalist perspective.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The key elements in a conceptual model of generalism include accessibility, holistic patient-centred, team-based care, care coordination, continuity and management of complex multiple problems.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Evidence from previous studies with cancer survivors followed up in primary care suggest that they are more likely to receive preventive interventions for conditions other than cancer, whereas those followed up by oncologists are more likely to receive interventions directed at cancer surveillance.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Primary care may therefore have an important broader generalist role to play in cancer follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Principles underpinning a novel shared care model of follow-up for prostate cancer</title><p>In 2005, the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a landmark report From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The report recommended that new research initiatives focused on follow-up of patients with cancer were urgently needed to guide effective survivorship care. The IOM report outlined four essential components of survivorship care planning: (1) prevention of recurrent and new cancers, and of other late effects; (2) surveillance for cancer spread, recurrence or second cancers; assessment of medical and <italic>psychosocial</italic> late effects; (3) interventions for consequences of cancer and its treatment and (4) coordination between specialists and primary care providers to ensure that all of the survivors&#x02019; health needs are addressed.</p><p>The most common systemic problems in providing comprehensive cancer care include requirement for a case manager, local accessible health services and doctors who communicate with each other.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A systematic review of guidelines for follow-up care in prostate cancer highlighted that most focus on the detection of cancer recurrence and assessment of the medical consequences of treatment, with little attention placed on identifying and responding to other key unmet needs.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In the ProCare Trial we are applying the following principles to guide the design of a model of shared hospital and primary care for prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004972F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014004972F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Trial flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014004972f01"/></fig><sec id="s1c1"><title>Communication between hospital and primary care</title><p>A current major issue in cancer follow-up is coordination of care between specialists and general practice, partly due to out-dated approaches to communication. Timely and systematic communication between hospital and community care providers is urgently required to clarify the roles and responsibilities of all, including the person with cancer.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> An Australian trial comparing methods of communication between hospital and general practices found that fax had higher receipt rates than post and was the most preferred method by GPs.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> An innovative trial of electronic faxing of standardised information to GPs about a patient's chemotherapy regime has shown that this approach led to improved GP confidence in managing adverse effects of treatment and increased satisfaction with shared care.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are recommended as an important tool to facilitate communication and clarify responsibility during the transition from active treatment to survivorship.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> There has only been one trial of the use of SCPs in primary care<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> but several methodological issues have been raised about this trial which may explain its negative findings<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> hence further evidence is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Promotion of patient involvement and engagement</title><p>Patients with cancer want to be involved with decision-making, and wish to participate in strategies to remain well.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Involving patients with chronic diseases in their disease management results in better communication with physicians, improved self-reported health and reduced health distress, few hospitalisations and reduced health costs.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Self-management approaches also have potential for ameliorating the functional and emotional problems experienced by prostate cancer survivors.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> A systematic review of patient activation approaches has shown they can alter the content of consultations and improve the identification of patients&#x02019; concerns.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Approaches that allow patients to list and share their concerns with their doctor, particularly if linked to practitioner interventions, showed particular promise in this review. A separate systematic review of problem checklists found that these can empower patients with cancer to ask relevant questions in healthcare consultations.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><sec id="s1d1"><title>Tailoring care to specific needs of individual patients</title><p>Cancer survivors have different needs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

The sample size is based on ensuring adequate information is collected to yield preliminary estimates of the treatment effect and of between-patient variation that are sufficiently precise for phase III trial planning purposes. The sample size target was revised at a steering committee meeting on 2 August 2012. This was in response to lower accrual rates than predicted, specifically due to a lower proportion of low-moderate risk prostate cancers than originally estimated. The revised target of 90 men was selected to ensure that the 95% CIs for the mean difference between the two groups on the patient reported outcome measures would extend no further than &#x000b1;0.5 of a SD with 80% probability and allowing for 10% attrition at 12&#x02005;months (ie, complete data on N=80 is required). This level of precision corresponds to what has been proposed as a minimal clinically important difference of health-related quality of life measures<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> allowing us to identify clinically significant harm from the intervention if it existed. Data from a trial of a group-based intervention involving 331 men with prostate cancer in Victoria, Australia (ACTRN12606000184572) has been used to estimate how this level of precision will translate to estimates from the HADS and EPIC instruments.

Treatment groups will be compared on the categorical endpoints (eg, clinical process measures) using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Logistic regression modelling will also be undertaken to estimate the treatment effect on these endpoints adjusting for baseline covariates. The principal emphasis of the analysis will be on obtaining estimates of the treatment effect size and assessing feasibility in order to inform the design of a subsequent phase III trial. p Values for the multiple comparisons between the groups will be interpreted in this context.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s2"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ProCare Trial has several novel elements: it is the first randomised controlled trial of a model of shared care for men with prostate cancer; it is the first trial to use the DT in primary care and the first to test a specific problem checklist to identify unmet needs of cancer survivors in primary care. We are testing SCP in primary care. One of the problems with the Grunfeld trial of SCPs in primary care was the high proportion of prevalent cancer cases who had completed treatment several years previously, and were possibly less likely to benefit.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We are therefore only recruiting men who have very recently completed their cancer treatment and in their first 12&#x02005;months of follow-up care.</p><p>As a phase II trial it is designed to yield estimates of sufficient precision for phase III trial planning purposes. However, as with all trials of alternative models of cancer follow-up, an outstanding methodological issue is the selection of an appropriate primary outcome measure. Most trials have measured satisfaction with care and a range of health-related quality of life measures, finding no differences between hospital and primary care follow-up.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Trials in populations at low risk of cancer recurrence would need to be unfeasibly large to detect differences in survival. The ProCare Trial includes a range of outcome measures including disease-specific quality of life and unmet needs. The intervention is designed to improve the identification of unmet needs and implement best practice management in the expectation that this will improve disease-specific quality of life and overall well-being.</p><p>We are recruiting men from a range of metropolitan and rural settings in two states in Australia including public and private healthcare settings. Based on discussions with urologists and radiation oncologists we have chosen only to recruit men with low-intermediate risk of disease recurrence, based on the D'Amico criteria.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> As the first trial of shared follow-up care in prostate cancer it was agreed by the investigator team for safety reasons to focus initially on men with low-intermediate risk disease. This is also consistent with international approaches to risk stratified follow-up.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Our trial population is likely to be representative of a wide range of men with low-intermediate risk prostate cancer who might be offered alternative follow-up arrangements if this model of care were shown to be feasible and acceptable.</p><p>We plan to complete follow-up in July 2014 and report trial results in early 2015.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Dissemination</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial of a model of shared care for men with prostate cancer; it is also the first trial to use the DT in primary care and the first to test a specific checklist to identify unmet needs of cancer survivors in primary care. We plan to publish the main trial outcomes in a single paper and anticipate publishing additional papers exploring the data in more detail and relating to the implementation of this complex intervention.
