EEG recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a target event. Subjects performed two sessions: in the first the regularity of the predictive sequence was implicit, while in the second this regularity was made explicit. Subjects pressed a button in response to targets. Both the implicit and explicit sessions showed shorter reaction times and peak P3b latencies for predicted versus random targets, although to a greater extent in the explicit session. In both sessions the middle and last most-informative stimuli of the three-standard predictive sequence induced a significant larger P3b compared with randomized standards. The findings show that local contextual information is processed implicitly, but that this modulation was significantly greater when subjects were explicitly instructed to attend to target-predictive contextual information. The findings suggest that top-down attentional networks have a role in modulating the extent to which contextual information is utilized.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PSI2012-34212 to NF] and [DEP2011-22466 and Xunta de Galicia CN 2012/170 to MFdO].

These studies identified several neural correlates associated with the facilitation of explicit local contextual processing. First, P3b latency and reaction time was faster for the processing of predicted compared with random targets. Second, there was a gradual increase in P3b amplitude during the detection of the stimuli consisting of the predicting sequence, indicating that the predictive sequence became a secondary target for the subjects. In the present study we employed this paradigm <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> to investigate the effects of implicit versus explicit local contextual processing. The objective of the study was to determine whether the facilitatory effect of explicit processing of predictive local context <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Frensch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> is also demonstrated when the same stimuli are processed implicitly. To this end, subjects performed two sessions of the same task. Both sessions were identical and consisted of visual stimuli of triangles facing either left, up, right or down <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In the first session subjects are simply instructed to detect the target (downward facing triangle), while in the second session they are made aware that targets either appear randomly or after a predictive sequence (triangles facing left, upward, and then right) that signals the occurrence of predictive targets. This design allows for the direct comparison of behavioral and electrophysiological measures between the implicit and the explicit session in the same subjects, thus avoiding confounds of inter-individual variability <xref rid="pone.0065914-Pitts1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

Stimuli were presented in the center of the visual field. Subjects were asked to centrally fixate throughout the recording. Stimuli consisted of 15% targets and 85% of equal amounts of three types of standards. In each block a total of 78 stimuli (12 targets, 22 of each standard type) were presented each for 150 ms and inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 second. Recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a three-standard predictive sequence. The target was a downward facing triangle and the three standards were triangles facing left, upwards and right, at 90 degree increments.

Before the first (implicit) session, subjects were told that a series of triangles would be presented on the screen and were instructed to respond by pressing a button, using their right index finger, whenever they detected a downward facing triangle. Subjects performed a brief training session to ensure they were able to detect the target accurately before the recording session began. After completing the first recording session subjects were questioned whether they noticed at any point during the task that they were able to anticipate the occurrence of the downward facing triangle, i.e the target. Subsequently subjects were then shown the predictive sequence and were told that it would be 100% predictive of a target, but that targets would also appear randomly throughout the block. Subjects were asked to press a button each time a target was presented, to pay attention and look for the predictive sequence, and to avoid premature responses. Subjects then performed a brief training session to ensure that they were confident in the detection of the predictive sequence, before the second recording session began.

Thus, for each subject peak P3b amplitudes (measured in &#x000b5;V) at CPz were evaluated for 6 conditions in each session: targets after predictive sequences (predicted), targets after non predictive random sequences (random), random preceding standards (standards excluding those comprising the predicting sequence) and the three standards consisting of the predictive sequence: the last most-informative standard (n-1), the middle standard (n-2) and the first least-informative standard (n-3) of the predicting sequence. We also evaluated P3 amplitude at CPz for each of the three standards presented randomly, that is, not as a part of the predictive sequence (Sn-1, Sn-2 and Sn-3) in order to compare each of these standards to its counterpart when presented within the predictive sequence. In addition, we evaluated P3b amplitudes at CPz for conditions n-1, n-2, n-3, Sn-1, Sn-2 and Sn-3, during the first 5 and last 5 blocks of the implicit session, to determine whether implicit processing of the predictive sequence changed as a function of time (i.e. between the first half and last half of the implicit session).</p><p>Peak P3b latencies (measured in ms) were evaluated for predicted and random targets at the electrode site with the largest P3b amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction, followed by post-hoc parametric paired t-tests, Sidak corrected for multiple comparisons unless otherwise stated.

First, in both sessions a significantly larger P3b was generated by predicted targets, random targets, compared with standards and by the middle, and last and most-informative stimuli of the predicting sequence, compared with the same standards presented in a randomized non-predictive sequence. Thus, in the explicit session the predictive sequence became a secondary target for the subjects and thus an indicator for successful local contextual processing, replicating results of earlier studies <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065914-Frensch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. During the implicit session subjects reported that they were not aware of any predictive sequence. Nevertheless, during this session significantly larger P3b amplitudes were observed, particularly for the last most-informative stimulus of the predicting sequence (n-1), compared with randomized standards, suggesting that the sequence was detected implicitly. In addition, both sessions induced a gradual increase in P3b amplitude in the predictive sequence, supporting an accumulation of information from the preceding trials <xref rid="pone.0065914-Fogelson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It has been suggested that implicit sequence learning depends on detection of variations in the environment through associative mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0065914-Kutas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, one possible mechanism for the implicit detection of the predictive sequence may be that visual search processes are sensitive to regularities in the visual input <xref rid="pone.0065914-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This may be a likely mechanism since the sequence utilized a clockwise rotation, which is a familiar feature in our everyday surroundings. Another factor that may have contributed to P3b amplitudes increases is the alternating nature of the stimuli in the predictive sequence, while randomized standards also included repetitions <xref rid="pone.0065914-Verleger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which may have confounded our conclusions. However, our findings argue against this possibility, showing positive correlations between n-1 P3b amplitudes and the target-evoked P3b latency shift during the implicit session, together with a tendency for n-1 P3b amplitudes to increase in the second half of the implicit session compared with the first half, suggesting implicit learning of the predictive sequence.

The fact that a significant reaction time difference and a P3b latency shift were observed between the two target conditions during the implicit session, suggests that subjects not only detected the predictive sequence in an implicit manner, but that the predictive information provided by this sequence was also utilized implicitly, in order to facilitate processing of deterministic targets, albeit to a significantly lesser extent compared with explicit contextual processing. This is further supported by correlations demonstrating that the larger the peak P3b for the predictive sequence preceding the target, the larger the target-evoked P3b latency shift that is observed in the implicit session.

Our finding suggest that qualitatively similar neural processes may be involved in processing and utilizing predictive contextual information but that what is modulated is the magnitude to which context is used to facilitate detection of predictable targets. This modulation may occur through top-down attentional networks, so that increased attention during the explicit session, where subjects are instructed to detect and utilize the predictive sequence, facilitates processing of local contextual information compared to when it is processed implicitly. Our findings support this proposition, demonstrating larger P3b amplitudes during the processing of the predictive sequence compared to when these stimuli are processed implicitly. This is in line with studies implicating cognitive control systems as being important in guiding attention during explicit sequence learning <xref rid="pone.0065914-Kutas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and of context-dependent modulation through attention driven top-down mechanisms [8,13,50].
