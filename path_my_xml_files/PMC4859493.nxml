The primary outcome measure was median morphine consumption within the first 24 hours following surgery. The mean&#x000b1;SEM of morphine requirements was reduced from 29,8&#x000b1;5,25 mg to 14,22&#x000b1;3,23 mg (p = 0,015) and resulted in a decrease in pain at rest (p = 0,02) measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from mean&#x000b1;SEM 3.34&#x000b1;0,35 to 0.86&#x000b1;0.24, and also in pain during movement (p = 0,02) from 4.32&#x000b1;0,36 to 1.90&#x000b1;0,30 in the ibuprofen treatment arm; while in the placebo group VAS score at rest ranged from 4.68&#x000b1;0,40 to 2.12&#x000b1;0,42 and during movement from 5.66&#x000b1;0,42 to 3.38&#x000b1;0,44.

We all agree on the importance of multimodal treatment of perioperative pain, since it has direct effects on the outcome of patient recovery [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite this knowledge, acute postoperative pain still is a significant problem that occurs between 60 to 80% of patient&#x02019;s according the different series reported and it often remains undertreated [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of acute pain treatment in the inpatient setting [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However they provide no benefits to the underlying pathophysiology of the process. Adjuvant agents for pain treatment including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) should be used in combination with opioids [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moderate to severe acute postoperative pain should be treated with a multimodal therapy and a preemptive analgesia approach that may help mitigate the side effects of the opioid agents by reducing the total dose required [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are a few NSAID available for intravenous use in Spain (Ketorolac, Dexketoprofen) being their usage limited by the side effects and prolonged periods of treatment are not recommended. Ibuprofen is a nonspecific inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (COX) enzymes, the inhibition rate of COX-1 to COX 2 of Ibuprofen is 2,5:1 which implies a low risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal problems, while other NSAID as for example ketorolac have a ratio of COX-1 to COX-2 inhibition of 330:1, reason for a high risk of side effects and it is therefore its use is controversial in most of perioperative settings [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Oral ibuprofen is a commonly used NSAID with antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, but this presentation is not appropriate in perioperative settings, then its use has been previously limited by the lack of a commercially available parenteral formulation in our country. Until now three surgical studies were conducted to assess the use of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen for the treatment of postoperative pain (outside Europe). The first one evaluates the efficacy and safety in patients undergoing either orthopaedic or abdominal surgery (mostly corresponding to abdominal hysterectomies) [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the second one [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] evaluates the efficacy in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery and the third one [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluates the patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. These studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of perioperative administration of IV ibuprofen for moderate to severe postoperative pain, and set the stage for further investigations and clinical uses [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The present phase III clinical trial is part of our effort to expand the availability of treatment options for multimodal analgesic therapy in Europe. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new formulation of IV-Ibuprofen compared to placebo for the management of postoperative pain in abdominal and orthopaedic surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction in total morphine use during the first 24 hours post-surgery as compared to placebo. The secondary objective was to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of intravenous administration of ibuprofen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This was a phase III, multi-center, randomized [1:1], double-blind, parallel groups, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV-Ibuprofen for the treatment of pain in post-operative elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery in adult patients, with an anticipated need for post-operative hospitalization and IV-Morphine analgesia for at least 24 hours.

Randomized stratification was used according to baseline patient characteristics, type of surgery and centre. In order to avoid any bias and maintain the integrity of the data, the trial was double blind (Pivotal S.L generated the randomization sequence, managed through e-CRF). Adequate drug labelling warranted blinding of both, the patient and the research study staff.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included: reduction in pain intensity at rest and during movement, reduction in morphine consumption during the first 48 and 72 hours post-surgery, time to first subsequent narcotic analgesia for breakthrough pain (or time to treatment failure), reduction in the number of doses of morphine and in the number of attempts of PCA dosing, less nocturnal awakening due to pain and the score on the Ramsay-Hunt sedation scale. Pain intensity was measured by patient self-assessment both at rest and during movement with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours following surgery, combined with Ramsay-Hunt sedation scale. The VAS was presented as a 10 cm horizontal line anchored by the words "no pain" (corresponding to zero) and "worst possible pain" (corresponding to 10). The patient was taught to mark the point on the line that they felt represented their perception of their current pain. The values were scored as mild pain (from 1 to 4), moderate pain (from 5 to 6) and severe pain (from 7 to 10) [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>At the beginning of the trial a complete physical examination of all participants was performed, baseline vital signs were recorded, blood samples were drawn for clinical chemistry (included: sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), haematology (haematocrit, haemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count) and coagulation analysis (activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and INR); concomitant medications were reviewed and recorded for each patient. Tolerability and safety profile of 800 mg IV-Ibuprofen versus placebo, both infused every 6 hours, was evaluated through a comparison of treatment emergent adverse events (AE) [by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)], local reaction due to intravenous infusion (pain, erythema, induration) as well as vital signs, clinical chemistry values, haematology and coagulation values. Researchers were responsible for identifying and promptly reporting any AE that occurred during the study period and to grade the event by intensity from 1 to 3 [according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4], recording action taken with the study drug, causality of the study drug, required treatment, outcome and time of resolution. Vital signs and laboratory results were monitored closely to investigate the effects of the treatment, including renal, liver and haematology values. Vital signs were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 hours after the initial dose and every 6 hours thereafter concomitant with study drug administration until the final dose and during the follow- up visit (within 2 to 4 days after the last dose of the study drug treatment). Routine laboratory tests (chemistry, haematology and coagulation) were done during screening as baseline, within 24 hours after the first dose for abdominal surgery, at 48 hours after the first dose for patients with hip surgery, shoulder, spine and ligaments and at 72 hours after the first dose for patients with knee or column surgery, and at the follow up visit. Adverse event monitoring continued through day of the follow-up visit, in the event that a patient could not attend the follow-up visit, safety assessments were conducted by telephone.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Sample size determination was based on previous IV-ibuprofen studies and on literature review [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It was projected that the morphine requirement in the placebo group would be approximately 55 mg and that the ibuprofen treatment would reduce it to around 45 mg. Accepting an alpha level of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, 143 subjects were deemed necessary in each group to recognize as statistically significant difference greater than or equal to 10 mg. The standard deviation was assumed to be 30. Considering a dropout rate of 10&#x02013;12%, a total of 320 patients were to be included, 160 in each treatment group. If half of the patients correspond to each type of surgery (orthopaedic and abdominal surgery) the power to evaluate differences in each group would be 55%. An interim analysis (according to the second amendments to the original protocol) was performed once half of the planned sample (160 patients) had completed the study, in order to evaluate whether or not it was appropriate to continue the trial, and/or to increase or decrease the sample size according to the differences found between the two treatment groups. Statisticians who did not participate in the evaluation of patients carried out this analysis, and the results were not disclosed to the study researchers. For this statistical comparison was considered a significance level of p &#x0003c;0.015. Recruitment was to be stopped if significant differences for the two subgroups (abdominal surgery and orthopaedic surgery) were reached. If not, sample size was to be calculated based on the data obtained. All recruiting hospitals had the same case report forms, with an instruction manual providing detailed instructions for each data item, and the research team were trained on the data collection procedures required.</p><p>For statistical analyses of the efficacy endpoints two populations were defined: the Intention To Treat (ITT) population consisting of all patients who were both randomized and treated, (only patients included in the ITT population from the interim analysis were included in the final ITT population); and the Per Protocol (PP) population consisting of all patients from the aforementioned ITT population who had received the study treatment for at least 24 hours. The safety analysis was performed based on all the subjects who had received at least one dose of the study medication. Continuous variables were summarized using the mean, standard error of the mean (SEM), median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum with the total number of patients contributing values. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess if the continuous measure followed a Normal distribution. Categorical variables were summarized in contingency tables by presenting the absolute and relative frequencies of patients in each category. CI 95% for categorical variables was included in the efficacy analysis. The association between continuous variables and the treatment group were analysed following the T-Student test if the variable followed Normal distribution and the Wilcoxon test if it did not. The association between categorical variables and the treatment were analysed following the Chi-square test or F- Fisher test as applicable. The dependent variable was the evaluated measure and the independent variables were the treatment and the visit or evaluation moment. To analyse the time until patients presented a determined event, a Kaplan-Meier model stratified by treatment group was applied. Comparisons between treatment groups were performed through the Log-Rank test. Statistical tables were created using the SAS version 9.3 statistical packages. A bilateral risk of &#x003b1; = 0.015 was fixed for all analyses performed. Adverse events were coded using MedDRA system organ classifications, and the adverse events were also coded as serious or non-serious using FDA definitions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 206 patients were enrolled at nine surgical centres in Spain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154004.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the distribution.

The main objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of IV-Ibuprofen for the management of postoperative pain in comparison to placebo, while the secondary objective was to evaluate tolerability and safety of IV-Ibuprofen. The primary endpoint was reached, as intravenous treatment with ibuprofen reduced the morphine requirements within the 24 hours post-surgery, to almost half of the mean compared to placebo group. In comparison to previous studies conducted with intravenous formulations of ibuprofen [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the median morphine consumption was lower in both treatment arms, which may have been due to the very different type of surgery conducted, possibly associated with lower levels of post-operative pain. For example in the study of Southwoth et al. 73% of patients underwent abdominal surgical procedures, fifty-five per cent of which were hysterectomies (predictive VAS 7 to 10). However, while the median morphine consumption was higher, the total morphine reduction was only 26%, compared to a 47.6% reduction in our study. A similar outcome were observed in both Singla et al. study, where patients went through orthopaedic surgery receiving iv-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine than those receiving placebo, and the Kroll et al. study, where the median morphine requirements was reduced by 19% in patients that experience abdominal hysterectomy receiving IV-Ibuprofen.</p><p>Furthermore related to morphine requirements, both the number of morphine doses and the number of attempts of dosing morphine at PCA were lower in patients treated with ibuprofen than in patients treated with placebo. Treatment with IV-Ibuprofen had an additional benefit for those patients because they had also a lower risk for treatment failures versus patients treated with placebo.</p><p>Since patients could self-administer morphine via a PCA in both treatment arms it was expected that pain would be well controlled in most of the patients. However, acute pain both at rest and at movement within 24 hours after surgery was even better controlled in patients treated with ibuprofen than in patients treated with placebo, with this difference being statistically significant. It has been reported that postoperative mean pain scores higher than 3 have a significant effect on general activity, mood, walking ability, and sleep [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results suggest that adding IV-Ibuprofen could have a clinical benefit in postoperative pain control, especially during the first 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other secondary endpoints such as Ramsay-Hunt sedation scale and nocturnal awakenings due to pain did not show significant differences between both treatment groups.</p><p>The major weakness of our study concerns both the sample size and the projected morphine consumption, as we had planned to analyse patients from two distinct groups, orthopaedic and abdominal surgery. The literature describes orthopaedic surgery as one of the most painful surgeries (postoperative pain prediction of VAS score from 7 to 10). Not being able to include orthopaedic surgery patients had major implications on the outcome of the study: it lowered the total VAS score prediction of severe postoperative pain resulting in a lower range; it prevented us from being able to assess the effectiveness of the use of iv ibuprofen in orthopaedic surgery; and it precluded us from being able to draw conclusions about the use of IV-Ibuprofen in a longer period (72 hours), and the benefit of reduced morphine consumption during the three days post- surgery. Regarding the lower average consumption of morphine in our study, initially we predicted that a reduction of 10 mg of morphine consumption would be needed to be statistically significant. But since we could only evaluate the effectiveness of the abdominal surgery patients, which were predominantly laparoscopic surgery, a mean reduction of 7 mg or a median reduction of 15.66 mg in morphine consumption seems to be clinically relevant, regardless the result was statistically significant. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the clinical significance of the decrease in morphine requirements, current literature suggests the negative influence of morphine on the immune system, affecting cancer recurrence in a dose dependent way [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Besides the well-known classic opioids-related adverse effects on recovery and rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], another reasons for trying to diminish morphine consumption are on one hand that many patients have comorbidities and are poly-medicated which interfere with pharmacodynamics of the opioids and increase even more the risk of drugs interaction and side effects [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; and on the other hand the probability of development of tolerance and hyperalgesia induced by opioids [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, all opioid dose-sparing strategies are desired [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The safety analysis included all 206 patients that were treated in the study. Ibuprofen was safe and well tolerated, local injection site reactions and laboratory data did not reveal any additional risk related to intravenous infusion of ibuprofen. No substantial differences between the two treatments arms were note with regards to the incidence of AE. Some events such as urinary retention, headache, nervous system disorders and enzyme alterations (increased transaminases) were more frequent in the placebo-treated group, while nausea and vomiting were more frequent in the ibuprofen-treated group. It should be noted that nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common specific complications after abdominal surgery [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (which comprised the majority of our patients). Therefore, not necessarily attributable to the drugs used, but it could be involved both genetic factors as well as the type of surgery [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All serious adverse events were unrelated to the study treatment and were resolved. There were no deaths during the study and no prolonged hospitalizations due to adverse events related to the study treatments. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, which constitute typical opioids adverse reactions, was very similar in both treatment arms, despite the significant reduction of morphine consumption in the ibuprofen arm versus the placebo arm. There were no reports of bronchospasm, constipation, dry mouth, muscle twitching, sleepiness, sweating, respiratory depression and confusion. The results from this trial agree with the results from other trials conducted in surgical patients treated with other approved IV-Ibuprofen formulations. In concordance with our results the trial from Southworth et al., Kroll et al., and Singla et al., also show that similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, neither gastrointestinal toxicity, bleeding or renal failure [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, with respects to the warnings of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) about the long term use and/or at high doses of Ibuprofen and other NSAID at the level of the renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, bone, cardiovascular function among others, and considering the safety profile demonstrated both in our study and previous, the use of IV-Ibuprofen for a short period of time in in hospitalized patients should not be an issue.</p><p>Although our results from orthopaedic surgery patients were not available for an efficacy analysis, due to the small sample size, the safety and tolerability results suggest that IV-Ibuprofen may be also safe and well tolerated when infusions are administered throughout 48 or 72 hours after surgery, though further studies are required. This is the first European phase III clinical trial about the use of IV-Ibuprofen. It is a multicentre national study, with a double blind and randomized controlled design. Conducting a study in our local population is important since it is known that sex, age, weight, cultural factors as well as prior experiences of patients may impact pain response [<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154004.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Perioperative administration of IV-ibuprofen 800 mg every 6 hours in abdominal surgery patients decreases morphine requirements, pain, and the risk of rescue treatment with other analgesics. IV-ibuprofen was safe and well tolerated. Treatment with IV-ibuprofen 800 mg every 6 hours could be a useful adjuvant for short-term use in perioperative pain in abdominal surgery in adult patients. Given the safety profile of IV-ibuprofen, the save on morphine consumption and its known anti-inflammatory properties beneficial not only on postoperative pain relief, but on the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute postoperative pain, we consider appropriate that protocols for management of postoperative pain should include IV-ibuprofen 800 mg every 6 hours as an option to offer patients an analgesic benefit while reducing the potentially risks associated with morphine consumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154004.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154004.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154004.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154004.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154004.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Serious Adverse Events.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154004.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154004.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Most frequent treatment emergent adverse events.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154004.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154004.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of local reactions.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154004.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Francisco Borrego Rabasco M.D., Ph.D., Research Professor for his expertise and helpful discussions.
