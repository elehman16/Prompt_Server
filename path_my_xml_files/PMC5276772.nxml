efficacious for pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism. Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise
is an exercise program with validated safety and efficacy in improving physical function
in the elderly. In this study, we investigated this program&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on plasma
glucose elevation when it was adapted to a pregnancy model. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve
18- to 19-year-old females without a history of pregnancy were randomly assorted into two
groups: an intervention group, for which six subjects were outfitted with mock-pregnancy
suits and asked to perform Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise, and a control group who did not
perform exercise. The intervention group had a mean Borg Scale score of 11.1 &#x000b1; 0.9 during
the exercise. [Results] No significant intragroup differences were observed in fasting,
baseline, or post-intervention/observation plasma glucose levels. On the other hand, the
intergroup change in plasma glucose levels after intervention/observation was significant
when comparing the intervention and control groups: &#x02212;1.66 &#x000b1; 7.0 and 9.42 &#x000b1; 6.57&#x02005;mg/dl,
respectively. [Conclusion] Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise appears to effectively inhibit plasma
glucose elevation at intensity and movement levels that can be safely applied to pregnant
women with abnormal glucose metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Glucose metabolism disorders</kwd><kwd>Pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd>Gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Exercise during pregnancy effectively enhances maternal and fetal health and physical

pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes mellitus, which often complicate
pregnancies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise is therefore
recommended throughout the pregnancy term for women without absolute contraindications to
it<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Diabetes is increasing in
prevalence worldwide: one in 11 adults are currently affected, and this number is estimated
to grow to one in 10 by 2040<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal
glucose metabolism discovered during pregnancy is defined as gestational diabetes mellitus,
and is estimated to affect 15% of pregnant women worldwide<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Along with dietary regimens, exercise therapy is a basic treatment
for diabetes; its immediate effects include enhanced glucose and fatty acid utilization and
decreased plasma glucose levels, while its long-term effects include decreased insulin
resistance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pregnant women with
abnormal glucose metabolism have been reported to experience maternal complications
including miscarriage and premature birth, as well as fetal complications including fetal
distress and fetal demise.</p><p>Exercise is typically recommended for pregnant women. However, there is a lack of evidence
to recommend exercise as a safe therapy for pregnant women with abnormal glucose
metabolism<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise programs adapted
to pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism must avoid excessive contraction of
abdominal muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and performing such a
program habitually may contribute to increased insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, selecting an exercise program for pregnant women
with abnormal glucose metabolism is difficult due to the lack of evidence regarding
safety.</p><p>Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise is an exercise program with validated safety and efficacy in

inhibitory effects on plasma glucose elevation when it was adapted to a pregnancy model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve healthy, 18- to 19-year-old females were selected as the participants in this study.
Participants had no regular exercise routine, no history of pregnancy, and were not
currently pregnant. Candidates who were visiting a hospital regularly or taking medication
for any kind of disease were excluded. Before the study began, its research objectives and
methods were explained to participants verbally and in writing, and their written consent
was obtained. Research data collection was conducted in November 2014. This study was
conducted after obtaining the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of Kansai University
of Welfare Sciences (Approval No. 14-41).</p><p>The exercise program used was Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise. This program consists of
calisthenics (physical exercises) that incorporate elements of Tai Chi and was developed for
frail elderly individuals to be able to perform the exercise program continuously,
enjoyably, and safely<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tai Chi
Yuttari-exercises include two types of activities, and the subjects can perform them in
either a standing or sitting position. Only the two sitting versions were used in this
study. In order to prevent falls, a chair is placed in front of the participants in the
sitting versions, so that even elderly individuals with diminished physical function can
exercise safely. All movements in Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise are slow and use muscle groups
throughout the body; no quick movements are required. In addition, participants imitate the
movements while watching a video, removing the need for a special exercise instructor.
Moreover, the program is not dependent on the weather, because it can be performed indoors.
We have previously reported the regimen to be safe when we verified the cardiopulmonary
dynamics of healthy females with an average age of 74&#x02005;years performing Tai Chi
Yuttari-exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A summary of our
findings is as follows: the respiratory rate slightly increased, but no abnormal breathing
patterns were exhibited; blood pressure tended to decrease following exercise; subjective
exercise intensity (perceived at the heart and lungs) had a maximum Borg Scale score of 9
(very light) during exercise; exercise intensity ranged from 1.34&#x02013;1.87 METs; and the
respiratory quotient ranged from 0.82&#x02013;0.90.</p><p>The 12 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: six to an intervention
group that performed the Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise and six to a control group that did not.
The total duration of the Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise was 30 minutes; one set consisted of two
types of activities in a sitting position with a rest break between. Participants performed
two sets over a 60 minute timeframe. For the pregnancy model, women in the intervention
group wore a front-sided ~300 g backpack containing 1.8&#x02005;kg of weights and newspaper (height:
34&#x02005;cm, width: 18&#x02005;cm, and total weight ~2.1&#x02005;kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

their movements so that their abdominal region would not be compressed in the resulting
range of motion. The intervention group was asked to rate their perceived exercise intensity
using the Borg Scale as well as their ability to converse during exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> while they performed the exercises.</p><p>The measurement procedure was as follows. First, participants were instructed to avoid
strenuous exercise and to fast (except for drinking water) from 8 p.m. the day prior to the
exercise session. Fasting plasma glucose was then measured on the day of the session using a
plasma glucose meter (Medisafe Fit: Thermo Co., Ltd., Japan). Participants in both groups
were fed one pack of a cookie-type test meal (glucose load) containing 75&#x02005;g of sugar and
28.5&#x02005;g of fat (Meal Test C: Saraya Co., Ltd., Japan) for precision testing of glucose
tolerance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants were
instructed to consume their test meal within 20 minutes, with up to 200&#x02005;ml of drinking water
permitted during feeding. Plasma glucose was measured after one hour of rest in a sitting
position. Baseline indicates measurements taken 1 hour after test meal consumption. During
the next hour, the intervention group performed the Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise, while the
control group continued to rest in a sitting position; plasma glucose was then rechecked
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The test meal was consumed within a 20-minute timeframe, and plasma glucose was then

used for intervention versus control group comparisons and for baseline versus
post-intervention/observation comparisons. The IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 19.0

Yuttari-exercise, an exercise program deemed feasible for pregnant women with abnormal
glucose metabolism to perform safely, using healthy females under a provisional pregnancy
model.</p><p>The resting heart rate increases by about 10 bpm in pregnant women<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, circulating blood volume increases from the first
trimester with an average increase of 40&#x02013;45% in late pregnancy from pre-pregnancy levels
(although individual variations are large)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and blood pressure slightly decreases in the second trimester but
increases thereafter<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The supine
position increases compression of the uterus, resulting in impeded venous return from the
lower body and reduced cardiac output, which in turn causes a drop in arterial blood
pressure. If this position is maintained, arterial compression causes blood pressure of the
uterine artery to drop below the arterial pressure of the upper limbs<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG), while cautioning against exercise in pregnant patients with absolute
contraindications, recommends dynamic physical exercise using major muscle groups at an
exercise intensity ranging from 12&#x02013;14 on the Borg Scale, which corresponds to a range where
individuals can still hold a conversation as they exercise<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise may be performed in either a sitting or
standing position and consists of slow movements using muscle groups throughout the body.
The forms of Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise adopted for our pregnancy model avoided leg positions
contraindicated for pregnant women. Under these conditions, participants had a mean Borg
Scale score of 11 and were able to hold a conversation during the exercise session. Given
that this exercise regimen conforms to ACOG recommendations, we believe it would have
minimal effects on the cardiopulmonary dynamics that accompany pregnancy.</p><p>Exercises adapted for pregnant women should avoid Valsalva maneuver-like movements and
should be conducted in an environment with good humidity that avoids heat stress<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, pregnant women&#x02019;s ability to
balance is reduced, and their risk of falling is elevated<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since falling can lead to maternal and fetal complications,
selection of an exercise program must take into account fall prevention. Walking&#x02014;a
representative exercise program for all ages and genders&#x02014;has been reported to increase the
risk of falling in seniors who perform the exercise habitually<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cardiopulmonary dynamics are stable during Tai Chi
Yuttari-exercise even for elderly individuals<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This finding, along with its ability to be conducted indoors, led
us to consider this exercise program suitable for pregnant women. This program also
addresses the increased fall risk of pregnant women, as it can be performed while
sitting.</p><p>In this study, significant differences within each of the two groups in terms of plasma
glucose levels were not observed during fasting nor before or after
intervention/observation. However, mean plasma glucose was significantly decreased in the
intervention group following exercise when compared with levels prior to exercise, while
plasma glucose increased or remained unchanged for all subjects in the control group during
the observation period. Maintaining satisfactory blood glucose control is critical for
preventing maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women with abnormal glucose
metabolism. Exercise intensities that result in a 40&#x02013;60% peak oxygen uptake (or even higher)
have been recommended in order to gain the maximal benefit from exercise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, these intensities are
inappropriate for pregnant women. In addition to fulfilling the major premise of ensuring
the safety of the mother and infant, the Tai Chi Yuttari-exercise program should allow
pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism to effectively control their plasma
glucose.</p><p>The first limitation of the present study is the poor reliability of the pregnancy model.
In addition, our data related to the inhibitory effects on plasma glucose elevation were
obtained from healthy women who were not pregnant. Accordingly, caution is necessary when
interpreting our results, including those concerning safety, and when adapting them to
pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism. Finally, the data supporting the
recommendation for exercise therapy for pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism are
weak<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there is no consensus on
how to adapt exercise in this context. Thus, currently, prudent judgment is necessary when
adapting exercise for pregnant women with abnormal glucose metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dempsey</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>No need for a pregnant pause: physical activity may reduce
