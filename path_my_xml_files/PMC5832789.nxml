The levels of ctDNA fluctuate with treatment during cancer therapy, broadly correlating with disease response and relapse across a wide range of cancers and treatments and offering the potential for non-invasive monitoring of disease status in both the metastatic and early settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Circulating tumor DNA is a surrogate for tumor biopsy in assessment of driver mutations such as <italic>EGFR</italic> in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and allows assessment of clonal evolution over time in patients with multiple metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. There are now early data that suggest that ctDNA dynamics in the early stages of treatment could be used to predict treatment outcome before tumor response can be assessed through the conventional means of size on imaging or a change in clinical symptoms or signs. Early ctDNA dynamics predict outcome on chemotherapy for colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">These studies have shown that early ctDNA dynamics could potentially allow a real-time, individualized assessment of a treatment&#x02019;s efficacy, allowing treatment adaptation with either an early switch away from an ineffective therapy or addition of further therapy in a group identified early as being resistant to therapy. However there are no data from large, homogenously treated phase III trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, that allow a robust determination of clinical validity for ctDNA dynamics in assessing response to targeted therapies.</p><p id="Par5">The potential for ctDNA dynamics to predict long-term outcome is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that a fall in measured ctDNA corresponds to a functional effect of treatment on the cancer, and that short-term effects of treatment will predict long-term clinical outcome. The exact mechanisms by which ctDNA enters the circulation are incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but are likely in part a function of tumor cell death and turn-over given the observed association between ctDNA and tumor volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Specific treatment effects on these processes may be important in relating early ctDNA dynamics to clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par6">The second assumption is that an early measurement of ctDNA can provide an adequate surrogate of the overall, aggregate response of a patient&#x02019;s cancer to treatment. Intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity presents a challenge to targeted therapy response, as sub clones may have divergent response to therapy. An example of this phenomenon is the occurrence of mutations in the estrogen receptor gene, <italic>ESR1</italic>, in breast cancer that result in constitutive activation of the estrogen receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations evolve in response to prior aromatase inhibitor therapy for advanced breast cancer in as many as a third of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Prior data has suggested that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations may frequently be sub clonal in the resistant cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, yet the extent to which this sub clonality effects response to therapy is unknown. The selective estrogen degrader fulvestrant has activity in vitro against cancers with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, although higher concentrations are required to inhibit mutant ER than wild-type ER and it is unknown if the clinical schedules of fulvestrant achieve the doses required to degrade mutant ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We undertook an analysis of the PALOMA-3 trial to assess the utility of early ctDNA dynamics in predicting outcome on CDK4/6 inhibitors, and to investigate the implications of tumor heterogeneity. CDK4/6 inhibitors have substantial efficacy in the treatment of advanced estrogen (ER) receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, the most common subtype of breast cancer. Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, increases progression-free survival when added to the endocrine therapies letrozole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and ribociclib increases progression-free survival when added to letrozole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The PALOMA-3 trial compared palbociclib plus fulvestrant with fulvestrant plus placebo in a 2:1 ratio in advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine treatment, demonstrating an improvement in progression-free survival from 4.6 months to 9.5 months with the addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, studies have been unable to identify which ER-positive breast cancers benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and there is a pressing need to identify biomarker approaches to identify which patients derive long-term benefit.</p><p id="Par8">Here we show that early ctDNA dynamics in the commonly truncal mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> predict sensitivity to palbociclib. In contrast we show that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are commonly sub clonal and weak predictors of outcome, with early ctDNA dynamics anticipating clonal selection of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations by therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Early plasma dynamics of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations</title><p id="Par9">Sequential plasma samples were collected at baseline, cycle 1&#x02009;day 15, and at progression in the PALOMA-3 study to assess whether early dynamic changes in ctDNA could predict progression-free survival (PFS) on palbociclib.

Our results here demonstrate that early suppression of ctDNA predicts long-term outcome substantially earlier than changes in tumor size, when truncal mutations such as <italic>PIK3CA</italic> are tracked in plasma, in the setting of palbociclib with fulvestrant in advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</p><p id="Par21">Our data demonstrates that early ctDNA changes may be predictive for cytostatic therapies such as palbociclib. Cancer cells predominantly undergo apoptosis as a result of a failure to transition the S and M phases of the cell cycle. Our data suggest cancers with incomplete cell cycle arrest on palbociclib continue to proliferate on treatment, undergoing apoptosis and/or necrosis with ongoing release of tumor DNA in the circulation. In contrast, cancers with more complete G0/G1 cell cycle arrest to palbociclib no longer undergo cell death and have more fully suppressed ctDNA. Ensuring complete cell cycle arrest by CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations is therefore shown to be key to maintaining long-term disease control by therapy.</p><p id="Par22">As <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation detection at baseline is not a predictive biomarker for palbociclib and fulvestrant, in this analysis it likely represents a functionally agnostic means of assessing the presence of DNA released by the patients&#x02019; cancer cells, its truncal status meaning it is found in all cancer cells within the patient. Our data illustrate the importance of assessing clonality in using early ctDNA dynamics to predict response to targeted therapies in cancer. <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant clones evolve in ER-positive advanced breast cancer during aromatase inhibitor treatment, with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations resulting in constitutively active ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, though <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant clones may be acutely sensitive to fulvestrant or the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), this does not translate into improved PFS for patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant cancers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In contrast to this we show that patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in their cancers have worse outcome on fulvestrant alone. This discrepancy could potentially be explained by cancers with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations detected in plasma being genetically diverse and more likely to feature other resistant sub clones not assessed here, highlighting the potential importance of understanding heterogeneity with non-invasive assays. Previous studies of early ctDNA dynamics within the first 2 weeks of treatment have not assessed sub clonality or explored functionally distinct clones, using either a single gene or heterogeneous cohorts receiving a variety of treatments and measuring a number of different genetic aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Relative early clonal dynamics could offer an approach to tackle intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, through identifying differences in sensitivity to treatment early, and anticipating changes in clonal composition at progression.</p><p id="Par23">The early ctDNA dynamics of a truncal mutation approach could be applied to other cancer treatments with no biomarker, but a number of challenges remain. Palbociclib&#x02019;s cytostatic effect may be significant in generalizing this analysis to other treatments which are not cytostatic. The optimal time point for comparative assessment is also unknown. Further problems in generalizing this approach include confident selection of a truncal mutation and understanding the functional significance of sub clones, as seen here with the contrasts between <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic>. Technically the best method for measuring the tumor content of plasma for early changes remains uncertain.

A limitation of our study is a degree of uncertainty concerning the true truncal or sub clonal status of the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, which we infer rather than directly assess with multiple region, multiple time point biopsies. Data from archival primary tissue would be helpful in supporting the hypothesis that the majority of the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations we observe are truncal. Analysis of TCGA data confirmed that polyclonal <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations are rare in primary disease, but the landscape of endocrine-resistant disease is less well described. A small subset of the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations observed in the PALOMA-3 analysis may be sub clonal, as is potentially the case for the patients observed to have an <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation at higher allele fraction than their <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation. Another limitation is the relatively modest amount of plasma we were able to assess, although this did not substantially affect our analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>).

Further clinical trials using a validated cut-off for circulating DNA response will be required to test this approach prospectively. It may be further possible to translate this approach to allow early assessment of other treatments, and individualize assessment of response to therapy. Conceivably ctDNA response could also be used to screen agents for signs of efficacy in early phase trials. Future trials examining the early dynamics of circulating tumor DNA need to consider the clonal status of the measured aberration, and whether it is appropriate to group together aberrations that may be sub clonal and functionally distinct.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental study design</title><p id="Par27">The PALOMA-3 study was an international, multi-center, phase III, double-blind randomized controlled trial of palbociclib in women with advanced, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The wells were analyzed on a Bio-Rad&#x000ae; QX200 instrument for FAM and VIC signal in each droplet. The Bio-Rad QuantaSoft&#x000ae; software package version 1.4.0.99 was used fit the proportion of empty droplets to a Poisson distribution to calculate the original concentration of FAM and VIC-binding template. Copies/ml and allele fraction were calculated directly from this.</p><p id="Par31">A <italic>PIK3CA</italic> multiplex droplet digital PCR assay was used to assess E542K (c.1624 G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A), E545K (c.1633 G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A), H1047R (c.3140&#x02009;A&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;G), and H1047L (c.3140&#x000a0;A&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T). Samples were analyzed using either 0.25&#x02009;ml plasma equivalent or 1.3&#x02009;ng, whichever was the larger, the latter corresponding to approximately 400 wild-type alleles. A multiplex was called as mutation positive if there were at least two FAM-positive droplets, at least one of these being FAM only. Samples were only called as undetectable if there were at least 300 wild-type alleles detected. If this criterion was not met then the sample was repeated or designated as failed if there was insufficient material to repeat. Individual mutations were subsequently confirmed by repeating the same plasma equivalent with a singleplex assay. As the mutation had previously been identified in the multiplex a single FAM-positive droplet was accepted as positive. All mutation assays were run with three separate non-template controls, with no positive calls made above the control FAM signal.</p><p id="Par32"><italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were interrogated using two separate droplet digital PCR multiplexes from Bio-Rad&#x000ae;, multiplex 1 (dHsaMDXE91450042) and multiplex 2 (dHsaMDXE65719815), updating and expanding a previous analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The same criteria was used as for the baseline samples for a sample being called as undetectable. Given the increasing error in estimates from digital PCR at very low concentrations of template, only those samples with four or more FAM-positive droplets in the baseline mutation assay were taken forward for longitudinal analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The Cancer Genome Atlas</title><p id="Par34">The Cancer Genome Atlas data for the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations E542K, E545K, H1047R, and H1047L and the <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations E380Q, L536R, Y537C, D538G, S463P, Y537N, and Y537S in breast cancer were accessed electronically from cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbioportal.org">http://cbioportal.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par35">The &#x0201c;circulating tumor DNA response&#x0201d; was defined as the ratio of mutant copies/ml of plasma at day 15 and day 1, subsequently denoted as CDR<sub>15</sub>.
