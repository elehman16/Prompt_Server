Two phase 1 studies evaluated potential effects of food on single-dose pharmacokinetics of IR/ER HB/APAP tablets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>These were single-center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-period crossover studies in healthy volunteers (aged 18&#x02013;55 years). IR/ER HB/APAP was administered as a single 2-tablet dose (study 1) or 3-tablet dose (study 2) under fed (high- and low-fat) and fasted conditions. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0&#x000a0;h to time t (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) and from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>) and maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of hydrocodone and APAP under fed versus fasted conditions were compared using analysis of variance. A 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval of the geometric least squares mean ratio fully contained within 80 to 125&#x000a0;% indicated no treatment difference. Safety and tolerability were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty of 48 participants in study 1 and 21 of 30 in study 2 completed all treatments. In both studies, under fed (high- or low-fat meal) versus fasted conditions, 90&#x000a0;% CIs for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> for both hydrocodone and APAP were entirely contained within the bioequivalent range (80&#x02013;125&#x000a0;%), indicating that high- and low-fat meals did not affect the extent of exposure. In both studies, a high-fat meal did not affect the C<sub>max</sub> for hydrocodone. Hydrocodone C<sub>max</sub> was not affected by a low-fat meal in study 1 but increased by approximately 19&#x000a0;% in study 2. A high-fat meal decreased APAP C<sub>max</sub> by approximately 20&#x000a0;% (study 1) and 13&#x000a0;% (study 2); a low-fat meal decreased APAP C<sub>max</sub> by 22&#x000a0;% (study 1) and 21&#x000a0;% (study 2). Approximately 50&#x000a0;% of participants in both studies reported &#x02265;1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), with no notable difference based on food intake. There were no serious or severe AEs. The most common TEAEs were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pharmacokinetic and safety findings were similar regardless of food intake.

Additional potential advantages of ER opioids include fewer concentration peaks and troughs throughout the day, which may improve pain control and compliance, as well as prevent sleep disruption as a result of less-frequent dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fixed-dose combination (FDC) opioid analgesics may provide additive analgesic efficacy while allowing a reduction in the total dose of each component; this may reduce the risk of dose-related adverse events (AEs) associated with either component administered as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, until recently, no opioid FDC with ER properties has been available.</p><p>The most frequently prescribed drug (of any kind) in the United States is the FDC analgesic IR hydrocodone bitartrate (HB)/acetaminophen (APAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Biphasic IR/ER HB/APAP 7.5/325-mg tablets (MNK-155; Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Hazelwood, MO) are in development for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain for which nonopioid analgesics are inadequate. IR/ER HB/APAP delivers 25&#x000a0;% of its HB and 50&#x000a0;% of the APAP from an IR layer for rapid onset of analgesia and employs a gastroretentive matrix (Acuform&#x000ae;, Depomed, Inc., Newark, CA) to allow sustained release of the remainder of the HB (75&#x000a0;%) and APAP (50&#x000a0;%) over a 12-h dosing period. A similarly formulated IR/ER oxycodone/APAP tablet (XARTEMIS&#x02122; XR; formerly MNK-795, Mallinckrodt Brand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) was approved for the management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Given that IR/ER HB/APAP is formulated to provide both a rapid and an extended duration of action, it is necessary to characterize the extent and rate of exposure of hydrocodone and APAP during treatment with IR/ER HB/APAP in patients treated under different conditions. In two phase 1 trials, single- and steady-state administration of IR/ER HB/APAP under fasted conditions was found to provide total and peak exposure similar to IR HB/APAP with less-frequent dosing (Data on file, Mallinckrodt, Hazelwood, MO). Potential effects of food on absorption of IR/ER HB/APAP have yet to be characterized.</p><p>Clinically relevant food effects have been observed with ER gabapentin tablets (Gralise&#x000ae;, Depomed, Inc., Newark, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ER metformin HCl tablets (Glumetza&#x000ae;, Santarus, Inc., San Diego, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] formulated using the same gastroretentive matrix used for IR/ER HB/APAP and IR/ER OC/APAP, with high fat content (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% calories from fat) augmenting these effects. For ER gabapentin, compared with the fasted state, low-fat and high-fat meals increased the extent of absorption as measured by maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) by 33 to 84&#x000a0;%, respectively, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 33 to 118&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For ER metformin HCl, compared with the fasted state, low-fat and high-fat meals increased AUC by 38 and 73&#x000a0;%, respectively, but C<sub>max</sub> was unaffected. However, for IR/ER OC/APAP, food and fat content do not alter the extent or rate of absorption of oxycodone or APAP compared with the fasted state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>It is important to ascertain whether food and fat content of a meal might affect the rate and extent of absorption of the active pharmaceutical ingredients of IR/ER HB/APAP relative to the fasted state, as observed with some products using the same ER matrix. To that end, two phase 1 studies in healthy adult volunteers evaluated the effect of fed (high- and low-fat meals) versus fasted conditions on single-dose pharmacokinetics and bioavailability following administration of IR/ER HB/APAP 7.5/325-mg tablets given as a single 2-tablet dose (study 1) or a single 3-tablet dose (study 2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Two phase 1, single-center (PPD Phase I Clinic, Austin, TX, USA), open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-period crossover trials were conducted.

Hydrocodone and APAP concentrations were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay that was validated over a calibration range of 0.100 to 50.0&#x000a0;ng/mL for HC and a range of 100 to 50,000&#x000a0;ng/mL (study 1) or 15,000&#x000a0;ng/mL (study 2) for APAP. HC-d6 and APAP-d4 were used as the internal standards. Study data were collected using the Analyst Version 1.4.2 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and PPD Assist LIMS Version 5 (PPD, Richmond, VA). The assay method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, ruggedness, recovery, and specificity. Studies to confirm both short-term stability and long-term storage stability were performed.

In contrast, only 1 of 5 who vomited after a high-fat meal did so after their first dose. In the remaining 5, the dose taken was the second or third dose. The participant who discontinued after receiving the 2-tablet dose because of moderate pruritus was treated with a single 25-mg dose of diphenhydramine, after which the AE resolved.</p><p>The most commonly reported individual TEAEs (affecting &#x02265;10&#x000a0;% of participants in the overall group) included nausea, vomiting, and dizziness in both studies. In addition, headache after the 2-tablet dose and pruritus and feeling hot after the 3-tablet dose were reported in &#x02265;10&#x000a0;% of participants. After either dose, all TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. No severe or serious TEAEs or deaths were reported.</p><p>No clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or mean or individual oxygen saturation values were reported. No 12-lead electrocardiogram abnormalities were noted, and no abnormal physical examination result was considered a TEAE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Data from two phase 1 studies demonstrated that there is only a minimal food effect with IR/ER HB/APAP 7.5/325-mg tablets, not likely to be of clinical significance. A high-fat meal did not have an effect on hydrocodone total exposure or peak exposure after either a 2-tablet or 3-tablet dose. A low-fat meal did not affect total hydrocodone exposure after a 2-tablet or 3-tablet dose but did increase peak exposure after a 3-tablet dose by approximately 19&#x000a0;%. No effect of food on C<sub>max</sub> was noted after the 2-tablet dose. These results are consistent with food effects reported for other ER hydrocodone products, where food, particularly a fatty meal, may produce modest increases in hydrocodone C<sub>max</sub> but have no significant effect on total absorption or require administration on an empty stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. After either IR/ER HB/APAP dose, hydrocodone was rapidly absorbed under all conditions, with no clinically relevant lag in the appearance of plasma concentrations when administered with food. There was a single peak with no trough between the IR and ER phases, suggesting that the objective of rapid onset of effect with sustained activity thereafter has been achieved.</p><p>A high-fat meal decreased APAP C<sub>max</sub> by approximately 20&#x000a0;% after a 2-tablet dose and 13&#x000a0;% after a 3-tablet dose compared with fasted conditions. A low-fat meal did not have an effect on total APAP exposure with either dose. However, a low-fat meal decreased peak exposure of APAP by approximately 20&#x000a0;% after the 2-tablet dose and 21&#x000a0;% after the 3-tablet dose compared with fasted conditions. Because food had no effects on total exposure, these modest decreases in peak exposure are not expected to be clinically significant or necessitate dosage adjustments. After either dose, APAP was rapidly absorbed under all conditions, with no clinically relevant lag in the appearance of plasma concentrations when administered with food.</p><p>Differences in pharmacokinetic results after a 2-tablet dose (study 1) compared with the 3-tablet dose (study 2) were apparent, although inferences about the relative properties of the 2 doses are based on numerical differences without formal statistical analysis. For hydrocodone, mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were larger in participants who received 3 tablets regardless of fed state compared with participants who received 2 tablets. Under all conditions, mean t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> was slightly longer in participants who received 2 tablets compared with those who received 3 tablets. For APAP, mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were larger in participants who received 3 tablets regardless of fed state compared with participants who received 2 tablets. When comparing each fed state (high-fat, low-fat, and fasting), mean t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> was slightly longer in participants who received 3 tablets compared with those who received 2 tablets. Thus, hydrocodone and APAP exposure increased in a predictable manner when the dose increased under all conditions, regardless of food intake.</p><p>In the present analysis, following a single dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 7.5/325&#x000a0;mg 2 tablets, nausea was reported in 25&#x000a0;% of participants and vomiting in 13&#x000a0;%; following a single dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 7.5/325&#x000a0;mg 3 tablets, nausea was reported in 37&#x000a0;% of participants and vomiting in 27&#x000a0;%. No severe or serious TEAEs were reported under any treatment condition, and there were no clinically meaningful abnormalities of laboratory values, changes in vital signs, oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram results, or physical examination findings. No notable safety differences were observed between the fed (high-fat and low-fat meals) and fasted treatment groups in either study, with the exception of the TEAEs of nausea and vomiting. Almost all participants who vomited were women, which is consistent with research showing that women are more susceptible to vomiting during opioid therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Reasons for this disparity between men and women are not clear. However, there are data suggesting that hormonal factors, differences in sensitivity to opioid agonism, and other factors may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The safety profile of single, 2-tablet and 3-tablet doses of IR/ER HB/APAP was consistent with expectations for a low-dose combination opioid analgesic. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study, 63 patients who had undergone impacted molar extraction received a single dose of IR HB/APAP 7.5/500&#x000a0;mg, with ibuprofen (dosage not specified) available as rescue medication; during 6&#x000a0;h of follow-up, nausea and vomiting were reported in 16 and 8&#x000a0;% of patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Short-term multi-dose studies of IR HB/APAP at doses of 5/325&#x000a0;mg and 7.5/650&#x000a0;mg and IR HB/ibuprofen 7.5/200&#x000a0;mg 1&#x02013;2 tablets have reported nausea in 21 to 36&#x000a0;% and vomiting in 4 to 13&#x000a0;% of patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of this analysis is that elderly, pediatric, and substantially over- or underweight patients were not represented. Patients with significant illnesses that might affect pharmacokinetics or tolerability were also excluded, and demographic diversity was limited, with only 1 participant each of Asian and American Indian/Alaskan Native descent participating in study 2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Food intake had no effect on overall exposure to hydrocodone or APAP with IR/ER HB/APAP. Small changes in C<sub>max</sub> for both hydrocodone and APAP were observed under fed versus fasted conditions; however, these differences were not considered clinically meaningful. IR/ER HB/APAP was generally well tolerated, with a TEAE profile typical of low-dose opioid combination analgesics, and there was no indication that food intake had any effect on safety. These results suggest that IR/ER HB/APAP can be administered without regard to food.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="40360_2015_32_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
