The objective of this study was to determine the effect of recombinant human parathyroid hormone, rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), on phosphate and vitamin D metabolite levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Following pretreatment optimization of calcium and vitamin D doses, 124 patients in a phase III, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with hypoparathyroidism received subcutaneous injections of placebo or rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) (50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/day, titrated to 75 and then 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/day, to permit reductions in oral calcium and active vitamin D doses while maintaining serum calcium within 2.0&#x02013;2.2&#x02009;mmol/L). Predefined endpoints related to phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism were analyzed. Serum phosphate levels decreased rapidly from the upper normal range and remained lower with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 vs. placebo). At week 24, serum calcium&#x02013;phosphate product was lower with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) vs. placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) treatment resulted in significant reductions in oral calcium dose compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) while maintaining serum calcium. After pretreatment optimization, baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D) levels were within the normal range in both groups. After 24 weeks, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels were unchanged in both treatment groups, despite significantly greater reductions in active vitamin D dose in the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) group. In hypoparathyroidism, rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) reduces serum phosphate levels, improves calcium&#x02013;phosphate product, and maintains 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and serum calcium in the normal range while allowing significant reductions in active vitamin D and oral calcium doses.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypoparathyroidism</kwd><kwd>Phosphate</kwd><kwd>rhPTH(1&#x02013;84)</kwd><kwd>Parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This study was funded by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Shire.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder of unbalanced mineral homeostasis resulting from absent or inappropriately low levels of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although hypocalcemia is a classic hallmark of hypoparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia may also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PTH acts directly on bone, increasing turnover, and resulting in the release of calcium and phosphate into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the kidney, PTH stimulates renal reabsorption of calcium, promotes phosphate excretion in the urine, and enhances the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) to the active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D) metabolite, which increases transepithelial transport of dietary calcium and phosphate from the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In concert, these effects help maintain normal serum calcium and phosphate levels.</p><p>With standard conventional management, the goal is to maintain serum calcium at the low end of the normal range while attempting to avoid both hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria as well as hyperphosphatemia, which can increase the calcium&#x02013;phosphate product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the clinical feasibility of therapy with oral calcium and active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol), albeit used often in large amounts, important complications can ensue. Conventional therapy can lead to hypercalciuria, which in turn can result in nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, and irreversible kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Active vitamin D metabolites do not replace the phosphaturic action of PTH and might exacerbate hyperphosphatemia by enhancing intestinal phosphate absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Elevated serum phosphate levels may increase the serum calcium&#x02013;phosphate product, thereby raising the risk for precipitation of calcium&#x02013;phosphate. In patients with advanced renal disease, elevated serum phosphate levels and higher serum calcium&#x02013;phosphate product were associated with coronary calcifications and increased mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In patients with hypoparathyroidism, calcification complexes have been reported in soft tissues, particularly the brain, lens, and kidney, but also the vasculature and other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent guidelines recommend maintaining calcium&#x02013;phosphate product levels below 4.4&#x02009;mmol<sup>2</sup>/L<sup>2</sup> (55&#x02009;mg<sup>2</sup>/dL<sup>2</sup>) to reduce the risk of ectopic calcifications and advise consideration of a low phosphate diet and, in certain cases, phosphate binders as needed to control phosphate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In patients with hypoparathyroidism, daily subcutaneous (SC) treatment with recombinant human PTH (rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), PTH rDNA; NATPARA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Shire-NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexington, MA, USA) has the potential to reproduce some of the physiologic effects of PTH compared with conventional therapy, such as lowering serum phosphate levels, promoting conversion of 25(OH)D to active 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and improving renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) is identical to native human PTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Treatment of hypoparathyroidism with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) has been studied in several recently published clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In short, these studies demonstrate that treatment with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) is associated with reduced requirements for oral calcium and active vitamin D while maintaining control of symptoms, and some studies provide evidence for improved quality of life. The pivotal registration study for rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), REPLACE, was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III, multicenter study that demonstrated that once-daily SC injections of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) reduced both oral calcium and active vitamin D requirements by &#x02265;50&#x02009;% from baseline levels while maintaining albumin-corrected total serum calcium levels in the target range (1.9&#x02009;mmol/L to laboratory upper limit of normal) at Week 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. 53&#x02009;% of patients who received rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) achieved this endpoint compared with 2&#x02009;% who received placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Complete independence from calcitriol or alfacalcidol and reduction of daily calcium doses to &#x02264;500&#x02009;mg/day while maintaining serum calcium in the target range was achieved by 43&#x02009;% of the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) group compared with 5&#x02009;% of the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p><p>In this report, we present additional relevant results from the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial completed in this endocrine-deficiency disease population.

During the optimization phase, native vitamin D doses were adjusted as follows: patients with serum 25(OH)D levels below the lower limit of normal (&#x0003c;75&#x02009;nmol/L) were supplemented with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> at 2000&#x02009;IU/day until levels reached the normal range (75&#x02009;nmol/L&#x02012;250&#x02009;nmol/L), patients with serum 25(OH)D levels in the normal range received maintenance vitamin D<sub>3</sub> at 400&#x02009;IU/day, and patients with serum 25(OH)D levels above the normal range did not receive vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>After calcium and active vitamin D doses were stable for a 2-week period, which established the baseline doses, patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive once-daily SC injections of placebo or 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g rhPTH(1&#x02013;84). The 24-week treatment period began with a stepwise titration phase that allowed for 2 uptitrations of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) dose, if needed, to reduce active vitamin D first and then oral calcium, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Adjustments were permitted in active vitamin D and oral calcium doses to maintain serum calcium in the target range and to improve hypercalciuria at any time during the treatment period. During the treatment phase, patients received at least 400&#x02009;IU/day of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>; patients with serum 25(OH)D levels below the lower limit of normal received additional vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as necessary to bring levels into the normal range. rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) was discontinued at the conclusion of 24 weeks, whereby baseline oral calcium and active vitamin D were resumed, and patients were followed up for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The assessments for serum phosphate levels were scheduled at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and 24-hour urine phosphate measurements were done at baseline and Weeks 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24.

In addition, preclinical studies suggest that high levels of serum phosphate may directly promote vascular calcification via osteochondrogenic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Among patients with end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular disease, elevated serum phosphate levels correlate with increased mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our results show that, compared with placebo, rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) treatment significantly decreased serum phosphate levels. It is noteworthy that the reductions reported here in serum phosphate levels and calcium&#x02013;phosphate product were noticeable despite the fact that the measurements were made 24&#x02009;h after the last PTH injection, a time point that reflects a minimal reduction in serum phosphate and calcium&#x02013;phosphate product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In a phase I pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) study conducted in patients with hypoparathyroidism, Clarke et al. reported that reductions in serum phosphate and calcium&#x02013;phosphate product occur rapidly following rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and were maximal at 12&#x02009;h following injection with 50&#x02013;100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g rhPTH(1&#x02013;84).</p><p>The decline in serum phosphate levels in the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) group was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in urinary phosphate excretion. Transient changes in urinary phosphate excretion may have been missed in this study because of the timing of assessments, and we may have captured only the new steady state. In the phase I PK/PD study, serum phosphate decreased to a nadir at 5&#x02009;h after injection of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), which was associated with a corresponding increase in urinary fractional excretion of phosphate over the same time course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, Sikjaer et al. showed that urinary phosphate excretion increased over the first 8&#x02009;h post-injection of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), followed by a return to near-baseline levels over the next 16&#x02009;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study, the first post-baseline assessment of urinary phosphate was conducted after 1 week of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) treatment had been completed and 24&#x02009;h after the last study drug dose. By 1 week of treatment with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), new steady-state serum phosphate levels may already be established, such that no further increases in urinary phosphate would be required to maintain the lower serum phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, while the study protocol did not restrict patients&#x02019; dietary intake or the administration of phosphate binders, no patient took phosphate binders during the study. Thus, fluctuations in dietary phosphate during the study may also have contributed to the variability in urinary phosphate. Finally, compared with other time points, fewer patients had urine phosphate levels assessed at the early study visits (up to Week 6). The smaller sample sizes at these early time points may have contributed to the lack of consistent between-group differences at these time points. Nonetheless, the urinary phosphate data presented here might inform future studies investigating phosphate dynamics in hypoparathyroidism.</p><p>Although no prospective data exist in the hypoparathyroidism population, a somewhat arbitrary threshold of 4.4&#x02009;mmol<sup>2</sup>/L<sup>2</sup> (55&#x02009;mg&#x000b2;/dL&#x000b2;) is generally accepted as the upper limit of normal, and recent treatment guidelines include maintenance of calcium&#x02013;phosphate product below that level as a goal of hypoparathyroidism management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Overall, our analysis showed that levels of calcium&#x02013;phosphate product decreased to a greater extent in the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, calcium&#x02013;phosphate product levels declined rapidly with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) within 1 week of treatment. Decreases in calcium&#x02013;phosphate product were evident with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) treatment despite the fact that serum calcium levels remained stable during the study. The observed reductions in calcium&#x02013;phosphate product were likely driven primarily by rhPTH(1&#x02013;84)-mediated decreases in serum phosphate. Together, these data suggest that, unlike conventional management strategies with oral calcium and active vitamin D therapy, treatment with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) improves phosphate levels and calcium&#x02013;phosphate product in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Thus, rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) has the potential to reduce complications, such as soft tissue calcification, compared with conventional therapy by more effectively restoring the full range of physiologic activities elicited by the endogenous hormone.</p><p>The 2&#x02013;16-week optimization period before randomization in the REPLACE study ensured that patients had optimized their conventional treatment with oral calcium and calcitriol or alfacalcidol and had normal serum 25(OH)D and magnesium levels. As a result, serum levels for both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D were within the normal range at baseline. Despite significant reductions in oral active vitamin D or even complete independence of active vitamin D in a subgroup, patients treated with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) maintained serum levels of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the normal range. In contrast, placebo-treated patients who eliminated oral active vitamin D experienced decreases in serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. This reflects the physiologic role of PTH to enhance conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. In addition, other metabolic pathways may be contributing to the turnover of 25(OH)D in patients treated with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), including catabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 24A1 to generate 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In some cell types, CYP24A1 is known to be activated by PTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Because 25(OH)D constitutes the substrate for conversion to active vitamin D, care has to be taken to keep 25(OH)D levels within the normal range in these patients. Consequently, over the course of the study, patients receiving rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) had higher daily requirements for supplemental native vitamin D than patients receiving placebo, although the variability was large. Thus, administration of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) may permit reduction or elimination of oral calcium and active vitamin D supplementation, but native vitamin D supplementation should be continued. In practice, careful monitoring of serum 25(OH)D levels, as well as adjustments of oral native vitamin D supplementation as necessary, is warranted for patients receiving rhPTH(1&#x02013;84).</p><p>The results reported here are consistent with other published data using different study designs and dosing regimens of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

This current analysis extends the primary findings of the REPLACE study and provides further mechanistic evidence that therapy with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), in contrast to conventional therapy with oral calcium and active vitamin D, mimics the action of endogenous PTH in patients with hypoparathyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In summary, treatment with rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) addresses the multiple physiologic mineral and vitamin D abnormalities that occur in hypoparathyroidism by decreasing serum phosphate levels toward the mid-normal range, improving the calcium&#x02013;phosphate product, and maintaining serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels in the normal range. This latter benefit will be maintained if careful monitoring of serum 25(OH)D levels and adjustments in oral native vitamin D supplementation as necessary are performed by the treating endocrinologist.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
