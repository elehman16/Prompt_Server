shoulder muscle fatigue by analyzing and comparing median frequencies of shoulder muscles
at different table heights when performing therapeutic ultrasounds work. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects were 63 healthy male adults who were equally and randomly assigned
to a standard height group (SHG), a high height group (HHG), and a low height group (LHG).
The standard table height was set at the level of the elbow joint when the subjects flexed
their elbow while in a sitting position. High height and low height were set 10&#x02005;cm higher
and 10&#x02005;cm lower, respectively, than the standard height. Muscle fatigue of the upper
trapezius, middle deltoid, rhomboid, and infraspinatus of the subjects was measured during
ultrasound treatment work at each table height. [Results] Median frequencies of the upper
trapezius, middle deltoid, rhomboid, and infraspinatus muscles were significantly lower in
the HHG than in to the LHG. [Conclusion] When therapeutic ultrasound is performed using a
table that has a height lower than that of the elbow joint, the median frequency of the
shoulder muscle increases, hence decreasing muscle fatigue. This way, musculoskeletal pain
as a result of performing therapeutic ultrasound can be prevented.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Therapeutic ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Work environment</kwd><kwd>Table height</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Research on musculoskeletal pain has presented empirical grounds for improving working

However, physical
therapists&#x02019; musculoskeletal system problems in physical therapists have been the subjects of
limited to investigation and research<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and information is needed on the factors
that cause such problems and on techniques for resolving them based on a dose-response
relationship.</p><p>According to relevant research, 80% of physical therapists have pain in their
musculoskeletal system, and 40% of these subjects complained of pain in the hands, wrists,
and shoulders<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapists
perform a high amount of heavy work by since they lifting or move patients, and such heavy
work is considered an etiology of pain and damage. However, short repetitive work may cause
micro-injuries, and an accumulation of these injuries may lead to chronic musculoskeletal
pain. Such work was also found to be a major cause of cumulative trauma disorders
(CTDs)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, among the diverse
therapeutic actions performed by physical therapists, simple and repetitive low-intensity
work as well as heavy work can cause musculoskeletal pain.</p><p>Hong et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 50% of
physical therapists in Korea who perform in therapeutic ultrasound work complained of
musculoskeletal pain. Therapeutic ultrasound work is a representative physical therapy
technique that requires repetitive motions of low-intensity muscle contraction for a short
time and is considered to contribute to CTDs. Kang et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that repetitive therapeutic ultrasound work of low
intensity for a short period may increase the work load on the spinal erectors, depending on
the height of the treatment table. In addition, Lee et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the muscle activity of shoulder muscles is affected by
table height and that extensive use of the shoulder muscle causes muscle fatigue, which in
turn can cause musculoskeletal pain. Accordingly, this study examined the effect of
treatment table height during ultrasound work on shoulder muscle fatigue, and based on the
results, we present an appropriate working environment, potentially contributing to the
prevention of musculoskeletal pain of physical therapists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 63 male adults with no history of musculoskeletal or neurological system
disorders. All the subjects listened to a detailed explanation about the study&#x02019;s
methodology, safety matters concerned with the progression of the study, and bio-information
protection before voluntarily consenting to participate in the study. (This study was
approved by the IRB of the Catholic University of Pusan (CUPIRB-2014-002). The average age,
height, and weight of the subjects were 22.1&#x000b1;2.8&#x02005;years, 170.8&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;cm, and 70.4&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;kg,
respectively. All subjects were equally and randomly allocated to a standard height group
(SHG), a high height group (HHG), and a low height group (LHG).</p><p>Therapeutic ultrasound work was performed as follows. Subjects sat on a stool with their
foot, knee, and hip joints at 90&#x000b0;. The standard height was set from the ground to the
olecranon process of the elbow when each subject flexed his elbow at 90&#x000b0;. High height and
low height were established as 10&#x02005;cm higher and 10&#x02005;cm lower, respectively, than the standard
height. When the subjects took a sitting position, the distance between each subject and the
table was 20&#x02005;cm. In order to maintain the same therapeutic ultrasound work, a circular air
cushion, with a 12&#x02005;cm diameter circle drawn on it, was placed at a corner of the treatment
table in front of the subjects. Therapeutic ultrasound work was performed for five minutes
along the circle drawn on the air cushion to the sound of a bell which rang once every three
seconds<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle fatigue of the
subjects during the therapeutic ultrasound work was evaluated using electromyography
(LXM3201, LAXTHA inc., Daejeon, Korea) and analysis software (Telescan, LAXTHA inc.,
Daejeon, Korea). The sampling rate was 1,024&#x02005;Hz, and the root mean square was obtained.
After completing a band pass filter processing between a frequency at 10 to 500&#x02005;Hz with
60&#x02005;Hz a notch filter process with a frequency at 60&#x02005;Hz, the median frequency was calculated.
In order to analyze the median frequencies of three groups, a post hoc test was conducted
using a one-way analysis of variance and Sheffe&#x02019;s method using SPSS 18.0 for Windows, and a
significance level was set of &#x003b1;=0.5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The median frequency of the shoulder muscles was lowest in the HHG and highest in the LHG.
Post hoc analysis showed that the median frequency of the upper trapezius muscle of the LHG
differed significantly from those of the SHG and HHG. The median frequencies of the middle
deltoid muscle, rhomboid muscle, and infraspinatus muscle of the LHG and SHG differed
significantly from those of the HHG (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

Research on dose-response has been
performed for diverse works, such as sewing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, milking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, looking
through a microscope<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and working on a
computer<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has helped to prevent musculoskeletal system diseases by
analyzing the environmental factors that may trigger such diseases. However, in the field of
physical therapy, such efforts have been confined to investigation and research, and
therefore an analysis of the risk factors based on the dose-response relationship was
needed.</p><p>One factor that influences muscle fatigue is working hours. The longer that therapists work
on a table, the more they feel muscle fatigue<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study examined the effects of therapeutic ultrasound work on
muscle fatigue and used five minutes work as the control. In general, the minimum time
needed to effectively heat deep tissues with therapeutic ultrasound is more than 5
minutes.</p><p>For low-intensity ultrasound work, therapists move their upper limbs in different
directions and work continuously, causing repetitive muscle contraction of the shoulder
muscles that trigger such movements and the muscles that support the upper limbs. Repetitive
low-intensity muscle contraction is related to induction of trigger points<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The upper trapezius muscle that should
continuously support the weight of the arms is the most representative muscle of where
trigger points occur<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of
this study indicated that muscle fatigue of the upper trapezius muscle increased when the
table height was high. In addition, muscle fatigue of the middle deltoid muscle and
infraspinatus muscles, which engage in abduction and external rotation, increased, and
muscle fatigue of the rhomboid muscle, which supports the shoulders, also increased. When a
repetitive load applied on these muscles, it may possibly lead to trigger points<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hong et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that most physical therapists who conducted ultrasound
therapy experience symptoms in the forearms and the wrists as well as the shoulders,
suggesting that trigger points had influence.</p><p>Musculoskeletal pain during work mostly occurs through heavy work. However, the applicator
used for therapeutic ultrasound work weighs about 500&#x02005;g, indicating that use of this
applicator, which is low-level light work, which does not greatly influence musculoskeletal
pain. However, low-intensity muscle contraction, which is about 15% of maximal muscle
contraction, may also increase muscle fatigue<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, when recruitment of type II muscle fibers decreases as a
result of repetitive muscle contraction, recruitment of type I muscle fibers increases<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and the electromyography median frequency
of electromyographic activity decreases, which may represent an increase muscle fatigue<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, low-intensity work, such as therapeutic ultrasound
work, may increase muscle fatigue. In this study as well, muscle fatigue of the subjects
increased in relation to table height during ultrasound work, suggesting that short
repetitive therapeutic ultrasound work may be a cause of CTDs<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery is recommended to be performed on an operating table at the height of
the elbow, because this height does not increase muscle fatigue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, table height was set using elbow height as
the standard.</p><p>Yim et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that muscle activity
of the upper trapezius muscle, supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, and rhomboid
muscles increased, and research has suggested that computer table height is an etiology of
neck and shoulder pain in computer users<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the HHG experienced a higher level of muscle fatigue than the SHG in
the upper trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and rhomboid muscles, demonstrating that
treatment table height contributes to pain in the neck and shoulders when physical
therapists conduct therapeutic ultrasound work.</p><p>Kim et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> recommended working on a
low computer table because computer work on a table whose height is lower than elbow height
may reduces the muscle activity of the trapezius muscle. The results of the present study
also demonstrated that shoulder muscle fatigue arising from therapeutic ultrasound work is
lower when performed on a table lower than elbow height. Table height is a major cause of
shoulder muscle fatigue, and when therapeutic ultrasound work is conducted on a table that
is higher than the elbow, muscle fatigue of the upper trapezius muscle, middle deltoid
muscle, infraspinatus muscle, and rhomboid muscles increases compared to when work is
performed at a height lower than the elbow. Therefore, using a table that has a height lower
than the elbow to carry out low-intensity ultrasound work will help prevent musculoskeletal
pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided by the Catholic University of
