Our objectives were to determine the influence of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block on the incidence of acute and chronic post-hysterectomy pain and to examine potential associations between time of block administration, either before surgical incision (preemptive) or after end of surgical procedure and its effect.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Seventy-five patients undergoing elective total abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia were allocated randomly to receive TAP block either pre-incisional, or before emergence from anesthesia or sham block (just a needle puncture, control group). Pain was evaluated postoperatively at rest and movement by visual analogue scale. Peri-operative analgesic requirements, sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting scores were recorded. Patients were questioned at three, and six months after surgery for type and severity of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Pain scores were significantly higher in Group II versus Group I (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but both demonstrated significantly lower pain scores than control Group.

The incidence of chronic pain was significantly reduced in the pre-incisional group than others. The incidence of sedation was noted to be higher in the control group (61%) versus other groups (18% and 32% respectively), at time point 12 h postoperatively but was comparable between 12, 48 h (awake and alert). Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was reduced in patients who received TAP block (16% and 29%) in Group I and II respectively versus 66.5% in Group III.

Group I received standard general anesthesia with TAP block performed after induction of anesthesia. Group II received standard general anesthesia with TAP block performed before emergence from anesthesia. Group III received standard general anesthesia and a sham block was considered for the control group where the needle was inserted and nothing was injected. Through using prospective, randomized (sealed envelopes), double-blind design, both patients and postoperative assessors were blinded to the establishment of TAP block.</p><p>Anesthesia was standardized in all patients. After preoxygenation for 3&#x02013;4 min anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg. Trachea intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with 1% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen, and incremental rocuronium doses were repeated to maintain neuromuscular block.</p><p>Respiratory rate and tidal volume parameters were adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide level at 35&#x02013;45 mm Hg. Signs of light anesthesia (e.g., increases in arterial pressure, tearing, or sweating) were managed with additional boluses of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg fentanyl, and its requirement was recorded for each patient. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 2.5 mg and atropine 1 mg.</p><p>TAP block had been performed after induction of anesthesia in Group II and before emergence from anesthesia in Group II. After application of skin antiseptic solution, the site was drapped, then the iliac crest was palpated from anterior to posterior till the latissimus dorsi muscle. The triangle of Petit is located anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle. The base of the triangle is composed of the following layers, fascial extensions of external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis, respectively, and the peritoneum.</p><p>Using a blunt regional anesthesia needle (22G, B. Braun, Germany), the skin was pierced just cephalic to the iliac crest over the triangle of Petit. The needle was introduced at a right angle to the skin in a coronal plane until resistance was encountered. This resistance indicated that the needle tip had reached the external oblique muscle. Slowly, advancement of the needle resulted in a "pop" sensation as the needle reached the plane between the external and internal oblique fascial layers. Further careful advancement of the needle was done till a second pop was encountered which indicated entry into the transversus abdominis fascial plane. After aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, 20 mL of 0.375% bupivacaine solution was injected. Then, TAP block was performed on the adjacent side using an identical technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Twenty minutes elapsed between block and surgical incision in Group I in whom block was performed before surgical incision.</p><p>Balanced salt solution was used for fluid therapy. Monitors for patients included pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, end-tidal carbon dioxide and noninvasive arterial blood pressure.</p><p>Patients were transferred to the postoperative care unit after tracheal extubation. Duration of TAP block using 20 ml of 0.375% levobupivacaine has been shown up to 24 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Successful block was confirmed by loss of cold sensation in the distribution of T7-L1 dermatomes on the side of the block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Checking levels of block in the recovery unit was done by a blinded data collector.</p><p>When patients suffered from pain in the recovery room, they received a titrated dose of morphine (2 mg bolus at 5-min intervals) until the visual analogue score was &#x02264;30. Intravenous morphine in a dose of 20&#x02013;50 mcg/ kg was given as necessary to relieve severe pain which was rated by using visual analog scale greater than 30 for the first 48 h after surgery.</p><p>Analgesia was assessed at both rest and movement (sitting from lying down position) at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h after surgery by an observer blinded to treatment groups using a 100-mm VAS. Total amount of morphine consumption was recorded.</p><p>Complications of TAP were recorded which may include failure of the block, intramuscular hematoma and abscess, visceral puncture or perforation. Undesirable effects from opioid use as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sedation and respiratory depression were also monitored and recorded. These assessments were performed at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after end of surgical procedure.</p><p>PONV was measured using a categorical scoring system (none=0; mild=1; moderate=2; severe=3). Detection of nausea occurred when nausea score was &#x0003e;0 at any time point postoperatively.</p><p>Sedation scores were rated using a sedation scale (awake and alert=0; quietly awake=1; asleep but easily roused=2; deep sleep=3). Sedation was defined as a sedation score &#x0003e;0 at any postoperative time point.</p><p>Respiratory depression was defined as respiratory rate &#x0003c;8 breaths per min and / or PaCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;45 mmHg.</p><p>Patients were invited to pain evaluation three, six months later. In addition, they were requested to answer a short questionnaire.

Although the actual study seems to show a difference between pre- and post-surgical blockade, a placebo group had been included in the study in order to validate that this blockade is effective.</p><p>This is a small prospective randomized trial on 75 patients. The authors reported statistically significant decrease in pain scores, analgesic requirements, PONV, sedation, and incidence of chronic pain in the group with the pre-incisional TAP block compared with post-surgical one. However, patients who received TAP showed significant decrease in analgesic requirement, pain scores, PONV and sedation than the control ones. The technique was potentially safe, the failure rate was 6% and no complication was recorded.</p><p>TAP block holds considerable promise for postoperative analgesia in abdominal surgery with both transverse and midline incisions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Many articles and case studies have demonstrated the analgesic effect of TAP block when it had been performed at the end of surgery, before emergence from anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Others have reported the analgesic effect of TAP block when it had been performed after anesthetic induction, before surgical incision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Dierking <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] found no significant difference in morphine requirement and pain scores between the groups when did inguinal field block before surgical incision or before emergence from anesthesia in herniorrhaphy.</p><p>Incidence of PONV was reduced by more than half (66.5% versus 16% and 29%) in the TAP block group. However, the decrease in PONV scores in the pre-incisional TAP group was significant in comparison to the post-surgical group.</p><p>Sedation scores were also significantly reduced in the patients who underwent TAP blockade, in the first 12 h postoperatively. However, decrease in sedation scores in the pre-incisional TAP group was significant in comparison to the post-surgical group, which was attributed to decrease in use of opioids.</p><p>The analgesic role of TAP block when used as part of a multimodal regimen is a matter of controversy. Joseph <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] concluded that the TAP block, when used as part of a multimodal regimen inclusive of intrathecal morphine, did not improve the quality of post-Cesarean delivery analgesia. On the contrary, Belavy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] concluded that TAP block reduced morphine requirements after Cesarean delivery when used as a component of a multimodal analgesic regimen.</p><p>Chronic pain is reported by 5&#x02013;32% of women after hysterectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In this study it was about 8% in the pre-incisional TAP group versus 35% in the other two groups. By inhibiting the altered central sensory processing, preemptive analgesia is thought to diminish the incidence of hyperalgesia and allodynia after surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>There are many limitations of this study, the blocks in this study were performed in anesthetized patients using blind technique because of the lack of availability of a suitable intraoperative sonar probe in many of the hospitals in developing countries. It is therefore impossible to assume that all blocks were working perfectly. This point may have biased the validity of the results but confirming successful block by loss of cold sensation in the distribution of T7-L1 dermatomes detected three cases of failure of the procedures which were excluded from the study. There are difficulties in adequately blinding studies because TAP block produces loss of sensation of the abdominal wall.
