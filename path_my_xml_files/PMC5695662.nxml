training (NFT), wherefore we are happy to respond to the letter by <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Fovet and colleagues, 2017</xref>.</p><p id="P3">We agree that, strictly speaking, the results of our study (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) do not allow generalizing
the negative findings reported in primary insomnia to other NFT applications. Yet, what
is disturbing is the fact that even misperception insomniacs (i.e. participants without
any objectively quantifiable sleep problems) show unaltered EEG activity [in the same
12&#x02013;15 Hz range; sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)] minutes after NFT sessions ended. At
least we would have expected a sustained effect in this subgroup because they should not
suffer from severe learning impairments. Surprisingly, these findings contradicted
earlier reports from our own laboratory (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser
<italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus
<italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), where we added a healthy and younger
control group and verified that participants achieved similar SMR enhancements during
NFT training blocks (14&#x02013;28%) as found earlier (15&#x02013;25%; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Fovet and colleagues question how exactly these discrepancies between earlier
(positive) results of our group in healthy participants (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and insomniacs (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) are
explained. First of all, it is important to note that in all three studies, we used
exactly the same NFT methodology. The only exception was that we extended the NFT from 8
&#x000d7; 3 min to 8 &#x000d7; 5 min blocks (including two &#x02018;transfer blocks&#x02019;
with no immediate feedback) in the last double-blind study (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This was specifically done
because we expected participants to have shallower learning curves due to the higher age
[mean = 38.59, standard deviation (SD) = 11.18 in <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>. (2017)</xref>; mean = 34.83, SD = 10.60 in <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref>; mean =
23.63, SD = 2.69 in <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser <italic>et al</italic>.
(2008)</xref>] and the higher severity of insomnia [e.g. polysomnography
(PSG)-derived wake after sleep onset 64.56 min in <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>. (2017)</xref> versus 37.01 min in <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref>]. So first
of all, the slightly higher age may have rendered the observed effects in the latest
study smaller than in the earlier two NFT studies. Second, we clearly highlight the
non-optimal study design in our first insomnia study (2014), which was intended to serve
as a comprehensive pilot test for the present and much more controlled double-blind
study. Not only was that earlier study only single-blind but it also compared 10 blocks
of NFT to five blocks of placebo-feedback (i.e. likewise randomized-frequency feedback).
In an earlier study (<italic>cf</italic>. Fig. 6; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), we reported a placebo effect on
subjective quality of life across the sessions, i.e. an effect that was independent of
whether participants received placebo or real neurofeedback; reanalysing the subjective
data, we indeed found evidence that patients may have felt more social support in that
earlier single-blind study in the NFT condition. This should be alarming for any
neurofeedback study not adopting a double-blind design (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) as this effect is unlikely limited to our NFT
study.</p><p id="P5">Also, note that in this earlier study, we were unable to find an increase in
sleep spindles or memory performance following NFT, contrary to what we had found in
healthy young controls (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser <italic>et
al</italic>., 2008</xref>). What we did find was a linear relationship of SMR
enhancement (i.e. an SMR amplitude change of NFT Session 2&#x02013;3 to Session
9&#x02013;10) during NFT and a respective (fast) spindle number change. Splitting the
sample into NFT &#x02018;responders/learners&#x02019; and
&#x02018;non-responders/non-learners&#x02019; as performed in many NFT studies seemed
artificial and thus not justified to us. Indeed, splitting participants into
&#x02018;learners&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-learners&#x02019; or &#x02018;SMR
increasers&#x02019; and &#x02018;SMR decreasers&#x02019; (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Reichert <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) appeared to be a common practice in the
field. However, this approach is circular as it confirms, in the worst case, no more
than that for example SMR increasers or learners (as defined by the investigators)
indeed increase in SMR or slow cortical potential amplitude without adding any further
knowledge.</p><p id="P6">The authors continue to refer to a &#x02018;well-controlled double-blind
study&#x02019; by <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Kober <italic>et al</italic>.
(2015)</xref> that contradicted our recent findings and crucially found an increase
in relative SMR amplitude and declarative memory performance following NFT. Yet, we are
not convinced by the findings presented in this study. For the SMR, Kober <italic>et
al</italic>. only found within-session changes (together with a similar increase in
a non-rewarded 21&#x02013;35 Hz beta band) but essentially &#x02018;no significant changes
in absolute SMR power over the feedback training sessions&#x02019;, which we had reported
earlier (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser <italic>et al</italic>.,
2008</xref>). According to our understanding, only systematic power changes over NFT
sessions (i.e. multiple days) would show actual learning over time. For behavioural
changes, the authors analysed 12 cognitive parameters of which three were significant in
a pre- to post-session comparison (at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the NFT group
versus only one in the control group. Simulating the data reveals that the only pre- to
post-change that survives a correction for multiple comparisons (<italic>P</italic>
&#x0003c; 0.005) is the VVM2 construction 1 (Visual and Verbal Memory Test by <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Schelling and Sch&#x000e4;chtele, 2001</xref>).
Importantly, however, participants&#x02019; scores are not significantly different
between the experimental and the control groups [<italic>t</italic>(18) &#x02248; 0.024;
<italic>P</italic> &#x02248; 0.980]. Thus, we neither see evidence for the increase
of SMR amplitude (over sessions) nor a difference in behavioural performance between the
experimental and control groups.</p><p id="P7">We believe that in many NFT studies, one factor giving rise to misleading effects
may be that the control groups are (if present at all) often a &#x02018;playback&#x02019;
NFT session, i.e. the NFT feedback another subject has received is just replayed to a
&#x02018;control&#x02019; participant. This kind of control appears extremely problematic
as participants in the control group then learn over extended periods of time that they
have no control over the feedback received. Essentially, manipulations of that kind may
be used for learned helplessness but do not depict an adequate control condition for
neurofeedback as it will likely induce negative training effects in the controls
(against which NFT is tested thereafter). In order to circumvent this bias, we tried to
carefully match the feedback received in our NFT and placebo-feedback conditions [1686
for placebo-feedback (SD = 208) and 1652 trials for NFT (SD = 277)] with thresholds
adapted after each 5-min run to stay in the range of 13&#x02013;25 rewards.</p><p id="P8">Fovet <italic>et al</italic>. are also concerned that increasing the amount of
rewards received within a run may have rendered the training too easy in the current
protocol. We do not share this concern as the current approach leads to a reward about
every 17 s, and if participants exceeded 25 rewards within a 5-min run, we increased the
threshold to be exceeded for the following 5 min feedback period to assure that the
training remained challenging. Furthermore, as stated earlier, the changes in SMR from
baseline are identical in the 2014 (15&#x02013;25%) and 2017 (14&#x02013;28%) studies; it
is a misconception that the earlier changes were 115&#x02013;125% as mentioned in Fovet
<italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s letter (100% was taken as baseline level, or
&#x02018;zero&#x02019;; <italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>
caption, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>.,
2014</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We completely agree with Fovet and colleagues that a better understanding of
neurophysiological mechanisms involved in various neurofeedback protocols is needed.
However, screening the NFT literature we see very few studies actually addressing
questions of that kind and we believe that highly controlled, i.e. double-blind, studies
with combined EEG-functional MRI might be especially suited to demonstrate systematic
brain changes related to various neurofeedback protocols convincingly.</p><p id="P10">Indeed, there are some studies that persuasively demonstrate that certain
frequencies can be upregulated across training sessions (i.e. across days and not within
a training session) in young healthy individuals (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hoedlmoser <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Philippens and Vanwersch, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Zoefel
<italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Arns
<italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) using NFT. Yet, at the same time there are
several studies only showing changes within runs (i.e. within a training session) but
not across sessions (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Dempster and Vernon, 2009</xref>;
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Kober <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Reichert <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Although
our data indicate that we could increase SMR amplitude &#x02018;significantly from its
spontaneous value&#x02019;, i.e. in the NFT training period as compared to the respective
NFT baselines; as well as compared to the eyes-open rest condition (<italic>cf</italic>.
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We do not see EEG changes from before
to after NFT or increased (absolute) SMR amplitude across sessions [e.g. Session 1 to
Session 11: <italic>t</italic>(26) = &#x02212;1.34, <italic>P</italic> = 0.19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p><p id="P11">We believe that our data (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et
al</italic>., 2017</xref>) therefore support the view that although EEG changes
are readily observed within an NFT session, systematic changes in oscillatory brain
activity over time are generally hard to achieve in the elderly or in patients with some
kind of learning impairments. Yet without detectable changes in brain activity, which
are at least maintained over a number of hours (here, a rest condition flanking each
NFT), days and weeks (here, across the NFT sessions), it is hard to imagine how
neurofeedback can lead to consistent amelioration of various disorders and symptoms as
often claimed. Most critically, the vast majority of neurofeedback studies do not
present EEG data at all (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Cortoos <italic>et al</italic>.,
2010</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Gruzelier, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Reiner <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), therefore it
is impossible to evaluate the credibility of their outcome beyond subjective reports of
symptom change or some behavioural tests, which could be explained by a placebo effect
as well.</p><p id="P12">In conclusion, our publication was designed to demonstrate that increasing
12&#x02013;15 Hz SMR activity and sleep spindles can improve sleep and ameliorate primary
insomnia symptoms. Therefore, we did not intend to refute neurofeedback research
altogether. Yet, given our negative findings and reviewing a broad range of published
neurofeedback studies, we believe that we highlight key issues that need to be addressed
in the whole field. Importantly, addressing these issues and concerns will increase the
credibility of the field, which we see as a goal worth striving for. Specifically, we
are not aware of any similarly well-controlled study as the one published in
<italic>Brain</italic> earlier this year (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus
<italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) for any NFT protocol, study sample, or
patient group. Given the fact that many of the reviewed studies in the field solely rely
on subjective data, have no or insufficient control groups, and seem to build upon the
<italic>a priori</italic> assumption that NFT has to have an effect, the scientific
foundation of neurofeedback still appears to stand on rather shaky ground. It is also
likely that publication bias (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kuhberger <italic>et
al</italic>., 2014</xref>) is further supporting the idea of neurofeedback as a
universally efficacious non-pharmacological treatment in the field simply because
negative findings may be seriously under-represented in the literature.</p><p id="P13">For the reasons we outline above, we strongly disagree with the authors that
double-blind studies are premature for a field whose most significant contributions date
back to the 70s and 80s (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Sterman <italic>et
al</italic>., 1970</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Hauri, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Hauri <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>). Most
importantly, we once walked into the trap ourselves, that is, we jumped to some
premature conclusions underestimating single-blind limitations and placebo effects
associated with NFT in our earlier pilot study (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Schabus
<italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As stated previously in our empirical contribution, we sincerely welcome further
rigorously controlled neurofeedback studies that critically address different kinds of
NFT protocols and study samples. Unfortunately at present, an overwhelming amount of NFT
studies are not withstanding high scientific standards, and are more harmful than
helpful for the field and it almost seems that the NFT community is still relying on
laurels gained years ago. Nevertheless, the general rationale to directly target those
brain oscillations that are altered in a specific disorder or associated with an
improvement in performance is appealing. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the field
will find ways to convince the scientific community that neurofeedback has indeed to be
considered as a non-pharmacological alternative for various disorders and/or peak
performance training.</p></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>Funding</title><p>Research was supported by the FWF research grant P-21154-B18 and Y777 from the

sub-domain physical quality of life (including activities of daily living,
energy and fatigue, pain and discomfort, sleep and rest or work capacity) and
social quality of life (including personal relationships and perceived social
support) for our earlier single-blind study. Note that physical quality of life
changes over time but irrespective of placebo-feedback training (PFT) or NFT.
Data for social quality of life indicate a trend towards increased perceived
social support only between sessions with real NFT training [dashed circles;
i.e. entrance to LPSG2 in NFT-first group (<italic>n</italic> = 12); and LPSG2
to LPSG3 in the PFT-first group (<italic>n</italic> = 11)]. (<bold>B</bold>) The
same subjective data for our double-blind study (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Schabus <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) do not indicate differences
in perceived social support (for NFT versus PFT training). Yet we found again a
non-specific increase in physical quality of life from study entrance (LPSG1) to
the follow-up after 3 months. Note that here LPSGs 1 and 3 flank the first
training block (12 &#x000d7; NFT or PFT) and LPSGs 5 and 7 flank the second
training block (12 &#x000d7; NFT or PFT). PFT-first participants included 10 and
NFT-first 12 participants (i.e. participants with WHOQOL values for all five
time points). <italic>F</italic>-values depict the interaction between group
(NFTfirst, starting with NFT, PFTfirst, starting the protocol with PFT) and time
[entrance, learning nights/polysomnographies (LPSG), and Follow-up]. Error bars
indicate &#x000b1; 1 standard error.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emss-74599-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Absolute SMR amplitude across the neurofeedback sessions.</title><p>Note that SMR amplitude (on trained electrode C3) is (i) higher for the NFT

insomniacs with sufficient data points at each session (<italic>n</italic> = 22
for Baseline to NFT period; <italic>n</italic> = 21 for preRest to NFT period).
To derive absolute SMR amplitude, artefact-corrected EEG data were transferred
to the frequency domain by applying the FFT (fast Fourier transform) to 1-s
segments. Spectral line values were calculated using one half of the spectrum
and are expressed in &#x003bc;V/2. To reduce artefacts caused by potential signal
discontinuities at the segment boarders, segments were tapered using a Hanning
window (window length 10%). Finally, a periodic variance correction was applied
to account for the reduction in signal strength induced by the windowing
function. Error bars indicate &#x000b1; 1 standard error.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emss-74599-f002"/></fig></floats-group></article>
