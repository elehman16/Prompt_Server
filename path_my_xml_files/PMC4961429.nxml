Participants aged &#x02265; 70 years were at increased risk of functional decline based on a score &#x02265; 2 points on the Identification of Seniors at Risk- Primary Care, ISAR-PC. Participants in the intervention group received a systematic comprehensive geriatric assessment, and individually tailored multifactorial interventions coordinated by a trained community-care registered nurse (CCRN) with multiple follow-up home visits. The primary outcome was the participant&#x02019;s disability as measured by the modified Katz activities of daily living (ADL) index score (range 0&#x02013;15) at one year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, hospitalization, and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, the median age was 82.7 years (IQR 77.0&#x02013;87.1), the median modified Katz-ADL index score was 2 (IQR 1&#x02013;5) points in the intervention group and 3 (IQR 1&#x02013;5) points in the control group. The follow-up rate was 76.8% (n = 1753) after one year and was similar in both trial groups.

Twenty-four general practices were willingly to participate and were randomized. Community-care registered nurses (CCRN) provided the multifactorial intervention program to participants from practices allocated to the intervention group. The control group received no extra care or information besides usual care. The trial was registered at Trial Registration NTR2653.

The CGA, CTP and follow-up visits were conducted by the same CCRN. In total, 15 experienced CCRNs, employed by one homecare organization, participated in the intervention. All CCRNs followed a formal 10-day training in providing integrated elderly care in the community, prior to the start of the study (more information of the training is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158714.s019">S2 Text</xref>).</p><p>The CCRN conducted the CGA during a home visit. The CGA focused on somatic, psychological, functional and social domains, representing conditions such as urinary incontinence, memory problems, fall risk, and loneliness. The physical examination and performance tests of the CGA included measurement of body mass index, blood pressure and pulse (all geriatric conditions are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158714.s020">S3 Text</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The participants were asked whether they recognized the identified conditions as relevant problems, whether they desired (additional) care or treatment for them, and in case of multiple problems, which one(s) should have priority in the CTP. To create uniformity, further diagnostic assessments and interventions came from a toolkit containing standardized evidence-based protocols and were developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel (examples of possible diagnostics and interventions are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158714.s020">S3 Text</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Possible interventions were referral to a GP, referral to a paramedic, giving advice, follow-up visit by the CCRN.

Additionally, the intervention was not more effective than current primary care for all other outcomes assessed.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>A major strength of the study is that, given that we avoided major bias, it robustly excluded clinically relevant effects of the intervention on the primary outcome. Specifically, the 95% confidence interval around the mean difference between the two treatment groups (-0.07; 95% CI, &#x02212;0.22 to 0.07) excluded the predefined functional decline of -0.5 points by a wide margin. Thus, although the study was not designed as a non-inferiority trial, we found evidence of no effect. The sensitivity analyses accounting for missing data confirmed the robustness of the main analyses. To prevent bias in the outcome assessment, outcome assessors and participants were blinded using a postponed informed consent procedure. Another strength is the patient-centered approach comprising recognition and prioritization of identified problems for care and treatment. Addressing problems that older persons consider important may increase adherence to the intervention and facilitate implementation. Other strengths of the study include the active involvement of older people in the design and evaluation of the study, the high participation rate, the high adherence rate to the structured study protocol, and the evidence-based toolkit.</p><p>The study also has some limitations. First, the CCRNs and the GPs could not be blinded for the purpose of the study because they were part of the intervention. Second, despite computerized randomization the study showed some imbalance in baseline disability and SES. To overcome this, we adjusted the analyses for SES and baseline value of the outcome measure. Third, in the intervention group 23% of the participants declined to take part in the CGA. Although we collected reasons for non-participation/declining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158714.g001">Fig 1</xref> Flow chart), a large number did not fill in the reason for decline (n = 150 unknown), or could not be contacted (n = 81 other reasons). Overall, the participants who declined CGA were older, had more (I)ADL disabilities, and more often lived in a home for the elderly compared to the participants who received the CGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158714.s008">S3 Table</xref>). These non-respondents may have caused underestimation of the overall effect, as analyses were intention to treat. Fourth, not all parts of the intervention were implemented as planned. According to the nurses&#x02019; registration, not all CGAs were discussed with the GPs. These CGAs involved participants declining care or without unmet care needs. This may have caused underestimation of the adherence to the intervention, and thus of the overall effect. A detailed more qualitative process evaluation is therefore needed to gain more insight in the motivation and morale towards adherence to the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Two recent meta-analyses on multifactorial interventions,[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and one meta-analysis on preventive home visits[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have demonstrated small effects on functional decline. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity in the target population, the large variability of possible interventions and the variation in outcome measurements of ADL and IADL.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] One meta-analysis demonstrated that studies that were conducted before the year 1993 showed increased risk reduction on physical function.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This implicates that health care systems probably improved since then, adapting principles of effective elderly care in usual care.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Studies performed in the United States also demonstrated increased risk reduction on functional decline, because primary care for older people is less developed in the US compared to most European countries.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies in the United Kingdom, Canada, and The Netherlands found neutral effects of multifactorial preventive interventions to prevent disability or functional decline,[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] except for one study who described a small effect of nurse-led personalized care on postponing functional decline among highly educated participants.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] The window of opportunity for multifactorial interventions to prevent functional decline may therefore be larger in countries without a well-developed primary health care, such as the US.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Explanation of the finding and implications for future research</title><p>There are several possible explanations why we did not find an effect of a one-year nurse-led multifactorial intervention. First, the intervention lasted one year and measured its potential effects over a two-year period, which may have been too short to see effects emerge. Targeting a pre-frail population, which focuses on the prevention of future incidents, such as disability or mortality, a longer intervention and follow-up period has demonstrated beneficial effects.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] Furthermore, although experienced CCRNs were trained before and during the intervention, we observed that nurses needed time to build a steady collaboration with the GPs with focus on the new way of working with the GP and to focus on geriatric conditions. A detailed process evaluation is needed to learn how both professionals interacted together and which components of the intervention were or were not regarded useful to implement.</p><p>Second, insufficient contrast between the study groups could explain the lack of effect that was observed. The majority of the participants in the control group contacted their GP on a regular basis and received home care nursing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158714.s017">S12 Table</xref>). The Netherlands has a very easy assessable health care system,[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the quality of regular GP care is considered to be of high standard; evidence-based guidelines for the management of chronic conditions managed in the GP practice are available and the adherence to these protocols is good.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] Problem-based, goal-oriented approaches might already have been incorporated in usual care and additional improvement seems difficult.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</p><p>Third, although the modified Katz-ADL index is able to validly and reliably measure unfavourable health outcomes,[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] more insight is needed in its ability to detect clinical relevant change in disability over time. Besides, the separate components of the interventions were developed to provide treatment and care for geriatric conditions, such as pain, incontinence, hypertension, and loneliness, but this may not have been sufficiently associated with daily functioning as such. To enhance the effect of the intervention, more emphasis should be put on interventions that can directly postpone new disabilities, such as physical activity.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158714.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Using other measures with a closer relation to the individual outcome, such as goal-attainment scaling (GAS) might suit a patient-centered approach better.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] GAS, is a clinimetric tool that describes goal achievement for individual patients. GAS has demonstrated to detect clinically important change in the evaluation of complex interventions in frail elderly patients.[<xref rid="pone.0158714.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>Fourth, the intensity of the intervention may have been too low to see effects emerge. However, we found no &#x0201c;dose-response&#x0201d; effects by the number of home visits and interventions in the CTP.</p><p>Fifth, although many geriatric conditions were identified in the CGA, only one condition per participant was recognized as a problem and only one intervention was initiated. This could indicate that the CGA detected many conditions without unmet needs. Older persons may simply accept certain conditions as a normal part of ageing, or perhaps they were already addressed. Furthermore, prioritizing geriatric conditions may have resulted in a selection of interventions, while unfavorable conditions where left untreated. However, recognition and prioritizing may be useful in developing a person-centred approach to care, potentially facilitating shared decision-making and overall efficiency.</p><p>Finally, although we found a small and transient effect of the intervention for after-hours GP care use, we think that this should be interpreted with caution because of the relatively large number of outcome measures assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cluster randomized trial, we found no evidence that a one-year multifactorial nurse-led care program was better than current primary care in community-living older people at increased risk of functional decline in The Netherlands. Nevertheless, the implementation of preventive programs in general practice is ongoing in many health care systems throughout the Western world. We may learn from process evaluations why Dutch general practitioners want to implement preventive interventions despite the apparent ineffectiveness of a one-year intervention on functional decline over and above current primary care. In consideration of the ageing of Western societies, increasing task delegation from GPs to nurses warrants further non-inferiority analyses on both quality and costs, and warrants evaluation from a societal perspective to explore whether such programs may still deliver valuable services at acceptable costs and efforts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting
