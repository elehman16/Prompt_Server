Yet preoperative body washing continues to be widely used in many hospitals across Europe. This paper suggests that existing trials of preoperative body washing, upon which guidelines are based, are dated and proposes a new investigation of preoperative body washing using modern definitions of surgical site infection with standardised patient follow up, modern surgical techniques and well designed trials. This paper provides a critique of existing guidelines and describes a randomised trial with 60 participants to compare the effect of soap and two antiseptic washing products on colony forming units (CFUs) for up to six hours. Chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine were significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the underarm, and chlorhexidine was significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the groin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Preoperative body washing</kwd><kwd>chlorhexidine gluconate</kwd><kwd>octenidine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1757177411428095"><title>Introduction</title><p>The concept of preoperative body washing; washing with an antiseptic solution before surgery, was introduced over 30 years ago with the aim of reducing skin bacterial load and ultimately reducing endogenous surgical site infections (SSIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177411428095">Cruse and Foord, 1980</xref>). Despite guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411428095">NICE, 2008</xref>) and systematic reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411428095">Webster and Osborne, 2011</xref>) that do not support this practice, preoperative body washing is routine in some hospitals in Europe, especially in the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands. It is unusual for a clinical intervention with an associated cost to continue to be widely used in contradiction to national guidelines. This situation calls for a reappraisal of the effectiveness of preoperative body washing.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1757177411428095"><title>Literature review</title><p>Probably the two most influential documents in the UK which discuss preoperative body washing are the SSI guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411428095">NICE, 2008</xref>) and the Cochrane systematic review of body washing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411428095">Webster and Osborne, 2011</xref>). Based upon a review of the evidence neither of these documents recommends preoperative body washing. The NICE guidelines recommend that patients shower or bathe using soap either the day before or the day of surgery and the Cochrane review found no clear evidence to support or reject preoperative body washing. However, examination of the evidence included in these documents identifies some potential concerns. For example, the NICE recommendation is based on a meta analysis of five trials published between 20 and 29 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411428095">Byrne et al, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411428095">Earnshaw et al, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411428095">Hayek et al, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411428095">Randall et al, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411428095">Rotter et al, 1988</xref>). The age of the trials is important as they pre-date standardised definitions of SSIs and surveillance protocols and developments within clinical practice, such as the introduction of routine antibiotic prophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411428095">Horan et al, 1992</xref>). It is interesting to note the comparatively high SSI rates in the included trials, ranging from 10%&#x02013;50%.</p><p>Of further interest is that while this meta-analysis led NICE to recommend the use of soap, only three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411428095">Earnshaw et al, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411428095">Hayek et al, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411428095">Randall et al, 1983</xref>) of the five studies included in the meta-analysis used soap as a comparison group, with the remaining studies comparing an antiseptic agent against a detergent. Additionally, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411428095">Hayek et al, 1987</xref>), which compared soap, detergent and an antiseptic was flawed. In the flawed study it was subsequently discovered that the &#x02018;detergent&#x02019; had antimicrobial properties, yet the contaminated data from patients receiving the &#x02018;detergent&#x02019; is still included in the meta-analysis.</p><p>The same five trials are included in the Cochrane systematic review of preoperative bathing or showering, although they are separated into trials comparing antiseptic solutions against soap and trials comparing antiseptic solutions against detergent. Three trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411428095">Earnshaw et al, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411428095">Hayek et al, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411428095">Randall et al, 1983</xref>) are included in the meta-analysis comparing antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine gluconate) against soap. One trial from 1983 with 62 participants and a patient follow up of seven days found no difference in SSI rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411428095">Randall et al, 1983</xref>). A second trial from 1989 with 66 participants and a patient follow up of around five days found in favour of soap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411428095">Earnshaw et al, 1989</xref>). The third trial with 1315 patients followed up for six weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411428095">Hayek et al, 1987</xref>). This large trial established superior performance for chlorhexidine with an infection rate in the chlorhexidine group of 9% compared to 13% for the soap group. However, this statistical significance was lost when the trial was combined in a meta-analysis with the two small studies using a random effects model (<italic>p</italic> value 0.94), notably heterogeneity remained high (I<sup>2</sup> =60%).</p><p>The limitations of these trials suggests that a new study using modern definitions, modern clinical practice and high quality design is required.</p><p>We therefore proposed a two stage study which would address the deficits of the existing studies and allow a comparison of soap against antiseptic agents. The first stage was to identify the effect of preoperative body washing on skin bacterial counts and the second stage was to identify the effect of preoperative body washing on surgical site infections. Splitting the study into two stages was a necessary step for ethical reasons. If a randomised trial of body washing showed no difference in skin bacterial counts, then it would be pointless to conduct a large expensive trial involving patients to measure SSI rates. Conversely, if a trial of body washing showed a difference in skin bacterial counts in favour of antiseptics then a trial measuring SSIs would be justified. This paper describes the first stage of the study.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1757177411428095"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The aim of the first stage of the study reported in this paper was to measure the immediate and residual effect of two body washing antiseptic products against soap with colony forming units as the outcome measure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section4-1757177411428095"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We undertook a randomised controlled trial with plain soap, chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine comparing the reduction in colony forming units in 60 healthy volunteers.</p><p>Following ethical approval from the University Research Ethics Committee and with consent, 60 participants were randomised to shower with one of the following products;</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Plain liquid soap (Morrisons)</p></list-item><list-item><p>HiBi Scrub Plus (4% w/v chlorhexidine gluconate, Molnlycke Health Care)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Octenisan (1% octenidine dihydrochloride, Schulke)</p></list-item></list><p>In accordance with manufacturers&#x02019; instructions, chlorhexidine gluconate was used once a day for two consecutive days and octenidine was used once a day for five consecutive days.

This, in conjunction with the high cost of SSIs, has led to a renewed focus on interventions to reduce surgical site infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177411428095">House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2009</xref>). Preoperative body washing is a relatively inexpensive intervention and therefore should be assessed properly before it is dismissed as having no additional benefit over soap.</p><p>This small well conducted trial shows that preoperative body washing products, especially chlorhexidine, are more effective than soap in reducing colony forming units on the skin of healthy volunteers. This effect is seen immediately after showering and also six hours after showering. Chlorhexidine was found to be more effective than octendine, however this was just in the groin. Though the recommended five day application for Octenisan compared with just two days for HiBi Scrub Plus may make this product less appealing to patients.</p><p>We are not aware of any studies which demonstrate the relationship between colony forming units and surgical site infections. However, the effect of body washing on colony forming units observed in this study means the possibility exists for body washing to have an effect on surgical site infections. The second stage of this investigation is to conduct a randomised controlled trial among surgical patients comparing soap against a preoperative body wash with antiseptic and measuring SSI as the outcome.</p><p>To provide definitive level 1 evidence which can be incorporated into preoperative body washing guidelines a meta-analysis of several clinical trials is needed. To be eligible to be included in a meta-analysis, clinical trials should meet certain key requirements.
