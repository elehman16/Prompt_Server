It comprises of a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. NAFLD is known as one of the most common liver diseases in Western countries.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In addition, approximately 25% of their adult population suffers from this disease<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and its prevalence is 2-3 times higher than hepatitis B and C or other alcohol-related liver diseases. Besides, it is the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In Iran, the prevalence of NAFLD is reported 2.8%.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Recent studies in Eastern Asian countries showed that the spread of the disease has increased due to changes in people&#x02019;s lifestyle and dietary patterns (highfat and high-carbohydrate diet, low physical activity, obesity, and diabetes mellitus type 2).<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Recently, NAFLD has been increasing due to the prevalence of obesity.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Amongst the patients with NAFLD, 39-100% of them are obese.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Several studies have shown an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level more than aspartate aminotransferase (AST) which is a sign of NAFLD that is associated with obesity, metabolic syndromes, and insulin resistance which leads to inflammation of the liver that has resulted from accumulation of fat in the liver.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Until now, there has been no special treatment for patients with such disease and the only pharmaceutical therapies such as metformin, teazolidy and free radical inhibitors such as vitamin E are recommended.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> All specialists confirm that the most effective way is modification in lifestyle, daily exercise, healthy diet for prevention and treatment of NAFLD.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A proper diet that can reduce the weight up to 10% could solve metabolic and histological disorders associated with this disease.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Moreover, evidence suggests that regular exercise 3 to 4 times a week can be beneficial.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Tendler and colleagues conducted a study on the effects of a low-calorie diet in patients with NAFLD and observed a significant decrease in the body weight, liver enzymes (ALT and AST) as well as a significant improvement in their ultrasound result.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In another study, Hickman and colleagues examined the effects of 15-month diet and exercise with a focus on weight loss and Modified BMI. They reported a significant reduction in BMI, liver enzymes and also improvement in the patients&#x02019; quality of life.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> From every three patients with NAFLD, one is potentially exposed to the risk of cirrhosis and advanced liver failure.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the absence of timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment and followups, symptoms of liver failure will prevail. Furthermore, these patients are more exposed to diseases such as coronary heart, chronic renal disorders and carotid atherosclerosis compared with healthy individuals.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Follow-up is an essential part of the care. Frequent and regular follow-up in order to intervene is essential to promote healthy behavior. Patients&#x02019; followed-up can lead to change in their behavior.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Some studies indicate that regular follow-up helps the patients and their families to participate actively in the rehabilitation process and control the disease.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> American Nursing Association states that (telenursing) is a sub-branch of telemedicine that focuses on providing specific nursing services.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is beneficial for patients as it increases the access to effective care through telecommunication devices. Technologies used in telenursing include telephone, fax, internet, and audio and visual communication devices. Among different means of communication devices, telephone is the most available device in societies. Using telephone in providing care can reduce the costs, facilitate the access to an effective care, and improve the relationship between the patients and care providers. Currently, the use of telenursing enables the nurses to perform actions such as patient monitoring, patient education, data collection, nursing interventions, pain management, and patients&#x02019; family protection.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Therefore, by applying such method, we can provide care in a short time and replace hospital care by community-based care training and patient&#x02013; oriented care.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Thus, NLFD can be controlled in the early stages by informing the patients about the process of the disease. By providing appropriate education on dieting, weight loss, increased physical activity, and following the improvement process, we can prevent unpleasant complications. Considering the importance of such issues, we aimed to investigate the effect of telenursing on liver enzymes (ALT and AST) in the patients with NAFLD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized controlled clinical trial study was conducted from May 2013 to Dec 2014, and ethics committee approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Ethics committee code CT-92-92-62-6602).

The design and protocol of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. The numbers 0 through 4 were allocated to the control group and numbers 5 through 9 to the intervention group. Initially, the researcher explained to all participants about the nature of the disease, factors contributing to illness, progression and prognosis, complications of the disease and the importance of the treatment and follow-ups for the patients. The researcher asked the participants to complete demographic information form. For all participants, the serum levels of ALT and AST were determined by the same laboratory. Height and weight were measured by the same meter and scale and body mass index was calculated by the researcher.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Design and protocol of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCBNM-4-239-g002"/></fig><p>A nutritionist offered counseling for all participants in both intervention and control groups. They also received dietary advice provided in a written form. Then patients were asked to do some sorts of moderate physical activities at least 30 minutes a day, 4 to 5 times a week to increase their heart rate and respiration. The physical activities included jogging, cycling, aerobic exercise or any other activity that is of a similar intensity. In addition to face-to-face consultation, all the participants received a training pamphlet.</p><p>In the intervention group, telephone intervention lasted for 12 weeks in a way to follow-up the recommended diet and physical activity. The researcher contacted the patients twice a week during the first month and once a week in the second and the third months. The average duration of each call was 15 to20 minutes between 8 AM to 8 PM that was confirmed by patients.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The participants were also given self-report forms, which was designed by the researcher, to record their daily diet and physical activities. This helped the patients to easily report the items based on the form during telephone follow-ups. Conversation content included evaluating the adherence to diet and physical activities. Also, if a patient did not adhere to the diet and training program, the researcher tried to identify and analyze the reason and ultimately provide a possible solution. In addition, in each telephone session, conversation was recorded in a preprepared form by the researcher.</p><p>During the intervention period, the control group received no intervention by the researcher and was only followed up as usual by a specialist and also received educational booklet after the intervention. At the end of the 12th week, serum levels of liver enzymes were measured again by the same laboratory that preformed the pretests. Also height and weight were measured by the same meter and scale and body mass index was calculated by the researcher again.</p><p>The data that were collected from the participants both before and after the intervention were analyzed using SPSS software (version 16) and Chi-square test, Paired t-test and independent t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>There were 30 patients in the intervention group, of whom 8 were women (26.7%) and 22 men (73.3%).

The results indicated that after 12-weeks of telenursing glycosylated hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL levels were decreased in the intervention group in comparison to the control group.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We can conclude that telenursing could promote healthy behavior in patients with NAFLD by increasing their awareness towards the disease and a treatment that can lead to reduction in the level of liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD. Telenursing can provide counseling services by phone after receiving clinical advice from a physician as well as continuous trainings that could have a positive effect and help the patient with NAFLD to have healthy behaviors and also help to improve the results of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGEMENT</sc></title><p>The present article was extracted from the thesis written by Sorur Javanmardi Fard and was financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Grant No 6602).
