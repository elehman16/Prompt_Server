Chronic neck pain is regarded as often complex in origin and nature and particularly difficult to manage [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the challenge of chronic neck pain is likely to grow due to increasing computer and mobile technology use, with recognised consequences such as &#x02018;text neck' [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>].</p><p id="par0010">One approach to the solution of this growing problem that warrants investigation, is to explore ways of encouraging better self-efficacy and self-care. In this research, self-efficacy is defined as confidence in one&#x02019;s ability to execute a behaviour to produce a desired outcome [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. We define self-care broadly as a certain positive attitude and form of attention towards the self, in respect of any necessary function that is under individual conscious control and is self-initiated [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. Greater self-efficacy and self-care could enable individuals to recognise and reduce some of the underlying causes of musculoskeletal pain, such as mal-coordinated postural and movement habits, excessive muscular tension, and associated psychological distress [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>]. The Alexander Technique is an effective long established but often under-utilised way of bringing about such constructive self-change. It is an embodied reflective practice that enables individuals to improve the way they go about their daily activities, through increased awareness, intentional inhibition of unwanted reaction and unnecessary action, and with more effective direction of thought; all leading to improved overall muscle tone and postural support with less stiffness [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. The Technique is usually taught in one-to-one lessons, using integrated spoken and hands-on guidance [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. Such lessons have led to diverse health and performance-related benefits [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>]. Training in the Alexander Technique has been shown to increase dynamic postural muscle tone [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and improve movement coordination and balance [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>]. These movement and balance changes are thought to result from the altered postural tone [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Research studies, often using qualitative methods, have reported improvements in psychological well-being, mood and confidence, as well as reduction in performance-related anxiety following one-to-one Alexander lessons [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>].</p><p id="par0015">The ATLAS (Alexander Technique Lessons or Acupuncture Sessions) trial is the second large randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of Alexander lessons in a chronic musculoskeletal pain population. The earlier ATEAM trial demonstrated that, compared with usual care alone, one-to-one Alexander lessons led to significant long-term reduction in chronic or recurrent back pain and associated disability, [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. ATLAS compared usual care alone with either Alexander lessons or acupuncture (both plus usual care) for primary care patients with chronic (median 6 years) non-specific neck pain [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>]. The ATLAS trial clinical findings have already been reported, with the primary outcome of the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in pain and associated disability for both Alexander lessons and for acupuncture sessions compared with usual care alone, with the benefit maintained to at least 12 months [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The trial design encompassed a range of additional participant-reported outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol, mostly relating to self-efficacy and the ability to improve self-care [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to the outcome data collected from participants, data were also collected from the practitioners regarding delivery of Alexander lessons and acupuncture. Findings for the acupuncture group have been published separately [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>]. Here we report the results for the self-efficacy and other self-care-related outcomes in the Alexander group.</p><p id="par0020">The main aims of the current analysis are: to evaluate the extent of change in self-efficacy and self-care ability during and following a series of one-to-one lessons in the Alexander Technique; to compare the extent of any such changes with those in the group receiving usual care alone; and to identify any relationships between such changes and the long-term clinical outcome already reported in this chronic neck pain population. The ATLAS trial was not designed for direct comparison of Alexander lessons and acupuncture; however, based on descriptive analyses, we report similarities and differences between the outcomes for the two interventions [<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as a means of gaining insight into their distinctive natures.

Participants randomised to the acupuncture group were offered an equivalent intervention duration of traditional Chinese acupuncture plus continued usual medical care.

Additional outcome measures were included in the participant questionnaires that were completed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Self-efficacy was determined by the five-question pain management sub-scale of the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale.

The four-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale was also used, and asked the following questions, scored 0 (never) to 4 (very often): &#x02018;In the last month, how often have you i) felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?; ii) felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?; iii) felt that things were going your way?; iv) felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?&#x02019; [<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>].

The difference from usual care for this parameter was statistically significant for the Alexander group, reflecting the fact that development of this ability is a key component of Alexander lessons. Participants in the acupuncture group alone made statistically significant dietary changes as a result of the intervention when compared with the usual care group (Supplementary Table 2), reflecting the fact that dietary advice is a key component of acupuncture practice but not of Alexander lessons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0075"><label>3.4</label><title>Practitioner-reported data</title><p id="par0135">Alexander Technique teachers reported being able to teach in line with their usual practice, with 93.8% (136/145) of the participants taught in this way. Log book data also revealed that lessons were generally organised around observation of, and reflection on, the manner of performing everyday activities such as sitting, standing, moving and lying resting in a particular way, while incorporating fundamental Alexander principles. Such activities provided a framework for the learning and practise of Alexander thinking and practical skills, and for the development of an understanding of the main principles; these had an integral role throughout each lesson (Supplementary Table 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0080"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0140">Individuals with chronic neck pain who attended Alexander Technique lessons reported improvements in a wide range of outcomes related to self-efficacy and self-care, with a significantly greater degree of positive change than occurred with usual care alone. These benefits were generally maintained over the 12 months of the study. Furthermore, many of these changes were found to be related to an improvement in clinical outcome, as assessed by the NPQ score at 12 months.</p><p id="par0145">Strengths of this pragmatic study include the high overall adherence rate, with 60% of participants attending all 20 Alexander lessons and non-adherers generally being individuals who either never began their lessons (12%), or those who discontinued after one or two lessons. Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of participants (94%) were taught the Alexander Technique in line with their teachers' usual practice. This indicates that the trial design and conduct adequately reflected the &#x02018;real world' setting and suggests that the results are likely to be transferrable to routine practice. The log book data completed by the Alexander teachers also revealed that the lesson content and delivery in the trial reflected current standard Alexander teaching practice across the UK, as shown by a recent large-scale national survey [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This survey did reveal some variation in teaching practice between the three participating professional organisations, but as the majority of Alexander teachers in the UK belong to the Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique, as do all those who worked in this trial, the teaching in the ATLAS trial can be taken to be broadly representative of current overall UK teaching practice.</p><p id="par0150">Limitations of the current analysis include low statistical power, resulting from the trial being powered only for comparison of groups for the main clinical outcome of NPQ score. In addition, only the participant-reported outcomes were pre-specified in the protocol; however, the practitioner-reported data analyses were specified in the statistical plan prior to data lock. A further limitation was the low response rate in the usual care group for the two outcome measures that related to putting into practice the advice or teaching received during the trial. Perhaps participants in this group did not perceive the relevance of these two questions? Their low response may have impacted the observed between-group differences for these two outcomes, particularly bearing in mind that the findings remained stable between 6 and 12 months for the Alexander group.</p><p id="par0155">Although ATLAS was not designed, and therefore not powered, to be a comparative trial of Alexander Technique lessons and acupuncture sessions, the observed similarities and differences in self-efficacy and other self-care-related outcomes may nevertheless provide interesting insights into these two distinctive approaches to healthcare. The differences in findings between the two intervention groups regarding the nature and amount of benefit gained, demonstrate that benefit was not simply due to the additional (and equal) time and attention that participants received from the Alexander teachers and acupuncturists compared with the provision of usual medical care alone. Rather, the observed differences are most likely to have resulted from specific factors unique to each intervention. The participant-reported outcome measures employed can, therefore, be considered to provide meaningful data, even though some of them were devised specifically for the trial and were not validated measures. Previous trials have also demonstrated that long-term health benefits ensuing from Alexander Technique lessons are unlikely to result from non-specific effects of attention and touch [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>]. The predominantly self-care nature of the Alexander Technique and the distinctive teaching methodology employed were reflected in the outcomes for that group, such as the ability of individuals to reduce pain during the activities of daily life by applying the Alexander principles. Together with the other analyses for the acupuncture group [<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], these findings accord with the view that acupuncture is predominantly therapeutic but with an important educational component primarily through lifestyle advice, while Alexander Technique lessons are primarily principle-based practical education and also have a therapeutic element.</p><p id="par0160">To date there has been relatively little published research on the Alexander Technique and self-efficacy/self-care. However, participants in the ATEAM randomised trial who learnt the Technique reported that they were better able to manage their chronic back pain condition [<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The same finding was reported by a service evaluation in a chronic pain clinic where Alexander lessons helped people manage self-perception of pain and reduce pain escalation, fear avoidance, and the effect of pain catastrophising [<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These benefits enabled a reduction in reliance on medication, with more than half of the participants stopping or reducing their pain medication following lessons.</p><p id="par0165">In the current analysis, participants who had a better clinical outcome in terms of neck pain and associated disability tended to be those who reported an increase in self-efficacy, and also those who reported being able to apply what they had learnt from their Alexander lessons during their daily lives to reduce pain. These findings are particularly encouraging in the light of the known role of self-efficacy in relation to the management of chronic pain [<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, a high percentage of participants reported that they had learnt to improve the way they lived and cared for themselves as a result of the lessons and this percentage increased between 6 and 12 months from 81% to 87%, reflecting the reinforcing self-learning nature of the Alexander Technique and continuous benefit of applying it. This result is in line with the main clinical findings of the trial, which showed that the reduction in NPQ score observed at 6 months was maintained to 12 months, indicating little or no loss of benefit once the Alexander lessons had ceased [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Longer-term retention of skills learnt in Alexander lessons has also been reported previously [<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p id="par0170">Interestingly, there was no association between participants' self-efficacy at baseline and clinical outcome (NPQ), suggesting that good outcomes were not dependent on a pre-existing strong belief in ability to reduce pain. Rather, participants became more confident in their ability to reduce their pain as a result of attending Alexander lessons and learning the Technique, and this is what led to better clinical outcomes. The lack of baseline predictors of clinical outcome, taken together with the broad trial inclusion criteria that ensured a diverse and representative non-specific chronic neck pain population, suggest that Alexander lessons may be widely appropriate, with no differential effects identified for different subgroups of patients. Research in other areas has also shown that certain education-based interventions can lead to increased self-efficacy, with associated improvement in clinical outcomes, including pain reduction [<xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p id="par0175">The significant change in exercise that was reported in the Alexander group is interesting, particularly as specific exercise advice does not form part of Alexander teaching. If it signifies that the ATLAS Alexander group participants increased the amount of general exercise or activity they engaged in, this would be consistent with the reported increase in self-efficacy and decrease in NPQ score. It would also suggest a potential explanation for the finding in the ATEAM back pain trial that those participants in the group offered 24 Alexander lessons who also received a prescription for general exercise were found to gain no additional benefit from the exercise prescription [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Perhaps most of the participants in that group were already engaging in more activity?</p><p id="par0180">One surprising finding in the current analysis is the lack of significant change in the Perceived Stress Scale when explored as the outcome of interest. Other than changes to diet, this is the only outcome that did not change significantly following Alexander lessons. Anecdotally, stress reduction is one of the main reported benefits of Alexander lessons, albeit that stress/anxiety is not currently reported as a main reason for beginning lessons [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, qualitative research, sometimes embedded in controlled trials, has reported improvement in psychological well-being and reduced performance-related anxiety following Alexander lessons [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>]. A potential explanation for the lack of significant change in the Perceived Stress Scale may relate to our use of the short-form version (maximum possible score: 16), consisting of 4 items rather than the standard 10 or 14. Baseline scores in the ATLAS trial were approximately 6, which is typical for a UK general population [<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This unexpectedly low baseline score left limited scope for significant reduction during the trial. Further research is warranted in this area using the more sensitive 10- or 14-item scale, together with a range of other outcome measures for stress and anxiety.</p><p id="par0185">Future research could usefully evaluate the relative benefit of one-to-one Alexander lessons alone and one-to-one lessons combined with some group classes to explore possible differences in relative teaching/learning efficiency and cost/benefit ratios. Furthermore it would be worthwhile to evaluate the effectiveness of an initial course of acupuncture for rapid pain relief in the chronic neck pain population, followed by Alexander lessons for long-term self-efficacy and self-care.</p></sec><sec id="sec0085"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0190">Alexander lessons promote self-efficacy and self-care by imparting knowledge and skills that help people improve the way they live and care for themselves, leading to long-term reduction in chronic neck pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec0090"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0195">The ATLAS trial was funded by a clinical studies grant from <funding-source id="gs0005">Arthritis Research UK</funding-source> (grant number 19702).
