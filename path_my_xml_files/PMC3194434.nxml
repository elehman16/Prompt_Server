Since pyrin has an important role in IL-1&#x003b2; regulation we hypothesize that IL-1 inhibition will decrease the number of FMF attacks in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To determine if rilonacept, a fusion protein that binds and neutralizes IL-1, decreases the number of FMF attacks compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects were FMF patients &#x02265;4 years of age recruited at 6 U.S. sites, who had at least 1 FMF attack per month despite receiving adequate doses of, or who were intolerant of colchicine. Subjects received two 3-month courses of rilonacept (Arm A) at 2.2 mg/kg (max 160 mg) by weekly SC injection and two 3-month courses of placebo (Arm B). Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences (ABAB, BABA, ABBA, BAAB). Escape visits were allowed to permit switching arms (blinding was maintained) for patients with at least 2 attacks within a course. The primary outcome was the difference of FMF attacks between rilonacept and placebo courses with responders defined as subjects with a &#x0003e;40% difference. Results were analyzed by paired t-and signed rank tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fourteen subjects were randomized, 8 males and 6 females, mean (&#x000b1;SD) age 24.4&#x000b1;11.8 years (range 4.5-47.3; 4 patients &#x0003c;18 years), disease duration 17.5&#x000b1;12.6 yrs, with a baseline of 3.1&#x000b1;2.0 attacks per month. Eleven completed the full study and 3 dropped out (1 due to lack of efficacy, 1 due to distance from study site and 1 lost to follow-up). Among 12 patients who completed at least 2 treatment courses the mean number of attacks per month on rilonacept was 1.0&#x000b1;1.2 vs. 1.8&#x000b1;0.9 on placebo (P=0.021 by paired t-test and 0.027 by signed rank test). There were 8 responders; all 4 non-responders were adults. There were 2 respiratory infection SAEs, 1 on rilonacept and 1 on placebo. Injections site reactions were significantly more frequent with rilonacept but no differences were seen in other adverse events, including infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rilonacept significantly reduced the number of FMF attacks and had an acceptable safety profile. IL-1 inhibition is a treatment option for most (especially children) colchicine resistant FMF patients.</p></sec></body></article>
