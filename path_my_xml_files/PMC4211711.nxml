Differences between HIV-1 breakthrough viruses from vaccine and placebo recipients can be attributed to the RV144 vaccine as this was a randomized and double-blinded trial. CD8 and CD4 T cell epitope repertoires were predicted in HIV-1 proteomes from 110 RV144 participants. Predicted Gag epitope repertoires were smaller in vaccine than in placebo recipients (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.019). After comparing participant-derived epitopes to corresponding epitopes in the RV144 vaccine, the proportion of epitopes that could be matched differed depending on the protein conservation (only 36% of epitopes in Env vs 84&#x02013;91% in Gag/Pol/Nef for CD8 predicted epitopes) or on vaccine insert subtype (55% against CRF01_AE vs 7% against subtype B). To compare predicted epitopes to the vaccine, we analyzed predicted binding affinity and evolutionary distance measurements. Comparisons between the vaccine and placebo arm did not reveal robust evidence for a T cell driven sieve effect, although some differences were noted in Env-V2 (0.022&#x02264;p-value&#x02264;0.231). The paucity of CD8 T cell responses identified following RV144 vaccination, with no evidence for V2 specificity, considered together both with the association of decreased infection risk in RV 144 participants with V-specific antibody responses and a V2 sieve effect, lead us to hypothesize that this sieve effect was not T cell specific. Overall, our results did not reveal a strong differential impact of vaccine-induced T cell responses among breakthrough infections in RV144 participants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by an Interagency Agreement Y1-AI-2642-12 between the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command and the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and by a cooperative agreement (W81XWH-07-2-0067) between the Henry M.

Viruses derived from vaccine recipients could be differentiated from those from placebo recipients at Env positions 169 and 181, which are contact sites for V2-specific antibodies including some derived from RV144 participants <xref rid="pone.0111334-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Genetic signatures in V2, together with the identification of binding antibodies directed against V2 as a correlate of risk of HIV-1 infection <xref rid="pone.0111334-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, suggest that anti-V2 antibodies may have played a role in the protection conferred by the RV144 vaccine.</p><p>It is plausible that Env-V2 was not the sole viral determinant impacted by vaccine-induced immune responses. One possible path to explore is the potential role of T-cell mediated immune responses.

The entirety of exon 2 was DNA sequenced for all class II loci with additional exons DNA sequenced for DQB1 (exon 3), DQA1 (exon 3), and DPB1 (exons 3 &#x00026; 4). DNA sequence analysis and HLA allele assignment were performed with Assign-SBT v3.5.1 software (Conexio Genomics). The HLA database for allele assignment was updated with IMGT release 3.0.0 May 5th 2010. Any ambiguous types that remained following DNA Sequence Based Typing were resolved to 4-digits using the PEL-FREEZ UNITRAY SSP, Life Technologies. SSOP was conducted using the LABType SSO Class I HD system (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA), which is based on Luminex xMAP technology, and results were interpreted using the accompanying HLA Fusion 2.0.0 software.

In parallel, epitopes were predicted in the vaccine insert sequences using all the HLA/HLA-DR alleles in the cohort of 110 RV144 subjects.

Matched epitope predictions were analyzed based on the respective binding affinity values of the matched epitopes, and on the evolutionary distance calculated between the matched epitopes. For each matched subject-derived and vaccine-derived epitope pair, the binding affinity value was calculated as the ratio of the binding affinity for the subject-derived epitope to the binding affinity of the vaccine-derived epitope. The evolutionary distance was calculated between the subject-derived and vaccine-derived epitope based on the HIV-specific matrix (HIV-between-10%) developed by Nickle and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0111334-Nickle1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>For each subject, summary distances were computed based on matched pairs of predicted epitopes (if there were no predicted epitope or no matched pair, then the distance could not be defined and the subject's information was not used).

For each gene, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed and a model of conditional adaptation was created for the vaccine status and for every HLA gene, amino acid position and state. The null hypothesis is that the observations depend on the phylogenetic tree structure; then, adaptation due to each variable is modeled along the tree by an additive process. Results were adjusted for multiple comparisons, using q values of &#x02264;0.2 with an associated p-value threshold of &#x02264;0.05 (implying a false-positive proportion of 20% among identified associations).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Association between viral loads and HLA alleles</title><p>We analyzed the effect of the HLA (2 digit) genotype on viral loads measured at the time of HIV-1 diagnosis (VL corresponding to the plasma sample sequenced).</p><p>L1-regularized linear regression analyses were used to test which features predict VL for each sample.

For each subject, the list of predicted autologous class I and class II epitopes was compared to corresponding epitopes predicted in the vaccine insert strain to identify pairs of matched subject+vaccine epitopes (Schematic representation for class I epitopes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111334-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Considering each vaccine insert sequence separately, we found no difference between vaccine and placebo recipients in the ratio of subject-derived epitopes that could be matched to vaccine-derived epitopes for any of the HIV-1 proteins: p&#x02265;0.314 vs CM244, p&#x02265;0.214 vs LAI (MN for Env), p&#x02265;0.540 vs 92TH023. Since the RV144 vaccine was composed of proteins of different subtype (Subtype B and CRF01_AE; while all subjects evaluated were infected with CRF01_AE) and of proteins that are relatively variable (Env-gp120) or conserved (Gag/Pro), we tested if these factors affected the ability to match predicted autologous epitopes to the predicted epitopes in the inserts. We found that the ratio of matched epitopes differed depending on the protein and on the vaccine reference considered but not on the vaccine/placebo status. The proportion of matched epitopes is much higher in Pol, Gag, or Nef (73 to 91%) than in Env, for which only about a third (36%) of predicted epitopes in subject-derived sequences could be matched to epitopes identified in the vaccine inserts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111334-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, there were subtype-specific differences, with significantly more subject-derived epitopes matched against the CM244 (also CRF01) than against the MN (or LAI; both subtype B) vaccine insert. For example, an average of 55% of Env predicted epitopes were matched against CM244 compared to 7% matched against MN (p&#x0003c;0.0001) whether vaccine or placebo recipients are considered. The limited number of matched epitopes is due to the high diversity between Env sequences, hence the large distance between specific strains, which is amplified when attempting cross-subtype epitope matching.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0111334-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111334.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Subject-specific epitopes matched to vaccine-derived epitopes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0111334-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0111334.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Matched epitopes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gag</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pol</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Env</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nef</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,629/5,509</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12,198/13,368</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5,545/15,520</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,389/2,860</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD8 (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11,177/13,419</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25,273/29,921</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13,109/36,738</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,006/4,119</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD4 (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73%</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt102"><label/><p>Epitopes were considered matched when the subject- and vaccine-derived peptides had at least 67% AA identity.

Because the vaccine was multivalent, we compared the epitopes predicted in RV144 participants&#x02019; sequences to the subtype B and CRF01_AE reference strains included in the vaccine (CRF01_AE: CM244 and 92TH023; subtype B: LAI and MN). We tested both differences in binding affinities (by comparing predicted IC50 for the epitopes in the vaccinee&#x02019;s sequence and in the vaccine insert) and in evolutionary distances (i.e., protein distances between RV144 participants&#x02019; epitopes and vaccine-derived epitopes were calculated using an HIV-specific substitution model). We looked for evidence of a difference between vaccine and placebo group by analyzing predictions in proteins that were part of the vaccine (Gag, Pro, Gp120) and used as control the epitope predictions derived from RT-IN and Nef (to test the hypothesis that there would be no difference between the vaccine and placebo group outside of the vaccine insert).</p><p>We first looked at predicted CD8 and CD4 epitopes defined as both weak and strong binders. We found no difference between the vaccine and placebo group either when we focused on binding affinities or evolutionary distances for the different proteins and references considered (data not shown). Second, we focused on the subset of epitopes identified as strong binders (i.e., with a predicted IC50&#x02264;50 nM). Again, there was no concordant evidence of a difference between the vaccine and placebo group, although, for CD8 epitope predictions, there was a trend suggesting a difference between the vaccine and placebo groups in Pro (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.080) and gp120 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.065) when binding affinities of predicted epitopes were considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111334-t003">Table 3</xref>).

Data were not available against the subtype B vaccine boost (MN) because subject-derived epitopes were too divergent to be matched to the vaccine strain. For predicted strong CD8 binders, there was a significant difference between the vaccine and placebo group in the V2 region of Env when binding affinities were considered. Comparisons were significant against the CRF01_AE strains (CM244 p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022; 92TH023 p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.047).

There was no significant distinction found between the vaccine and placebo groups using the tests described above (p&#x0003e;0.108), noting that there were no epitopes in V3 that had enough similarity with MN for the corresponding epitopes to be matched (i.e., less than 2/3 of the residues of a peptide matched).</p><p>Parallels between V2 and V3 were notable: i) both V2 and V3 were a hotspot of RV144-induced antibody responses <xref rid="pone.0111334-Karasavvas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; ii) V2- and V3-specific binding antibodies were identified as correlates of risk of infection in RV144; and iii) they harbored signature sites of RV144 vaccination. Statistical analyses that interrogated individual sites in Env from RV144 participants identified two sites in V2 (sites 169 and 181, <xref rid="pone.0111334-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>) and one in V3 (site 317).

We repeated the analysis described above by taking into account separately the predicted epitopes restricted by HLA-A*02, HLA-A*11, and HLA-B*46; including strong and weak binders (focusing only on strong binders reduced the subset of predicted epitopes to a number too small for adequate comparisons).</p><p>For these allele-specific comparisons, there was no difference between the vaccine and placebo groups whether evolutionary distances or binding affinity were considered &#x02013; the smallest p-values were p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.206 for evolutionary distances (gp120 vs CM244 for HLA-A*02), and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.123 for binding affinity measures (V2 vs CM244 for HLA-B*46) (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111334.s002">file S2</xref>).

We tested for evidence of a distinction between the vaccine and placebo groups and found evidence potentially suggestive of a weak T cell driven sieve effect among breakthrough viruses as vaccine/placebo comparisons showed a) some evidence of a signal converging on the Env-V2 segment, and b) smaller Gag epitope repertoires in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients.</p><p>One indication that the V2 signal, although weak, may be genuine is the fact that differences between the vaccine and placebo group were only seen when comparisons were made against CRF01_AE strains (CM244, 92TH023). No difference was seen when subject-derived sequences were compared to epitopes derived from the subtype B MN strain; this appears logical as the MN boost protein would seem unlikely to have elicited a substantial number of cross-reactive T cell responses toward infecting CRF01_AE viruses, which at the epitope level often differed from MN by 4&#x02013;5 residues out of nine in a CTL epitope. The lack of V2 signal against MN as a reference could be expected as cross-reactivity decreases drastically with more than 2 mutations out of 9 residues in a CTL epitope <xref rid="pone.0111334-Rolland4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> - a typical instance when epitopes are compared between subtype B and CRF01_AE. An additional factor that may explain the identification of a vaccine/placebo distinction in V2 is the fact that 60% of the CD4 responses detected in a subset of RV144 vaccine recipients were directed against V2 <xref rid="pone.0111334-deSouza1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, although, paradoxically, these responses were not identified post-infection, suggesting that antigen-specific T cells could possibly have been preferentially infected and deleted <xref rid="pone.0111334-Douek1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Importantly, it is possible that the signal detected in V2 was the consequence of an antibody-mediated effect, as binding antibodies targeting V2 were associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection in the RV144 trial. As such, two vaccine-associated signatures in V2 <xref rid="pone.0111334-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> that were linked to vaccine-derived binding antibodies <xref rid="pone.0111334-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> were located within predicted CD8/4 epitopes. Overall, it is difficult to hypothesize that T cell driven immune responses played an important role in the protection associated with the RV144 vaccine because few RV144 subjects mounted CD8/CD4 responses following RV144 vaccination <xref rid="pone.0111334-RerksNgarm1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, we cannot discount that T cell responses may have played a role in a more restricted way as the limited sensitivity of the T cell assays employed in the RV144 trial means that some responses may not have been detected.</p><p>Our results were generally, but not necessarily, in agreement between the CD8 and CD4 epitope predictions. It has to be noted that CD4 epitopes are less well defined than CD8 epitopes in the context of HIV-1 natural infection, hence <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of CD4 epitopes are less accurate than those for CD8 epitopes. It is possible that the absence of information and algorithms for the prediction of epitopes in HLA class II alleles common in Thailand may underestimate epitope enumeration and bias this analysis. To overcome the uncertainty in epitope predictions, additional analyses were focused on a few V2 epitopes that had been precisely characterized in some RV144 participants (<xref rid="pone.0111334-deSouza2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; and personal communication from Mark deSouza and Silvia Ratto-Kim). For example, we specifically looked at predicted epitopes corresponding to the peptide that showed the highest recognition in a study of responses from 25 RV144 vaccine recipients following vaccination: peptide VHALFYKLDIVPIED (AA 172&#x02013;186) <xref rid="pone.0111334-deSouza2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, these epitope comparisons focused on the experimental data showed no distinction between vaccine and placebo groups, while this may be due in part to the small number of subjects, it also illustrates the limited congruence between <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and mapped CTL responses, as previously noted <xref rid="pone.0111334-Rolland3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The second signal we identified was the significantly (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.019) smaller size of Gag epitope repertoires among vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. One interpretation is that there could be more escape mutations in Gag sequences from vaccinees (due to vaccine-induced responses), and that these mutations prevented certain sequence motifs from being recognized as epitopes. Another interpretation is that vaccine efficacy might depend on the number of Gag epitopes in the circulating viruses, implying that viruses with canonical epitopes were more likely to be blocked from establishing infection. Some evidence of a vaccine/placebo distinction in Gag is interesting as Gag is typically a preferential target of T cell responses compared to the V2 region of Env. Indeed, a T cell driven sieve effect may have been expected to be uncovered in an immunodominant region of the proteome, as was shown in a study of the Step trial <xref rid="pone.0111334-Rolland3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Analyses of epitope repertoires from breakthrough infections in the Step trial showed a distinction between the vaccine and placebo group that was largely driven by an effect in Gag. Several factors allowed for the detection of a T cell based signal in Gag in the Step trial: i) most subjects mounted T cell responses following vaccination; ii) there are immunodominant responses in Gag; iii) a Gag immunodominant response (SL9) was restricted by a common allele in the Step cohort (HLA-A*02); iv) Gag is a relatively conserved protein allowing for an easier identification of genetic signals than a more variable protein (such as Env); v) there was no env immunogen to potentially shift immunodominance patterns in vaccinees.</p><p>Lastly, our results differ from those of Gartland and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0111334-Gartland1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, who reported evidence of greater predicted HLA binding escape for an HLA A*02 peptide in vaccine versus placebo recipients, and greater vaccine efficacy in A*02-positive participants than in A*02-negative participants (VE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;54% versus 3%, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). We note that a comprehensive test of all HLA alleles in the RV144 cohort failed to show that A*02 modified vaccine efficacy. The differences between our studies could also be due to the fact that the MN-derived V2 peptide linked to the findings by Gartland and colleagues was not included as a predicted epitope in our analysis, because we only considered as a predicted epitope the peptides that had a predicted binding affinity &#x0003c;500 nm (different methods can be used to analyze sequences without conditioning on the presence of potential epitopes <xref rid="pone.0111334-Edlefsen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Besides, few MN-derived epitopes were included in our cross-proteome analysis since subtype B- (MN vaccine insert) and CRF01_AE- (breakthrough viruses) derived epitopes were poorly matched; the MN peptide highlighted in <xref rid="pone.0111334-Gartland1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showed three to six AA differences with corresponding breakthrough-derived peptides, suggesting a limited probability of cross-reactive CTL responses with the breakthrough peptides (knowing that the MN component of the RV144 vaccine was a protein boost, which would not typically be expected to elicit CTL responses).</p><p>In conclusion, while there is some evidence that T cell driven immune responses may have been associated with genetic changes in HIV-1 breakthrough viruses from vaccinees, the fact that most results are not strongly corroborated across our proteome-wide epitope comparisons is consistent with weak CD8-driven cytotoxic T cell responses in RV144. Hence, in the absence of evidence for strong CD8+ T cell epitopic signals across the RV144 vaccine inserts, the most conservative interpretation of our findings for V2 epitope predictions would suggest a relationship to V2-specific binding antibody responses previously identified as a correlate of risk in RV144 <xref rid="pone.0111334-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111334.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
