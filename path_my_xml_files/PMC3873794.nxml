especially holds for unaccustomed training volumes at moderate to high intensities. We investigated
the effects of a marine oil complex, PCSO-524&#x000ae;, derived from the New Zealand green-lipped
mussel (formulated as Lyprinol&#x000ae; and Omega XL&#x000ae;) on DOMS after a 30 km training
run.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Initially, peak oxygen uptake of 32 distance runners (4 female, 28 male; median age 45 years,
range 28&#x02013;53) was measured on a treadmill with a 1.5 km hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase
every 4 minutes starting from 8.5 km hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. At least 1-week after this initial
test, they participated in a 30 km road run at a speed corresponding to about 70% of their
individual peak oxygen uptake on a flat terrain. Before and after (0, 24, and 48 hours) the run,
blood concentration of creatine kinase (CK) were measured and pain sensation was determined (pain
scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = extremely painful). Runners were then matched in pairs based on
maximal CK and peak oxygen uptake, and allocated randomly into two different groups. One group was
supplemented with 400 mg per day of PCSO-524&#x000ae; for 11 weeks, the other group with an olive
oil placebo. After that period, CK and pain sensations were remeasured following a second 30 km run
at the same speed and on the same terrain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The general pattern of soreness in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; supplemented group was reduced by 1.1
units (standard error 0.41) compared to the placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), the effects
being greater in lesser trained runners (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). CK levels were
positively associated with pain sensation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but trends toward
lower CK in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; group, which were also more pronounced in the lesser trained
runners, were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pain sensations experienced by distance runners following a 30 km run were reduced by

negatively impact performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-oajsm-4-109">2</xref> Compared to other
endurance sports like swimming, rowing, or cycling, runners are especially susceptible to muscle

likely to play a major causative role. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not
without risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-109">5</xref> and anti-inflammatory agents with

it was important to provide a specific exercise stress to maximize the study&#x02019;s practical

run.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study protocol was approved by the Ethics committee of the German Sports University,
Cologne, Germany.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Overview of study design</title><p>Thirty two Caucasian, nonprofessional distance runners (28 male, 4 female) participated in this
study. They were recruited from a local running club (Telecom, Bonn, Germany). Prior to the long
distance runs, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was measured during an incremental treadmill exercise
until subjective exhaustion. At least 1-week after this test, runners participated in a 30 km run at
a speed corresponding to about 70% VO2peak on a flat course on asphalt after which pain sensation
was assessed within the next three days and serial blood samples were collected for subsequent
measurement of creatine kinase (CK) concentration. Runners were then paired as closely as possible
for sex, maximal CK concentration, and VO2peak and one runner in each pair was randomly allocated to
either the active or placebo group. The active group was provided with capsules containing 50 mg
PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) and 100 mg pharmaceutical grade olive oil, and the control
group with 150 mg placebo capsules containing pharmaceutical grade olive oil, which were identical
in appearance to the active capsule. The fatty acid analyses of these capsules are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-oajsm-4-109">Table 1</xref>. The runners were asked to take eight capsules
(400 mg active substance) every day during the treatment period of 11 weeks. Following the
treatment, the 30 km run was repeated on the same course and at the same speed as the first run,
followed by the same regime of recording pain perception and blood collection. A single blind design
was employed, runners themselves being unaware of who was supplementing the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great
HealthWorks) or olive oil control capsules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>The treadmill protocol involved a stepwise increase in speed every 4 minutes, starting at 8.5 km
&#x000b7; hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with increments of 1.5 km &#x000b7; hour<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
and 30 seconds between increments until subjective exhaustion. During the rest periods, blood was
taken from an earlobe for determination of lactic acid concentration (Accutrend<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>
Lactate analyser; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Expired respiratory gas was analyzed using
a ZAN 680 spirometry system (JK Medical Systems Private Ltd; Chennai, India) and data, including
heart rate, were recorded for further computation during the last 30 seconds of each stage.</p><p>In order to measure CK blood plasma concentrations, a 20 microliter whole blood sample was taken
from an earlobe with the runner in a seated position, prior to the 30 km run, and again immediately
after, 24 hours, and 48 hours post run. Blood samples were analyzed using the Diaglobal test kit and
Vario Photometer DP 300 (Diaglobal GmbH; Berlin, Germany), calculated according to the
manufacturer&#x02019;s designated procedures.</p><p>Pain was measured using a scale of 0&#x02013;10; runners were asked to indicate which level best
represented pain intensity with 0 representing no pain and 10 indicating extremely severe pain. The
runners indicated the level of their pain verbally to one technician during a standardized slow
walking procedure in the laboratory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical procedures</title><p>Various models belonging to the class of general linear mixed models were explored, which allowed
us to compare the pretreatment to posttreatment changes in CK and DOMS in each group with adjustment
for the effects of pretreatment values of these variables as well as the CK before each run. In
exploring these models, we considered statistical adjustments for running speed and the number and
length of training sessions. We then excluded nonsignificant variables to employ a simplified model
to measure the interaction between the treatment and the time of measurement of DOMS and CK
(transformed by logarithm to satisfy linearity requirements). In taking the matched pairs into
account, this effectively allowed a comparison of the patterns of pretreatment to posttreatment
changes in DOMS and CK following the 30 km run in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) and
placebo groups.</p><p>Our simplified model had the form:</p><disp-formula id="fd1-oajsm-4-109"><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>DOMS&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;Ln&#x000a0;CK&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>km&#x000a0;run&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02013;</mml:mo><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>km&#x000a0;run&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Treatment</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Time</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Treatment&#x02009;</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x022c5;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>&#x02009;Time</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Weight</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Run&#x000a0;average&#x000a0;speed</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Random&#x000a0;pair</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Random&#x000a0;subject</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Residual&#x000a0;error</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><p>where the response (dependent) variable is the difference in DOMS (or LnCK) between the pre and

PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) and placebo groups in any of the physiological characteristics
associated with the maximal treadmill tests before the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Training</title><p>Training volumes and intensities during the 11 weeks were similar in both groups. Six runners in
each group averaged one to two training sessions per week; two in each group average two to three
sessions per week; and eight in each group ran an average of three or more sessions per week. One
runner in each group averaged less than 10 km per run; ten in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great

PCSO-524&#x000ae; group and six in the control performed more than 15 km on average per session. All
runners trained on a flat terrain.</p></sec><sec><title>DOMS</title><p>A summary of the runners&#x02019; DOMS is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-oajsm-4-109">Table 3</xref>. We analyzed the treatment effect in two ways. Firstly, on investigation of the
changes in DOMS following the pre and posttreatment 30 km runs, there was a significant reduction in
DOMS in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared
to the control group, after accounting for potentially confounding covariates as described above. As
illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oajsm-4-109">Figure 1</xref>, the PCSO-524&#x000ae;
(Great HealthWorks) treatment effect was a reduction of 1.1 units (standard error 0.41) on the
10-point scale.</p><p>Secondly, on comparing the responses of runners in the postsupplementation 30 km training run on
its own, again with appropriate adjustments, DOMS was lower in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great
HealthWorks) group than in the control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) during the 48 hour period
post run. This effect is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-oajsm-4-109">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Training was categorized according to training frequency into those who trained three or fewer
sessions per week, and those who trained four or more sessions per week. There was evidence of a
greater PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) treatment effect on DOMS in runners who trained less
frequently (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In runners who trained no more than three sessions a
week, the mean of DOMS in the postsupplementation run was 1.7 in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great
HealthWorks) group and 4.0 in the control. For runners who trained four or five sessions a week, the
mean of DOMS was 1.6 in both the treatment and control group.</p></sec><sec><title>CK concentration</title><p>The CK concentrations measured following the pre and posttreatment 30 km runs are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-oajsm-4-109">Table 4</xref>. In the study group as a whole, there was no
conclusive evidence of any PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) effect on CK levels
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1), although lower mean values (backtransformed from the logarithms
used in the statistical analyses) were apparent in the treatment group following the posttreatment
30 km run (367 versus 487 IU/L). Furthermore, similar to the situation for DOMS, the trend toward a
treatment effect on the maximal CK was more pronounced in the lesser trained runners. In runners who
trained three times a week or less, the median maximum CK level following the second 30 km run was
475 IU/L for PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) group, 31% lower than the control group where the
mean was 680 IU/L. In the runners who trained four or five sessions a week, the median value of
maximal CK after the second 30 km run was 284 IU/L for the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks)
group, this being 19% lower than in the control group where the median value was 349 IU/L. Taking
all values of both runs into account, the more highly trained runners had lower maximal
concentrations of CK (569 IU/L compared to 315 IU/L, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). There was a
significant relationship between DOMS and LnCK (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). A plot of the absolute
values is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oajsm-4-109">Figure 3</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding of the present study is a slight but significant reduction in pain sensation in
PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great Health-Works) treated nonprofessional distance runners following a 30 km
training run. More specifically, this effect was more pronounced in lesser trained runners.</p><p>Despite the fact that CK has long been associated with DOMS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-oajsm-4-109">12</xref> analysis of the CK levels following the postsupplementation 30 km
run did not reveal a PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) treatment effect, but closer analysis of
our data did provide some evidence of this effect. Firstly, the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great
HealthWorks) reduction of DOMS was accompanied by a relationship between DOMS and CK, suggesting the
plausibility of an elicited reduction in postrun CK. Secondly, the median maximal posttreatment CK
level was 25% lower in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) group than in the control; and
consistent with the DOMS data, this trend was more pronounced in the lesser trained runners. The
post treatment median CK in the lesser trained runners was 30% lower in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great
HealthWorks) group than in the control group; whereas the equivalent figure for the better trained
runners was 19%. Further investigation is required and a study design with greater statistical power
is necessary to gain a clearer picture of whether PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks)
supplementation can attenuate the efflux of CK from muscle cells, an effect generally associated
with reduced sarcomeric trauma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-oajsm-4-109">13</xref></p><p>Given that effects occurred relative to a control group that took placebo capsules of olive oil,
and comparing the differences in composition of the active and placebo capsules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-oajsm-4-109">Table 1</xref>), the likely candidates for the active
components of PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) are the &#x003c9;3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as each is known to possess anti-inflammatory
properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-oajsm-4-109">14</xref> These lipids have widespread
effects on human physiology, including down-regulating genes controlling inflammatory activity,
reducing lipid synthesis and stimulating its oxidation, and influencing cell membrane function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-oajsm-4-109">15</xref> There is also in vitro evidence of their
facilitatory effect on skeletal muscle regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-oajsm-4-109">16</xref> through inhibition of cytokine activity. The &#x003c9;3 fatty acids have also been shown
to influence psychological function, and currently there is interest in the role of EPA on
psychological mood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-oajsm-4-109">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-oajsm-4-109">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-oajsm-4-109">18</xref> Consequently,
apart from PCSO-524&#x000ae;&#x02019;s (Great HealthWorks) peripheral anti-inflammatory properties,
this raises the possibility that its effect on DOMS may have occurred, at least in part, through its
effect on the central nervous system. Last but not least, an enhancement of antioxidative enzymes
has to be taken into account when potential causal effects of PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks)
are considered. Recently, Schmidt et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-oajsm-4-109">20</xref> showed
altered expression of genes regulating antioxidative processes after supplementation with fish oil
in humans. If their interpretation holds, this effect may be of special meaning for the findings of
the present endurance study since mitochondria are the main source of endogenous oxidant
production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-oajsm-4-109">21</xref></p><p>Our findings must be viewed alongside two other studies, each of which provide little evidence
that EPA or any other component of fish oil or PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) itself were
effective in reducing DOMS or CK following muscular activity. Firstly, it was reported that fish oil
supplementation had no influence on DOMS induced by isokinetic eccentric elbow flexion, nor any
effect on the inflammatory markers CK, cytokines interleukin-6, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-109">7</xref> This might suggest that our finding that
PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) treatment effects DOMS was due to its unique variety of
lipids, but another, and indeed the only other published report on the effect of PCSO-524&#x000ae;
(Great HealthWorks) on DOMS provides little support for this premise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-109">19</xref> In that study, the exercise stress comprised intervals of downhill
running and 8 weeks of PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) supplementation, after which the
authors reported no statistically significant effects on DOMS, blood CK, myoglobin, or cytokine
levels. However, it is of interest to observe the graphically represented variations between the
active and placebo groups. Where minor trends of variation occurred in mean CK, interleukin-6,
interleukin-10, and myoglobin levels (in the post 24 hour post exercise period) and DOMS (in the
48&#x02013;96 hour period) the values were lower in the PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks)
supplemented group. Any interpretations of trends such as these are clearly tenuous, and are raised
as a point of interest given the findings of the current study and may again point to a need for
greater statistical power in studies concerning highly variable &#x02018;snapshots&#x02019; of blood
CK and subjective measurement of DOMS. Any further research on the effect of marine oil
supplementation should also consider other factors which may have influenced discordant results
between our study and the two cited works. These factors include the dose of PCSO-524&#x000ae;
(Great HealthWorks; in the current study was 400 mg/day for 11 weeks compared to 200 mg/day for 8
weeks in the previously mentioned study using this particular marine oil);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-109">19</xref> the age of the subjects (the two prior studies involved younger
groups with a mean age of 25 years); the nature and novelty of the exercise stress (the previous
studies employed unaccustomed downhill treadmill running intervals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-109">19</xref> or unaccustomed maximum eccentric arm flexor work),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-109">7</xref> as distinct from the sport and training specific
running exercise in the current study. It is notable that the non-specific protocols elicited CK
levels of about twice the magnitude and much greater range than in the current study, and presumably
greater DOMS, although direct comparison with these outcomes is problematical. Further research is
required to confirm our findings of the effectiveness of PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) in
offsetting DOMS in runners, and whether such a finding may be related to the training status, age,
familiarity with the exercise stimulus, intensity of the exercise stimulus, or dose.</p><p>As is typical, our study had its strong points as well as its limitations. The investigation of a
long training run rather than unaccustomed muscular activity was of direct practical relevance,
particularly to runners and coaches. The involvement of our statistical model that facilitated
adjustment for potentially confounding covariates and avoided the undesirable practice of multiple
time point comparisons was also a solid aspect of this study. On the other hand, the lack of
precision of measurement of the two primary outcome measures, DOMS and CK, was a limitation that
would tend to reduce the chances of finding significant effects. The DOMS estimate relied on the
consistency of each individual&#x02019;s perception and rating of pain following 30 km runs 11 weeks
apart and the three postrun plasma concentrations of a rapidly changing CK may not accurately or
reliably reflect released CK volumes. However, any potential inaccuracy and unreliability would
reduce the chances of finding a treatment effect, perhaps increasing confidence in our finding of an
effect on DOMS. Our single blind design was also not ideal, although neither of the main outcome
measures were reliant on personal judgment by any of our research teams so this fact should not have
influenced our results. Although speculative, upcoming studies should also take into account a
possible effect of olive oil itself on muscle soreness and, therefore, may consider a different
placebo. Finally, our participants were a group of predominantly male club runners of a median age
of 45, with a range of 30 years, and our conclusions may not apply to more accomplished and/or
younger runners, or indeed to athletes in other disciplines.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) supplementation
attenuated DOMS in a group of club runners following a 30 km training run, an effect which was
greater in lesser trained runners. This effect was accompanied by a trend towards lower postrun CK
concentrations in the supplemented group compared to the control group, this trend being consistent
with our findings that CK levels reflected DOMS. In addition to the generally accepted benefits of
increasing the intake of &#x003c9;3 fatty acid in western diets, our findings suggest that
PCSO-524&#x000ae; (Great HealthWorks) supplementation is likely to assist veteran age distance
runners recover from the muscular stress induced by long training runs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by a grant from PharmaLink International GmbH.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-oajsm-4-109"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruby</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bush-Joseph</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Muscle soreness and delayed-onset muscle
