In the majority of patients (about 70%), the disease is diagnosed in an advanced, non-resectable stage with a very poor outcome. The prognosis is highly associated with the metastatic behavior of the tumor. Metastatic spread is a complex process of molecular and phenotypical changes of tumor cells. In this process the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) seems to play a crucial role. During EMT cells reduce intercellular adhesions, lose polarity and acquire a fibroblastoid phenotype with high motility and invasive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This process is characterized by downregulation of E-cadherin and other epithelial molecules associated with cell adhesion. In parallel, an up-regulation of mesenchymal proteins, like vimentin and an increase of secretion of proteolytic enzymes, like matix-metalloproteinases (MMP), can be observed, contributing to the increase of cell motility, invasiveness and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In conclusion, EMT seems to play a key role in the progression of tumors towards invasion and metastasis. Among transcription factors inducing EMT and down regulation of E-cadherin, which represents the hallmark of EMT, the snail family of zing finger transcription factors, like SNAIL (SNAI1) and SLUG (SNAI2) play a prominent role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Overexpression of SNAI2/SLUG can be observed in a variety of different cancers and seems to be associated with poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In particular, SNAI2/SLUG is also a negative prognostic factor for relapse and overall survival in resectable, early stage lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In breast cancer cell lines, Ye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] could show that SNAI2/SLUG is suppressed by ligand-activation of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;). Several findings of this study indicate that SNAI2/SLUG is an estradiol- responsive gene and ER&#x003b1; may play an important role in EMT in breast cancer.</p><p>To further clarify the role of SNAI2/SLUG in lung cancer and in particular in the advanced setting, this study was conducted to examine the correlation with hormone receptor expression as well as different MMP along with the clinical outcome in Western patients with metastatic NSCLC, enrolled in a randomized first-line chemotherapy trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>For mRNA analysis, tumor biopsies of patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC enrolled in a randomized, multicenter first-line phase II trial and treated with docetaxel and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] were used. These samples were prospectively collected during this study. From a total of 88 randomized patients, tumor samples of 64 patients were available and of those 53 samples qualified for sufficient mRNA extraction and gene expression analysis.</p><p>Patients gave informed consent for the study including sample collection and analysis. Approval of the local ethic committees was obtained (leading ethics committee: Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Hessen). Standards of the International Conference on Harmonization World Health Organization (WHO) Good Clinical Practice were followed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample preparation and RNA extraction</title><p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained before the start of chemotherapy were collected. From each tumor block, a 5-&#x003bc;m section was stained with hematoxylin&#x02013;eosin (H&#x00026;E) and revised by a pathologist and two consecutive 10-&#x003bc;m sections were cut on a standard microtome, placed into individual tubes, and stored at 4&#x000b0;C for &#x02264;1&#x000a0;month until RNA extraction. Fully automated high-throughput RNA extraction has been carried out similar to methods previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] by using a fully automated XTRACT roboter and extraction kits (STRATIFYER Molecular Pathology GmbH, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Gene expression analysis using quantitative PCR</title><p>Expression of SLUG/SNAI2, MMP2, MMP7, MMP9, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and the normalization (housekeeping) gene CALM2 were assessed by one-step RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR). SuperScript &#x000ae; III Platinum &#x000ae; One-Step qRT-PCR System with ROX (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Experiments were carried out on a Stratagene Mx3005p (Agilent Technologies, B&#x000f6;blingen, Germany) with 30&#x000a0;min at 50&#x000b0;C, 2&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 40&#x000a0;cycles of 15&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000b0;C and 30&#x000a0;s at 60&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The expression of the genes of interest was calculated by using the &#x00394;C<sub>t</sub> method. Cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) values, which indicate the (interpolated) number of PCR cycles until the fluorescence reached its threshold, were determined. C<sub>t</sub> values were normalized by subtracting the C<sub>t</sub> value of the housekeeping gene (CALM2) from the C<sub>t</sub> value of the target gene (&#x00394;CT). RNA results were then reported as 40- &#x00394;C<sub>t</sub> values, which would correlate proportionally to the mRNA expression level of the target gene. For assessment of DNA contamination in RNA preparations, a PAEP gene-specific qPCR without preceding reverse transcription was carried out using the reagents from the SuperScript III&#x000ae; Platinum&#x000ae; One-Step qRT-PCR System with ROX and Taq DNA Polymerase. In samples with a C<sub>t</sub> value &#x0003c;35, the DNase I treatments were repeated to prevent effects on bispecific PCR assays. Stratagene human QPCR Reference total RNA (Stratagene, Waldbronn, Germany) was used as positive control for RTqPCR and human genomic DNA (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as positive control for qPCR. All PCR assays were carried out in triplicate, and the mean of triplicates was reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistics</title><p>The study was explorative. The median expression of genes (SNAI2/SLUG, MMP2, MMP7, MMP9 and ESR1) was used as an objective cut-off to distinguish high from low expression. Associations between gene expression values and clinicopathological data were compared and calculated with chi-square-tests. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the date of assignment until disease progression or death of any cause. Overall survival (OS) was measured from date of assignment until death of any cause. Time-to-event curves were calculated by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and the log-rank test was applied. The Cox regression model was used for the univariate and multivariate analyses. All P values were two-sided with P values &#x0003c;0.05 indicating statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed with WinSTAT software (Version 2009.1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>SNAI2/SLUG and MMP mRNA expression</title><p>SNAI2/SLUG mRNA expression could be evaluated in 49 patients and ranged between 28.01 and 41.70 with a median of 34.09 (&#x00394;C<sub>t</sub>).

They observed an EMT marker expression increase in 40% of patients and this correlated with poor outcome (disease free-survival).</p><p>In stage I NSCLC, EMT markers such as Twist and SNAI2/SLUG were associated with a worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In resected adenocarcinoma of the lung, Shih et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] could confirm the negative prognostic effect of SNAI2/SLUG expression measured by mRNA on survival and relapse. They also observed an increase of MMP2-mRNA expression in SNAI2/SLUG overexpressing tumors.</p><p>EMT in lung cancer is triggered by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. One of the most important characterized EMT-inducing oncogenic changes is the K-RAS mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, TGF-&#x003b2; and hypoxia inducing factor-2&#x003b1; (HIF-2&#x003b1;) are known EMT inducing intrinsic factors. Among extrinsic factors, hypoxia and inflammatory tumor microenvironment have to be mentioned.</p><p>Interestingly, tobacco smoking induced EMT through HDAC &#x02013;mediated down regulation of E-cadherin via up regulation of SNAI2/SLUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we could confirm the negative prognostic effect of SNAI2/SLUG expression in advanced lung cancer, indicating the prognostic effect of EMT. It has to be noticed that in comparison to previously published data on early stage operable patients, our cohort consisted of advanced or metastatic stages, so this phenomenon seems not only be restricted to early stage lung cancer.</p><p>In contrast to findings of Shih et al. and others groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we could not observe a correlation of SNAI2/SLUG and MMP 2 in our cohort. Probably this could be due to the limited patient number in our series. However, a difference in early stage and metastatic cancers has to be considered as a potential explanation for this observation.</p><p>One important finding of our study was the significant inverse correlation of SNAI2/SLUG and ESR1. This in line with results reported from breast cancer, where SNAI2/SLUG expression was evaluated in different ER-positive and ER negative cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; directly repressed transcription of SNAI2/SLUG by the formation of a complex of ligand-activated estrogen receptor-&#x003b1;, histone deacetylase 1 and nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>This phenomenon can also be observed in ovarian cancer. Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] could show, that E-Cadherin suppression and SNAI2/SLUG expression is mediated by estradiol and estrogen receptor alpha in ovarian cancer cell lines.</p><p>Our findings fit into the consistent overall picture that a distinct subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (ESR1 high expression tumors) has certain similarity and analogy to breast cancer, based on several epidemiologic and observational studies.</p><p>First, in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] we could show that ESR1 is an independent prognostic factor in metastatic NSCLC similar to breast cancer.</p><p>Second, the metastatic pattern/ and behavior of ESR1 positive lung cancer is similar to breast cancer, where bone metastases are associated with estrogen receptor positivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Third, SNAI2/SLUG is significantly inversely correlated with ESR1 expression and prognostic in analogy to breast cancer.</p><p>Furthermore, the strong inverse correlation of SNAI2/SLUG with ESR1 underlines and validates the prognostic relevance of ESR1 in lung cancer. As SNAI2/SLUG is one of the key factors for E-cadherin suppression and for EMT, which represents a more aggressive phenotype of cancer, the results seem reasonable.</p><p>With our data we cannot provide a proof that SNAI2/SLUG expression is directly triggered by the estrogen pathway and we cannot rule out that the strong inverse correlation of SNAI2/SLUG and ESR1 is determined by an independent pathway. However, the analogy to breast and ovarian cancer suggests that SNAI2/SLUG is an ER responsive gene in lung cancer as well.</p><p>Our results would have two implications in NSCLC patients. First, SNAI2/SLUG expression adds to the prognostic factors known in NSCLC, making it meaningful to stratify according to SNAI2/SLUG in future clinical trials. Additionally, it helps to identify patients with poor prognosis, who may be candidates for more aggressive therapies in the future. Second, based on the strong inverse correlation with ESR1 expression, SNAI2/SLUG expression and EMT in general should be studied in response to antihormonal treatment in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Taken together, our data confirm that, as for breast cancer, ESR1 expression in lung cancer is associated with the lower levels of EMT Markers. Therefore, the results warrant further evaluation of antihormonal treatment in a subgroup of patients with lung cancer (ESR1 high lung cancer) in analogy to ER/PR positive breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>SNAI2/SLUG is prognostic of patients&#x02019; outcome.
