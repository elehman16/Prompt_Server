Introduction</title><p>Pilonidal sinus is a common infectious process which occurs in buttocks and sacral area which involves a wide range of symptoms that are different from an asymptomatic sinus abscess to acute and chronic sinus track (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">De Parades, Bouchard, Janier, &#x00026; Berger, 2013</xref>). The disease was first described in 1833 by Mao. The disease occurs mostly in young adults and its incidence is 26 cases per 100,000 and in men is twice women, the peak incidence was between 15 and 24 years of age and rarely occurs after age 40 (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">McCallum, King, &#x00026; Bruce, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Raffas &#x00026; Hassam, 2013</xref>). The etiology of this disease is not fully understood, some are believed to be congenital in origin, and some consider it an acquired disease and the reason to this is that this condition can be seen in folds between the fingers of hairdressers and shepherds and dog trainers which can be due to the penetration of the hair as a foreign body and cause reactions in the subcutaneous tissue (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bradley, 2010a</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). Hull et al. have suggested that hair in this area come in clusters and like a drill bit into the skin and gradually in-depth down (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Hull &#x00026; Wu, 2002</xref>). Sondenna and et al. have proposed that during puberty, due to rapid growth gluteus muscles, distance of hair follicles, sebaceous glands and apocrine glands increases and this event increases the probability of foreign body entrance into the skin and causes holes, which is the precursor of the formation of pilonidal sinus (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Sondenaa et al., 1996</xref>). The sinuses are asymptomatic until they are not infectious and when they become infected the symptoms of intermittent pain, tenderness, and intermittent serous-purulent fluids manifest. Other manifestations include sinus abscess that is acute and is at the upper and outer left position than vents (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Chintapatla, Safarani, Kumar, &#x00026; Haboubi, 2003</xref>). Primarily non-surgical treatment for this disease is not recommended and is only recommended for patients who have the least symptoms such as hygiene sacrococcygeal region and shaving regional hair weekly. There are several methods for surgical treatment that the method should be appropriate for each individual with clinical features of the disease. The ideal treatment should be the minimum required hospitalization after surgery, be simple, with minimal pain, the patient soon returned to his work, minimal risk of complications and should be treated easily in case of the recurrence. Various therapeutic approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages are presented in recent years (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Rabie, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Sondenaa et al., 2002</xref>). In acute abscesses the treatment is as incision and drainage and elective mode of treatment for chronic pilonidal sinus as incision and primary repair, incision and flap (rotational - rhomboid and Z plasticizer), incision and leaving the wound open to repair secondary, due to prolonged wound healing and return to work in the classical surgery (open surgery) and according to the few studies in terms of comparing the two methods of primary repair and rotational flap, it is necessary to compare the two methods, so we aimed to conduct a comparative study between surgical primary repair and rotational flap in terms of factors, such as duration of hospitalization, the recurrence rate, rate of infection, itching or hematoma, the time period of sutures and wound dehiscence.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>The study design has been done as experimental clinical trial after research and ethics committee approval, patients with pilonidal sinus who had not previously undergone surgery for this disease were enrolled without limitations on age and sex. Chronic pilonidal sinus is defined as the presence of secretion and pain in sacrococcygeal region that is not formed abscess. The number of sample was 80. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 40. Diabetic and obese patients with underlying diseases and patients with acute pilonidal abscess or prior surgery were excluded. All patients before surgery their hair was removed by depilatory. In primary repair group, the skin after removal of affected area in sacrococcygeal area up to the posterior sacral fascia after making adequate hemostasis has attempted to repair with nylon 0.2, so that the edges are closer together. In rotational flap after resection of the affected area formed the subcutaneous skin flap with a proper pedicle flap in the proximal area and by turning the flap into defect area come closer with minimal tension. Antibiotics were administered to patients before and after surgery, but analgesics were administered as needed. Then, depending on the clinical status, patients discharged and the first and fourth weeks and 6 months postoperatively were visited and questionnaires were completed. For the analysis of the present study SPSS 16 software is used (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Rezaie et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3.

According to the results of the study, in terms of the complications after surgery, such as frequency of hematoma and seroma, wound infection, itching, recurrence and hospitalization time there was no significant difference between the two rotational flap method and primary repair. The results of Okus et al. study (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Okus, 2012)</xref> in 2012 on 49 patients with flap and 44 patients underwent primary repair surgery in terms of mean age (25 years) and no recurrence during 6-month follow-up in both group and one case of wound infection in the primary repair group was consistent.
