Therefore, it is important to further define the influence of type 2 diabetes on these enzymes. The LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) trial includes over 9000 subjects with type 2 diabetes who are randomized to receive liraglutide or placebo. The purpose of the current study is to assess baseline amylase and lipase activity in the LEADER population. We believe that this is the largest study of lipase and amylase activity in subjects with type 2 diabetes.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects and Study Design</title><p>The LEADER trial is an international double-blind placebo-controlled trial currently evaluating the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT01179048). There are 9340 subjects with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events (with or without existing cardiovascular disease) enrolled at 410 centers worldwide and randomized 1:1 to liraglutide or placebo. Subjects will be followed for a minimum of 3.5 years.</p><p>Baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in LEADER have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Briefly, subjects with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk who were either drug-naive or treated with 1 or more antihyperglycemic drugs were screened. Subjects treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors were excluded. Medical history, including history of pancreatitis and/or gallstone disease, was obtained. Enrollment of subjects with severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR &#x0003c;30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was limited to a maximum of 220, whereas no similar limit was applied to subjects with moderately reduced eGFR (30&#x02013;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). After a 2-week run-in phase, subjects were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive either liraglutide (0.6 mg up to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg) once daily or equivalent placebo as an add-on to their baseline treatment. After randomization, study visits occur at months 1, 3, and 6 and every 6 months thereafter until termination of the trial. Subjects are followed for up to 5 years. Secondary and safety end points include, among others, the incidence of acute pancreatitis, acute gallstone disease, and changes in serum lipase and amylase. Enrollment commenced in September 2010 and was completed in April 2012. Each enrolling center&#x02019;s institutional review board approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipase and Amylase Screening and Monitoring</title><p>Lipase and amylase activity is measured at baseline and months 6 and 12. Assessments are to be repeated annually (for up to 5 years) until termination of the trial, with a final measurement at the end of treatment. Serum pancreatic lipase and total amylase activity is measured in the fasting state in all subjects using an enzymatic colorimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) performed by a central laboratory (ICON PLC, Dublin, Ireland). None of the subjects had symptoms suggesting acute pancreatitis at the time of baseline blood drawing. The ULN for this assay is set at 63 U/L for lipase and 100 U/L for amylase. Neither limit is adjusted for subjects with type 2 diabetes. Per protocol, more frequent measurements of lipase and amylase activity are to be conducted locally in cases of persistent severe abdominal pain leading to a suspicion of acute pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The distribution of both lipase and amylase values was right-skewed; therefore a logarithmic transformation was applied before analysis. Explanatory factors were prespecified and included sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, race, duration of diabetes, glycemic control (HbA1c), diabetes pretreatment, eGFR (modified diet in renal disease formula), autoimmune disease, thyroid disease, lipid levels, and use of certain medications (proton pump inhibitors, &#x003b2;-blockers, H2 receptor antagonists, and glucocorticoids). A multivariable linear normal analysis of covariance model was created, with the logarithmically transformed lipase and amylase values as dependent variables. The effect of each covariate was first derived on the log scale and then exponentially transformed to obtain an interpretation as relative activity of lipase and amylase. Effects of each factor are therefore adjusted to the set of all other factors and expressed in relative terms, with an effect equal to 1.0 representing &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; (also expressed as percent change = 0%).

The proportions of subjects with elevated serum lipase (16.6%) and amylase (11.8%) activity were consistent with findings from previous reports in type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and elevations above 3 times the ULN were seen in 1.2% of subjects for lipase and 0.2% for amylase. To our knowledge, this is the largest study (N = 9340) of lipase and amylase activity in a population of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Logistic regression indicated that worsening eGFR was the most prominent factor influencing lipase and amylase activity. An eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to CKD stage 4&#x02013;5) was associated with higher serum lipase and amylase activity and greater proportions of subjects with elevations in either enzyme, findings recognized in other studies.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, of those subjects with normal renal function (eGFR &#x02265;90 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), 12.2% had elevated levels of lipase and 7.7% had elevated levels of amylase activity. Other factors shown to have a smaller impact on either increasing or decreasing lipase or amylase activity included certain drugs (proton pump inhibitors, insulin, and oral antihyperglycemics), BMI, HbA1c level, age, and race. Risk factors, known to be associated with pancreatitis, such as a history of pancreatitis or gallstones, did not seem to affect baseline activity of either lipase or amylase. Other environmental factors such as alcohol intake and smoking have been described as risk factors for the development of pancreatitis.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Although a history of alcohol consumption was not systematically collected for the present population, smoking was analyzed and did not have an independent effect on pancreatic enzyme activity.</p><p>It is unclear why lipase and amylase activity is elevated in a significant portion of subjects with type 2 diabetes. To understand these findings, the complex physiologic nature of these biochemical markers requires comment. It is known that there are many sources of amylase and lipase in the human body. Amylase exists in 2 isoenzyme forms: p-amylase (mostly originating from the pancreas) and s-amylase (mostly originating from the salivary glands). However, other sources in the body can contain various mixtures of both forms, including the fallopian tubes, thyroid, small intestine, liver, placenta, testis, skeletal muscle, and spleen, as well as various tumors.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the asymptomatic subject, serum amylase is made up of a mixture of p-amylase (approximately 40%) and s-amylase (approximately 60%). In acute pancreatitis, the predominant isoenzyme in the serum is p-amylase. However, p-amylase level has been reported to be markedly elevated in other nonpancreatic acute conditions such as ovarian cyst rupture.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Several types of lipase are also present in the human body, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatic, endothelial, and muscle.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The pancreas itself contain several different lipases, including pancreatic triglyceride lipase, pancreatic lipase-related proteins 1 and 2, carboxyl ester lipase, and phospholipase A2.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> It is generally assumed that basal serum lipase is of pancreatic origin. However, the actual proportion of basal serum lipase from other sources is unknown. The lipase assay in LEADER uses colipase and bile salts and hence is thought to be specific for pancreatic lipase activity. However, some experts question whether these assays can truly distinguish pancreatic from nonpancreatic lipases (personal communication: Mark Lowe, MD, PhD, vice-chairman and professor of pediatrics at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine).</p><p>Lipase and amylase are synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cell, packaged in zymogen granules, and thought to reach the blood stream by leakage of these enzymes from the basal lateral membrane of the acinus into the surrounding capillaries or via the pancreatic lymph with drainage through the thoracic duct.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Secretory studies in animals and humans demonstrate an effect of a high-carbohydrate or high-fat diet on the composition of amylase and lipase in these granules.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, it is unknown whether fasting or food consumption has an effect on levels of serum activity for either enzyme. Amylase is filtered by the renal glomerulus and excreted into urine where it can be measured. Lipase is also filtered at the glomerulus but almost completely reabsorbed by the renal tubules, leaving negligible amounts of lipase in the urine.<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Rat studies suggest that amylase, and particularly lipase, is degraded by the renal tubules; however, there are no data on this process in humans.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>Given the limited knowledge on the origins and excretion/degradation of serum amylase and lipase, there are several possible explanations for elevated activity in the diabetic population. Our data confirm prior observations that reduced eGFR raises serum lipase and amylase activity. Possible mechanisms include reduced glomerular filtration, a change in tubular reabsorption, degradation of the enzymes, or all of these factors. It should be noted, however, that reduced eGFR does not affect both enzymes equally. In the group with eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (CKD stage 4&#x02013;5), amylase activity alone was elevated in 11%, lipase activity alone was elevated in 19.8%, and both were elevated in 15.3% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">4</xref>). Neither these findings nor our finding that more than one half of the subjects with eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> had normal lipase and amylase activity can be explained on the basis of known mechanisms.</p><p>It is unclear what is driving elevated lipase and amylase activity unrelated to kidney function (12% and 7% of the entire cohort, respectively). Subclinical pancreatic inflammation may be one explanation. Prior studies suggest that subclinical chronic pancreatitis may be increased in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In an asymptomatic diabetes population, Hardt and colleagues<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> showed that 35% (compared with 18% in controls) of subjects with diabetes had a low fecal elastase concentration, which is thought to be a marker of pancreatic insufficiency or chronic pancreatitis. One autopsy study revealed that subjects with diabetes had a greater level of pancreatic fibrosis and evidence of chronic pancreatitis than controls.<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> However, if pancreatic inflammation explained the enzyme elevations, it might be expected that lipase and amylase activity would be elevated to a similar degree. Nevertheless, our data, as well as that from others,<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> indicate that lipase activity elevations predominate over amylase in the percentage of subjects affected. In addition, amylase activity is elevated about 25% of the time without an elevation in lipase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">4</xref>).</p><p>Because amylase and lipase come from other potential sites (gastric, hepatic, endothelial, muscle), it is possible that these serum enzymes in diabetes may originate in areas other than the pancreas. It is also possible that diabetes&#x02014;or the drugs that subjects with type 2 diabetes take&#x02014;may cause changes in the secretion or excretion/degradation of these enzymes by the kidney that may also lead to elevations. An increased glucose concentration, as found in poorly controlled diabetes or ketoacidosis, has previously been reported to affect enzyme activity<sup><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>; however, this finding in relation to HbA1c could not be confirmed.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In our population, a higher HbA1c was related to higher lipase but lower amylase activity. The impact of confounding risk factors that may be present and more common in a type 2 diabetes population, such as cholelithiasis or hypertriglyceridemia, also does not provide a clear picture. Although some of these factors showed significant associations due to the large sample size in LEADER, the effect sizes were small and presented no consistent trend (eg, HbA1c).</p><p>The present study is strengthened by its robust sample size, consisting of the largest study to date of lipase and amylase in a type 2 diabetes population. On the other hand, LEADER specifically enrolled subjects at high cardiovascular risk, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. However, there is no reason to expect that cardiovascular disease per se would change pancreatic enzyme activity. Furthermore, similar elevations in lipase and amylase were noted in other studies that did not specifically include subjects at high cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our study measured total amylase and not pancreatic (p-) amylase; thus different findings may have resulted from use of this assay. Others have in fact measured p-amylase in subjects with diabetes and found that 6% had an elevation, approximately one half that of our results.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that among subjects with type 2 diabetes, 16.6% had elevated lipase (including 1.2% that have a greater than 3-fold elevation) and 11.8% had elevated amylase activity (0.2% &#x0003e;3-fold elevated). Although it may be the single most important parameter responsible for some of the elevations, reduced kidney function is not responsible for most. Other significant causes remain unknown. Because pancreatic enzyme elevations (especially a 3-fold elevation) are crucial for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (along with significant upper abdominal pain and positive imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or abdominal ultrasound),<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> it is important for the gastroenterologist to be aware of the pitfalls of these laboratory studies in subjects with diabetes. In addition, certain antidiabetic drugs such as GLP-1 receptor agonists may raise pancreatic enzymes above baseline, further confusing the enzyme picture.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important for the clinician to pay extra attention to clinical symptoms and imaging in the diabetic population when considering the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Dr Mark Lowe for his expertise and input in this work.
