First proposed by Engel (1977) the biopsychosocial model acknowledges biological processes but also highlights the importance of experiential and psychological factors in pain. The famous gate control theory of pain[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] also proposed that the brain plays a dynamic role in pain perception as opposed to being a passive recipient of pain signals. They suggested psychological factors can inhibit or enhance sensory flow of pain signals and thus influence the way brain ultimately responds to painful stimulation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] If mind processes can change the way the brain processes pain then this holds tremendous potential for psychological intervention to produce reduced pain signals from the brain.</p><p>Kabat-Zinn's <italic>et al</italic>. (1986) described the process of pain reduction in his paper on mindfulness and meditation. The process of pain reduction occurred by &#x0201c;an attitude of detached observation toward a sensation when it becomes prominent in the field of awareness and to observe with similar detachment the accompanying but independent cognitive processes which lead to evaluation and labeling of the sensation as painful, as hurt.&#x0201d; Thus, by &#x0201c;uncoupling&#x0201d; the physical sensation, from the emotional and cognitive experience of pain, the patient is able to reduce the pain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The patients&#x02019; descriptions of distraction from pain, identifying maladaptive coping strategies toward pain and heightened awareness of pain sensation leading to behavioral changes are examples of how pain is unassociated with emotion, cognition, and sensation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Therefore recently these theories attracted several researchers who are working on pain.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-8-128-g001"/></fig><p>Mindfulness meditation has roots in Buddhist Vipassana philosophy and practice and has been independently adopted within clinical psychology in Western societies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recently in Netherlands Veehof <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a systematic review of controlled and noncontrolled studies on effectiveness of acceptance-based interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction program, acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain. Primary outcomes measured were pain intensity and depression. Secondary outcomes measured were anxiety, physical well-being and quality of life.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Twenty-two studies randomized controlled studies clinical controlled studies without randomization and noncontrolled studies were included totaling 1235 patients with chronic pain. An effect size on pain of (0.37) was found in the controlled studies. The effect on depression was (0.32). The authors concluded that ACT and mindfulness interventions had similar effects to other cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions and that these types of interventions may be a useful alternative or adjunct to current therapies. Chiesa and Serretti also conducted another systematic review on 10 mindfulness interventions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The main findings were that these interventions produced small nonspecific effects in terms of reducing chronic pain and symptoms of depression. When compared to active control groups (support and education) no additional significant effects were noted.</p><p>In summary, there is a need for further studies into the specific effects of mindfulness studies on chronic pain. Regarding as the researcher knowledge efficacy of mindfulness has not been explored on quality of life of chronic pain patients in Iran. The authors aimed to examine the impact of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) protocol designed for pain management on quality of life and pain of a homogeneous sample of females with nonspecific chronic LBP (NSCLBP) in comparison of the usual medical care group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sampling</title><p>Out of initial female samples aged 30&#x02013;45 (<italic>n</italic> = 155) who diagnosed as chronic NSLBP by physicians in physiotherapy centers of Ardebil-Iran at least 6 months before.

Four items are reverse scored. Summed raw scores in the eight domains are transformed to convert the lowest possible score to zero and the highest possible score to 100.

Breathing exercise distract their mind from pain to breathing and mindful living made them aware about maladaptive coping strategies.</p><p>In the first session, information given about the fundamentals of mindfulness, describing the mindfulness supporting attitudes included being nonjudgmental toward thought, emotions or sensations as they arise, patience, nonstriving, compassion, acceptance and curiosity gave them a wisdom and believe that they are suffering from painful thoughts more than the pain itself.</p><p>Furthermore, during body scan practice they learned to see their real body conditions, as it truly was, without trying to change the reality. Accepting their chronic illness condition helped them see the other possible abilities in their social and emotional roles. In fact the body scan practice helped them change the relationship with their body and pain. Through direct experience in body scan, one realizes the interconnection between the state of the mind and the body, and thereby increases patients&#x02019; self-control over their life. Mindful living techniques also improved their quality of life by teaching them to pay more attention to their daily life necessities, which led to the experience of subtle positive emotions, like peace and joy, self-esteem and confidence. Furthermore, they appreciated positive things. Once they learned to see the persistent pain objectively and observe other sensations in their body, they applied the same principles through mindful living techniques in their everyday life. As a result, they learned how to manage their health and began to engage in their duties mindfully.</p><p>A number of research studies such as Plews-Ogan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Grossman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Sephton <italic>et al</italic>., (2007)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed effectiveness of mindfulness meditation program on quality of life of patients with chronic pain conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>All together the result of this study and previous studies highlighted the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatment for patients with chronic LBP.
