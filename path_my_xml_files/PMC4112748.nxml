Frovatriptan and rizatriptan are antimigraine agents belonging to the triptan class. Although previous studies have independently compared the efficacy of these agents, contemporaneous data examining both pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and efficacy in parallel have not previously been available.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this single-center double-blind study, 18 subjects (ten female) were treated for a single migraine attack with frovatriptan 2.5 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg. Plasma concentrations were measured predose and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after drug administration. The primary end point of this study was to evaluate the association between PK parameters and efficacy measures and recurrence rate. Secondary end points were pain-free and pain-relief episodes at 2 and 4 hours, recurrent episodes within 48 hours, and cumulative hazard of recurrence within 72 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, approximately 17% of patients had mild migraine, while 83% had moderate&#x02013;severe migraine. Although the time to maximum concentration was similar for both drugs (2.7 versus 2.3 hours), the terminal half-life for frovatriptan was longer than rizatriptan (29.3 versus 3.2 hours, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). The proportion of patients who were pain-free at 4 hours without rescue medication was higher in the frovatriptan-treated group, (38.9 versus 5.6%, <italic>P</italic>=0.045). The cumulative hazard of recurrence over 72 h was reduced by frovatriptan compared to rizatriptan-treated patients (log-rank test, <italic>P</italic>=0.04). Pain-free and pain-relief episodes for the study period were positively correlated with the concentration:maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) ratio for frovatriptan (<italic>r</italic>=0.52, <italic>P</italic>=0.028), but not rizatriptan. Recurrence rate was negatively correlated with the concentration:C<sub>max</sub> ratio for both frovatriptan (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.96, <italic>P</italic>=0.0024) and rizatriptan (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.98, <italic>P</italic>=0.0004). Fewer adverse events were observed for frovatriptan compared to rizatriptan (one versus eight, <italic>P</italic>=0.021).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study indicates that a similar extent of initial pain relief is afforded by both triptans in migraine treatment. The longer duration of action of frovatriptan parallels and correlates with its PK profile.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>headache</kwd><kwd>migraine</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>frovatriptan</kwd><kwd>rizatriptan</kwd><kwd>rescue medication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Migraine is a common painful neurological disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide.<xref rid="b1-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, and typically characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate-to-severe headache lasting 4&#x02013;72 hours.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Other common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, photo- and/or phonophobia and neurological aura symptoms.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although nonpharmacological therapies have been shown to offer symptom relief in the pediatric population,<xref rid="b3-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> current guidelines recommend the use of pharmacological therapies as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate migraine in adults.<xref rid="b5-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Triptans are a class of selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1B/1D agonists with proven efficacy for the treatment of acute migraine.<xref rid="b6-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The early success of the parent drug of this class, sumatriptan, led to the development of other triptan compounds, with the aim of optimizing pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, efficacy, and safety in migraine treatment.<xref rid="b7-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Triptans differ markedly in terms of their PK and pharmacodynamic properties.

Patients included both male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years, with a current history of migraine with or without aura, according to International Headache Society (IHS) 2004 criteria, and with at least one but no more than six migraine attacks per month in the 6 months prior to entering the study.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients could not be enrolled in the study if they had: 1) uncontrolled hypertension; 2) ischemic heart disease; 3) cardiac arrhythmias or symptomatic Wolff&#x02013;Parkinson&#x02013;White syndrome; 4) previous stroke or transient ischemic attack; 5) severe liver or renal impairment; 6) any other severe or disabling medical condition; 7) a history of alcohol, analgesic, or psychotropic drug abuse; 8) known hypersensitivity to study drugs; 9) previously demonstrated inadequate response to at least two triptans; 10) current use of propranolol or ergotamine (and its derivatives) as a prophylactic agent; 11) current use or use in the previous 2 weeks of monoamine oxidase inhibitors; 12) use of either test medication to treat any one of the last three episodes of migraine; and 13) other headaches that had lasted for more than 6 days (at the time of presentation for the study). Patients were permitted to continue with concomitant medications during the trial if prescribed for concomitant illnesses. Ideally, doses were kept stable during the study, but if a change in the concomitant medications and/or doses was considered essential for medical reasons, these measures were recorded in the case-report form and patient diary.</p><p>Where possible, the dose of any prophylactic medication remained unchanged throughout the study period. During the blood-sampling time, paracetamol was preferred as a concomitant medication for the treatment of headache. Where indicated, emergency medication could be administered at any time during the trial. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers were excluded as well, while women with childbearing potential but not practicing an effective method of birth control were to be submitted to a pregnancy test, if clinically indicated. The study was approved by the independent institutional review boards of the study center, was performed in accordance with IHS guidelines, and was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their inclusion into the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blind, single-dose, balanced, two-sequence, two-period, two-treatment, randomized crossover design with at least 14 days of washout between the two treatments. Each patient received 2.5 mg frovatriptan and 10 mg rizatriptan in a balanced computer-generated randomized sequence (1:1), where frovatriptan was followed by rizatriptan or vice versa. Blinding was ensured by preparing identical capsules containing frovatriptan or rizatriptan. The duration of the study varied between subjects, depending on the interval between screening and the first migraine attack and between the two migraine attacks. However, patients were instructed to go to the clinic as soon as a migraine attack occurred (and to take study medication as soon as possible after migraine occurrence).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>The safety of medications administered during the trial was monitored by recording in the patient&#x02019;s diary all AEs occurring during each period of treatment.

A 10 mL blood sample was collected from an indwelling catheter and allowed to clot at 2&#x000b0;C&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C without any anticoagulant.

One event was reported during frovatriptan treatment compared to eight during rizatriptan treatment (relative risk 2.4, confidence interval 1.39&#x02013;4.1; <italic>P</italic>=0.021). The majority of AEs (seven events) were of mild or moderate intensity, and no serious AEs were reported during the study.

A marked difference was observed in the <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> between frovatriptan (29.3 hours) compared to rizatriptan (3.24 hours). These two distinct PK profiles are already established.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Frovatriptan has been shown to have a <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of approximately 26 hours, which was not affected by sex, dose, or mode of administration.<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Other studies have shown similar <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> for frovatriptan, which varied slightly due to age and/or sex.<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In contrast, rizatriptan has been shown to have an extremely fast plasma elimination <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>, typically ranging between 2 and 2.5 hours, corroborating findings observed in the present report.<xref rid="b15-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Frovatriptan has distinctive pharmacologic features compared with other triptans, which make it particularly well suited to patients with prolonged migraines and those suffering migraine recurrence.<xref rid="b9-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b26-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, due to the lack of inhibitory or inducing effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, frovatriptan retains a low risk of drug interactions, and dosage adjustment is unlikely to be warranted. This is particularly relevant, since combination treatment of frovatriptan with analgesic drugs is sometimes required. Although the number of subjects in our study was small, our safety analysis replicated the findings in other studies in which frovatriptan exhibited a favorable tolerability profile that was often better than comparator triptans.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As expected, both drugs also gradually decreased migraine-related symptoms, as was also previously observed.<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>It is worth noting that sex-specific differences were observed for frovatriptan, for some PK parameters examined, but not for rizatriptan. Female subjects had significantly higher C<sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values compared to male subjects. These sex-specific effects have also been observed in previous findings in healthy adults and adolescent migraineurs.<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This difference has mainly been attributed to greater bioavailability in females compared to male subjects, in addition to a higher volume of distribution and clearance in males.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Regardless, these PK sex-specific differences for frovatriptan do not have any clinically significant effect, in terms of efficacy or safety, since frovatriptan has an extremely wide therapeutic window, and thus no dosage adjustment was deemed necessary.<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Supporting this, our findings also demonstrated that the activity of frovatriptan in terms of clinical benefit was similar between males and females.</p><p>Comparing efficacy of the two drugs in the present study, we did not see any difference between the two agents at 2 hours, but did observe a higher pain-free rate at 4 hours. Other head-to-head trials comparing frovatriptan to another triptan in migraineurs have observed similar extent of benefit afforded by frovatriptan.<xref rid="b19-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, pain-relief rates at 2 hours (ranging between 40% and 50%) were similar for both drugs and also corroborate previous findings.<xref rid="b19-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These data, collectively, indicate that the extended duration of effect associated with frovatriptan does not come at the expense of a slower onset of action. We also demonstrated that the frequency of pain-free episodes and pain-relief rates were directly correlated with the PK profile of frovatriptan. In addition to providing acute benefit, in terms of pain-free episodes, frovatriptan also significantly reduced recurrent episodes within 48 hours compared to rizatriptan. Recurrent episodes within 48 hours have typically lower incidence, ranging from 20% to 30% for frovatriptan compared to 43% for rizatriptan,<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> 44% for almotriptan,<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and 50% for zolmitriptan.<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The numerical differences in recurrence rates at 24 and 48 hours also suggest that beneficial effects on recurrence might also have been seen with frovatriptan with a larger sample size.</p><p>The difference in PK profile as seen by the concentration:C<sub>max</sub> ratio (%) for frovatriptan and rizatriptan from 4 to 72 hours was shown to correlate negatively with recurrence rate. Our findings reinforce the association observed between recurrence rate and PK activity (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) of various triptans, previously documented by G&#x000e9;raud et al,<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> but a small sample size hampered the strength of our analysis. Although our findings indicated that PK activity may be an important factor in determining frequency of migraine recurrence, this continues to be an extremely complex physiological phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by PK activity.<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> While it is important not to overestimate the clinical importance of different PK profiles of triptans,<xref rid="b27-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> previous evidence,<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> including the present report, points toward the need for additional trials with greater sample sizes and with well-defined end points.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The main limitation of the present study was the small sample size. This study was slightly underpowered due to the exclusion of seven patients, as they had not experienced a migraine attack within 3 months, as planned in the protocol. A larger sample size would have permitted a multivariate approach to determine more precisely the cause&#x02013;effect relationship between PK profile and drug effect (ie, antimigraine outcome measures). Regardless, even with the small sample size, secondary efficacy measures (eg, pain-free and pain-relief rates and rate of recurrence) were similar to other previously published studies.<xref rid="b19-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additional time points for secondary measures and a slightly longer follow-up period would have been desired. Although the predominant analgesic effect was attributed to triptan use, it should also be taken into account that in some subjects treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs was required, as planned in the protocol, which may have contributed in part to pain relief. Regardless, the double-blind, randomized, crossover design controlled for these and other potential confounders. A second potential weakness of the present study was the fact that PK parameters were measured from plasma samples and not whole blood. Since rizatriptan (and subsequent PK parameters) is normally assayed from plasma,<xref rid="b15-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> we also specifically assayed frovatriptan in the same manner, since this was a crossover design. However, this could be particularly relevant for frovatriptan, since it is recognized to bind to red blood cells (60% reversibly bound at steady states), thus potentially compromising assays performed exclusively in plasma.<xref rid="b28-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, values for different PK parameters measured in the present study were well within the normal range for those described using whole blood,<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-983" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> arguing that the plasma versus whole blood difference (particularly for frovatriptan) does not appear to cause an observable effect, at least at the doses used in the present study.</p><p>Finally, we included a limited PK sampling schedule in our study with the intention of correlating plasma levels and efficacy at selected time points. This meant that we were unable to fully define the PK profiles of both drugs, and particularly for rizatriptan, the shape of our observed curve suggested that T<sub>max</sub> would have occurred earlier than our first sample time (2 hours). While this is a limitation for a pure PK analysis, it does not necessarily undermine the conclusions we have drawn from the PK efficacy correlations. Indeed, an earlier T<sub>max</sub> and higher true C<sub>max</sub> for rizatriptan would result in even lower concentration:C<sub>max</sub> ratios for rizatriptan and so magnify further the differences between the two agents.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to specifically examine both the PK profile and therapeutic efficacy of two pharmacokinetically distinct triptans in parallel. Findings from the present pilot study confirmed the expected clinical activity of the two drugs on a target population and confirm previously published PK characteristics. Although both frovatriptan and rizatriptan displayed similar PK activity in the early phase (0&#x02013;4 hours), marked differences in activity were observed in the intermediate period after dosing, particularly 4&#x02013;24 hours, where the longer <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of frovatriptan and the persistence of its active plasma concentrations may explain its better performance at later time points. This time period (4&#x02013;24 hours) coincided with improved efficacy by frovatriptan in terms of reduction of migraine attacks and reduction of migraine recurrence compared to rizatriptan. PK parameters were also found to be associated with pain-free and pain-relief episodes, in addition to migraine recurrence. Results from the present trial support the use of frovatriptan over rizatriptan, particularly in patients suffering from relapse and/or migraines of longer duration. Patient-reported AEs and drug-related AEs were lower in patients treated with frovatriptan compared to rizatriptan. A further trial with a larger pool of patients will help confirm the results obtained in the present study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The present study was supported by Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA, Luxembourg.
