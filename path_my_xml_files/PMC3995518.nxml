Footwear modifications and foot orthoses are widely used in clinical practice to treat this condition, but their effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated. This article describes the design of a randomised trial comparing the effectiveness of rocker-sole footwear and individualised prefabricated foot orthoses in reducing pain associated with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eighty people with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis will be randomly allocated to receive either a pair of rocker-sole shoes (MBT&#x000ae; Matwa, Masai Barefoot Technology, Switzerland) or a pair of individualised, prefabricated foot orthoses (Vasyli Customs, Vasyli Medical&#x02122;, Queensland, Australia). At baseline, the biomechanical effects of the interventions will be examined using a wireless wearable sensor motion analysis system (LEGSys&#x02122;, BioSensics, Boston, MA, USA) and an in-shoe plantar pressure system (Pedar&#x000ae;, Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany). The primary outcome measure will be the pain subscale of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ), measured at baseline and 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include the function, footwear and general foot health subscales of the FHSQ, severity of pain and stiffness at the first metatarsophalangeal joint (measured using 100 mm visual analog scales), global change in symptoms (using a 15-point Likert scale), health status (using the Short-Form-12&#x000ae; Version 2.0 questionnaire), use of rescue medication and co-interventions to relieve pain, the frequency and type of self-reported adverse events and physical activity levels (using the Incidental and Planned Activity Questionnaire).

In 2013, it was estimated that 1.9 million people in Australia had OA, and that this figure is expected to increase to 3 million people by 2032 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although the knee is the most commonly affected lower limb region, foot involvement is also common. The most commonly affected region of the foot is the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ), with radiographic changes evident in 12 to 35% of people aged over 35&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The population prevalence of symptomatic radiographic first MTPJ OA (i.e. both radiographic changes and associated symptoms) in people aged over 50&#x000a0;years has recently been estimated as 7.8%, with a higher prevalence observed in women, older people, and those from lower socio-economic classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>People with first MTPJ OA typically present with symptoms of pain and stiffness in their big toe joint that increase with activity. Because the first MTPJ plays an important role in the transfer of the body during the propulsive phase of gait, people with first MTPJ OA will often adopt an apropulsive walking pattern with a shortened step length and longer stance phase duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], accompanied by excessive knee and hip flexion or hip circumduction to assist the transfer of the swing limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and decreased loading of the first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In our recently completed comparison of 43 cases and 43 controls, we found that symptomatic first MTPJ OA was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire and the physical function and subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, Abhishek <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that great toe pain is associated with lower scores on the health satisfaction and psychological domains of the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and a recent population-based study found that 72% of people with symptomatic first MTPJ OA report disabling symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Many patients with first MTPJ OA seek surgical treatment for their condition. A clinical audit of 785 cases of foot surgery in Australia between July 1995 and June 1996 revealed surgery for this condition to be the fourth most common procedure performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, a population-based study of 6,956 inpatients in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] indicated that these procedures accounted for 15% of all foot and ankle procedures. Our recent analysis of the Medicare Benefits Schedule database indicated that between 1997 and 2006, over 46,000 private sector surgical procedures for treatment of first MTPJ disorders (hallux valgus and hallux rigidus) were subsidised under Medicare, at a direct cost of approximately $2&#x000a0;M per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These costs, however, are an underestimate of the total economic impact of the condition. The 2013 Deloitte Access Economics analysis indicated that treatment expenses for OA accounted for only 17% of the total cost of the disease, the remaining costs being attributed to burden of disease and productivity losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology of first MTPJ OA is not fully understood. Increased age, previous trauma, family history and a flat foot are commonly reported as contributing factors in the literature, but few studies have been undertaken to examine this in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is, however, evidence that certain structural characteristics of the foot are more common in those with first MTPJ OA compared to controls. Our recent systematic review concluded that people with first MTPJ OA were more likely to exhibit a dorsiflexed first metatarsal relative to the second metatarsal, a plantarflexed forefoot on the rearfoot, reduced first MTPJ joint range of motion, a longer proximal phalanx, distal phalanx, medial and lateral sesamoids, and a wider first metatarsal and proximal phalanx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although temporal relationships cannot be inferred from such studies, it has been hypothesised that as a result of this altered foot structure, the first metatarsal is less able to plantarflex during propulsion to allow the proximal phalanx to dorsally rotate on the first metatarsal head, resulting in dorsal joint compression of the first MTPJ. Over time, this process results in cartilage damage, exposure of subchondral bone, juxta-articular sclerosis, and the formation of a dorsal osteophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Conservative treatment of first MTPJ OA involves measures to obtain pain relief (including anti-inflammatory medications and intra-articular injections), physical therapy to maintain range of motion, and footwear and foot orthoses to modify foot function. Surgical management may involve removal of the dorsal exostosis, insertion of a joint implant, or, in advanced cases, fusion of the first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, despite the high prevalence of first MTPJ OA and its impact on quality of life, very few of these treatments have been rigorously evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with more advanced disease, post-surgical complications such as transfer lesions, forefoot pain, malunion and interphalangeal OA are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our recent systematic review of interventions for first MTPJ OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] revealed only one low quality randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of two different physical therapy programs in 20 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Following the publication of this review, we completed a randomised controlled trial which found that intra-articular viscosupplementation (hylan G-F20) was no more effective than a placebo (sterile saline) for this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clearly, there is a need for additional well-designed trials into non-surgical interventions for the treatment of first MTPJ OA.</p><p>The pain associated with first MTPJ OA generally occurs during the propulsive phase of gait when the proximal phalanx is compressed against the dorsal osteophyte on the first metatarsal head. Therefore, ameliorating the need for the first MTPJ to dorsiflex has the potential to reduce joint compression and alleviate pain when walking. Clinically, this can be achieved using a footwear modification known as a rocker-sole, in which the sole of the shoe is curved (at the forefoot, rearfoot, or both) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The aim of this modification is to allow the body&#x02019;s centre of mass to &#x0201c;roll over&#x0201d; the base of support, reducing the need for foot and ankle dorsiflexion and subsequently decreasing the loads placed on the forefoot. Biomechanical studies have confirmed this proposed mechanism, indicating that rocker-sole shoes reduce sagittal plane motion of the forefoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], reduce forefoot plantar pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and reduce first MTPJ dorsiflexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] when walking. Such a change in biomechanics may be therapeutically beneficial in those with first MTPJ OA by reducing compression at the first MTPJ. Although no controlled studies have been performed, uncontrolled reports suggest that rocker-sole shoes are effective in the management of first MTPJ pain, and may in some cases prevent the need for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In both clinical practice and research, the main barrier to the use of therapeutic footwear is concern regarding aesthetics, and indeed, adherence to therapeutic footwear in people with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis has been reported to be as low as 22% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, the recent popularity of so-called &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;toning&#x0201d; footwear, pioneered by the Swiss company Masai Barefoot Technology (MBT), has made the rocker-sole shoe more fashionable. It is therefore likely that acceptability and adherence to this intervention will be much greater than that associated with the relatively unattractive medical grade footwear that has been used for this purpose previously. Indeed, a recent trial of MBT shoes for knee OA reported a drop-out rate of only 2% over 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In addition to rocker-sole shoes, first MTPJ OA is often managed with prefabricated or customised foot orthoses. Foot orthoses are thought to decrease pain associated with this condition by allowing the first metatarsal to achieve sufficient plantarflexion in preparation for propulsion, thereby minimising joint compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although widely used and recommended in clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], evidence to support the effectiveness of this approach is limited to case reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and one recent case series study, which demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in pain over 24&#x000a0;weeks in 32 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Given the prevalence and impact of first MTPJ OA, the lack of evidence for existing interventions, and the preliminary biomechanical and anecdotal evidence supporting the use of rocker-sole shoes and prefabricated foot orthoses, there is a need to conduct a rigorous randomised trial to evaluate which of these non-invasive treatments is most effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has been registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613001245785).</p><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee has provided ethical approval (number 13&#x02013;003).

This process will be repeated 5 times with a positive test result documented if a grating or cracking sensation occurs during at least 2 of the test trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>];</p><p>(vi) first MTPJ dorsiflexion range of motion: the passive, non-weightbearing, dorsiflexion range of motion of the first MTPJ will be measured in accordance to the procedure described by Hopson <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The first metatarsal and proximal phalanx of the hallux will initially be bisected in the sagittal plane. A dorsiflexion force will be applied to the hallux until end range of motion is reached, allowing the first ray to maximally plantarflex. The angle between the two lines will then be measured via a hand held goniometer. This measurement technique has been shown to be highly reliable in people with first MTPJ pain (intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). The assessment will be performed twice and the average score will be documented.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Foot Posture Index (FPI)</italic></title><p>To help determine the amount of rearfoot control to be added to the orthoses in the prefabricated foot orthoses group, the FPI will be documented. The FPI is a valid and reliable clinical assessment tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] which consists of six specific criteria: talar head palpation, supralateral and infralateral malleolar curvature, calcaneal frontal plane position, prominence in the region of the talonavicular joint, medial arch height and abduction and adduction of the forefoot on the rearfoot. Each FPI criterion is scored on a 5-point scale (range, -2 to +2). The six scores obtained are then summated to give an overall score of foot posture. The summated score has the potential to range from -12 (highly supinated) to +12 (highly pronated). The normal FPI (defined as&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1 standard deviation from the mean) has been reported to be +1 to +7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Therefore, participants who score greater than 7 will be deemed to have pronated foot posture, and will have full length medial wedges applied to the plantar aspect of the foot orthoses. The magnitude of the wedge angulation will be increased until there is a reduction in the FPI score of at least 2 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Those with an FPI score less than 7 will have open cell polyurethane foam applied to the plantar aspect of the rearfoot.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Three-dimensional foot scanning</italic></title><p>The FotoScan 3D foot scanner (Precision 3D Ltd, Weston-super-mare, UK) will be used to obtain fully weight bearing scans of both feet. Participants will be instructed to stand relaxed with their feet approximately shoulder width apart and their hands clasped lightly in front of them or gently resting on the support rail if required. The FotoScan 3D device uses a fixed system of cameras and projectors to obtain digital images of the foot, which are then automatically converted to 3D models. According to the manufacturer, the scans obtained with this system are accurate to within less than half a millimetre.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Radiographic assessment of OA</italic></title><p>The presence of radiographic OA will not be an inclusion criterion, as in clinical practice, footwear interventions are often provided on the basis of clinical findings without confirmation of radiographic changes. However, to document the radiographic severity of OA, weightbearing dorso-plantar and lateral radiographic projections will be obtained from the most symptomatic foot (or in the case of equivalent bilateral symptoms, the right foot), with the participant standing in a relaxed bipedal stance position. All x-rays will be taken by the same medical imaging department using a Shimadzu UD150LRII 50 kw/30&#x000a0;kHz Generator and 0.6/1.2 P18DE-80S high speed x-ray tube from a ceiling suspended tube mount. AGFA MD40 CR digital phosphor plates in a 24&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;cm cassette will be used. The tube will be angled 90 degrees and centred at the base of the third metatarsal, with the film focus distance set at 100&#x000a0;cm. All radiographs will be examined by HBM, SEM and JMT, to determine the presence of OA, using a radiographic atlas of foot OA developed by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The reliability of assessments using this atlas have been reported in detail previously (kappa values greater than 0.76 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Treatment preference and credibility/expectation</italic></title><p>In open randomised trials of musculoskeletal disorders, it has been demonstrated that participants who are allocated to their preferred treatment achieve better outcomes than those who do not receive their preferred treatment, despite the randomisation process resulting in equivalent baseline outcome measure scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. To address this issue, participants will be asked if they have a preference for either treatment (documented as rocker-sole shoes, prefabricated foot orthoses or no preference), although their response will not influence their randomised group allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. This approach conserves all the advantages of a fully randomised design but enables the interaction between preference and outcomes to be quantified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. A related issue is treatment credibility (participants&#x02019; beliefs about the logic underpinning the intervention) and treatment expectancy (participants&#x02019; perceptions of how much they may benefit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. To quantify this, the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] will be administered after randomisation. The CEQ consists of six items: three related to credibility and three related to expectancy. For each item, participants will be asked to rate the credibility of the treatment and their expectations on a 9-point Likert scale. High scores on the scale indicate that the participant considers the treatment to be credible and expects the treatment to be effective. The CEQ has been shown to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and has recently been used to assess the credibility of sham dry needling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and sham foot orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] used in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Biomechanical evaluation</italic></title><p>Because the proposed mechanism of action of the rocker-sole shoes is a change in biomechanical function of the lower limb, two approaches will be used to evaluate their effects at the baseline appointment. First, spatio-temporal parameters and three-dimensional motion of the thigh and lower leg during gait will be recorded using a wireless, wearable sensor motion analysis system (LEGSys&#x02122;, Biosensics, Boston, MA, USA). This system consists of accelerometers and gyroscopes attached with Velcro&#x02122; straps to each lower leg and thigh. The method for calculation of the spatio-temporal parameters of gait is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. To summarise, the gait phases are determined from the precise events of heel-strike (initial foot contact) until toe-off (terminal foot contact). These events are extracted from gyroscopes attached to each shank through a local minimal peak detection scheme. Based on each participant&#x02019;s height and using a biomechanical model, spatial parameters (i.e. stride length and stride velocity) and kinematics (knee and hip) are estimated by integration of the angular rate of rotation of the thigh and shank relative to the waist sensor. Gait analysis with this system has been validated in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], and patients with hip osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. After a familiarisation period, participants will complete 4 walking trials for each footwear condition over an 8 metre distance. To exclude the effect of acceleration and deceleration steps, only the middle four steps from each trial will be included for analysis. An average recording will be determined from the 16 steps (4 steps from 4 trials) for each condition. Second, plantar pressures (specifically, peak pressure under the hallux, first MTPJ and lesser MTPJs) will be measured with the in-shoe Pedar&#x000ae; system (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany), a reliable, valid and accurate measure of in-shoe pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The Pedar&#x000ae; insoles are approximately 2 mm thick and consist of 99 capacitive pressure sensors, arranged in grid alignment. Plantar pressure data will be sampled at a frequency of 50 Hz. Both groups will undergo the same biomechanical assessment. However, for rocker-sole shoe group, comparisons will be made between their own shoes and the rocker-sole shoes, while in the prefabricated foot orthoses group, comparisons will be made when wearing their own shoes (with and without the prefabricated orthoses).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary and secondary outcome measures will be collected at baseline and 4, 8 and 12 weeks. These time points have been selected as 4 weeks is considered the earliest time of greatest effect and 12 weeks is considered to be a standard clinical follow-up time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. To avoid over-testing and to minimise the risk of Type I error associated with serial measurements, statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions will specifically focus on the change in primary outcome measures between baseline and 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome measure will be the foot pain domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The FHSQ is a foot-specific health-related quality of life outcome measure consisting of 13 questions that assess four domains of foot health including pain, function, footwear and general foot health. Questions within each domain are scored using a Likert response format, with an output score produced ranging from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 indicating optimum foot health and a score of 0 indicating very poor foot health. The FHSQ has been shown to have a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]), and has been used in several RCTs by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. A recent review recommended the use of the FHSQ in clinical trials of rheumatological foot disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>].

This will be the third clinical trial undertaken for this condition and the first to focus on footwear-related interventions. Our recent systematic review of interventions for first MTPJ OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] revealed only one low quality randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of two different physical therapy programs in 20 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and more recently, our group completed an RCT which found that intra-articular viscosupplementation (hylan G-F20) was no more effective than a placebo (sterile saline) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As such, the trial will provide novel and clinically relevant information to inform the non-surgical management of this common and disabling condition.</p><p>The underlying biomechanical rationale for the use of mechanical interventions for first MTPJ OA is that the condition results from the inability of the first metatarsal to plantarflex during propulsion to allow the proximal phalanx to dorsally rotate on the first metatarsal head, thereby resulting in dorsal joint compression of the first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, the two interventions to be compared in this trial aim to address this biomechanical deficit in different ways. Rocker-sole footwear is thought to reduce the need for first MTPJ dorsiflexion during propulsion, by enabling the body&#x02019;s centre of mass to &#x0201c;rollover&#x0201d; the base of support, thereby decreasing sagittal plane motion of the ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], forefoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and reducing forefoot plantar pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, foot orthoses with a first ray cut-out, forefoot extension and medial wedging aim to limit rearfoot pronation and facilitate first ray plantarflexion during propulsion, thereby allowing the proximal phalanx to rotate on the first metatarsal head to achieve sufficient first MTPJ dorsiflexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The available evidence addressing this proposed mechanism of action of foot orthoses, however, is equivocal. While two studies have reported increases in first MTPJ dorsiflexion with orthoses placed under the foot in static stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>], one study reported no change in first MTPJ dorsiflexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Gait studies have been similarly inconsistent, with two studies reporting a <italic>decrease</italic> in first MTPJ dorsiflexion (with medial wedging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>] and orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) and one study reporting no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The prefabricated orthoses in this study will be modified in a similar manner to the protocol described by Welsh <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, there are two key differences in the inclusion criteria between our two studies. In the Welsh <italic>et al</italic>. study, participants were excluded if they had an FPI score &#x0003c;4 or exhibited less than 40 degrees of non-weightbearing first MTPJ dorsiflexion. This approach is based on three assumptions: (i) that people with first MTPJ OA are more likely to have pronated feet; (ii) that control of rearfoot pronation is an important goal of treatment for this condition, and; (iii) that individuals with less than 40 degrees of non-weightbearing first MTPJ dorsiflexion would not benefit from the orthoses. Participants in our trial will not be excluded on the basis of foot posture, as our recent systematic review did not find pronated foot posture to be strongly associated with this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the gait analysis component of the Welsh <italic>et al</italic>. study found no differences in rearfoot motion with the orthoses, suggesting that control of rearfoot pronation did not contribute to the observed improvement in symptoms. Finally, participants in our trial will be required to have less than 64 degrees of first MTPJ dorsiflexion (as we have shown that this cut-off is associated with radiographic OA in the first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]), but we will not exclude any participants on the basis of having insufficient range of motion in the first MTPJ. It could be argued that individuals with very limited first MTPJ range of motion have little to gain from prefabricated foot orthoses with a modification (a first ray cut-out) that, theoretically, facilitates motion at the first MTPJ by allowing the first ray to plantarflex. However, this mechanism is yet to be adequately demonstrated, and it is possible that the orthoses could achieve beneficial therapeutic effects through other mechanisms, such as reducing peak pressure under the hallux and first MTPJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].</p><p>The gait analysis component of the study will provide useful insights into the possible mechanism of action of the interventions. The wearable sensor motion analysis system (LEGSys&#x02122;, Biosensics, Boston, MA, USA) provides high resolution temporal and kinematic data, without the laboratory constraints and data processing requirements of traditional motion analysis systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. The use of this system will help identify changes in lower limb function associated with the footwear and orthoses (particularly changes in sagittal plane motion of the shank and thigh), and whether these changes are related to improvement in symptoms. Similarly, the in-shoe plantar pressure system (Pedar&#x000ae;, Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) will identify the extent to which the high peak pressures under the hallux frequently observed in individuals with first MTPJ OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>] are mitigated by the interventions. It should be noted, however, that it is not possible to measure first MTPJ motion <italic>directly</italic> in this study, as this requires the permanent modification of the upper of the shoe to allow placement of reflective markers or electromagnetic motion sensors on the foot.</p><p>Participants will be reviewed at 4-weekly intervals up to 12&#x000a0;weeks, which is similar to previous footwear trials which have employed 8&#x000a0;week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>] or 12&#x000a0;week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>] follow-up periods, and longer than the 4&#x000a0;week physical therapy trial for first MTPJ OA by Shamus <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although our trial of viscosupplementation for first MTPJ OA followed participants for 24&#x000a0;weeks, the effect of treatment clearly plateaued at 12&#x000a0;weeks in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We are therefore confident that the 12&#x000a0;week duration of the trial is sufficient to detect differences between the groups, if they exist. Furthermore, 12&#x000a0;weeks is considered to be a standard clinical follow-up period in trials evaluating the effects of interventions for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. The trial will incorporate 4 repeated measurements for the primary outcome measure (baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks) to provide insights into the trajectory of any improvements in symptoms. However, to address the issue of multiple testing of serial measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], we have pre-specified 12&#x000a0;weeks as the primary end-point, and no statistical comparisons of the 4 and 8&#x000a0;week scores will be undertaken.</p><p>There are three key limitations of the study design. Firstly, this is not a <italic>controlled</italic> trial, as both groups will receive an active intervention that has the potential to be therapeutically beneficial. This was an ethical requirement of our institution, as our original proposal to include &#x0201c;sham&#x0201d; orthoses as the comparator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] was considered by the ethics committee to be withholding &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; care. Because usual care is not well documented for this condition, we selected what we believe to be a simple, commonly-used treatment (prefabricated foot orthoses) with some evidence to support it, albeit it relatively low quality (case series evidence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This change in protocol unavoidably reduces the methodological rigour of the trial, but also increases its external validity.</p><p>Secondly, due to the nature of the interventions, research staff cannot be blinded to group allocation. However, follow-up assessment of outcome measures will be via self-completion questionnaires returned by mail, and research staff entering the data and conducting the analyses will be blinded to group allocation. Blinding participants in relation to the two treatments being offered was considered (i.e. by referring to them as &#x0201c;two footwear-related interventions&#x0201d; rather than specifying the rocker-soled shoes and foot orthoses). However, the inherent risk of this approach is that some participants may not be prepared to the wear the rocker-soled shoes for aesthetic reasons (and some could withdraw from the study immediately after being randomised for this reason). On balance, we considered that the reduction in methodological rigour created by poor adherence and differential drop-out was probably greater than that created by lack of blinding; hence our decision to openly advise participants as to the two treatments being compared.</p><p>A third, related issue is that because we will openly disclose the two treatments during the recruitment process, there is some risk of &#x0201c;resentful demoralisation&#x0201d; in participants who are allocated to the prefabricated foot orthoses group. That is, some participants who are allocated to receive the prefabricated foot orthoses may be resentful of not receiving the more expensive and (more visually substantial) rocker-soled shoe intervention, which may affect their adherence to the tasks required of them in the study and systematically influence their responses to the outcome measure questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. To address this, we will document both participant preference prior to randomisation and participants&#x02019; perceptions of treatment credibility/expectation after randomisation. This approach will not <italic>prevent</italic> resentful demoralisation, but will enable post-randomisation effects of treatment preference to be quantified, and if necessary, factored into the analysis as a prognostic variable.</p><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This study will be the first randomised trial to compare the effectiveness of rocker-sole footwear and individualised prefabricated foot orthoses in reducing pain associated with osteoarthritis of the first MTPJ, and only the third randomised trial conducted for this common and disabling condition.
