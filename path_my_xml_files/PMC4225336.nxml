Switching NVP to RPV could result in decreased RPV exposure with subsequent virological failure and dyslipidemia because NVP is regarded as the least dyslipidemic, non-nucleoside, reverse transcriptase inhibitor. This trial evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and cardiovascular risks of switching NVP to RPV.</p></sec><sec id="st2_19789"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Prospective open label controlled trial. HIV-1 patients with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL on once daily NVP, emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) switched to single tablet RPV/FTC/TDF. Eligible patients on NVP, FTC/TDF were controls. Primary endpoint was week 12 HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL by intention to treat analysis. Secondary endpoints were week 24 HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL, NVP and RPV pharmacokinetics, safety and fasting lipids, Framingham risk scores (FRS) and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) lipid goals.</p></sec><sec id="st3_19789"><title>Results</title><p>Of 189 eligible patients, we included 50 RPV switchers and 139 NVP controls. Week 12 HIV-RNA was &#x0003c;50 copies/mL in 46/50 switchers (92.0%) which was not different from the hypothesized 90% week 12 suppression rate (p=.431). Forty-four of 50 switchers had week 24 HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL compared to 126/139 controls (difference: 2.6%, 95% CI &#x02212;7.6% to 12.8%, p=.593). NVP plasma concentrations were below detection level in all at week 3. Mean week 1 RPV trough concentration was 0.083 mg/L and comparable to phase III trial data (p=0.747). Adverse events occurred in 36 switchers, the majority (82.0%) were grade one. Two switchers discontinued RPV for side effects. Significant changes over 24 weeks (p&#x0003c;0.001) were observed in switchers on total cholesterol (TC, &#x02212;0.67 mmol/L, 95% CI &#x02212;0.50 to 0.83), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C (&#x02212;0.36, 95% CI &#x02212;0.21 to &#x02212;0.51) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C (&#x02212;0.28, 95% CI &#x02212;0.20 to &#x02212;0.35). The TC/HDL-C ratio increased 0.20 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.37; p=.029) and systolic blood pressure decreased 6.0 mmHg (95% CI &#x02212;1.7 to &#x02212;10.3; p=.007). The median FRS did not change over 24 weeks (8.4% vs. 7.7%; p=.119). More patients achieved LDL-C (+15%; p=.016) and TC (+25%; p&#x0003c;0.001) ATP-III treatment goals at week 24 on RPV.</p></sec><sec id="st4_19789"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A NVP to RPV switch does not influence RPV exposure and results in adequate ongoing HIV-1 suppression. RPV could be an option for patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
