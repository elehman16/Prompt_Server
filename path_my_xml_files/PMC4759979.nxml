The use of pomegranate fruit dates from ancient times and reports of its therapeutic abilities have echoed throughout the ages. To evaluate the effect on the salivary pH and the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count in healthy subjects before and after pomegranate mouthrinse. Fifty healthy patients were randomly divided into two groups of 25 subjects each. Group A was treated with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinse; while Group B was treated with pomegranate peel extract (PPE) mouthrinse and the saliva samples were collected at three different intervals: Prerinse, after 10 min, and 60 min. The salivary pH was measured using a digital pH meter and the <italic>S. mutans</italic> count was determined by the commercial system Dentocult SM. The statistical analyses used in this study are Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test and <italic>t</italic>-test. PPE mouthrinse had an inhibitory effect on <italic>S. mutans</italic> count in adults. There was also an increase in the salivary pH after 10 min of the mouthrinse. PPE mouthrinse may be considered as a potential anticariogenic mouthrinse.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chlorhexidine alternative</kwd><kwd>herbal mouthrinse</kwd><kwd>pomegranate extract</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chlorhexidine, considered standard for an anti-plaque agent is one of the most competent antimicrobial agent but can cause tooth staining, horrid tang, and augmented calculus development.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This advocates the need for supplementary study and presents with new antibacterial agents that are strongly against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, with marginal consequences on the oral tissues, especially in children. Among the herbal alternatives, pomegranate finds a special mention.</p><p>Pomegranate, (botanical name: <italic>Punica granatum</italic>) is one of the oldest known edible fruits. The pomegranate is an ancient fruit that has not changed much throughout the history of man. It was found in the Indus Valley, so early that there is a word in Sanskrit for pomegranate.

The dried peels were powdered. The acquired powder was used to formulate an aqueous extract in soxhlet extractor. 20 g of PPE was achieved at the end of 5 days.</p><p>Pomegranate aril extract - A parallel procedure was applied for pomegranate aril extract but required mandatory 15 days of drying in hot air oven at 60&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Pomegranate juice - Freshly prepared pomegranate juice was acquired using the sterilized grinder of the research laboratory. 400 ml of pomegranate juice was heated for 1 h to get a heavy concentrate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Bacterial strain</title><p>The bacterial strain expended in this study was <italic>S. mutans</italic> Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) 890, acquired from the MTCC and Gene Bank Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Antibacterial activity-minimum inhibitory concentration</title><p>The antibacterial endeavor of each extract was tested alongside a strain of <italic>S.

Wells (8 mm diameter) were punched in the agar and filled with 0.1 ml of extract and incubated for 24 h. Concentrations of 600, 300, 150, and 75 mg/ml were tested similarly. Antibacterial activities were evaluated by measuring the diameter of inhibition zone.</p><p>PPE showed well-defined inhibition zones at 600 and 300 mg/ml concentrations. Pomegranate aril extract showed inhibition zones at 600 mg/ml, but the diameter was less than PPE. However, pomegranate juice failed to show inhibition zones.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Preparation of mouthrinse</title><p>The PPE was selected to prepare the mouthrinse as it demonstrated higher antibacterial efficacy based on MIC.</p><p>The 300 mg/ml concentration of PPE was used to prepare the mouthrinse.

In addition, the participants in the study were required to have a normal unstimulated (resting) whole saliva flow rate (0.5 ml/min).

Subsequent to baseline estimation, each participant underwent two sets of saliva sample collection along with estimation of salivary pH in two phases: Ten minutes after the mouthrinse (set 2), and 60 min after the mouthrinse (set 3). None were allowed to eat or drink in between the phases. Similarly, Group B participants were asked to rinse with 5 ml of pomegranate extract for 2 min and subsequently, the saliva samples (set 1, 2, and 3) were collected.
