Spinal narcotics have been used for decades but have not become commonplace because of safety or re-dosing concerns. An extended release epidural morphine (EREM) preparation has been used successfully in obstetric, abdominal, thoracic, and extremity surgery done with epidural anesthesia. This has not been studied in open spinal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Ninety-eight patients having complex posterior lumbar surgery were enrolled in a partially randomized clinical trial (PRCT) of low to moderate doses of EREM. Surgery included levels from L3 to S1 with procedures involving combinations of decompression, instrumented arthrodesis, and interbody grafting. The patients were randomized to receive either 10 or 15 mg of EREM through an epidural catheter placed under direct vision at the conclusion of surgery. Multiple safety measures were employed to prevent or detect respiratory depression. Postoperative pain scores, narcotic utilization, and adverse events were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant differences between the two groups as to supplemental narcotic requirements, pain scores, or adverse events. There were no cases of respiratory depression. The epidural narcotic effect persisted from 3 to 36 hours after the injection.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>By utilizing appropriate safety measures, EREM can be used safely for postoperative pain control in lumbar surgery patients.

Extended release epidural morphine (EREM: liposomal formulation DepoDur<italic>TM</italic>), has already been demonstrated to be superior to short-acting epidural narcotics and to intravenous opioids alone when utilized for postoperative pain control in obstetric, abdominal, and lower extremity surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Similarly, in spinal EREM should offer spinal analgesia without the need for indwelling catheters and repeat dosing.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of utilizing EREM in lumbar surgery at a dose of 10 and 15 mg to avoid respiratory depression. Previously, Hartrick, <italic>et al</italic>. reported and demonstrated the effectiveness of EREM for patients undergoing total knee replacement patients, but respiratory depression occurred at a dose of 20-30 mg. They advocated future trials of lower doses (10-15 mg) to avoid this complication.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Of interest, the EREM preparation cannot be mixed with other medications (e.g., saline or anything else) as this can cause an expedited release of the narcotic from the sustained release preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>The study, registered with the National Institute of Health (NIH) (number NCT 00335517), was approved by the Research Subjects Review Board. This prospective, randomized (by computer) study involved 98 patients presenting to three spine surgeons for elective lumbar surgery who were to receive either 10 mg (Group I) or 15 mg (Group II) of EREM. Patients who gave informed consent had to be at least 18 years of age, underwent lumbar surgery from the L3-S1 levels, and anticipated being hospitalized for at least 48 hours. Patients were excluded if they were unable to give consent, were incarcerated, pregnant, or had allergies to narcotic analgesics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients underwent lumbar surgery with their attending surgeons. Details of the surgery included: The operating surgeon, the number of surgical levels, and the number of levels fused with and without instrumentation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Conversion table of opiods to IV morphine equivalents[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SNI-4-51-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention: Catheter advancement to the L1 level and injection with 10 or 15 mg of extended release epidural morphine</title><p>At the conclusion of surgery, an epidural catheter was placed under direct visualization and was advanced at least 4 cm to the L1 level prior to the injection of 2 mL air to ensure patency. Surgical levels were confirmed with intraoperative radiography (fluoroscopy or portable X-ray). Aspiration was also performed to ensure no intradural injections. Subsequently, the undiluted (1 or 1.5 mL, corresponding to 10 or 15 mg) EREM was injected. The catheter was then removed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>Postoperatively, each patient was admitted to a nonacute level of care (floor bed). All patients were provided an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) system (morphine or hydromorphone) and oral analgesics (hydrocodone, oxycodone, or propoxyphene) as needed. The majority started with morphine PCA. This was at the surgeon's discretion. Narcotic consumption was recorded in morphine equivalents.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Safety measures</title><p>Postoperative orders included clear identification of &#x0201c;spinal narcotic&#x0201d; at patient's bedside and in patient's chart, and required multiple safety measures. First, elevation of the head of the bed to 30&#x000b0; avoided cephalad diffusion to the respiratory center. Second, the addition of 0.4 mg naloxone (low dose) to each liter of IV fluid minimized side effects like pruritis, nausea, and vomiting while avoiding reversal of the high concentration of narcotics at the spinal cord receptors. Third, continuous pulse oximetry monitoring allowed personnel to detect respiratory depression by an audible alarm. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pupil size were recorded every hour for the first four hours and every four hours subsequently. As the receptors for pupil size and the respiratory center are located in close proximity, the observation of pin point pupils could signal the potential onset of respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Perioperative data recorded for all patients included; the time of EREM injection, the amount of pain medication used at 6-hour intervals, and the patient reported pain scores during the 48-hour postoperative period. These data were used to compare the safety of the two EREM doses and differences based on the surgical details, as well as to evaluate the onset and duration of the EREM analgesia. Pain scores were also routinely recorded with vital signs using the Visual Analog Scale. Adverse outcomes were recorded, including respiratory depression, reoperation, rehospitalization, pulmonary embolism (PE), and mortality. For ease of comparison, all narcotic analgesics were converted to equivalent doses of IV morphine (per our institution's algorithm).

We concluded that there were no significant differences between the two dosage groups in the total narcotic equivalents used or reported pain scores at any single time point, any interval, or overall. There were also no differences based on levels of surgery, fusion, instrumentation, nor based on surgeon or use of interbody arthrodesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Duration of epidural analgesia following single low-dose EREM for spinal surgery</title><p>In addition, this study confirms the findings of others that the EREM analgesic effect does not occur until approximately 3 hours postinjection. The superiority of epidural analgesia over parenteral opioids for postoperative pain has been previously established. Cata <italic>et al</italic>. specifically reported how short-acting narcotics administered via patient-controlled epidural analgesia systems (PCEA) after lumbar spine surgery was superior to IV-PCA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Spine surgery patients treated with PCEA reported better pain control, used less narcotics, had lower incidence of deep venous thrombosis, and had shorter hospital stays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Orthopedic patients treated with EREM required less rescue narcotics</title><p>Orthopedic patients treated with EREM have also required less overall rescue narcotic, and none at all in some cases. Hartrick and colleagues showed that 48 hours after knee arthroplasty, patients averaged a cumulative narcotic consumption of 132 mg morphine when treated with PCA alone, 44 mg when treated with 20 mg EREM and PCA, and 39 mg when treated with 30 mg EREM and PCA. In that study, the incidence of respiratory depression was a dose-related phenomenon beginning with 20 mg and even stronger at 30 mg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This is why our study was designed with doses lower than this.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>36-Hour perceived duration of efficacy of EREM</title><p>In our own study, both nursing staff and surgeons anecdotally noted that patients subjectively appeared comfortable postoperatively, and around 36 hours postoperatively began to experience more discomfort with increased mobility. However, like Hartrick <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] we found that patients required less narcotic overall: 55 patients required &#x02264;50 mg IV morphine, 34 patients required &#x02264;20 mg IV morphine, and one required no additional pain medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-20"><title>Advantage of single-dose EREM: Avoidance of in-dwelling catheter/risk infection</title><p>In addition to effective pain control, EREM affords other benefits. Because EREM does not require an in-dwelling catheter, the risk of catheter infection and concern for catheter failure or premature removal are eliminated while still ensuring steady analgesia. Extended release delivery allows for a lower peak systemic concentration and less sedation. Good pain control and reduced sedation is a desirable combination for patient comfort, mobility, and overall recovery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-21"><title>EREM enables better mobility potentially reducing risk of PE and length of stay (LOS)</title><p>Utilizing EREM for pain control enables better mobility, thereby reducing risk of PE and hospital stay duration. Previous studies report a 0.5-6% incidence of symptomatic PE after spinal surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] A recent study in 2011 showed an incidence of 1.2% and this is not in-consistent with our data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Moreover, Blackshear and Crosson reported a significant decrease in the incidence of PE among arthroplasty patients who received EREM compared with patients who had an in-dwelling catheter for epidural analgesia or relied on parenteral and oral opioids for pain relief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Their finding correlated with significantly improved pain scores and shorter hospital stays. Similarly, Hartrick and colleagues found that knee arthroplasty patients treated with EREM tolerated physical therapy better and sooner than patients treated with parenteral narcotics alone. The 2% incidence of PE among the patients in our study falls within the reported incidence range. It is also worth noting that the two patients who did develop PE had perioperatively held their anticoagulation thus placing them in a hypercoagulable state. This emphasizes the importance of the balance between minimizing hemorrhage risk and utilizing prophylactic anticoagulation with any spinal surgery, regardless of the analgesic method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-22"><title>Low to moderate dose EREM administered without respiratory depression</title><p>With any form of opioid analgesia, the risk of respiratory depression must be considered, especially with older patients and patients with preexisting respiratory compromise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Previous studies have shown that there is no significant difference in the incidence of respiratory depression with the use of EREM compared with intravenous morphine or short-acting epidural morphine. Respiratory depression, as well as other adverse effects like hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and puritis, appears to be dose-related.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] With this in mind, our study looked at the safety and efficacy of low to moderate doses of EREM. We found that low to moderate doses could be used in a multimodal pain control plan without respiratory depression. There was no evidence to suggest that there was an effect of the mode of administration on the release of medication from the liposomal preparation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-23"><title>Close attention paid to safety measures</title><p>Close attention must be paid to the safety measures employed in this study. (1) Mark the chart as an epidural narcotic patient, (2) Keep the head of bed elevated at least 30&#x000b0;, (3) add 0.4 mg of naloxone to each liter of IV fluid starting at the time of injection, (4) continuous pulse oximetry, and (5) monitor pupil size with vital signs. This series was done without intensive care unit monitoring but if the individual surgeon has concerns, a step down unit or other monitoring device could be used.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-24"><title>Weaknesses of this study</title><p>One major weakness of this study was the heterogeneous population of patients (including prior surgeries, use of narcotics, etc.), the multiple types of surgical procedures performed, and the fact that three different surgeons participated in the study. Furthermore, no control group was included as the efficacy of epidural narcotics and EREM have been established by multiple studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-25"><title>Questions regarding specific method of administration</title><p>The two questions to be answered were related to the specifics of the method of administration; through open surgery versus an epidural injection. Here the question was whether the open wound (delivery of single dose at L1 level at the end of surgery) impacts the release of the drug with the potential of creating a higher risk of respiratory depression? In this study, there was no suggestion that either was true.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Low to moderate dose EREM (10 or 15 mg) with concomitant use of a PCA, while following safety precautions appropriate for epidural narcotic use, provides safe and effective postoperative pain control for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. Both dosages resulted in significant reduction in the demand for narcotic analgesics starting 6-12 hours postoperatively, and this effect persisted for the rest of the 48-hour postoperative period. Because both doses were equally effective, and because unwanted side effects are typically dose-related, we recommend using 10 mg EREM for postoperative pain control after lumbar surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank Kimberly A.
