Opioid analgesics play an important role in the management of chronic pain; in the US, they are estimated to be used by 40&#x02013;47 per 1,000 individuals (approximately 13&#x02013;15 million people in total) [<xref rid="pnw325-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Opioids alleviate pain by acting on opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Activation of opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can result in GI adverse events (AEs). Three opioid receptors are expressed in the GI tract: &#x003ba;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003bc; receptors. &#x003ba; and &#x003b4; receptors are expressed in the stomach and proximal colon, but their role in causing GI AEs is unclear [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. &#x003bc; receptors are expressed throughout the GI tract, and when opioids bind to them neural activity in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of the enteric nervous system is decreased. This impairs GI transit and motility, decreases gut fluid secretion, and increases fluid absorption, which can lead to opioid-induced constipation (OIC), the most common side effect of opioid therapy [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a population-based survey, 57% of individuals with chronic noncancer pain who used opioids experienced OIC [<xref rid="pnw325-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. OIC can have a negative effect on patients&#x02019; well-being. This is exemplified by a survey of 359 patients using opioids, which showed that health-related quality of life was significantly worse in those with OIC than in those without OIC [<xref rid="pnw325-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Firstline treatment for OIC involves the use of laxatives; however, laxatives do not address the mechanism underlying the disorder. Furthermore, there is insufficient clinical evidence available to determine the efficacy and side effect profile of laxatives [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pnw325-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This suggests the need for effective treatments for OIC.</p><p>Peripherally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are specifically designed to block opioid actions at peripheral &#x003bc;-opioid receptors in the GI tract [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Two PAMORAs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of OIC [<xref rid="pnw325-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: Naloxegol (a pegylated derivative of naloxone, delivered as oral tablets) has recently been approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic noncancer pain [<xref rid="pnw325-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and methylnaltrexone bromide (delivered as a subcutaneous injection or as oral tablets) has been approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic noncancer pain and for the treatment of OIC in adults with advanced illness on palliative care when laxatives are ineffective [<xref rid="pnw325-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Naldemedine (S-297995) is a novel PAMORA being developed for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic noncancer pain and cancer-related pain [<xref rid="pnw325-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The structure of naldemedine is analogous to that of the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone, but structural modifications limit the ability of naldemedine to cross the blood-brain barrier. In preclinical models, naldemedine potently inhibited the constipating effects of opioids without compromising pain relief or inducing centrally mediated opioid withdrawal [<xref rid="pnw325-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Early clinical dose-finding studies demonstrated that 0.3&#x02009;mg once daily had a good benefit-risk profile in patients with opioid-induced bowel dysfunction [<xref rid="pnw325-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the study reported here were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three doses of oral naldemedine (0.1&#x02009;mg, 0.2&#x02009;mg, and 0.4&#x02009;mg once daily) and define the optimal dose in patients with chronic noncancer pain who have OIC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of oral naldemedine in patients with chronic noncancer pain receiving opioid therapy who had OIC and who maintained a stable laxative regimen throughout the study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01443403).</p><p>Patients age 18 years or older were screened for 15&#x02013;28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pnw325-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Those who met the eligibility criteria and completed a Bowel Movement and Constipation Assessment (BMCA) diary on a daily basis for at least 14 days were enrolled in the treatment period. Patients were then randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral naldemedine 0.1&#x02009;mg, 0.2&#x02009;mg, or 0.4&#x02009;mg or placebo once daily for 28 days and were followed up for a further 28 days to complete safety assessments. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups using an interactive voice response system, which assigned a unique number to each patient and was used to identify the patient in all data systems.

There were no specific exclusion criteria for patients with persistent or uncontrolled pain or with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy Assessments</title><p>The BMCA diary was completed on a daily basis for the 28 days of treatment. As part of this diary record, patients also assessed the consistency of stools using BSS. To minimize the potential for overestimating the frequency of BMs, all passages of stool with a score of at least 1 on the BSS that occurred within a two-hour time frame were classified as a single BM. The baseline mean number of SBMs was calculated from the data collected in the last two weeks of screening, before the first dose of study drug was administered. Any BMs in the 24&#x02009;hours after use of rescue laxatives were not considered to be spontaneous.</p><p>The primary efficacy end point was the mean change in weekly SBM frequency from baseline to the last two weeks of the treatment period.

The safety population comprised all patients who received the study drug. The per protocol population comprised all patients who received the last dose of treatment and did not have major protocol violations (defined as those that could potentially affect the efficacy or safety conclusions of the study; these violations were determined prior to unblinding the study database).</p><p>For the primary end point, the mean change in weekly SBM frequency in each naldemedine dose group was compared with that of the placebo group, based on an analysis of covariance model, with frequency of SBMs per week at baseline as a covariate. Naldemedine dose groups were compared with the placebo group sequentially in descending order of dose.</p><p>As a secondary end point, the mean change in weekly SBM frequency was also compared between the different naldemedine dose groups. Mean change in SBM frequency from baseline to weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 was compared using a mixed-effects repeated measure model, which included the frequency of SBMs per week at baseline as a covariate, and treatment group, week, and week-by-treatment group interaction as fixed effects. The variance-covariance between-weeks matrix was unstructured. The differences in the proportion of SBM and CSBM responders between each naldemedine dose group and the placebo group, and frequencies of SBMs or CSBMs in the four, eight, 12, and 24&#x02009;hours following initial treatment administration, were compared using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. No corrections for multiplicity were performed for assessment of secondary end points. Summary statistics regarding the mean abdominal bloating score and discomfort score, and the corresponding change from baseline, were calculated by treatment group. Patients&#x02019; global satisfaction scores were tabulated by treatment group. The change in weekly BM, CBM, and CSBM frequency, change in weekly frequency of SBMs without straining, change in the number of days with SBMs and with CSBMs per week, and change in weekly frequency of SBMs rated 3 or 4 on the BSS were analyzed in a similar manner to the primary analysis, using repeated measure analysis. For the times to first SBM or to first CSBM after initial treatment administration, the distributions of times for each treatment group were compared using a generalized Wilcoxon test. Summary statistics regarding the change in frequency of false starts of BMs, weekly frequency of rescue laxative use, and frequency of rescue laxative use during the treatment period were calculated by treatment group.

In this phase 2b, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the efficacy and safety of the novel PAMORA naldemedine, administered at once-daily doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4&#x02009;mg, was evaluated in patients with chronic noncancer pain who had OIC and were receiving opioid therapy. The trial met its primary end point, demonstrating that naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg or 0.4&#x02009;mg once daily significantly increased the mean weekly frequency of SBMs from baseline to the last two weeks of the treatment period, compared with placebo. Change in mean weekly frequency of SBMs in the naldemedine 0.1&#x02009;mg group was not significantly different from that in the placebo group. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profiles demonstrated in this study, naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg once daily has been selected for future clinical trials in OIC.</p><p>Naldemedine 0.4&#x02009;mg produced a slightly greater increase in mean weekly SBM frequency than naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg, but the difference was not significant, suggesting no increase in efficacy with this higher dose. The effects of naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg and 0.4&#x02009;mg vs placebo were maintained throughout the four-week study period.</p><p>Benefits were observed with naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg and 0.4&#x02009;mg across multiple secondary end points in the current study. Change in CSBM frequency and the proportion of SBM and CSBM responders showed significant improvements compared with placebo; this was not seen with naldemedine 0.1&#x02009;mg. There was again no significant difference between the two higher doses, suggesting that increasing the dose above 0.2&#x02009;mg per day does not provide any additional benefit.</p><p>Straining to pass a BM and a feeling of incomplete evacuation are key symptoms used to determine OIC [<xref rid="pnw325-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg and 0.4&#x02009;mg reduced these symptoms, as demonstrated by significant differences in relevant secondary end points (increase in the proportion of CSBM responders and the mean weekly frequency of SBMs without straining) compared with placebo.</p><p>There were no significant changes in the abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores between baseline and the end of the treatment period in this study. The reasons for these findings are not clear. A possible explanation is that the scales used in the current study were not sufficiently sensitive to detect small changes in abdominal bloating and discomfort. To the best of our knowledge, there is not a validated scale for an objective assessment of bloating in patients with constipation.</p><p>Patients in all three dose groups were significantly more satisfied with treatment at the end of the current study than those receiving placebo: over 90% of patients receiving naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg, but only 50% of those receiving placebo, were satisfied.</p><p>All doses of naldemedine were well tolerated, and no safety concerns emerged in this study. The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar across treatment groups. The incidence of treatment-related AEs increased with naldemedine dose. The highest number of treatment-related AEs was reported in patients treated with naldemedine 0.4&#x02009;mg. This suggests a dose-related response, with a better safety profile being demonstrated for naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg than for naldemedine 0.4&#x02009;mg. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were GI disorders, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea. These AEs are expected based on the mechanism of action of the drug and its expected effect on &#x003bc;-opioid receptors expressed in the enteric nervous system.</p><p>Naldemedine had no effect on the analgesic property of opioids (as assessed by NRS pain scores) and did not cause opioid withdrawal (as assesed by COWS scores), consistent with its peripheral action. The pharmacokinetic profile of naldemedine demonstrated that it is rapidly absorbed, with an apparent terminal elimination half-life (7.11&#x02013;10.8&#x02009;hours) that supports once-daily dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Limitations</title><p>This trial had some limitations: the use of a self-recorded diary to determine subjective outcomes, including straining, constipation, patient satisfaction, and pain may have introduced some bias. Such diaries are, however, a routine and necessary element of all OIC trials. Larger trials with longer duration of treatment are needed to confirm the results of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of the PAMORA naldemedine at doses of 0.2&#x02009;mg and 0.4&#x02009;mg once daily for four weeks was efficacious in relieving OIC in patients with chronic noncancer pain who were taking opioids long term. The 0.2&#x02009;mg dose was shown to have a better safety profile than the 0.4&#x02009;mg dose. Treatment with naldemedine did not compromise analgesia or cause opioid withdrawal symptoms. Naldemedine 0.2&#x02009;mg once daily will be used in future confirmatory trials in OIC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="pnw325_supp.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Medical writing support (editorial and graphics) was provided by No&#x000eb;lle L O&#x02019;Regan PhD of PharmaGenesis London, London, UK and was funded by Shionogi.</p></ack><sec><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
