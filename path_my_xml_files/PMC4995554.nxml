For example, commonly occurring comorbid symptoms such as depression, dissociation and anger have been found to reduce good outcome in some studies<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but not in other studies.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Different results regarding moderation have been obtained even when the same treatment has been used but in different populations. For example, shame was found to predict outcome in exposure therapy in a college clinic but not in a community clinic sample.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In addition, some studies have shown that trauma history such as childhood abuse predicts less beneficial outcome,<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> whereas others report findings that have been mixed or nil.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This has led some researchers to conclude that the use of enhanced treatment is unnecessary since there is no evidence that any specific patient characteristic is associated with suboptimal outcome.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>However, it is problematic to make conclusions from nil results. The absence of differential outcomes has many possible sources. First, most of the above PTSD studies have limited their predictor analyses to outcomes at immediately post-treatment. A recent meta-analysis has reported that differences in outcomes across PTSD psychotherapies were observed between 1 and 4 months post-treatment but not at immediately post-treatment,<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> suggesting that variation in the benefits of PTSD psychotherapy may be more likely to emerge during follow-up.</p><p>Second, experts in moderator analyses have noted that individual patient characteristics are likely to be weak moderators of treatment effects and that it may be necessary to combine individual weak measures to create a single strong moderator to predict differential outcome across treatments.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Analytical methods for personalised medicine and identification of patient-specific optimal treatment decisions have been successful in physical health disorders.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Recently, new statistical methodologies for combining baseline patient characteristics with the goal of obtaining strong moderators of treatment effects have been developed for psychiatric disorders as well.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>In this paper we utilised a generated effect modifier (GEM) approach<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to produce an optimal moderator of the effects of three psychotherapies tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of cognitive&#x02013;behavioural treatment for PTSD related to childhood abuse.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The RCT evaluated the effect of treatment on improving PTSD outcome by providing a skills-focused module to address comorbid problems related to emotion regulation and interpersonal difficulties in addition to trauma-focused (exposure) therapy. The study compared the outcomes of the skills plus exposure condition relative to an exposure without skills condition and to a skills without exposure condition. Results indicated that the skills plus exposure condition provided greater rates of PTSD remission relative to the exposure condition, whereas the skills group fell in the middle.</p><p>Here we investigated whether baseline measures or a combination of them would moderate the effect of treatment on the PTSD outcome.

We modelled the CAPS scores at immediately post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow-up as a function of treatment, time, a given baseline patient characteristic (the six covariates shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and all two- and three-way interactions between them and assessed the significance of the three-way interaction (treatment &#x000d7; covariate &#x000d7; time).

This indicates much higher statistical significance than that of each of the individual six predictors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The size and direction of the coefficients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjpo.rcpsych.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1192/bjpo.bp.115.000745/-/DC1">supplementary Table DS3</ext-link>) in the linear combination were reviewed to interpret the GEM score. Of note, the coefficient for anger expression (AxEx, the Anger Expression subscale of the Stait-Trait Anger Expression Inventory) was negative, whereas those from all the other psychopathology measures (PTSD, depression, dissociation, interpersonal problems) were positive, reflecting the fact that AxEx acted in a way opposite from these measures in relationship to PTSD outcome. In addition, we considered that anger expression was conceptually closer to the one measure of good functioning, emotion regulation (NMR), which was scored such that higher scores reflected better functioning. As a result of these observations, we reverse scored AnEx, so that like the NMR, higher scores reflected better functioning. Two new variables were created, one representing &#x02018;symptom burden&#x02019; and the other summarising participants&#x02019; &#x02018;emotion regulation&#x02019;. The &#x02018;symptom burden&#x02019; is a composite measure consisting of equal weights of (standardised) PTSD, depression, dissociation and interpersonal problems, whereas the &#x02018;emotion regulation&#x02019; is a composite measure of equal weights of (standardised) NMR and AnEx. The generated &#x02018;symptom burden&#x02019; and &#x02018;emotion regulation&#x02019; variables were negatively correlated, <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>=&#x02212;0.58.</p><p>The simple average of these two new variables, BER (an acronym for &#x02018;burden and emotion regulation&#x02019;), was evaluated as a treatment effect modifier, in a similar way as the individual baseline characteristics.

Although this is not as significant as the associated <italic>P</italic>-value for the GEM, it is still statistically highly significant, in contrast to the individual measures that form BER, and has strong interpretable value.

In the STAIR/EXP treatment condition, although baseline CAPS scores were different across the four BER groups such that the BER Level 1 group had the lowest CAPS score and the Level 4 group had the highest score, all participants similarly showed good outcome immediately post-treatment and experienced continuing improvement through the 6-month follow-up.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Effect of burden and emotion regulation (BER) moderator on post-traumatic stress disorder treatment outcome across treatment conditions.</title><p>CAPS, Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; STAIR, Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation; EXP, prolonged exposure; SupC, supportive counselling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjporcpsych000745-g001"/></fig><p>In the STAIR/SupC condition, the baseline ordering of the BER levels with respect to CAPS was preserved at all post-treatment assessments. Immediately post-treatment, participants from BER Level 1 group had significantly lower CAPS scores than those from Level 4 group, with the outcomes for those in Levels 2 and 3 falling in between. Outcomes did not change during follow-up; gains in each BER group were maintained.</p><p>The impact of categorisation based on the BER score was most evident in the SupC/EXP condition. At immediate post-treatment, participants in all groups showed equivalent improvement. However, by 6-month follow-up, there is a fan-like effect, where BER Level 1 group showed continuing improvement in CAPS score to 6-month follow-up, whereas the Level 4 group showed deterioration. At 6-month follow-up, the mean CAPS score for the BER Level 4 group was significantly worse than that for the BER Level 1 group.</p><p>The treatment effect moderator suggests which patients will benefit from a given treatment more than from another treatment. In this clinical trial, all patients are doing best in the STAIR/EXP treatment, where for participants at every level of BER, the best outcome at 6-month follow-up is achieved after STAIR/EXP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the moderator also provides information about the relative value of the other two treatment conditions. Comparison between STAIR/SupC and SupC/EXP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) indicated that participants in the lower levels of BER (Levels 1 and 2) have lower PTSD symptoms at 6-month follow-up in the exposure without skills (SupC/EXP) treatment than in the skills without exposure (STAIR/SupC) treatment. Conversely, participants at the higher BER levels (Levels 3 and 4) have better outcome at 6-month follow-up in the skills without exposure relative to the exposure and no skills treatment.</p><p>We compared the average CAPS PTSD scores at the 6-month follow-up among the following subgroups: (1) participants treated with skills and no exposure (STAIR/SupC), (2) participants treated with exposure and no skills (SupC/EXP); and (3) those who received their optimal treatment based on BER, i.e. participants at BER Levels 1 and 2 who received exposure without skills (SupC/EXP) and participants at BER Levels 3 and 4 who received skills without exposure. There were 23 participants whose actual treatment assignment matched what would have been assigned based on BER (13 in STAIR/SupC and 10 in SupC/EXP). At 6-month follow-up, the mean CAPS score for those who received their optimal treatment was 24.7, whereas that for participants treated with skills was 30.6 (<italic>P</italic>=0.011) and the mean for those treated with exposure was 31.1 (<italic>P</italic>=0.033), indicating better outcome if patients are assigned their treatment based on BER, than if everyone is treated with STAIR/SupC or SupC/EXP (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjpo.rcpsych.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1192/bjpo.bp.115.000745/-/DC1">data supplement</ext-link> for details regarding how the test for the differences were conducted). Moreover, the impact of this difference should be interpreted in the context of considering the benefits as applied to an entire target population, where relatively small differences at the level of the individual have a large impact on social and economic well-being of the population as a whole.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>PTSD predictor studies to date have reported inconsistent to nil results. We proposed that one reason for the absence of effects might be due to limited follow-up where outcomes have typically been assessed only immediately post-treatment. More importantly, recent reviews of moderation effects in clinical trials indicate that individual symptom measures are typically weak predictors of outcome. This study extended evaluation of treatment outcome to a 6-month follow-up and investigated whether a composite moderator of treatment outcome comprised of several measures would be a more sensitive predictor of differential outcome.</p><p>We identified an optimal linear combination of baseline patient characteristics, and constructed an interpretable GEM, symptom burden and emotion regulation (BER). BER included the total severity of all symptom measures (i.e. PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, dissociation and interpersonal difficulties) as well as the accumulation of identified positive characteristics, described as emotion regulation strength (i.e. anger management and general emotion regulation capacity). The resulting generated moderator score, BER, significantly predicted course of symptoms over time differentially across treatments (i.e. STAIR, exposure and a combination of the two treatments).</p><p>These findings are important for a number of reasons. The development of composite moderators has been recommended as a more powerful and precise measure of treatment outcome.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This is the first study to utilise a composite moderator analysis to examine effect modifiers of PTSD treatment. Inconsistent results across studies to date may be explained by the relatively weak effects of individual measures tested as moderators of treatment outcome. The use of the traditional one-measure-at-a-time approach with the current sample produced null results similar to past studies, providing a demonstration of the differences in conclusion that can result depending on analytic strategy. The analyses also shed light on why trauma history (e.g. childhood abuse) sometimes but not always predicts outcome in treatment trials. It has been observed that early life and/or cumulative trauma is associated with increased symptom burden and impairment. However, history is actually only a general proxy for increasing symptom burden and problematic functioning. Individuals with similar history may vary on symptom severity and strengths depending on personal vulnerability (e.g. genetic load) and environmental (e.g. social support) factors. Given that interventions treat symptoms and not history, the use of symptom measures rather than history is likely to provide more relevant predictors of outcome and lead to more precise and personalised care.</p><p>The study included follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-month follow-up, unlike many previous treatment predictor studies. The moderator was not predictive of differential treatment outcome at immediate post-treatment, and variation in patient responses emerged only during follow-up. The results indicate the importance of including evaluation of patient status beyond the immediate conclusion of a psychotherapy trial, a time when patient response to treatment may be relatively uniform and generally positive. Time away from treatment and the emergence of new stressors and traumatic reminders can challenge the gains made during treatment. Last, our approach took into account both patient weaknesses and strengths. Although clinicians often consider patient strengths as well as psychopathology as they develop a treatment plan, this aspect of clinical care has not generally been translated into the research domain, particularly in the studies of PTSD treatment predictors.</p><p>It is frequently debated whether or not it is necessary for individuals with PTSD related to childhood abuse to receive enhanced interventions (e.g. skills training) to experience good treatment outcome. The data here suggest that skills training appears beneficial to all and may be necessary for a subset of vulnerable patients. Participants across all levels of BER had the best outcome in the STAIR/EXP intervention. Many individuals in exposure therapy without skills did well. However, participants with the highest BER scores (Level 4) showed deterioration during follow-up. The loss of benefits here, which is not seen in the other two groups, may be due to skills deficits that limit the ability to manage residual symptoms or to manage repeated or newly emerging life stressors which can exacerbate symptoms. Individuals with high BER would best be treated in either STAIR plus exposure therapy or, alternatively, STAIR without exposure. Indeed, our analyses indicated that among individuals who fell into either BER Level 3 or 4, skills training without exposure produced better outcome than exposure without skills. Still, it should be noted that among those with the lowest BER (Levels 1 and 2) treatment outcome was better in exposure therapy than in a skills only treatment.</p><p>These results demonstrate the contributing roles of cumulative symptom burden as well as of emotion regulation on influencing outcome. It also demonstrates how a moderator might function to provide measurement-based information to help guide patient and therapist decision-making about which treatment is expected to provide the greatest benefit to the individual patient. In the above analysis, for example, the results suggest that the combination treatment would be best. However, if the number of sessions or time for treatment was limited, then BER would help identify those who would do better in a brief course of skills training versus exposure therapy (i.e. those with high BER scores), those who would likely obtain greater benefits from exposure therapy versus skills training (i.e. those with low BER) and those for whom no difference in outcome is expected and thus could select their treatment based on personal preference (those with middle-level BER scores).</p><p>BER is a construct that is clinically intuitive and of treatment value. Although this research suggests the importance of assessing a range of symptoms as well as patient strengths, this is a demand that may be onerous in clinical practice. Future directions might include the reduction of measures contributing to combination moderators into a more manageable number of screening items and the development of online calculators for clinicians, which would allow a relatively rapid collection and analysis of information to guide treatment selection decisions. In addition to being patient-centred, this approach may help maximise resources by providing the treatment that the patient is statistically predicted to achieve the best results at the end of treatment and beyond.</p><p>Our results should be interpreted with certain cautions in mind. The sample size is small, and, accordingly, the results will need to be replicated. The sample consisted entirely of female participants who sought treatment for PTSD related to childhood abuse. Thus, it is unknown whether our findings would generalise to participants of other genders and those with other types of trauma histories (e.g. combat-related trauma). Composite moderators comprised of other measures might be more appropriate for other types of samples. For example, although the results from this study would suggest that both symptoms and strengths be taken into account, the type of symptoms used to measure burden might differ and the strengths identified might be other than emotion regulation capacities. Last, the construct needs further testing to determine whether it can inform clinical practice. The ultimate test for this and other treatment decision rules is to conduct and evaluate the outcome of clinical trials in which patients are randomised to conditions of treatment without use of the decision rule versus a condition in which the rule guides the selection of treatment.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to utilise a composite moderator approach for PTSD treatments and demonstrates that interventions may differ in their benefits depending on patient characteristics. By implication, it suggests caution regarding the view that the routine application of a single treatment approach across all patients with PTSD is optimal care. This approach makes strides towards personalised medicine, efficiently incorporates multiple predictors in a statistically appropriate manner and may prove useful for clinicians for selecting optimal treatments for their patients in an empirical manner.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by NIMH grants R01 MH86611 and R01 MH099003.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Kessler</surname>
