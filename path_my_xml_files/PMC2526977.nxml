There is evidence of increased risk of placenta accreta and percreta in subsequent pregnancies as well as decreased fertility; and significant resource implications. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of continuity of midwifery care have reported reduced caesareans and other interventions in labour, as well as increased maternal satisfaction, with no statistically significant differences in perinatal morbidity or mortality. RCTs conducted in the UK and in Australia have largely measured the effect of <italic>teams </italic>of care providers (commonly 6&#x02013;12 midwives) with very few testing <italic>caseload </italic>(one-to-one) midwifery care. This study aims to determine whether caseload (one-to-one) midwifery care for women at low risk of medical complications decreases the proportion of women delivering by caesarean section compared with women receiving 'standard' care. This paper presents the trial protocol in detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A two-arm RCT design will be used. Women who are identified at low medical risk will be recruited from the antenatal booking clinics of a tertiary women's hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Baseline data will be collected, then women randomised to caseload midwifery or standard low risk care. Women allocated to the caseload intervention will receive antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care from a designated primary midwife with one or two antenatal visits conducted by a 'back-up' midwife. The midwives will collaborate with obstetricians and other health professionals as necessary. If the woman has an extended labour, or if the primary midwife is unavailable, care will be provided by the back-up midwife. For women allocated to standard care, options include midwifery-led care with varying levels of continuity, junior obstetric care and community based general medical practitioner care. Data will be collected at recruitment (self administered survey) and at 2 and 6 months postpartum by postal survey. Medical/obstetric outcomes will be abstracted from the medical record. The sample size of 2008 was calculated to identify a decrease in caesarean birth from 19 to 14% and detect a range of other significant clinical differences. Comprehensive process and economic evaluations will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN012607000073404.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Continuity of carer in the provision of maternity care has been strongly recommended and encouraged in Victoria and throughout Australia. The Victorian Department of Human Services (DHS) released a policy document "Future directions for Victoria's maternity services" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] in June 2004 which endorsed and promoted the expansion of public models of maternity care that offer continuity of <italic>carer</italic>. Many hospitals have responded by introducing caseload midwifery, a one to one midwifery model of care in which women are cared for by a primary midwife throughout pregnancy, birth and the early postnatal period; a model of care that has been subjected to very little rigorous evaluation. We know of only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of caseload midwifery care; both conducted in the United Kingdom in the1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One did <italic>not </italic>include an 'on call' component for midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whereby midwives are called in to work when a woman in their caseload requires labour care. This aspect is likely to have a significant impact on midwives' lives and has been a common component of the model when implemented in Australia. The other was a cluster trial, with all midwives attached to between one and three general medical practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] &#x02013; a very different system of maternity care than that available in Australia. Other evaluations of the caseload model have used comparative descriptive designs, with most arguing that for feasibility and practical reasons using an RCT design was not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There have been no RCTs of caseload midwifery care in Australia.</p><p>There is evidence from RCTs that continuity of midwifery care may lead to reduced caesarean sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and instrumental vaginal births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and a decrease in other interventions during labour including induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] analgesia use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and episiotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. One Australian RCT demonstrated a decrease in women having caesarean birth from 18% to 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many of these RCTs have also reported increased satisfaction for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], with no statistically significant differences in perinatal morbidity or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. RCTs of continuity of midwifery care in the UK and in Australia have largely measured the effect of <italic>teams </italic>of care providers (commonly 6&#x02013;12 midwives). Caseload midwifery care differs in that women are cared for by a <italic>primary </italic>midwife throughout pregnancy, birth and the early postnatal period. The underlying philosophy is one of continuity of carer for both women and midwives. The primary midwife is on call for labour and birth care for the women in her caseload. One or two other midwives are introduced during pregnancy in case they are needed as a back-up, for example if the primary midwife has two women in labour at the same time, if a woman's labour is quite extended or if the primary midwife is on days rostered 'off call' or leave when labour begins. A fulltime midwife usually cares for 40&#x02013;45 women per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The impact of the caseload midwifery model on staff retention and attrition is unknown, but is another important issue for consideration in light of the fact that a 2002 review of the midwifery workforce in Australia concluded that there is a national shortage of midwives that is expected to increase over the next few years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is possible that the continuity inherent in caseload midwifery and potential for lower intervention childbirth would improve midwife satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; however studies in the UK and Australia have reported problems with the widespread implementation and organisation of models that promote continuity of carer. Issues for midwives include high and unsustainable workloads, personal costs (impinging on family life) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; and burnout and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A caseload model in Sydney ceased operations in 2001 following "many stressors from within and beyond the partnership model" [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], p34]. In response to these issues, some organisations have altered their approach, and moved from a caseload model to midwifery teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A 2000 review of continuity of carer models concluded that services should be organised in a way that aims to put less strain on midwives' lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Conflict between midwives working in new models and the staff in traditional models has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Midwives in new models, or the new models themselves, may be seen as a threat by medical staff, in that the midwives may be taking on work otherwise done by them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a qualitative evaluation of a team midwifery model in Brisbane, midwives were surprised by the lack of support from other staff, both peers and administrators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In two other trials it was reported that team midwives had to frequently respond to criticisms about their role or work practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In a setting of midwifery workforce shortages it is critical that the impact of new models of care is properly evaluated with regard to midwife job satisfaction, recruitment and retention.</p><p>There is a lack of evidence regarding the safety and the efficacy of the caseload model, although the existing RCTs of midwifery care (mostly team midwifery) do report decreases in interventions in labour and birth. In Victoria in 2004, 30% of births were by caesarean; a rate that has almost doubled over the past 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Reports in the USA and Australia have shown that the increase is related partly to non-clinical factors such as demographics, physician practice patterns, and maternal choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In Australia, intervention rates are highest among women with private health insurance, women giving birth in major tertiary hospitals and women attended by specialist obstetricians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and there is a particular concern with the high rate of elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication, and a recommendation that there should be national leadership to reduce caesarean section rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is timely that an RCT be undertaken to test the safety of the caseload model and to ascertain the effect of caseload midwifery on the rate of caesarean section births.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that a caesarean section has implications for subsequent pregnancies, including increased risk of placenta accreta and percreta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; decreased fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Evidence around the protective effect (or otherwise) of caesarean section on urinary and faecal incontinence is inconsistent and likely to be multifactorial. There is some evidence of increased neonatal respiratory morbidity for babies born by caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], however the frequency of significant fetal injury may be greater with vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. There are also significant resource implications: the increasing caesarean section rate adds an economic burden to already under-resourced medical systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Significant questions remain regarding the safety and efficacy of the caseload model, as well as its sustainability, the impact on the workforce, and costs of the model, given how different caseload is to a model using a team of midwives. There have been few economic evaluations of midwifery models of care. Published studies have reported conflicting results: some have reported continuity of care to be more expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and others that continuity models are more cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], although the studies used different methods to calculate costs.</p><p>It is not clear whether continuity of carer per se is more important to women than consistent and personalised care, even if it is provided by a number of care-givers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>We plan to implement a caseload midwifery model under RCT conditions to evaluate its effect on the rate of caesarean section and on a range of significant secondary outcomes.

It was hypothesised that the caseload model of care would decrease the caesarean section rate from 19% to 14%. In order to detect such a difference (with 80% power and 95% confidence) we needed 904 women in each trial arm. Allowing for 10% loss to follow up, 1004 women in each group were required, i.e. a total sample of 2008. This sample size also enables the detection of a range of other statistically significant differences to be detected for the major secondary outcomes, as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Power calculations with n = 904** in each arm</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><italic>Outcome</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>Standard care</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>Caseload</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>Power to detect specified difference</italic></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">%</td><td align="left">%</td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Birth by caesarean section</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">14</td><td align="center">80</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Instrumental vaginal birth</td><td align="left">10.6</td><td align="left">6.6</td><td align="center">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Epidural analgesia</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">13</td><td align="center">82</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intact perineum or unsutured laceration (increase)*</td><td align="left">41.2</td><td align="left">48.2</td><td align="center">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intact perineum or unsutured laceration (decrease)*</td><td align="left">41.2</td><td align="left">34.2</td><td align="center">86</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3rd or 4th degree laceration* (would not miss this difference)</td><td align="left">1.7</td><td align="left">3.4</td><td align="center">57</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Induction of labour</td><td align="left">27</td><td align="left">21</td><td align="center">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Augmentation of labour</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">14</td><td align="center">80</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">12</td><td align="center">79</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Any breastfeeding at 6 months</td><td align="left">53</td><td align="left">63</td><td align="center">99</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Postnatal depression at 8 weeks</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="center">88</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Postnatal depression at 6 months</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="center">88</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Smoking at time of birth</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="center">88</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*These estimations exclude caesarean births</p><p>** Allows for loss to follow-up</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of women to the trial</title><p>Recruitment to the trial will take place in the antenatal clinic when women attend for their maternity booking visit.</p><sec><title>Participant information</title><p>Women will be sent written information (a brochure) about the study when they ring to book into the hospital for their pregnancy care (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

To join the study she can then contact the research midwife and return the forms by mail. Upon the return of the forms, the woman will be randomised and contacted regarding the outcome of the random allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention allocation</title><sec><title>Randomisation procedure</title><p>The randomisation system in use for the trial was developed by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Centre Clinical Trials Centre <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctc.usyd.edu.au"/>. An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) activated by telephone will be used for randomising women to the two treatment arms of the trial (i.e. standard care and caseload midwifery care).</p><p>Randomisation will be undertaken using stratified permuted blocks of varying size, with randomisation stratified by parity (i.e. first or subsequent birth). For each woman, the system will assign the treatment in the next available sequential slot in the appropriate list of blocks.</p><p>When a woman agrees to enter the study the research midwife will complete a COSMOS study specific Trial Randomisation IVRS Worksheet with details that the system will request to complete the randomisation procedure (e.g. woman's full initials, parity and date of birth). Access to the IVRS is achieved by dialing a toll-free telephone number and navigating to the COSMOS trial via a menu system. The system is designed so that no woman can be randomised twice. A back-up system is in place in case of a system failure, via a nominated person at the Clinical Trial Centre. After completing all prompts the woman will be allocated a study number and treatment arm. The woman will be informed immediately of the randomisation outcome and further maternity care bookings arranged accordingly.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study participation</title><sec><title>Baseline</title><p>After consenting to participate in the study and prior to randomisation, women will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire, which includes demographic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Women will be allocated to either the control or intervention arms (described below).</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Further data collection is scheduled to take place following the birth (obstetric and medical data obtained from hospital record) and self-completed participant questionnaires at two and six months postpartum (postal). The hospital records will be checked following the birth before sending postal questionnaires to minimise the chance of a woman who has experienced a fetal death or an early neonatal death receiving a questionnaire. Women who are seriously ill or who have had a seriously ill infant will be sent questionnaires subject to confirmation that they have been discharged from hospital in good health. Where there are any concerns regarding whether a woman should be sent a questionnaire, the research team will discuss the issue and reach agreement.</p></sec><sec><title>Study completion</title><p>Successful completion of the study occurs after the six-month questionnaire is returned. If desired, women will be sent a summary of the results after completion of the analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant discontinuation</title><p>Women are free to withdraw from the study at any time. No further study follow-up will occur.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Description of caseload care</title><p>Women allocated to the caseload intervention will receive antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care from a primary caseload midwife with one or two antenatal visits to be conducted by a 'back-up' midwife. The primary midwife will be on call for the woman's labour and birth except in designated circumstances such as annual leave; sick leave; having already worked more than 12 hours in a 24 hour period; having more than one woman in labour; or if it is on one of the two days per week that the primary midwife is scheduled to not work or be on call. Care will then be provided by a back-up midwife or on occasion by non-caseload midwives. Negotiation of these details will be organised within each caseload group, as autonomy and control over working times and conditions have been shown to be important aspects of preventing burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The primary midwife will collaborate with obstetricians and other health professionals as necessary, and will continue to provide caseload care in addition to care provided by obstetricians if complications develop. In addition to providing care until after the birth of the baby, the primary midwife (or a back up midwife) will attend the hospital on most days to provide some postnatal care and will provide domiciliary care following discharge from hospital. Care will be provided according to hospital guidelines and protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of midwives to caseload</title><p>Approximately 12 fulltime midwives are required to staff the intervention. This can consist of more actual midwives (e.g. it could be several part time midwives). Positions will be advertised in the first instance internally, then if the required number is not met there will be external advertisements. To be eligible, midwives need to have completed two years clinical midwifery post-registration.</p></sec><sec><title>Education of caseload midwives</title><p>In addition to any education deemed to be necessary by the hospital in preparation for working in the caseload model, caseload midwives will be offered a one day training session by the research team. One third of the day will focus on the research components of the trial and the rest will be in regard to working in this new way-practicalities, personal boundaries, and working in a small group (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for program outline).</p></sec><sec><title>Description of standard care</title><p>Women allocated to the control group can choose from the standard hospital options for low risk women; these include midwifery-led care &#x02013; which may involve some continuity or could mean women seeing a different midwife for every visit; care by junior medical obstetric staff; or community based care &#x02013; usually shared care with an accredited general medical practitioner (GP) (i.e. the GP provides the majority of the woman's antenatal care, usually nearer to her home, but the woman is booked for labour, birth and postnatal care at the hospital). In both the midwife-led and GP-led models women would be booked to see an obstetrician at 36 and 42 weeks gestation, with other referral or consultation as necessary. When women come into the hospital for labour, birth and postnatal care they will be cared for by whichever midwives and doctors are rostered for duty. Care will be provided according to the same hospital guidelines and protocols as for the women in the intervention arm.</p><p>It is possible that some women allocated to either the intervention or the control group will seek other care options, such as care with a private obstetrician or midwife, but neither of these is available at the Royal Women's Hospital. In this event we aim to obtain all data as planned, and analysis will be by intention-to-treat.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Adherence to the study protocol will be monitored and intervention fidelity measured in a range of ways.</p><sec><title>Measures of intervention exposure</title><p>Data regarding the extent to which care was provided by the primary midwife will be collected from the medical record following the birth and from the women via postal questionnaire at two months. To assess and compare continuity of carer, women in both trial arms will be asked about the presence of known care providers for labour, birth, postnatal hospital care and domiciliary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Caseload midwife meetings</title><p>Monthly team meetings will be held with the caseload midwives and a member of the research team (DF) to provide support and give an opportunity for problem-solving and debriefing. The research team member will be available to the caseload midwives before and after meetings and will be contactable between meetings by email or telephone. Protocol adherence will be discussed at team meetings. Other key support for the caseload midwives will be from their clinical manager(s) as well as from the Director of Maternity Services (TF).</p></sec><sec><title>Adherence to protocols</title><p>Three sources will contribute to assessing adherence to the intervention protocols: interviews with the intervention midwives at the beginning and end of the trial; monthly meetings between the caseload midwives and the research team member; and data collection from the medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention evaluation by participants</title><p>The postal questionnaire sent to women at two months will include a number of questions about women's model of care and continuity of carer. Questions will also assess satisfaction with model of care provision.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention evaluation by caseload midwives, non-caseload midwives and other key stakeholders</title><p>Comprehensive evaluation of how the intervention works within the organisation will be undertaken using surveys and key informant interviews.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><sec><title>Trial participants</title><p>&#x025cb; A background demographic data questionnaire will be completed by women at the time of recruitment, prior to randomisation.</p><p>&#x025cb; Obstetric/medical data will be collected manually from the medical record following the birth.</p><p>&#x025cb; Data will be collected at two and six months postpartum by postal survey. Questionnaires will be mailed by the research midwives and/or project coordinator. A covering letter will be sent with each questionnaire and a reply paid envelope included. To maximise response, a reminder letter will be sent two weeks after the first mailing, then if there is no response in another two weeks women will receive a second reminder letter that includes another copy of the questionnaire. When these questionnaires are returned they will be checked for women's responses to the self harm question (Q10) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and if a woman has indicated that the thought about harming herself has occurred to her "quite often" in the last week she will be telephoned according to a pre-specified protocol (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Caseload midwives, non-caseload midwives and other key stakeholders</title><p>&#x025cb; <italic>A </italic>questionnaire will be administered to all caseload midwives and non-caseload midwives near the beginning and at completion of the trial.

The intervention group will be compared with the standard care group by intention to treat analysis. Proportions of women having a caesarean section will be compared using chi-square tests and odds/risk ratios. Comparison of means will be undertaken for continuous variables using t-tests where data are normally distributed or medians compared using Mann-Whitney U tests otherwise. Ranked or Likert-type scales will be analysed using cumulative odds ratios. Where there are differences in baseline characteristics of the women in the two groups which might be associated with outcomes, an additional multivariate analysis will be carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Analysis of open-ended questions from surveys will be undertaken using simple thematic analysis and coded into themes. Key informant interviews will be transcribed verbatim and the transcripts checked against the audiotape for accuracy.

Transcripts will be read and reread to gain an overall perspective then a step by step approach used. A coding framework will be developed to reduce the text to meaningful manageable parts. Basic emerging themes will be identified, then summarised into more abstract groups (organising themes) and finally summarised as overriding metaphors, or global themes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study administration</title><sec><title>Personnel</title><p>Principal investigators</p><p>Dr. Helen McLachlan (Mother and Child Health Research &#x00026; Division of Nursing &#x00026; Midwifery, La Trobe University)</p><p>Dr. Della Forster (Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University &#x00026; Royal Women's Hospital)</p><p>Ms. Mary-Ann Davey (Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University &#x00026; Consultative Council on Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity (CCOPMM), Victorian Department of Human Services)</p><p>Professor Judith Lumley (Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University)</p><p>Ms Tanya Farrell (Royal Women's Hospital)</p><p>Professor Jeremy Oats (initially Royal Women's Hospital, later CCOPMM, Victorian Department of Human Services)</p><p>Ms. Lisa Gold (Deakin University)</p><p>Professor Ulla Waldenstr&#x000f6;m (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm)</p></sec><sec><title>Associate investigators</title><p>Dr. Mary Anne Biro (Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University)</p><p>Professor Leah Albers (University of New Mexico, USA)</p></sec><sec><title>Project team</title><p>Helen McLachlan</p><p>Della Forster</p><p>Mary-Ann Davey</p><p>Judith Lumley</p><p>Tanya Farrell</p><p>Mary Anne Biro</p><p>Lisa Gold</p><p>Michelle Newton</p></sec><sec><title>Project coordinator</title><p>Mary Anne Biro</p></sec><sec><title>Research midwives</title><p>Michelle Kealy</p><p>Sue Veljanovski</p><p>Jo Rayner</p><p>Cath Fitzsimon</p></sec><sec><title>Health economics research assistant</title><p>Bree Rankin</p></sec><sec><title>Job descriptions of required personnel</title><p>Position descriptions: Project coordinator; Research Midwife and Health economics research assistant (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Staff education</title><p>Research midwives will be required to undertake one day of initial orientation regarding the project overall, including the data collection tools, the recruitment process and interview techniques.

Many RCTs of continuity of midwifery care compared with standard medical care have reported no statistically significant differences in perinatal morbidity or mortality and have reported increased satisfaction with care in the continuity of midwifery arm. The model to be trialed focuses much more on continuity of carer rather than continuity by a team of carers, and thus benefits or potential harms will not be known until results are available.</p><p>This study includes women who are at low medical risk and excludes women at high risk. A strict protocol will be followed for women who develop complications. If a woman in the intervention arm develops medical or obstetric complications she will be transferred to medical care as per the hospital protocol, but in addition will continue to receive caseload midwifery care.</p><p>There is evidence from RCTs that continuity of midwifery care may lead to reduced caesarean sections and operative vaginal births, and a decrease in other interventions in labour including induction, augmentation, analgesia use and episiotomy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data monitoring and safety committees</title><p>A data monitoring committee will be established comprising an external statistician, a clinical expert and an expert in RCTs to check the randomisation and undertake an interim analysis.
