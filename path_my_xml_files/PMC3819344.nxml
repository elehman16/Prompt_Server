Children with reading problems were exposed either to a self-paced computer programme that focused on improving phonetic ability, or underwent a classroom-based reading intervention. Exposure was limited to 3 40-min sessions a week, for six weeks. The children were assessed in terms of their reading, spelling, and mathematics abilities, as well as for their externalising and internalising behaviour problems, before the programme commenced, and immediately after the programme terminated. Relative to the control group, the computer-programme improved reading by about seven months in boys (but not in girls), but had no impact on either spelling or mathematics. Children on the programme also demonstrated fewer externalising and internalising behaviour problems than the control group. The results suggest that brief exposure to a self-paced phonetic computer-teaching programme had some benefits for the sample.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basic literacy levels are a concern in many countries. For example, the National Assessment of Adult Literacy in the USA found that 40% adults function in the lowest categories of ability <xref rid="pone.0077867-US1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In the UK, the reading ability of 20% of adults is below that expected of an 11 year old child <xref rid="pone.0077867-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Such poor literacy skills are also linked to poor future employment success <xref rid="pone.0077867-Dugdale1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and to a worse prognosis for health <xref rid="pone.0077867-Bostock1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Given such findings, literacy is seen by many governments as a key area to target for pupils in schools.</p><p>In fact, developing reading skills is paramount to the development of the pupil through school, and mastery of literacy skills will facilitate pupils' progress through the education system and, later, in the workplace. Individuals at risk from reading difficulties endure a slow and laboured progression to attain a similar level of academic achievement as their class peers <xref rid="pone.0077867-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Additionally, a struggling reader may have a greater tendency to exhibit problem behaviours <xref rid="pone.0077867-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and have a tendency to display heightened signs of stress <xref rid="pone.0077867-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, reading ability impacts both academic attainment, and behavioural and emotional problems <xref rid="pone.0077867-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An examination of internalising behaviours (e.g., anxiety, depression) and externalising behaviours (e.g., aggression, theft) in a sample of 6&#x02013;8 year old children established a link between externalising behaviours and poor academic achievement, and also peer-victimisation. In turn, underachievement and peer-victimisation predicted greater internalising and externalising behaviours <xref rid="pone.0077867-vanLier1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Similarly, first-grade pupils in the USA, who were identified as poor readers, displayed greater probabilities of poor task engagement, poor self-control, and externalising and internalising behaviour problems two years later <xref rid="pone.0077867-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, slow reading acquisition has been found to be associated with cognitive, behavioural, and motivational consequences; this prevents establishing optimum conditions for further cognitive development, as knowledge-based tasks that are dependent on reading skills are inhibited, attenuating development; in contrast, pupils with good reading skills advance at a rate where success generates further success, a phenomenon referred to as the &#x02018;Matthew effect&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Stanovich1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, reading delay can be considered to have an impact upon the whole curriculum within schools.</p><p>Reading difficulties are linked to deficits in a variety of basic skills, such as: phonological processing <xref rid="pone.0077867-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077867-Hatcher1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, sound discrimination <xref rid="pone.0077867-Harford1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and letter-blending and segmenting <xref rid="pone.0077867-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077867-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, the ability to recognise words by sight at speed, requires practice and repetition, and a lack of such abilities will hinder reading skills <xref rid="pone.0077867-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, increasing the academic gap between pupils. To overcome some of these problems, the implementation of efficient phonics programmes has been suggested to ensure pupils become fluent readers <xref rid="pone.0077867-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A phonics programme, typically, begins with teaching very basic elements such as letter sounds, and proceeds to introduce sounds that are placed together and read at a quicker pace to produce &#x02018;blending&#x02019;. In this regard, pupils typically begin with constant-vowel-constant (CVC) words, such as &#x02018;hen&#x02019;, &#x02018;rat&#x02019;, &#x02018;sun&#x02019;, and later extend to more complex words <xref rid="pone.0077867-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Following this, pupils are introduced to digraphs, which are two sounds that together make one sound, such as &#x02018;sh&#x02019;, and &#x02018;ch&#x02019;.</p><p>Theoretically, phoneme-based programmes have suggested several routes to account for the success achieved, and it is considered that phonological abilities are a major cause of word reading skills <xref rid="pone.0077867-Muter1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For example, research assessing onset&#x02013;rhyme skills and phoneme awareness as predictors of word recognition shows both phoneme sensitivity, and letter knowledge, to be predictors of subsequent word recognition <xref rid="pone.0077867-Muter1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As a consequence, interventions that incorporate phonemic awareness with letter knowledge serve to promote decoding skills in children with poor reading skills <xref rid="pone.0077867-Snowling1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The beneficial effects of early implementation of a synthetic phonics and analytic programme have been demonstrated in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0077867-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The intervention reported in this study lasted 16 weeks, and included a multisensory approach to train synthetic phonics, via blending sounds together, for reading and spelling. Following training, participants illustrated an increase in reading ability seven months ahead of their chronological age. Similarly, intensive discrete phonic reinforcement and consolidation techniques have been studied <xref rid="pone.0077867-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this programme, words were decoded, and then returned to their original forms (encoded), and children were encouraged to analyse and practice sound blends. There were improvements in reading accuracy, and comprehension, and 50% of the cohort achieved an increase of around two years in reading age within six months. Such structured phonics-based approaches are now considered more effective for the remediation of reading problems than non-phonetic methods <xref rid="pone.0077867-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077867-Sharpies1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Recent phonic interventions employed in the UK include: &#x02018;Catch Up Literacy&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, &#x02018;Toe by Toe&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Cowling1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, &#x02018;Sound Linkage&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Hatcher2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, &#x02018;Alpha to Omega&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Hornsby1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and &#x02018;Literacy Acceleration&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0077867-Lingard1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>However, a practical problem with many of these approaches is that they are one-to-one interventions, with a progressive developmental approach to teaching language skills, and the level of intervention required to improve reading ability is often quite intense, involving significant costs in terms of teacher time. One suggested solution to this problem involved the adoption of technologies to aid teachers cope with large classes of differing abilities <xref rid="pone.0077867-Skinner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Recent efforts in language intervention have utilised ICT, partly with the aim of reducing levels of direct teacher intervention, and making the programmes more accessible to greater numbers of children. However, success with such ICT-based interventions has been mixed <xref rid="pone.0077867-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0077867-Saine1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In some of these studies, the relative lack of success has been attributed to a variety of factors such as a limited sample, that students were removed from normal lessons to take part in the intervention <xref rid="pone.0077867-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, other research has demonstrated greater success. For example, the Finnish Remedial Reading Intervention (RRI) &#x02013; a phonics programme taught in the classroom &#x02013; and the Computer Assisted Remedial Reading Intervention (CARRI) &#x02013; a combination of RRI and a graphogame that provides practice of letter-sound correspondence and phonemic awareness &#x02013; provided good evidence of effectiveness in seven year-old school beginners in mainstream schools <xref rid="pone.0077867-Saine1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Such success points to the potential usefulness of computerised interventions to reinforce traditional methods of remedial interventions in mainstream schooling.</p><p>While this evidence supports the notion that computer programmes might be a significant advance and help in this area, there are clearly some issues to resolve in terms of documenting the effectiveness of these approaches and with regard to making such programmes more effective. One potential issue for such self-paced computer programmes is the degree to which they may motivate the children to participate through the appropriate delivery of reinforcers for their performance. Motivation to read has been identified as a major factor in developing this skill <xref rid="pone.0077867-Wigfield1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the above studies, some studies report no use of reinforcers for pupil performance <xref rid="pone.0077867-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Others do report the use of particular reinforcers <xref rid="pone.0077867-Given1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077867-Saine1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but do not report the degree to which these were viewed as effective by the pupils. This latter issue could be important for any self-paced computer-based reading intervention <xref rid="pone.0077867-Flora1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The current report aims to assess the effectiveness of the &#x02018;Self Learn Read and Spell Programme&#x02019; in enhancing reading ability in secondary school aged pupils. This presents the stages of a phonics reading programme, via a self-paced computer-programme, in combination with performance-based access to pupil-chosen computer games. The computer games employed as reinforcers were developed in conjunction with software engineers, and had been pre-tested on pupils to gauge their engagement. After each stage of the phonic programme, the computer-programme allowed access to a computer-game (selected by the pupil), dependent upon the performance of the pupil in that previous stage. The primary aims of this research project were to add to the literature on the effectiveness of computer-assisted reading programmes relative to traditional approaches, and to explore the impact of brief exposure to the reading programme on changes in the pupils' reading ability, as previous programmes had been employed over considerable time periods. As a control to see the specificity of the intervention, the pupils' abilities in spelling and mathematics were also assessed, which the current reading programme might not be expected to impact so strongly, if at all. Additionally, the pupils' behavioural functioning, in terms of their externalising and internalising problems, was assessed to determine if exposure to the programme improved these aspects of behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the Department of Psychology Ethics Committee, Swansea University.

A screen shot of one of the games is seen in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077867-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0077867-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0077867.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Screen shots of computer game used as a reinforcer (top panel), and part of the teaching programme (bottom panel).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0077867.g001"/></fig><p>The programme has 23 levels of teaching. For example, it starts with a review of the alphabet (Level 1), and then moves to a basic phonic word teaching phase (Level 2). Three-letter phonic words are contained in Level 2 (e.g., cat, kit, fun, jet, pan, tap, etc). This gives the user practise in the constant combinations, vowel blending, and phonic combination, with easy words, which will give them confidence and the ability to spell 150 words. Level 3 moves onto four-letter words, with a combination of two letters with a single and double sound (e.g., th, wh, ng, sh, ch, qu, ck). Levels 5 and 6 cover the silent &#x02018;e&#x02019; (fat&#x02013;fate), and Level 7 deals with double vowels where only one vowel is sounded (e.g., boat, dead, steak). Level 8 teaches the &#x02018;o&#x02019; sounds (e.g., hop, hope, cold, cow, rough), and Level 9 highlights the &#x02018;oo&#x02019; sound (e.g., boot, blue, crew).

At the same time, the psychologist asked the pupil's teacher to complete the SDQ and CDI about the children selected for inclusion. The children were then randomly divided into two groups: one group completed six weeks of exposure to the above computer programme; and the other group remained in their normal reading classes for that period of time. These reading classes comprised the use of eclectic methods for teaching reading, including phonics and whole-word techniques, but were not delivered by a computer. Both groups of children experienced three, 40 min sessions a week of their intervention, for a period of six weeks. In both groups, the children worked in small groups (4&#x02013;6) in a class with a teacher and a learning support assistant. In the case of the computer programme, the children worked singly at a computer at there own pace through the programme, and could ask for assistance if they needed help. After the six weeks, the pupils were reassessed by the same psychologist in terms of their BAS scores, and the same teacher again completed the SDQ and CDI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>

Using the change scores is a widely adopted procedure in the literature relating to the effectiveness of interventions, and also accommodates differences in baseline measures without having to include those measures in an analysis of covariance, which would involve assumptions about the manner in which baseline and outcome scores were related, and dramatically increases the needed sample size, thus, reducing power to detect change. Inspection of these data reveals that the boys exposed to the programme demonstrated relatively larger gains than the boys not exposed to the programme, but that there was very little difference between the two groups of girls.

The results demonstrated that brief exposure to the programme (six weeks) led to improvements in reading for boys (but not girls), and during the period of intervention, the behaviour problems in both boys and girls exposed to the programme improved relative to a control group receiving additional tuition in reading but who were not using the computer programme.</p><p>The fact that reading ability was improved by exposure to a computer-based reading programme suggests that such self-paced computer-approaches may have utility in developing reading abilities at a greater rate. These impacts on reading suggest that the improvements noted with other computer-programmes <xref rid="pone.0077867-Saine1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, employed over longer periods of time, can be replicated, even with relatively short exposures. That exposure to the current computer programme did improve reading, while several other demonstrations showed little improvement <xref rid="pone.0077867-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077867-Given1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, may potentially be attributable to a variety of factors, which will need exploration. However, the employment of effective reinforcers in the current programme, which was integral to development of the computer-programme, may be of note <xref rid="pone.0077867-Skinner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Certainly, the use of appropriately selected reinforcers has been shown to be a necessary component in reading programmes <xref rid="pone.0077867-Flora1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although some consideration of potential impacts of such reinforcement-based schemes on pupil's intrinsic motivation is required <xref rid="pone.0077867-Kohn1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, a longer follow-up period would be needed to establish this, and it should be noted that there are many demonstrations of reinforcement having no long-term detrimental effect on pupil's motivation to read <xref rid="pone.0077867-Eisenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>The relative benefits of the computer-programme in helping both externalising- and internalising-behaviour problems were also encouraging, and replicate a previous demonstration of this effect <xref rid="pone.0077867-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, while there were improvements in the behaviours of the pupils exposed to the computer programme, this effect seems mainly to be the product of the behaviours of the children in the comparison groups worsening. It is unclear why this would be the case, it might be the case that this is the normal course of development for such a sample, or that their relative inability to read produced greater numbers of behavioural problems. This latter suggests maps onto a further question that remains concerning these findings, which is whether the impacts on reading and behaviour are independent, or mediate, one another; that is, does improvement in reading lead to improvements in behaviour, or vice versa? With a short intervention, and relatively few participants, this is a difficult question to explore with the current data. However, a preliminary mediation-analysis performed on these data for the boys, showed no suggestion that either behaviour mediated the effect of the intervention on reading, or vice versa. The point biserial correlations between intervention and reading outcome, or intervention and behavioural outcomes, were not impacted by the addition of a mediator.</p><p>The difference in the impact of the computer-programme on the reading abilities of boys and girls is a finding that needs further exploration. On the one hand, it may suggest that the specific reinforcers built into the programme may have been more effective for boys compared to girls; and on the other hand, it may suggest that the computer-based approach, as a whole, may be more suited to boys than girls. However, these suggestions need to be tempered by the finding that exposure to the programme did impact on the behaviour problems exhibited by both the girls and the boys, suggesting that some aspects of the intervention were effective for girls. It also could be noted that the girls had a marginally (but not statistically significantly) higher reading ability at the start of the programme than the boys, and this might point to the intervention being more effective with poorer readers. However, this consideration needs to be tempered by the fact that all of the participants were actually poor readers, and these boy-girl differences were marginal. Moreover, further analysis of these reading outcome data, using baseline reading ability as a covariate, had no impact on the pattern of statistical significance reported above, suggesting baseline reading ability was not a contributory factor.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to the study, which should be acknowledged. The measures of reading were limited to the BAS achievement scales, which do not reflect fluency or comprehension, and these aspects of reading will need further exploration. The intervention was also very brief, and, while this is encouraging in one respect, the impact of longer interventions will need to be explored. Moreover, the gains in reading will need to be studied for their maintenance after programme termination. In addition, future work might include a comparison of the current programme with other phonetic computer-teaching programmes <xref rid="pone.0077867-Huffstetter1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Finally, it should be noted that the current sample did not have defined reading problems, but were identified by the school as having such problems, which may mean they were poor-performing in the context of that school, but might not have &#x02018;diagnosable&#x02019; reading difficulties. This means that further work will be needed to see if the current results generalize to such a specific sample.</p><p>In terms of the programme, there are still some developments that could be suggested to improve its effectiveness. The games used as reinforcers could be subject to a stronger reinforcer assessment test, to determine their effectiveness in this capacity. A reinforcer is not determined, as such, by its nature, but by its effects on the frequency of that successful performance in the future, and while the games have been identified as acceptable and pleasurable by the children, the introduction of reinforcer assessment tests, and some aspects of child choice into the programme may facilitate this aspect of the programme.</p><p>In summary, the current report demonstrated that brief-exposure to a computer-based reading programme can have an impact on reading abilities, and also impacts positively on both externalising-behaviours and internalising-behaviour problems. This adds to the literature indicating that such approaches may well be effective, and a potentially useful addition to the set of tools available to teachers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the children, teachers, and schools involved in this research.
