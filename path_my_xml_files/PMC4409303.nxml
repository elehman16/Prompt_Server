Naltrexone, one of few approved medications for the treatment of alcohol dependence, delays relapse to heavy drinking, reduces number of heavy drinking days, and increases number of days abstinent [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Naltrexone is not highly utilized, however, in part due to concerns about non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is well recognized that the efficacy of naltrexone is contingent on high adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, effects of naltrexone versus placebo may only be evident only among patients with high adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and treatment outcomes correlate with adherence rates [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Adequate naltrexone adherence has been defined as taking at least 80% of prescribed doses [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124613.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124613.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Notably, evidence suggests that more rigorous adherence monitoring is associated with greater medication effects [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], suggesting that monitoring alone could improve adherence.</p><p>A number of Internet-based interventions have been developed to address medication adherence for variety of conditions. A review of 13 studies noted that, although some have shown efficacy, only one study used a high-quality measure of adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some form of monitoring was a key component in several of these interventions, and while a few used mobile self-monitoring devices, none used the most ubiquitous and convenient device currently available: the mobile phone. Because mobile phones offer a high degree of access to individuals in their daily lives, they are well suited for just-in-time intervention delivery [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Initial mobile health (mHealth) interventions for improving medication adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have used text message medication reminders, functioning essentially as an alarm clock. In contrast, the present study incorporated a recently developed platform for mobile, web-based adherence reminders that matches intervention intensity to adherence performance, while also assessing self-reported adherence on an ongoing basis. This low-cost, low-resource, easily scalable mHealth intervention, delivered via smartphone, integrates text message reminders and mobile web-based adherence assessment. The present study is a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy for improving naltrexone adherence in a treatment-seeking sample [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We hypothesized that, compared to a control condition involving mobile self-report of side effects, drinking, and craving, the addition of adaptive mobile medication reminders and adherence assessments would be associated with better adherence, which in turn would be associated with better treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0124613.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124613.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants (N = 76) were 21&#x02013;55 years old.

Advertisements stated that researchers were seeking participants who wished to cut down or quit drinking for involvement in a medication study. Those passing a phone screen were scheduled for further in-clinic screening, at which the study was fully described, any questions were answered, and written informed consent was obtained before continuing. Participants then completed a demographics questionnaire, urine drug toxicology and pregnancy screening, and a blood draw. Participants also completed an interview assessment that included a structured diagnostic interview; all participants met criteria for a current (past year) alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence). The study psychiatrist reviewed blood work results and approved those within acceptable limits. Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol for 72 hours prior to their scheduled baseline appointment to facilitate a clinical assessment of withdrawal symptoms using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-Ar) protocol.

To conceal the allocation sequence from study personnel, the process was computer-automated.

Indices of side effects included the proportion reporting any side effects in Days 1&#x02013;7, 1&#x02013;28, and 1&#x02013;56, as well as a side effects score comprising the total number of side effects multiplied by number of days endorsed during each of these periods. Pearson's correlations were used to examine whether the indices of side effects were related to indices of adherence at mid-study or study end.</p><p>Given the once per day dosing schedule for naltrexone, MEMS data were cleaned to ensure that no more than one opening per day was counted as a taken dose. For each participant, the number of doses taken was expressed as a proportion of number of openings divided by number of days for Days 1&#x02013;28 and Days 1&#x02013;56. Each participant was then dichotomously coded as below or above our <italic>a priori</italic> 80% adherence threshold at mid-study and over the full 56 days.</p><p>The primary analysis examined the proportion of patients who were categorized as adherent (i.e., &#x02265;80% of cumulative doses taken), All randomized participants were included in this analysis. If the MEMS cap was not returned, overall adherence was counted as zero. Secondary analyses examining continuous adherence data included both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. For ITT, overall adherence was computed for all randomized participants as a proportion of days on which an opening occurred from Day 1&#x02013;56, unless the MEMS cap was not returned, in which case adherence was coded as 0%. Adherence was examined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the form of hierarchical multiple regression. Variables differing between groups at baseline were entered as covariates on the first step of hierarchical multiple regression analyses. R-square change was evaluated as experimental condition was entered into the regression equation on the second step of the hierarchical analysis. The per-protocol analyses focused on Week 4 outcomes for two reasons. First, participants who did not return for the Week 4 visit did not receive a refill and thus could not adhere for the full 56-day period. Second, the number of participants retained through Week 8 (n = 37) was substantially lower than the number required to detect a significant intervention effect on the primary outcome [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], reflecting high attrition. Given inadequate power to address the primary hypothesis with the Week 8 outcomes, unplanned per-protocol analyses examined mid-study adherence among those attending Week 4 whose MEMS caps were returned (n = 60), excluding 2 participants who had disclosed information invalidating their MEMS data (discarding pills, taking half- or double-doses).</p><p>Given that adherence tends to decline over time, analyses also examined whether the intervention helped participants maintain adequate adherence in the initial weeks of treatment. A secondary (unplanned) survival analysis examined latency to fall below 80% of cumulative doses taken. Daily cumulative adherence was defined as cumulative number of days with a bottle opening divided by cumulative number of days in the trial. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis evaluated whether experimental conditions differed in latency to fall below 80% adherence at midstudy and at study end.</p><p>To evaluate the association of adherence with relapse to heavy drinking, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared those above and below the adherence threshold at mid-study (80% doses taken, collapsed across experimental condition) with regard to two relapse variables derived from the Week 4 TLFB: latency to first drinking day (for those with an abstinence goal) and first day of heavy drinking (&#x02265;4 [women] or &#x02265;5 [men] standard drinks).</p><p>Smartphone alcohol drinking and craving data were aggregated across Days 1&#x02013;28 and 29&#x02013;56 and compared using t-tests. All participants making at least one report during the 28-day period received a mean score for that period. SASED-derived mean drinks per drinking day during Days 1&#x02013;28 and 29&#x02013;56 were compared with TLFB-derived drinks per drinking day for the same periods using Pearson's correlations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec025"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec026"><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>

Results did not support the hypothesis that text message medication reminders and mobile web-based adherence assessment would improve adherence, above and beyond a control condition consisting of mobile assessment of side effects, drinking, and craving. Notably, high attrition resulted in an insufficient sample size at Week 8. In this context it was not surprising that ITT analyses (including all randomized individuals and assigning 0% adherence to those who discontinued) revealed no intervention effect and low overall estimates of adherence (50% cumulative through Week 8). A per-protocol analysis through Week 4 showed adherence rates of 83% (intervention group) and 77% (control group). These rates approach those reported in studies using psychosocial interventions to maximize adherence [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Secondary analyses suggested that the intervention group maintained adequate adherence (&#x02265;80% of doses taken) longer than the control group through Week 4, although the effect was not observed through Week 8. Therefore, one possibility is that mHealth approaches for monitoring adherence (or otherwise maintaining contact with participants) can support adequate short-term adherence in cases where psychosocial interventions are not available. Taken together, these findings suggest that a smartphone intervention involving daily assessment, without or without medication reminders, warrants further evaluation for maintaining adherence to pharmacotherapy among those engaged in treatment. The results further suggest that daily adherence reminders and assessments via smartphone may help sustain adherence during the first weeks of naltrexone treatment, when the incidence of relapse is generally highest. Contrary to other studies, adherence to naltrexone (defined as &#x02265;80% of doses taken) was not associated with significantly longer latencies to first heavy drinking day (for all participants) or first drinking day (among those with an abstinence goal).</p><p>Advantages of the current study include the use of a novel technology designed specifically to support medication adherence during treatment for alcohol use disorders, and the use of MEMS to provide a relatively objective measure of adherence. While MEMS is a widely accepted measure of adherence, it indicates bottle openings rather than actual medication use; having a biomarker of adherence would increase confidence in pill adherence results. The comparison condition sought to control for the possibility that receiving a smartphone and/or using it to perform self-monitoring would exert an effect. The control condition was both a strength and a limitation, as it did not enable us to examine the effect of the intervention compared to treatment-as-usual (i.e., treatment without daily assessments via smartphone). The difference in attention (i.e., the number of text messages) between the conditions could be viewed as a limitation. Other limitations include the short 8-week treatment protocol and a relatively small sample size, in part reflecting the high number of study dropouts and discontinuations between Week 4 and Week 8. Attrition limited the statistical power and utility of the Week 8 assessments. Finally, while secondary analyses indicated that participants in the intervention condition maintained &#x02265;80% adherence significantly longer than control participants, the clinical significance of this outcome has not been validated, and there was no association of medication adherence with drinking outcomes in the current sample.</p><p>This study offers preliminary support for the feasibility of mHealth interventions among treatment-seeking participants with alcohol use disorders. Participant engagement was relatively good in both conditions, with a number of smartphone assessments completed over the course of the study, which addresses concerns that individuals with alcohol dependence would be unlikely to complete mobile assessments [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We expected that accountability for medication adherence via smartphone reminders and assessments improve adherence above and beyond daily alcohol use assessments; however, participants who were merely prompted to report on side effects, drinking, and craving had similar adherence rates as the intervention group, possibly through self-monitoring of the very targets of the medication: drinking and craving. It is important to acknowledge, however, that we did not have a reminder-without-assessment condition, which would be necessary to evaluate how mobile assessment per se compares to adherence reminders alone.</p><p>Evidence that remote monitoring of adherence and/or alcohol use improves treatment engagement would have implications for real-world treatment settings given the low cost of these interventions. All participants received smartphones with unlimited service to use in the study, costing approximately $300 USD per participant. We did not give participants an option to use their own smartphones so as to standardize and control the intervention experience. When such standardization and control are not concerns, intervention cost would be reduced as individuals across socioeconomic classes increasingly already have smartphones [<xref rid="pone.0124613.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nonetheless, prepaid smartphones and service plans are decreasing in cost and may provide a more cost-effective than psychosocial interventions, which require in person attendance with a trained professional. mHealth interventions have additional advantages of requiring minimal staff time and enabling daily contact. Although not used in the current study, feedback loops can be incorporated to alert staff under predetermined conditions, for example, if certain side effects are reported or adherence has not been reported for a period of time.</p><p>In summary, the present findings support the feasibility of implementing a mHealth intervention for supporting adherence to pharmacotherapy among treatment-seeking participants; however, the current results did not support the efficacy of text message reminders on adherence, above and beyond remote assessments of drinking and craving. Despite these findings, trials with larger samples and alternate designs are warranted. In particular, given the use of a relatively rigorous control condition in the present study, future studies should compare mobile assessments and reminders to treatment-as-usual. Further questions include whether mHealth interventions can achieve adherence rates comparable to those achieved with psychosocial adherence interventions, or whether mHealth interventions could enhance effects of psychosocial interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124613.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124613.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124613.s002"><label>S1 Content</label><caption><title>Study Smartphone Message and Assessment Content.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124613.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124613.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study Protrocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124613.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124613.s004"><label>S1 Screenshots</label><caption><title>Screenshots from the Control and Intervention Conditions.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124613.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the project staff and study participants and express appreciation to Dr. Kent Hutchison, Dr. Michael Bogenschutz, and Dr. Jane Simoni for their assistance with this project.
