<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In contrast, heat acclimatisation generally increases PV.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, theoretically, it is possible that combining both stimuli (ie, hypoxic exposure and training in the heat) would provide an additional training stress and afford a substantial improvement in total blood volume and convective O<sub>2</sub> delivery<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and, in turn, high-intensity exercise performance. However, the potential physiological and performance responses to a combination of hypoxic and heat exposure have not been investigated.

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> While these observations may raise questions over the efficacy of the short-term hypoxic training camps in endurance athletes, recent findings still suggest a possible beneficial effect in team sports athletes, under specific environmental conditions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For instance, the Hb<sub>mass</sub> responses to hypoxic exposure being inversely related to athletes&#x02019; baseline Hb<sub>mass</sub>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which is likely lower in team sport players than in endurance athletes, a possibly greater (and hence, substantial) increase in Hb<sub>mass</sub> could be observed in this specific population. It has also been suggested that the short hypoxic exposure time, which is common to team sport camps, could be compensated by an increased level of hypoxia (ie, simulated &#x02265;3000&#x02005;m,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> which may provide increased haematological responses).

Three days prior to the study start, all hypoxic rooms were calibrated by qualified engineers. During the Qatar camp, players were blinded towards the environmental condition to which they were exposed (both for sleeping and training times). However, they were informed about the treatment they received after the last testing session at the Qatar camp based on the coaches&#x02019; decision for motivational purposes. During sleeping/day times, players in the HYP group were exposed to a normobaric hypoxia equivalent to 2500&#x02005;m (FiO<sub>2</sub> 15.2%) for the first 2&#x02005;days/nights of the intervention period. Thereafter, the O<sub>2</sub> fraction was decreased to the equivalent of 2800&#x02005;m (FiO<sub>2</sub> 14.6%, 2 nights) and 3000&#x02005;m (FiO<sub>2</sub> 14.3%, rest of the camp). Participants were confined to their rooms from 16:00 to 19:00, 20:00 to 06:00 and 08:00 to 10:00 during these 2&#x02005;weeks. However, they were encouraged to spend more time in their rooms if desired (but this was not recorded). During all cycling sessions, the HYP group was exposed to normobaric hypoxia equivalent to 2800&#x02005;m.

All players were familiar with this test, as it was part of the regular fitness testing battery implemented by the club. Briefly, the Yo-YoIR2 consists of repeating 20&#x02005;m shuttle runs at increasing speeds (starting at 13&#x02005;km/h) with 10&#x02005;s of active recovery (consisting of 5&#x02005;m of jogging) between runs until exhaustion.

For convenience, all players were tested together with the intensity of the 5&#x02005;min submaximal exercise bout fixed at 13&#x02005;km/h over 40&#x02005;m shuttles (adapted from ref. <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Mean HR during the last 30&#x02005;s of the 5&#x02005;min exercise period was calculated and termed exercise HR (HRex).

Thereafter, they entered the climate chamber (44&#x000b0;C, 44% RH; Tescor, Warminster, Pennsylvania, USA) to perform 24&#x02005;min of walking at 5&#x02005;km/h (1.39&#x02005;m/s, 1% grade) on a treadmill (Cosmed T170, Rome, Italy), followed by 24&#x02005;min of seated rest. No fluids were consumed during the test. HR was also continuously recorded (Polar Team2 1.4.1, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). Sweat loss was calculated as the difference in pretest and post-test body mass as measured using a calibrated electronic scale (weighed in underwear, body dried; Seca, Germany). Sweat samples were collected for the duration of the test through an absorbent pad with protective dressing (Tegaderm+Pad, 3M Health Care, Borken, Germany) positioned on the back (at the level of the right shoulder) of the participant. The skin was cleaned with deionised water prior to application of the pad. Samples were analysed for sodium concentration ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>sweat</sub>; Dimension Xp and Plus, Siemens, Munich, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Jumping performance</title><p>Countermovement jumps (CMJ) were used to estimate explosive strength. The players had been familiarised with this test prior to the study. Prior to testing the players performed a standardised dynamic warm up followed by three submaximal practice jumps. The players then performed three maximal CMJs, with a 2&#x02005;min rest between each. All CMJ's were performed with hands held firmly on the hips and participants were instructed to jump as high as possible. The jumps were performed with a self-selected countermovement depth and the jump with the highest score was used for further analysis. All CMJ's were performed on a commercially available force plate (400 Series Performance Plate&#x02014;Fitness Technology, Adelaide, Australia) connected to a computer running software (Ballistic Measurement System&#x02014;Fitness Technology, Adelaide, Australia) that recorded vertical ground reaction forces at a rate of 200&#x02005;Hz.

Ferritin levels were determined using chemiluminescent immunoassay (Siemens Advia Centaur XP, Siemens Ltd, Erlangen, Germany). Other haematological variables were collected using the same technique and similar equipment in Australia and Qatar. However, to ensure accurate comparisons, data were only compared from within the same laboratory (ie, Australia versus Australia and Qatar versus Qatar). Both measures were considered as baseline values, and data postcamp (Qatar) and 4&#x02005;weeks later (Australia) were therefore expressed as relative changes from their original baseline. Hb<sub>mass</sub> was assessed using the optimised carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing procedure first described by Schmidt and Prommer.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This comprised inspiration of a bolus of 99.5% pure CO (BOC Gases, Sydney, Australia) in a dose of 1&#x02005;mL/kg of body mass that was rebreathed for 2&#x02005;min. A CO sensor (Draeger PAC7000, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) was held in proximity to the mouth throughout the test to check for leaks. Fingertip capillary blood samples (200&#x02005;&#x003bc;L) were analysed in triplicate for per cent carboxyhaemoglobin (%HbCO) using a spectrophotometer (ABL80 Hemoximeter, Radiometer, Denmark) before as well as 7&#x02005;min after starting rebreathing. The CO rebreathing procedure provides an accurate and reliable method of measuring Hb<sub>mass</sub> with a low typical error of &#x0223c;2% in our laboratory (ie, 1.7% (90% CI 1.2% to 3.2%). From the Hb<sub>mass</sub> we calculated BV, red blood cell volume (RCV) and PV according to the following formulas. Haemoglobin concentration (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct) were determined from venous blood samples (Sysmex Corp, Kobe, Japan).

All data were log-transformed for analysis to reduce bias arising from non-uniformity error and then analysed for practical significance using magnitude-based inferences.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We used this qualitative approach because traditional statistical approaches often do not indicate the magnitude of an effect, which is typically more relevant to athletic performance than any statistically significant effect. The chances that the changes in performance or physiological variables were greater for a group or a time point (ie, greater than the smallest worthwhile change, SWC (0.2 multiplied by the between-subject standard deviation, based on Cohen's d principle)), similar or smaller than the other group or another time point were calculated. Quantitative chances of greater or smaller changes in performance or physiological variable were assessed qualitatively as follows: &#x0003e;25&#x02013;75%, possible; &#x0003e;75&#x02013;95%, likely; &#x0003e;95&#x02013;99%, very likely; &#x0003e;99%, almost certain. If the chance of having beneficial/better or detrimental/poorer performances were both &#x0003e;5%, the true difference was assessed as unclear. Since changes in high-intensity running performance might be influenced by baseline training status, changes in Yo-YoIR2 were systematically adjusted for baseline Yo-YoIR2 performance. In a separate analysis, changes in Yo-YoIR2 were also adjusted for changes in CMJ performance (which is likely important for high-intensity running performance including changes of direction). Pearson&#x02019;s product&#x02013;moment correlation analysis was also used to investigate the association between all variables. The following criteria were adopted to interpret the magnitude of the correlation (r) between the different measures: &#x02264;0.1, trivial; 0.1&#x02013;0.3, small; &#x0003e; 0.3&#x02013;0.5, moderate; &#x0003e; 0.5&#x02013;0.7, large; &#x0003e; 0.7&#x02013;0.9, very large and &#x0003e;0.9&#x02013;1.0, almost perfect. If the 90% CL overlapped positive and negative values, the magnitude were deemed unclear; otherwise that magnitude was deemed to be the observed magnitude.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Finally, individual responses to the intervention were calculated from the square root of the variance in the differences in the change scores in the HYP and NORM groups.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A positive value represents greater individual responses to the HYP treatment.

Similarly in both groups, there were very large decreases in submaximal HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F3">figure 3</xref>). While we cannot discount the effects of jet lag/travel fatigue on baseline measures, and a subsequent overestimation of the training camp-induced changes,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> this was likely similar for both groups and the between-group comparisons were unlikely affected. It is also worth noting that the magnitudes of the changes in Yo-YoIR2 performance and HRex were substantially greater than both the SWC<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and the day-to-day variability for both the Yo-YoIR2 (ie, 10%<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and submaximal HR (ie, 3%<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These changes in running performance were also very large compared with what is generally reported within such a limited period of time (ie, 14&#x02013;52% are generally observed after training periods lasting at least 6&#x02212;8&#x02005;weeks<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additionally, while acknowledging that only regular testing sessions (eg, every second week) would allow definitive conclusions on the exact time course of adaptation, the changes in YoYoIR2 performance following the present training camp was similar to that generally observed after 3&#x02005;months of training in this group of AF players (unpublished club historical data). Changes in HRex (&#x02212;8%) were also clearly greater than the SWC<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and those reported in highly trained young handball players following a 2-month high-intensity training intervention (a total of 16 sessions), which resulted only in a 5% decrease in HRex.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Finally, the present data are consistent with recent studies that showed substantial improvement in either high-intensity cycling (ES=+0.3 for work on a 60&#x02005;min time trial<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), submaximal (ES=&#x02212;0.9 for HRex in well-trained soccer players<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), swimming (ES &#x0223c; &#x02212;0.8 for 400&#x02005;m freestyle time<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and high-intensity intermittent running performance (ES=+0.4 for Yo-YoIR Level 1 in well-trained soccer players<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) in temperate conditions following short-term heat training programmes (ie, 5,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> 8<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and 10<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> days). The likely greater changes in performance in the present study compared with the previous soccer study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (as inferred from ES values) might be due to the present study being performed immediately following the off-season period (ie, 4&#x02005;weeks following the previous competitive season, and not in-season as has previously been described<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Moreover, in addition to the skills training sessions, the players in the present study also performed strength and cycling interval sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F1">figure 1</xref>), which may have accelerated the performance adaptations independently of heat exposure.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The greater increase in jumping performance in the HYP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F3">figure 3</xref>) was unexpected given the similar strength training programmes for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F1">figure 1</xref>). Importantly for the present study, however, adjusting the changes in Yo-YoIR2 performance for jumping performance did not modify the interpretations of the findings. This suggests that the differences in neuromuscular function between the two groups did not directly influence the changes in high-intensity running performance. Present data confirm therefore that within no more than a week of training in hot temperatures (32&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C (range 33&#x02212;29&#x000b0;C), 39&#x000b1;5% RH (range 37&#x02212;50%)) for only 11.5&#x02005;h, irrespective of the hypoxic stimulus, there were substantial ergogenic benefits for team sport players when tested in temperate conditions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The observation that there was no clear additional performance benefits for the HYP group is an important finding of the present study, and is consistent with the concept that a minimal &#x02018;hypoxic dose&#x02019; has to be prescribed to observe meaningful changes in physical performance (ie, generally more than 3&#x02212;4&#x02005;weeks<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> or a total of &#x02248;300&#x02005;h<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We also suggest that in comparison with the heat acclimatisation-induced effects, the 3% increase in Hb<sub>mass</sub> in the HYP group was too small to substantially alter more both maximal oxygen uptake and high-intensity running performance.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This conclusion is further reinforced by the blinding of the players toward the intervention (ie, for sleeping and cycle interval training), so that a placebo effect during the post-tests was unlikely in the HYP group.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The mechanisms by which high-intensity running capacity was improved following the camp however remains unclear with present measures, since we did not observe any significant association between the changes in either PV, BV or Hb<sub>mass</sub> and Yo-YoIR2 performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F5">figure 5</xref>). It is therefore possible that other mechanisms (not measured here) may also explain the performance benefits of heat acclimatisation. While the present results are of great relevance for many team sport athletes since such hot environmental conditions can be found in most countries during the spring/summer periods, they also provide new information in that additional hypoxic exposure had no acute benefit on either submaximal HR response or high-intensity running performance within such a short period (ie, &#x0003c;2&#x02005;weeks). Despite the likely beneficial physiological adaptations observed (ie, increased Hb<sub>mass</sub>), present results directly question the efficacy of using hypoxic exposure for obtaining short-term performance benefits in team sport athletes (eg, preparation for competition at sea level). The data detailed below however suggests that hypoxic exposure might augment chronic training effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Delayed effects of the live high-train high and low in the heat model</title><p>Twenty-six days (&#x0223c;4&#x02005;weeks) following the camp, we observed moderate-to-large increases in Hb<sub>mass</sub> and BV in the HYP group, while all blood variables were back to baseline values in NORM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F4">figure 4</xref>). The very likely 6% increase in Hb<sub>mass</sub> 4&#x02005;weeks after the camp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F4">figure 4</xref>) was well above both the SWC and the typical error of measurement in our laboratories (&#x0003c;2%), and within the range of usual random variations in athletes (ie, &#x02264;3%<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Additionally, this 6% increase was similar to the &#x02248;5% increase generally reported following either classic altitude or live high-train low (LHTL) programmes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The present study is the first to show the time course of Hb<sub>mass</sub> responses following a combined heat+hypoxic training camp in team sport athletes. In addition, the observation of greater Hb<sub>mass</sub> values 4WPost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F4">figure 4</xref>) is a unique observation, irrespective of the hypoxic stimulus and/or athletes considered. It should be acknowledged that the lack of a clear control of training load during the postcamp period is a limitation of the present study. However, the players from both groups, as professional team sport athletes, reported good adherence to the unsupervised training period and, as such, no between-group differences in training loads were apparent. Additionally, the magnitude of the observed increase in Hb<sub>mass</sub> in the HYP group (ie, 3% in 4&#x02005;weeks) was likely greater than any possible between-group difference in the training effect on Hb<sub>mass</sub> (a 1% change in Hb<sub>mass</sub> for a 10% difference in training load<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and there were no substantial changes in Hb<sub>mass</sub> in the NORM group. Taken together, these data suggest that the observed Hb<sub>mass</sub> increase in the HYP group might be related to a delayed erythropoiesis consecutive to the first camp, which might have been potentiated with the initial heat exposure. The prolonged Hb<sub>mass</sub> increase following the camp is particularly surprising given the reduced training load during the postcamp period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F1">figure 1</xref>), which may be expected to be associated with a slightly decreased Hb<sub>mass</sub>.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Data on Hb<sub>mass</sub> changes following hypoxic exposure differ, with authors reporting either a further increase that may last a week,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> or an immediate decrease<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> leading to prealtitude values within 4&#x02212;6&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Irrespective of the possible reasons for these changes in Hb<sub>mass</sub>, the higher values 4WPost in the HYP group likely explains the maintenance of blood volume (with respect to haemoconcentration normalisation), despite the absence of heat exposure during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F4">figure 4</xref>). The present observations also confirm that physiological responses to hypoxic exposure<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> are highly individual and likely dependent on the individual psychophysiological characteristics of each athlete (ie, the individual responses in both Hb<sub>mass</sub> and BV were &#x0223c;1/2 of the mean change in the HYP groups). The present results also show that in an applied setting with elite team sport players, the long-term physiological effects of a short training block in the heat may be limited. Indeed, in comparison with the end of the heat exposure period, PV decreased in the NORM group 4WPost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F4">figure 4</xref>). While PV increased further in the HYP group 4WPost, this increase was relatively (ie, compared with changes in the NORM group) lower than that for BV. The increased PV was therefore more likely related to the increase in Hb<sub>mass</sub> and compensatory fluid adjustments aimed at regulating blood hemoconcentration rather than heat-induced mechanisms. It is in fact possible that the performance benefits dissipate as acclimatisation-induced mechanisms normalise. Although such information is limited for heat exposure in elite team sport players, the characteristic adaptations to heat have been shown to return to normal values &#x0223c;3&#x02005;weeks following cessation of acclimation exposure.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p><p>In parallel to these hematological changes 4WPost, there was a possible trend for a better maintenance of Yo-YoIR2 performance in the HYP compared with NORM group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F2">figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F3">3</xref>). Despite large interindividual variations in changes in Yo-YoIR2 performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F2">figure 2</xref>, the SD for 4WPost-Post changes were 32% and 11% for NORM and HYP group, respectively), and the unsupervised training during the postcamps phase, these results are in accordance with empirical observations showing that enhanced physical performances generally occur 2&#x02212;4&#x02005;weeks following hypoxic exposure.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While it could be intuitive that the observed changes in BV provided an ergogenic benefit<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and contributed to the better maintenance of Yo-YoIR2 performance in HYP compared with NORM group, there was no direct association between these variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092559F5">figure 5</xref>), suggesting that other mechanisms (not measured here) may also explain the delayed performance benefits of the hypoxic exposure.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> For example, the multifactorial cascade of responses induced by hypoxia including angiogenesis, glucose transport, glycolysis and pH regulation, may partially explain improved high-intensity endurance performance independent of a greater Hb<sub>mass</sub>.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Specific beneficial non-hematological factors also include improved muscle efficiency probably at a mitochondrial level, greater muscle buffering and the ability to tolerate lactic acid production.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Players in the HYP group also performed seven &#x02018;interval cycling sessions&#x02019; in hypoxia during the camp. Despite inconsistencies, training &#x02018;high&#x02019; has been suggested to trigger muscle adaptation to compensate for decreased O<sub>2</sub> availability during exercise, which can have direct implications for high-intensity intermittent running performance.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Additionally, despite the lack of a direct transfer of the hypoxic exposure into improved performance immediately following the camp, the training and environmental stimulus provided in HYP group may have facilitated the training adaptations. This may also explain the better maintenance of Yo-YoIR2 running performance observed 4&#x02005;weeks after the camp.</p><p>Finally, while the hypoxic treatment was blinded to the players during the initial part of the camp, they were informed about the treatment they received after the last testing session of the first camp (based on the coaches&#x02019; decision for motivational purposes). Before this occurred however, when questioned 11 of the 17 participants correctly predicted the experimental treatment allocated. Therefore, we are unable to completely rule out the possibility of a placebo effect in explaining the better maintenance of performance in the HYP group 4WPost. Moreover, it is possible that differences in player's individual training load during the 4WPost period could also have affected present results.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the primary limitations of the present study was our inability to both examine the independent heat effects, and document training loads during the unsupervised training period.

We also acknowledge the lack of a clear control of the effectiveness of the blinding.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Another limitation is related to only having single Hb<sub>mass</sub> measures at each time point. While duplicate measures would have decreased the possible error of measurement, increasing the number of blood samples was unrealistic with the present population of elite professional players. In contrast, we consider that the elite standard of the players&#x02019; and the realistic training setting enhanced the ecological validity of the present investigation of elite players&#x02019; training practices.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Practical applications</title><p>While the specific effects of sleeping versus cycling in hypoxia, as well as that of a possible placebo effect on changes in performance could not be deciphered, the actual efficiency of such a training camp for the majority of the players still lends support to its implementation during the preseason in team sports.

It is however worth noting that the difference in the maintenance of Yo-YoIR2 performance 4&#x02005;weeks after the camp was rather small between the two experimental groups (ES=+0.3); the decision to add a hypoxic stimuli during sleeping and some training sessions has therefore to be taken with a cost/benefit approach. Finally, the large between-athlete variability of response and lack of association between change in Hb<sub>mass</sub> and/or PV, BV and change in Yo-YoIR2 performance imply that factors other than accelerated erythropoiesis and BV expansion contribute to observed performance improvements. Therefore, future work should be conducted to examine the factors that determine the responders from non-responders to heat+hypoxic exposure. This information could then be used to make informed decisions about individualising training/living conditions so that performance and physiological adaptations could be optimised. The proposed actions to individualise training camps include frequent monitoring of the changes in HR-derived measures<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the utilisation of a heat-response test.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, a very large increase in high-intensity running performance was observed after only 1&#x02005;week of training in the heat in elite football players.

Moreover, 4&#x02005;weeks later, hematological variables remained elevated and high-intensity running performance tended to be maintained only in the hypoxic group. Pending confirmatory research, present results suggest that a combination of heat and hypoxic training/exposure might offer a promising &#x02018;conditioning cocktail&#x02019; in team sports exercising at sea level in temperate environments. More research is still needed to identify the factors affecting the individual responses and therefore optimise such interventions at the individual player level. Further investigations are also warranted in team sport players to demonstrate the optimal dosing and timing of such heat+hypoxic camps, and to examine how this may translate into competitive match outcomes.
