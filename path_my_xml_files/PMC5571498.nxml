The adult gut mycobiota, which probably comprise approximately 13% of the gut microbial volume, consists of a species selection from approximately 140 different fungal genera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with the most abundant ones being <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Cladosporium</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Gut microbiota has been extensively studied over the last two decades. The Human Microbiome Project, or HMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the human microbial community structure, although no comprehensive and uniformly processed database can represent the human gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Fungal communities are far less studied. However, a positive association between the archaeon <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> with relative abundance differences in <italic>Prevotella</italic> might exist. Similarly, the relative abundance differences in <italic>Bacteriodes</italic> are associated with the archaeon <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic>, and they are negatively correlated with gut fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The human gut mycobiota confers several physiological effects to the human body. These fungi consume nutrients and may facilitate nutrient extraction and assist in digestion through enzyme and vitamin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The gut mycobiota is also essential as a form of antigen exposures to train the immune system and its responses. Through activating the fungus-specific pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) and adjacent mechanisms, defences against harmful pathogens and likewise a tolerance towards helpful commensals are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">However, for some humans, fungi can have unfavourable impacts, and the term <italic>fungal dysbiosis</italic> describes a state of unbalanced mycobiota associated with disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This phenomenon is most extensively studied in immunocompromised patients who regularly contract opportunistic commensal fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and in patients with obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Obesity and metabolic disorders have been associated with the increased presence and abundance of <italic>Saccharomycetes</italic> spp., <italic>Dipodascaceae</italic> spp. and <italic>Tremellomycetes</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are pro-inflammatory states, and <italic>Tremellomycetes</italic> spp. are associated with higher inflammation levels. Accordingly, a lower abundance of the ascomycotic <italic>Eurotiomycetes</italic> spp. and particularly less of the zygomycotic <italic>Mucor</italic> spp. might actually protect against an unhealthy metabolic profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. By contrast, IBD patients host lower concentrations of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and more <italic>Candida albicans</italic> than healthy subjects do. In this disorder, an increased Basidiomycota-Ascomycota ratio is also observed, along with increased fungal diversity and richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, many IBD and obesity patients also produce anti-<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], although they host different abundance levels of these gut fungi. Taken together, these findings imply that the gut mycobiota could be aetiologically important in human diseases.</p><p id="Par25">An understanding of the role of the gut mycobiota is emerging in relation to physiological as well as pathophysiological processes, but there is little knowledge of how the mycobiome is shaped from early life. High abundances of the genera <italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> (species-non-specific) were found in 10 Italian children who were each sampled once from 0 to 2&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, some common species have been studied. <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Malassezia</italic> spp. are partly transferred vertically from mothers to their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], supporting the theory that fungi colonise the neonatal gut through the birth canal. Culturing has also shown that the <italic>Candida</italic> spp. prevalence in neonates is 23%, and it more than doubles to 50% within 4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The paradigm of the sterile intrauterine environment is now shifting, and several studies confirm the prenatal presence of commensal bacterial taxa in the placenta and amniotic fluid and the possible transmission of these bacteria to the foetus long before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Corresponding knowledge on fungi is scarce. Early life microbiomes can also be affected by maternal exposure during pregnancy, ranging from high-fat diets to probiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Generally, we know that the mycobiome may be shaped by bacteria-fungus interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], as well as by the diet, by probiotics and by antibiotic administration (as shown in mice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, the settling of early mycobiota with respect to the quantity, diversity and association with the maternal mycobiome has not been described before nor has the probiotic impact on the mycobiota been investigated.</p><p id="Par26">In this prospective cohort, we describe the gut mycobiota in 298 pairs of healthy pregnant women and offspring from birth to 2&#x000a0;years of age. We report major shifts in the fungal abundance and diversity within these populations, and it supports the idea of a succession of mycobiotic hosting from mother to child and over the first 2&#x000a0;years of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Material</title><p id="Par27">We selected 298 mother-offspring pairs with at least one pair of faecal samples from mothers and offspring who participated in the Probiotics in the Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim study (ProPACT) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The ProPACT study is a population-based, randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded trial on probiotics from Trondheim, Norway, and it has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Briefly, the pregnant women who attended the regular Norwegian Antenatal Care Programme were asked to participate by completing questionnaires on their health and risk factors and by collecting faecal samples from themselves and their offspring. The health questionnaire details, including antibiotic administration, were collected at 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestation and 6&#x000a0;weeks, 1&#x000a0;year and 2&#x000a0;years after birth. Although we do not have details on the antibiotic administration in the offspring before 10&#x000a0;days of life, no offspring that were delivered by caesarean section received antibiotics during labour, but one developed septicaemia afterwards and was treated accordingly. The probiotic milk administration was double-blinded and randomly provided to one half of the pregnant population from 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestation until 3&#x000a0;months after birth. The probiotic milk contained 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs) of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG), 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>10</sup> CFUs of <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> Bb-12 and 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>10</sup> CFUs of <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> La-5 per day.

</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quantification</title><p id="Par29">We used a protocol for bacterial DNA extraction that involved mechanical and chemical cell lysis. The stool samples were homogenised by bead beating with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). We isolated the DNA with an LGC mag nucleic extraction maxi kit (LGC Genomics, Middlesex, UK) together with a KingFisher FLEX magnetic particle processor (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations, including a negative control as contamination control. Fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons were constructed using the primer pairs ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2 (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC), according to Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The fungal ITS quantities in 1516 samples were assessed with a LightCycler qPCR (Roche) of 50&#x000a0;cycles, using thermocycles comprising 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 15&#x000a0;min, then (95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 30&#x000a0;s, 56&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 30&#x000a0;s, 72&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 45&#x000a0;s)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;50. For each qPCR plate, we included positive and negative controls (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and sterile water, respectively). The qPCR cycle threshold (CT) value cut-off for fungal detection was set to either within the value of the negative control or to 45&#x000a0;cycles, because DNA quantification beyond 45&#x000a0;cycles can produce misleading results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene ITS1 region</title><p id="Par30">Since many of the samples had low ITS DNA quantities, we chose to sequence the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene ITS1 region of only those samples with sufficiently high ITS DNA quantities. We used a CT value of less than 35&#x000a0;cycles as the cut-off for sequencing. For the sequencing preparation, we measured the ITS DNA concentrations of the 125 selected ITS DNA samples (in addition to four positive and four negative controls) with FLx 800 cse (Cambrex), and they were normalised with a Biomek 3000 (Beckman Coulter) and prepared for amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq v3 600-cycle chemistry, according to the producer&#x02019;s instructions. Four positive and four negative controls were also included to the library. The library was quantified by using a Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR, BioRad) and then diluted to a concentration recommended for sequencing. We then performed gene paired-read sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene ITS1 region on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). Resulting sequencing reads were first filtered out based on the quality score (minimum average <italic>q</italic>-score 25) and the barcode (no mismatches in the barcode were allowed). Remaining sequences were then pair-end joined and further filtered through UPARSE algorithm (max expected error (maxEE) value set to 0.25). The sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene ITS1 region produced a total of 3,722,830 reads. The median number of reads per sample was 16,355 reads and the mean was 27,991 reads, ranging from 3 to 119,463 reads per sample. We then used 6000 reads per sample as a cut-off for the rarefaction to ensure even representation of each sample in the dataset. The final dataset comprised 100 samples with more than 6000 sequences per sample and a total of 214 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Ten of the samples were later discarded due to incorrect inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 90 samples in the analysis (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">We used the QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology) pipeline for quality filtering and diversity estimation, whereas the UPARSE algorithm was used for OTU clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

These proportions cohere with the findings of an Italian cross-sectional fungal cultivation study on children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Many of the fungal species that we detected in the offspring have previously been detected in the adult gut (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>D. hansenii</italic>, an ubiquitous <italic>Saccharomycetaceae</italic> species that is often used in the food industry as a cheese yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], dominates the offspring gut mycobiota during the breast-feeding period. <italic>D. hansenii</italic> can stem from breast milk because this fluid was the only dietary component at 3&#x000a0;months, and similar yeasts (<italic>C. albicans</italic>) have been found in breast milk before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. <italic>D. hansenii</italic> has also been found on the facial skin of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. <italic>D. hansenii</italic> has previously been cultured from human faeces and has been shown to grow well in milky environments like cheese and possibly breast milk, since some strains are known to grow at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. All these findings suggest that <italic>D. hansenii</italic> could be an autochthonous species of the early mycobiota.</p><p id="Par48">We found <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the newborn offspring, which has not been shown before. Intriguingly, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> first surges and then becomes a dominant species at 1&#x000a0;year of age, after the introduction of food containing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (e.g. bread) into the diet. This finding suggests both a birth-related and a dietary means of colonisation. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is present in most diets and has been found and cultured from faecal samples. However, it is also capable of causing opportunistic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], implying that it is an autochthonous species. We observed that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was substantially more abundant in offspring and adult gut mycobiota than previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and there was a relatively low occurrence of <italic>Candida</italic> spp.; this variation may be due to different regional diets, host genetics or fungal detection methods. Some studies have shown that by using culture-dependent techniques, one would obtain relatively more <italic>Candida</italic> spp. than when using culture-independent techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which could partly explain the rather limited amounts of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. in our study.</p><p id="Par49">Some of the identified fungi should be regarded as transients that do not colonise the gut. The OTUs <italic>Agaricomycetes</italic>/<italic>Agaricales</italic> sp. are likely from edible and non-colonising fungi, e.g. the button mushroom <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic>, and similarly, <italic>Ustilaginaceae</italic> spp. are well-known plant pathogens. These fungi are generally of lower quantities and are often known not to live in anaerobic and body temperature environments; they are thus most likely transients from food. Not all OTUs were annotated to the species level because the fungal databases still are under development. However, our strict classification improved the chance of an accurate classification.</p><p id="Par50">We found that maternal fungal hosting makes the offspring more inclined to host fungi. This effect was strongest at 10&#x000a0;days after birth. The increased chance of fungal hosting suggests that these mother-offspring pairs share physiological fungal hosting abilities. Because fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, they may originate from the mother during birth, the mother&#x02019;s breast milk, parental skin or anywhere else in the hospital or home environment with which the offspring come in contact. However, we did not observe any OTU abundance difference regarding vaginal or caesarean delivery. Thus, we find indications for the transfer of fungal hosting between mothers and offspring that appear to be independent of the mode of delivery.</p><p id="Par51">The overlapping OTUs in the mother and offspring guts were mostly <italic>Saccharomycetaceae</italic> spp. This fungal family seems to have adapted well to the human gut environment and may be the species that are fittest to survive the transfer into the newborn fungal host environment. In addition to the gut mycobiota, <italic>Saccharomycetaceae</italic> spp. are also the most abundant species in healthy human mouth mycobiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The fungal abundance varied by age, which supports the idea that physiological fungal succession occurs in the early gut mycobiota. We have shown that the gut mycobiota is establishing already at 10&#x000a0;days after birth, albeit at a lower abundance and diversity than what is detected in their mothers&#x02019; guts. At 10&#x000a0;days, the gut fungi have just started to fight for their positions in a seemingly first-come first-serve model; the reduction in fungal abundance is probably determined by feeding, gut immunity and their interactions. The decrease at 3&#x000a0;months may be due to a previously described temporarily high abundances of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. that exhibit fungal antagonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Upon approaching 2&#x000a0;years of age, the gut mycobiota consists of fungi specific for the adult mycobiota, as observed in our study.</p><p id="Par53">Interestingly, pregnant mothers that received probiotics showed a higher abundance of gut fungi. This finding could indicate that the probiotic bacteria used in our study promote the symbiotic growth of gut fungi, like other lactic acid bacteria that are known to grow mutually with yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Due to a strict ITS quantity cut-off, a smaller proportion of the samples was sequenced. It cannot be excluded that the lower-abundance samples have different compositions. Nevertheless, in this unselected study population of mothers and offspring, it is reasonable to surmise that this selection could reflect the gut mycobiota of a healthy gut. The study design gave us limited control of the faecal sampling, but all the mothers were well informed about how to collect and quickly freeze the samples to avoid contamination and improve preservation. In the future, a lysis protocol optimised for fungal DNA extraction would be preferable, but this approach would require the fungal extraction analysis of a representative selection of human-associated fungi that is not yet available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par55">Our findings provide the first insight into the gut mycobiota that is established in offspring and into the transfer of fungal hosting from mother to child. This study covers a large, unselected population cohort of mothers and offspring, and it broadens the field of gut mycobiota as a new research area. The ways in which the early mycobiota can affect a child&#x02019;s normal physiology with respect to growth, immunity and metabolism remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
