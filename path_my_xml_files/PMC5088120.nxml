post-operative physical therapy versus post-operative physical therapy alone on pain and
recovery of function after total knee arthroplasty. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty patients
(18 males and 32 females) ranging in age from 48 to 80&#x02005;years (mean 63.28, SD 9.44)
participated in a 6-week two-arm randomized rater-blinded trial. One group received pre-
and post-operative physical therapy whereas the other group received only post-operative
physical therapy. Pain and function were measured with a visual analogue scale and a lower
extremity functional scale at baseline (pre-operative) as well as week 3 and week 6
post-operative. [Results] The differences in pain intensity and functional score at week 3
and week 6 post-operative remained statistically insignificant between the two groups.
[Conclusion] The reduction of pain and recovery of function was similar in subjects who
received pre- and post-operative physical therapy and those who received only
post-operative physical therapy after total knee arthroplasty. Additional pre-operative
physical therapy did not bring about any further improvement in pain intensity or recovery
of function after total knee arthroplasty.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Physical therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Total joint replacement surgeries are increasing worldwide. In the year 2012, more than
84,000 primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures were performed in the UK, according
to data from the National Joint Registry data<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients awaiting knee replacement surgery commonly experience
difficulty maintaining balance and functional status; these problems further increase as the
waiting time for surgery lengthens<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Post-operative (post-op) physical therapy (PT) after TKA has been identified as an
important factor for successful patient outcome. Exercises are widely recommended after TKA
to improve walking and activities of daily living<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These include numerous interventions such as exercise, manual
techniques, knee taping, electrotherapeutic modalities, and education to implement patient
self-management strategies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
evidence of the effects of pre-operative (pre-op) PT in this population is limited<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two previous systematic reviews have
reported low to moderate quality evidence that pre-op supervised PT reduces pain in patients
with hip and knee osteoarthritis prior to joint replacement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> while, in contrast, another
study did not find a significant impact of pre-op PT plus education on range of motion,
muscle strength or post-op disability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, Dauty et al. reported no benefit of pre-op and post-op PT in patients undergoing
TKA<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, in a systematic
review, Silkman Baker and McKeon<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> did
not report positive effects of pre-op rehabilitation compared to other interventions in
individuals undergoing TKA.</p><p>There are very few studies that address this topic; to the best of our knowledge, no study
has compared the effect of pre- and post-op PT versus post-op PT alone after TKA especially
on pain and functional recovery. Hence, we compared the effect of pre-op and post-op PT
versus only post-op PT on pain and recovery of function after TKA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective randomized rater-blinded trial with assessments at baseline, week 3 and week
6 post-op was used to compare the effect of pre-op and post-op PT (pre-post PT) and post-op
PT alone on pain and recovery of function after TKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

Ethical Committee (IEC). All the procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Fifty consecutive patients who underwent TKA at Primus Super Specialty Hospital, New Delhi,
India, participated in this study. They were randomly divided through the chit box method
into two groups (25 subjects in each group)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. One group received pre-post PT whereas the other group received
only post PT. The inclusion criterion was a pre-operative diagnosis of primary knee
osteoarthritis (OA) by the orthopedic surgeon based on the American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) criteria<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients were excluded
if they had a history of rheumatoid arthritis, cognitive impairment, or ankylosing
spondylitis.</p><p>Pain and physical functioning were assessed by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and
the lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), respectively. The VAS is a valid and reliable
measure of chronic pain intensity<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The LEFS is a 20-item questionnaire
designed to measure activity limitation of lower extremities and has an established validity
for measuring the lower extremity function in a population of patients with orthopedic
problems<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each item of the LEFS is
scored on a Likert 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. LEFS scores range from 0 to 80 points,
with higher scores indicating a higher functional level<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The LEFS appears to recognize changes similar or superior to those
recognized by the WOMAC physical function subscale in patients undergoing knee or hip
arthroplasty<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A standard parapatellar surgical approach was used. The average length of hospital stay was
5 days. All the participants were given oral analgesics to control pain. While admitted to
the hospital before TKA, all the patients in the pre-post PT group received daily PT
sessions of approximately 30 minutes duration. It included strengthening and mobility
exercises, proper techniques of transfers, and gait training with assistive devices (stick
or walker). The participants were instructed to repeat these exercises 2&#x02013;3 times a day.
Similar exercises were given to the post-op PT group after surgery. After discharge from the
hospital, the patients received 12 sessions of PT, twice a week for 6 weeks, comprised
mainly strengthening and mobility exercises as well as gait training. In addition, all the
patients received 20 minutes of conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) to minimize pain. All the patients were instructed to repeat these exercises at home.
In the present study, the component of exercise protocol was based on a previously published
study<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analysis was done by using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (Statistical package for the</p><p>Social Sciences, IBM, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons was used to study the changes in
dependent variables over time. Univariate ANOVA was used to compare the dependent variables
at each level between the two groups. Descriptive data was presented as means and standard
deviations (SD). A p value of&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty patients (18 males and 32 females) who underwent TKA agreed to participate in the

alone on pain and recovery of function after TKA. During the first post-op month, a
significant reduction in pain and improvements in physical function were reported in both
the groups. However, there was no difference between the two groups.</p><p>In the available literature on efficacy of exercise in TKA patients, most of the studies
have focused either only on pre-op or post-op exercises. Only a few studies have compared
the two. Similar to our study, previous studies have also questioned any additional benefit
of the addition of pre-op exercises in patients undergoing joint arthroplasty, especially
for the knee<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neither a PT program to
strengthen upper or lower limb strength nor exercises to improve knee range of motion and
strength have been shown to add to the degree of improvement after TKA<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
targeted post-op care following pre-op assessments has been shown to decrease the length of
hospital stay<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Post-op management after arthroplasty surgery has been widely studied. Various studies have
reported its effect on decreasing pain and length of stay after surgery<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Still, there
is no standard protocol available<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most
of the available studies focused on pain reduction, strength gain, or mobility after knee
replacement surgeries. Fewer studies have taken the quality of life, the return to work and
daily activities, or the physical functioning as a whole as outcome measures in such
studies. Data on quality of life recovery after surgery plays an important role in deciding
the standard of care for patients<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Hence, along with pain reduction, we decided to include the LEFS, which is a measure of
activity limitation.</p><p>Although PT has been shown to be very effective in the management of arthritis and its
prevention and progression<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study suggests that additional pre-op PT did not
bring about any further improvement in pain intensity or function after TKA. The reduction
of pain and recovery of function were similar in subjects who received pre-op and post-op PT
and those who received only post-op PT after TKA.</p><p>The present study had some potential limitations. The pre-op PT was given only during the
hospital stay. The average hospital stay was 5 days; therefore, the number of sessions
received during pre-op PT might not have been enough to bring about a significant change in
the outcome. In addition, there was no follow-up after 6 weeks; therefore, the long-term
effects of these interventions remain unclear. In the future study, in addition to pain and
function, the assessment of the quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, knee range of
motion, and the gait parameters is warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, the reduction of pain and recovery of function were similar in subjects who
received pre- and post-op PT and those who received only post-op PT after TKA. Additional
pre-op PT did not bring about any further improvement in pain intensity and function after
TKA.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project was full financially supported by King Saud University, Vice Deanship of
