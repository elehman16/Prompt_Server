inspiratory sighs, sustained maximal inspiration and intercostal exercise) the on
breathing pattern and thoracoabdominal motion in healthy subjects. </p></sec><sec><title>METHOD: </title><p>Fifteen subjects of both sexes, aged 23&#x000b1;1.5 years old and with normal pulmonary
function tests, participated in the study. The subjects were evaluated using the
optoelectronic plethysmography system in a supine position with a trunk
inclination of 45&#x000b0; during quiet breathing and the breathing exercises. The order
of the breathing exercises was randomized. Statistical analysis was performed by
the Friedman test and an ANOVA for repeated measures with one factor (breathing
exercises), followed by preplanned contrasts and Bonferroni correction. A
p&#x0003c;0.005 value was considered significant. </p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS: </title><p>All breathing exercises significantly increased the tidal volume of the chest wall
(V<sub>cw</sub>) and reduced the respiratory rate (<italic>RR</italic>) in
comparison to quiet breathing. The diaphragmatic breathing exercise was
responsible for the lowest V<sub>cw</sub>, the lowest contribution of the rib
cage, and the highest contribution of the abdomen. The sustained maximal
inspiration exercise promoted greater reduction in <italic>RR</italic> compared to
the diaphragmatic and intercostal exercises. Inspiratory sighs and intercostal
exercises were responsible for the highest values of minute ventilation.
Thoracoabdominal asynchrony variables increased significantly during diaphragmatic
breathing. </p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS: </title><p>The results showed that the breathing exercises investigated in this study
produced modifications in the breathing pattern (<italic>e.g.,</italic> increase
in tidal volume and decrease in <italic>RR</italic>) as well as in
thoracoabdominal motion (<italic>e.g.,</italic> increase in abdominal contribution
during diaphragmatic breathing), among others.</p></sec></abstract><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breathing exercises are manual techniques commonly used in clinical practice. They can
affect breathing patterns and thoracoabdominal movement, prioritize one compartment of
the chest wall (CW) over another, and change the degree of participation of the
respiratory muscles<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>Diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most widely used and studied exercises in clinical
practice<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. It aims to improve pulmonary ventilation,
mainly to the dependent zones of the lungs by promoting greater respiratory displacement
of the abdominal compartment<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Other breathing exercises are also used in
respiratory physical therapy practice. Inspiratory sighs and sustained maximal
inspiration (SMI) are used to improve lung volume and hematosis by performing successive
inspirations (i.e. inspiratory sighs) or maximal inspiratory effort<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In addition, the intercostal breathing exercise
emphasizes rib cage (RC) compartment muscles, promoting greater displacement of this
compartment<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Cuello et al.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> was the first to propose the use of inspiratory sighs and intercostal
breathing exercises<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. </p><p>The mechanisms underlying breathing exercises, particularly inspiratory sighs, SMI, and
intercostal breathing, are not fully elucidated. Because the literature on these
exercises is scarce, health professionals prescribe them based on the positive outcomes
observed from their use or on their proposed mechanism of action. The comprehension of
which CW compartments are primarily engaged during these breathing exercises may support
the application of a specific exercise to conditions affecting different lung zones.</p><p>Currently, breathing pattern and thoracoabdominal movement can be assessed by
optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP). This device performs a tricompartmental analysis
of volume variations without presetting the degree of freedom of the CW, thus allowing a
more detailed analysis of the effects of breathing exercises on the ventilation of
different CW compartments (pulmonary rib cage - RCp, abdominal rib cage - RCa, and
abdomen - AB)<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The breathing exercises assessed in this study were selected based on their effect on
different lung zones<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Because pursed lip
breathing is usually associated with breathing exercises in clinical practice<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, it was added to the exercises with oral
expiration in this study.</p><p>Thus, the study assessed the effect of breathing exercises (diaphragmatic breathing,
inspiratory sighs, SMI, and intercostal breathing) on the breathing pattern and
thoracoabdominal movement of healthy participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study with 15 participants who met the following inclusion
criteria: age between 20-30 years; body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.99
Kg/m<sup>2</sup>; no disturbances in ventilatory function as assessed by pulmonary
function test<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; absence of neuromuscular
diseases; and no previous knowledge of how to perform the breathing exercises. The
exclusion criteria were being unable to understand and/or perform any of the
procedures.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (ETIC 0194.0.2036000-11) of the
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. All
participants signed an informed consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement instruments</title><p>The OEP (BTS Bioengineering, Milan, Italy) was used to assess the breathing pattern
and the thoracoabdominal movement. It is a non-invasive device<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> that provides an accurate and precise
indirect measurement of the absolute volumes of the three compartments of the CW
during both quiet breathing and exercise<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and in different positions<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Detailed information about the OEP system
was recently published by our group. To acquire the measures, it is necessary to
define the anatomical boundaries of the three compartments: the xiphoid process
between the RCp and the RCa, and the costal margin anteriorly and the lowest point of
the lower costal margin posteriorly between the RCa and the AB<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The device tracks the three-dimensional position and
displacement of each point of the CW, acquired by six synchronized cameras that
capture the light from passive markers (plastic spheres coated with reflective
paper). In an orthostatic or seated position, the markers are distributed across 89
points, and for the supine position, the markers are distributed across 52 points,
marking the anatomical references of the rib cage (RC) and of the AB<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

collection days. On the first day, the participants were given instructions about the
study; they signed the informed consent form and answered a questionnaire to collect
clinical and demographic data. Then, after the measurement of body weight and height
(by a calibrated scale), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR),
peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and perceived exertion by
modified Borg scale the participants were taught how to perform the pulmonary
function test (Vitalograph 2120, Buckinghan, England). After the spirometry test, the
participants answered the Human Activity Profile (HAP) questionnaire<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Both the spirometry and the HAP were
administered by the same examiner.</p><p>Next, the participants learned the following breathing exercises which were
randomized (computer program): diaphragmatic breathing - the participants had to
perform a slow and deep nasal inspiration emphasizing the anterior displacement of
the abdomen and avoiding RC displacement<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; inspiratory sighs - short, successive, and
slow nasal inspirations until the inspiratory capacity was reached<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; sustained maximal inspiration - a slow nasal
maximal inspiratory effort to reach the inspiratory capacity, followed by a 3-second
post-inspiratory pause<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; and intercostal
breathing - nasal inspiration emphasizing the displacement of the upper portion of
the thorax<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. For the diaphragmatic breathing,
inspiratory sighs, and maximal inspiration, the subjects were instructed to perform a
smooth and controlled pursed lip expiration. For the intercostal breathing, the
subjects were instructed to perform the expiration nasally, as recommended in the
literature<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. </p><p>On the second test day, the examiner placed the 52 markers at the pre-determined
anatomical references on the anterior thoracoabdominal wall, and the OEP was
statically and dynamically calibrated according to the established protocol<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. </p><p>All participants were assessed in a supine position with a 45&#x000ba; trunk inclination,
which is the standard position used for breathing exercises in hospitals. Initially,
5 minutes of quiet breathing were recorded, defined by the participant's own
breathing pattern, followed by 5 minutes of one breathing exercise. The participants
performed two sessions of 2 minutes for each breathing exercise, with a 1-minute
interval between them, and only the second session was considered for data
analysis.</p><p>The order of the exercises was randomized, and the participants received standard
instruction for each exercise at the beginning and after 60 seconds of exercise.
There was a 10-minute interval between different breathing exercises for the
participants to reestablish their initial HR, <italic>RR</italic>, SpO<sub>2</sub>,
and modified Borg scale values. All exercises were taught and monitored by the same
examiner.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>The following variables were analyzed for each exercise: chest wall tidal volume
(V<sub>cw</sub>); <italic>RR</italic>; minute ventilation (<italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic>); pulmonary rib cage percent contribution (V<sub>RCp%</sub>);
abdominal rib cage percent contribution (V<sub>RCa%</sub>); abdomen percent
contribution (V<sub>AB%</sub>); and the variables related to thoracoabdominal
asynchrony: phase-angle (PhAng) and inspiratory phase ratio (PhRIB) between the RC
and AB and between the RCp and RCa.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Due the lack of sufficient data in the literature for sample size calculation, the
sample size was calculated after the assessment of V<sub>cw</sub>,
<italic>RR</italic>, <italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic>, V<sub>RCp%</sub>, V<sub>RCa%</sub> and V<sub>ab%</sub> in 10
participants. The effect size was calculated by the square root of the sum of the
squared factors, divided by the sum of the squared errors. The data were acquired
from an ANOVA table generated by the software SPSS v 13.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). The
sample size was calculated considering the effect size for each variable, with a
significance level of 5% and 80% power<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.
Thus, the sample size was 10 participants for the variables considered for the
calculation.</p><p>The data were presented as measures of central tendency and dispersion, and the
normality was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test.</p><p>Normally distributed data were analyzed using ANOVA for repeated measures with one
factor (breathing exercises), followed by pre-planned contrasts and Bonferroni
correction for <italic>p</italic> value adjustment according to the number of
comparisons (n=10). Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the analogous
nonparametric test, the Friedman test. After adjustment, <italic>p</italic> was set
to &#x0003c;0.005.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 20 initially selected participants, 5 were excluded (3 presented with ventilatory
disturbances after the pulmonary function test; 1 presented with BMI over 29.99
Kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and 1 did not attend the second day of data collection). Thus,
fifteen participants completed the study, and the sample analyzed provided a sample
comfort level of 50% relative to the ideal sample size calculated.</p><p>The participants' demographic and anthropometric data, spirometry values, and physical
activity level are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. All
participants exhibited normal pulmonary function and were considered physically active
according to the HAP questionaire.</p><p>

the lung<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. An increase in the displacement of the
abdominal compartment compared to rest (with 60% contribution to V<sub>cw</sub>) was
observed during this exercise. Therefore, this exercise can improve the contribution of
the AB to the V<sub>cw</sub>, possibly contributing to air distribution to the basal
segments of the lungs<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. </p><p>Other authors investigated the breathing pattern during diaphragmatic breathing in
healthy subjects<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. None of them, however, performed a
tri-compartmental analysis of the CW, which can only be achieved using OEP.</p><p>The results of this study agree with the observations of Brach et al.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, who assessed the distribution of ventilation
during diaphragmatic breathing and concluded that this exercise drove the ventilation
from the upper segments to the lower segments of the lungs in healthy subjects without
significant change in <italic>V </italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic>. However, Tomich et al.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
observed a significant increase in <italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic> during the same exercise. The divergence between the studies could be
related to the higher tidal volume associated with a small reduction in
<italic>RR</italic> observed by these authors.</p><p>The significant increase in V<sub>cw</sub> during inspiratory sighs, SMI, and
intercostal breathing compared with diaphragmatic breathing may be related to performing
inspiration until reaching total lung capacity, according to the proposed exercises. The
higher reduction in <italic>RR</italic> during SMI than during diaphragmatic and
intercostal breathing may be explained by the 3-second post-inspiratory pause. The
absence of significant differences during the inspiratory sighs may be related to the
fractionated inspirations practiced during this exercise. Although V<sub>cw</sub>
increased significantly during SMI, there was no significant difference in
<italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic> compared to the rest phase. In contrast, the increase in
V<sub>cw</sub> during inspiratory sighs and intercostal breathing was able to
compensated for <italic>RR</italic> reduction and promoted an increase in
<italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic>. Inspiration performed in a single effort or in successive
inspirations resulted in similar V<sub>cw</sub> and reduced <italic>RR</italic>, but
successive inspirations increased <italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic>. Therefore, in the presence of globally reduced pulmonary
ventilation, it may be better to use this exercise instead of diaphragmatic
breathing.</p><p>The execution of SMI and inspiratory sighs do not require directing airflow to a
specific compartment of the CW. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to reach total lung
capacity during these exercises, which might explain the small contribution of the
abdominal compartment observed.</p><p>According to Fixley et al.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, intercostal breathing
improves ventilation to the non-dependent zones of the lungs, which may be explained by
the regional transpulmonary pressure gradient caused by the contraction of the CW
muscles stimulated by intercostal breathing. The participants of this study were
instructed to direct the airflow to the upper zone of the RC during this exercise,
improving V<sub>RCp</sub>% and reducing V<sub>AB</sub>% compared to the rest phase. This
finding, however, does not support nasal expiration as the factor responsible for the
greater contribution of the RC to V<sub>cw</sub>, as proposed by the author of the
technique, Cuello et al.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, because the effects of
inspiratory sighs and SMI are similar to the effects of intercostal breathing.</p><p>PhAng is an index used to assess thoracoabdominal asynchrony<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. It encompasses the data from the full
respiratory cycle but assumes in its calculation that the curves formed by the movement
of both compartments are approximately sinusoidal. Thus, non-sinusoidal waves can
compromise its calculation. To our knowledge, only one study has assessed PhAng between
RC and AB in healthy subjects, but they were assessed in a supine position with 30&#x000b0;
trunk inclination<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Additionally, the
measurement instrument used in that study was different from the current instrument: The
OEP was used in this study, while respiratory inductive plethysmography was used in the
work of Tomich et al.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, which does not allow a
comparison between the findings. The values of the PhAng between the RCp and RCa
observed in this study corroborate the findings of Aliverti et al., who assessed healthy
subjects in the seated position using the OEP<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. </p><p>The present study showed an increase in PhAng between RC and AB during diaphragmatic and
intercostal breathing exercises compared to the rest phase and showed an increase in
PhAng between RCp and RCa only during diaphragmatic breathing compared to both rest and
other exercises. Tomich et al.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> observed a
significant increase in PhAng between RC and AB during diaphragmatic breathing compared
to the rest phase. It is noteworthy that the thoracoabdominal asynchrony occurred mainly
during exercises that required voluntary use of specific muscle groups, such as
diaphragmatic and intercostal breathing, which could compromise synchrony among the
compartments.</p><p>PhRIB is used to quantify asynchronous movement without the need of sinusoidal
curves<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The values found for PhRIB agree
with the values described in the literature for healthy subjects at rest<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. The PhRIB between RC and AB showed a significant
increase during diaphragmatic breathing and inspiratory sighs compared to the rest
phase. There was also a significant increase in PhRIB between RCp and RCa during
diaphragmatic breathing. No studies were found in the literature that assessed PhRIB
during breathing exercises.</p><p>The present study showed a consistent increase in the variables related to
thoracoabdominal asynchrony only during diaphragmatic breathing, both for PhRIB and
PhAng. This increase is noteworthy in healthy subjects as it could be even higher in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases who present biomechanical changes
of the RC. Gosselink et al.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> observed that
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exhibited a change in the AB/RC
excursion ratio during the exercises performed with or without linear load<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. </p><p>The results presented in the present study support the specific use of breathing
exercises. The behavior of the variables analyzed in this study, even though the results
were obtained from healthy participants, could be similar to the behavior of the same
variables in postoperative patients because many such patients presented with previous
normal pulmonary function despite all the changes occurring in this period. Therefore,
the observed effects of the exercises, mainly the ones related to tidal volume increase
and <italic>RR</italic> decrease, could benefit patients with tidal volume reduction for
different reasons, such as pain, collapse of the lung parenchyma, or any other
restriction. Finally, directing the ventilation to certain lung segments could improve
ventilation to specific zones of the lungs of patients suffering from diseases such as
atelectasis.</p><p>The indirect measurement of volume without association with a direct measure by
pneumotachography is a limitation of this study. Therefore, the values recorded here
cannot be used as absolute values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this study suggest that the four breathing exercises analyzed improved
tidal volume and reduced <italic>RR</italic>. Only the diaphragmatic breathing primarily
directed the ventilation to the abdominal region. Inspiratory sighs and intercostal
breathing increased <italic>V</italic>
<sup>&#x02022;</sup>
<italic>E</italic> significantly compared to the other exercises. There was no
asynchrony during SMI. The results of this study may contribute to explaining the
effects of these four breathing exercises on the breathing pattern and thoracoabdominal
asynchrony of healthy subjects, thus allowing their proper use in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>To the Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES - PROCAD NF
