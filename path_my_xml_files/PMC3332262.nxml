Reasons cited included anonymity, the amount of information available and easy access.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3 b4 b5">3&#x02013;5</xref> The level of searching for information on depression online has increased. In 2000, depression was not in the 10 most frequently searched for topics, but by 2005, it was the fifth most common topic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></p><p>Others have investigated quality of health information websites, including those for depression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and attempted to rate the quality of these websites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7 b8 b9">7&#x02013;9</xref> Patients searching for health information online may be unable to find what they are looking for,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> possibly due to suboptimal search strategies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Most people follow-up between the first three and 10 results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> We have not found studies of <italic>how</italic> users seek online help for depression but most people searching for health information start with a search engine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Google's share of the search market is debatable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> but we can assume that a majority in the UK searching for health information will use Google. Search results may now be personalised according to user's location<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and previous searches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Some regard this personalisation as intrusive and this has led to the development of software to hide user characteristics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Search results will also change over time because of adjustment of Google's databases to the changing pattern of websites. This means that there is no standard response to a Google search; however, we can &#x02018;average&#x02019; the experience of several users to explore ease of finding given topics at any time.</p><p>Although not everyone searching online using terms such as depression is depressed, we need to make sure that the best support is available for those who are. Online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is self-help treatment recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK for mild to moderate depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The range of resources includes licenced (paid for) sites such as Beating the Blues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and free access websites providing access to CBT life skills resources (eg, Living Life to the Full (LLTTF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and MoodGYM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></p><p>Given the NICE recommendation and the predominance of Google, it would be reasonable to expect websites delivering access to online CBT to have relatively high profiles and be easily visible to users on a Google search. We were struck by the large geographical variation within the UK in the uptake of LLTTF. The highest rate (in Kirkwall, Scotland) was 15 times that of the lowest (Wigan, England). Such variation could not be explained by variation in prevalence of depression and was most likely explained by lack of awareness of online therapies for depression. We have been exploring ways of increasing awareness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> One method of doing this was to use online advertising, in particular, Google AdWords.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref></p><p>Those paying for an AdWords campaign set up one or more adverts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref> for example) and enter keywords to help determine when the advert is shown. AdWords determine if an advert is relevant to a given user's search based on (in AdWords terminology) exact matches, broad matches and phrase matches with the user's entered search term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> AdWords displays adverts as a sponsored link, either at the top of the list of search results or in the right-hand panel, depending on the phrase entered, the price you offer per advert and bids from competing adverts, and (if requested) by estimated location of the user. Google AdWords may be embedded in searches in other websites (the Google Display Network).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Google advert.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000800fig1"/></fig><p>However, diverting users who would have found CCBT sites <italic>without</italic> the aid of adverts, to finding it via an advert, is a waste of resources. In this case study, we reviewed the likely &#x02018;search experience&#x02019; using Google of people searching using the term &#x02018;depression&#x02019; to estimate the chance of finding online CBT and the improved probability by adding an online advert.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics and trial registration</title><p>This was an exploratory substudy within a pilot cluster randomised trial.

Those clicking on the advert were taken to a website which asked them to confirm their location (postcode area) and to complete a widely used depression rating questionnaire (PHQ9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and then offered links to four sites addressing low mood in different ways. Our main objective was to offer a link to online CBT, in particular, LLTTF and MoodGYM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> The NHS research ethics committee that considered our proposal asked us to add a link to Samaritans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (Samaritans is a secular UK charity aimed at providing emotional support to anyone in emotional distress or at risk of suicide mainly through their 24/7 confidential telephone helpline.) To keep symmetry in the exit page of the website, we added NHS Choices (non-CBT information about depression).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> The order of links presented on the page was randomised within each row, the top row always being the two CBT sites and the bottom row Samaritans and NHS Choices.</p></sec><sec><title>Search terms used</title><p>We reviewed the presentation of our advert and the search terms entered by users (who subsequently clicked on our advert) to understand better what terms people may use and how many may search directly for online CBT.</p></sec><sec><title>Exploring the results of normal Google search</title><p>Given that the results of Google searches are to some degree personalised and therefore will vary by computer used, to assess which websites would be found by users, we recruited a user panel of 12 people. We contacted a sample of previous users of LLTTF and through an AdWord's advert (using the keyword depression) sought volunteers in our target areas (12 of 121 postcode areas in Britain).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> These people, in a range of locations, are likely to have had search history including previous searches for depression and so would be presented with different Google search results. These results would be representative of those obtained by people in our target areas searching for depression-related terms. Although we tried to target our study postcode areas in recruiting the panel, there was some &#x02018;leakage&#x02019;. Nine of 12 were in target areas (Darlington, Lancaster, Orkneys, London SW, Kingston and Liverpool) and three were in other areas (Twickenham, Gloucester and Dorchester). We asked our user panel to search Google using the single word &#x02018;depression&#x02019; and email us a screen shot of the first page of results (usually 10 results). We also wanted to explore the variability of search results by different entered terms. We felt unable to ask our panel to carry out and report more than one search so two of the authors searched for the next nine most entered search terms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Estimating the chance of finding online CBT from websites</title><p>We assessed the websites found by people using the term &#x02018;depression&#x02019; to see how easy it was to find online CBT. We first assumed a knowledgeable user and assessed if online CBT (in this case specifically LLTTF or MoodGYM) could be reached in three clicks by someone who knew that online CBT sites existed. For those websites where online CBT could be reached in three clicks, we calculated the probability that someone (ie, an &#x02018;extreme&#x02019; novice) who made completely random choices would find online CBT purely by chance. To do this, we noted how many choices were involved at each level of the shortest pathway to online CBT to calculate an approximate probability of reaching online CBT.</p></sec><sec><title>Model to estimate probabilities of finding online CBT</title><p>We used a number of assumptions (see results) to estimate the probability of finding online CBT with and without Google adverts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows a schematic of the samples used and how information from different stages was used to calculate the probabilities.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Schematic of methods.

For example, Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)&#x02014;a major Department of Health initiative with delivery across England&#x02014;is promoting self-referral and finding positive benefits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> This is also seen in the national telephone support line NHS Living Life. Approaches such as these are likely to access a range of people who might not otherwise seek help via their GP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Support and guidance are recommended for all forms of CBT resources&#x02014;including online CBT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> Although national treatment guidelines such as NICE (2009) and SIGN (2010)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> recommend the addition of support, many people accessing online CBT through free sites will do so without support.</p><p>This study showed that the 3868 people who clicked on our advert typically searched with the single word <italic>depression</italic>, although there were a great variety of terms entered, including misspellings. However, our study demonstrated that even a knowledgeable person may have to search quite hard to find online CBT, and it would be difficult, or extremely unlikely, for a naive user of depression websites (ie, someone not specifically searching for online CBT for depression and knowing how to find it) to find online CBT websites easily using a Google search. Although our estimates use a large number of assumptions, we consider that a nearly threefold increase in the probability of finding online CBT by the addition of a Google Advert is likely to lead to more people with depression registering and using online CBT. The real test of this will be if there is an increase in uptake demonstrated in our cluster randomised trial comparing intervention with control areas.</p><p>Based on our &#x02018;click through rate&#x02019; (the number of times users clicked on our advert divided by the number of times it was presented) of 1.5% and that typically eight adverts are displayed on a page of search results, we estimated that users may click on an advert in 12% of cases when Google displayed search results and adverts. Although this is based on our empirical data, online adverts may not be viewed positively by internet users who are looking for credible information on the web. AdWords are sometimes used to promote bogus, misleading (eg, &#x02018;miracle cures&#x02019;) and malware-ridden sites, and many users will avoid them. Our own advert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>), mentioning NHS and with a &#x02018;.org.uk&#x02019; URL, may have had a better click through rate than other online adverts,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> so we may have overestimated the impact of online adverts.</p><p>The Department of Health was heavily criticised for spending &#x000a3;2.5 million on AdWords between February 2009 and January 2010.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> The Department of Health declined to give further details of how they had spent this money or its cost&#x02013;effectiveness. By judicious design of the website, the NHS Choices and other NHS websites should bring high profile search results. In this study, for example, the NHS Choices depression section was the only website that regularly appeared in the top three search results. If people find a website via a normal web search, then online advertising such as AdWords may be a waste of money. However, this study shows that, if there is substantial &#x02018;competition&#x02019; for a user's attention, advertising may be worthwhile. For example, the Royal College of Psychiatrists seems to be spending quite large sums on Google AdWords as their advert appears frequently alongside their website being found by &#x02018;normal&#x02019; Google search. For people with depression, given that adverts will in any case appear, having an advert for RCPsych that gives the user a one in 140 chance of finding online CBT for depression improves their chances very slightly.</p><p>This exploration of how choices may be made given the websites and adverts currently being found by Google gives some indication that it would be worthwhile. The number of routes that could be taken, even on websites from which it is possible to reach online CBT, also shows the bewildering choice facing those with depression using the internet.</p><p>Another approach to assessing search experience is through observation in a laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> setting or even &#x02018;in the wild&#x02019;, but recruiting, meeting and observing people with depression while they search the internet presents many ethical and practical difficulties. We were able to recruit 12 anonymous users who are likely to have searched for depression before, at various locations around the UK. They were able to supply us with information of their searches from their natural &#x02018;habitat&#x02019;, although we restricted their searching to just one search term. Ideally, we would ask the panel to search for more search terms but we thought this would jeopardise getting any response. The results suggested that although there was some modification of search results by users' previous search history and location, the variability was not that great. Although our sample of 12 users is small, given the lack of variation, it seems unlikely that a bigger sample would have identified other websites that would have increased the probability of finding online CBT.</p><p>Our study is also limited in that we only considered Google Search and not, for example, Google Search or Google AdWords embedded in partner sites, blogs or YouTube videos (the so-called Google Display Network). Also, not only do websites change but also Google search results change by location, user and over time. Website owners are also constantly modifying their websites and taking steps to raise their profiles for search engines such as Google. Google is also not the only way of advertising online and others have used, for example, paid location and demographic targeted adverts in Facebook on.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></p><p>The approach we have taken to assess the ease of finding CCBT could easily be replicated in future. The general idea of assessing the probabilities that expert and naive users may have in finding a particular website is applicable to anyone considering the addition of online adverts to promote online services or resources. Online adverts may compete both with other adverts as well as with the results of organic search, and health service providers considering the use of online adverts need a strategy that calculates the added (marginal) benefit and cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>More work is needed into how people make choices when confronted by different Google search results and adverts. Users of Google AdWords would also be advised to consider the context in which they are advertising and not just the data reported by Google Analytics. The results of a search and the additional impact of advertising should be explored in more detail before committing to a long-term Google AdWords advertising budget promoting access to healthcare resources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000800-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1730" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000800-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1735" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e154" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000800.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e155" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000800.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Ian Mayer of Mirata Ltd for help in extracting data from LLTTF and Robert Stillwell for developing the project website.
