Group I received modified connective tissue graft, while group II were treated with subepithelial connective tissue graft in pouch technique. The defect size was measured in its horizontal and vertical dimension by utilizing a periodontal probe in a stone cast at base line, after 3 months, and 6 months post surgically. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni <italic>post</italic>-<italic>hoc</italic> test were used for statistical analysis.

Reconstructive procedures for the deformed alveolar ridge are guided bone regeneration, bone graft and soft tissue graft placement beneath the flap or in pouch made in damaged area.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Soft tissue ridge augmentation is a valuable periodontal plastic surgery procedure for correction of ridge defects for aesthetic purposes. Epithelial connective tissue graft, onlay graft, subepithelial connective tissue graft, roll pedicle graft, interpositional graft technique, and combined onlay interpositional graft are the most employed approaches in this scenario.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In literature, little data is available about the comparison of subepithelial connective tissue graft in pouch and modified subepithelial connective tissue graft in the treatment of alveolar ridge defects. Therefore, to explore the beneficial effects of modified subepithelial connective tissue graft over subepithelial connective tissue graft in pouch, if any, in alveolar ridge defects the present study was undertaken.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty non-smoker individuals (24 males and 16 females, age between 25 and 55 years) with 40 class III alveolar ridge defects in maxillary anterior region were selected for the study in the Department of Periodontics, Dr. Z. A. Dental College, Aligarh. The study was designed as a randomized, clinical study comparing the alveolar ridge augmentation outcomes using modified connective tissue graft and subepithelial connective graft in pouch. Inclusion criteria for the patients were absence of any systemic and periodontal diseases, not taking any medication, no pregnancy or lactation, not previously treated for periodontal reasons, cause of tooth loss be trauma, congenital missing, and tooth fracture. To be included in the study, each patient had to present &#x0003c;20% plaque (PL+), and bleeding on probing (BOP+) sites. Selected sites were randomly divided by flip of coin method in two groups. Group I was treated by modified subepithelial connective tissue graft (combined onlay connective tissue graft), while group II by subepithelial connective graft in pouch method.</p><p>After recruitment of the patients, the study protocol, risks, benefits, and procedures were explained, and written informed consents were obtained from every patient. All the examinations, treatment, and procedures associated with this study followed the principles according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was properly reviewed, and approved by the Ethical Committee of Institute.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Measurement of the localized alveolar ridge defect</title><p>Stone casts were prepared at baseline and after 3, and 6 months postoperatively for measuring the dimension of alveolar ridge defects. The extension of the ridge defect was defined as distance between the buccal-proximal line angles of both adjacent teeth at the vertical level of the papilla tips. It was measured with an orthodontic caliber (Z&#x000fc;rcher Model, Medidenta Z&#x000fc;rich, Swiss), having a division of one tenth of a millimeter. The result was rounded up to the next tenth of a millimetre.</p><p>The measurements of the ridge defect was assessed on the dental cast with a manual UNC-15 periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA), in nearest millimetre by measuring the defect size separately in the vertical and horizontal dimension.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The vertical component of the ridge defect was measured between the deepest point of the ridge defect to a line, which run through the adjacent papilla tips, named the papilla line.</p><p>The horizontal component of the ridge defect was assessed between the deepest point of the ridge defect to the tooth arch curvature, which runs through the adjacent gingival zeniths, or the buccal cemento-enamel junction, respectively.</p><p>The papilla line and the tooth arch curvature defined in a semiquantitative manner according the aesthetically ideal ridge form, which outlined the target volume for augmentation. Both lines were determined with a tin wire, having a circle round cross-section with a diameter of 1 mm, possessing no elasticity. In this manner, the ridge defect was semi-quantitatively determined at the mentioned time periods. The measured results were rounded up to the nearest millimetre. The absolute gain in the vertical and horizontal dimension, expressed in millimetres, was calculated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative value. All measurements were done by a masked clinician who was unaware about the type of surgeries. All surgeries were performed by single well experienced periodontist for minimization of the inter operator variability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical protocol</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subepithelial connective tissue graft</title><p>After administering local anaesthesia, incision was given for pouch formation at the buccal side of involved area. This pouch was extended to the alveolar ridge for adequate depth with the help of periosteal elevator. Subepithelial connective tissue graft was harvested from the palatal aspect of left second premolar region. This connective tissue graft transferred to the preformed pouch and adjusted according to ridge deficiency. After suturing, the site was covered with periodontal pack.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>The modified subepithelial connective tissue graft technique</title><p>Half of the graft's width remained covered with epithelium whereas in the other half of the graft's width epithelium was removed leaving connective tissue and fatty tissue.

However, modified subepithelial connective tissue graft observed significantly more gain than connective tissue graft in pouch for the same parameters. The intragroup results of our study were in agreement with previous literature in which above mentioned techniques have showed significant improvement in horizontal and vertical ridge height.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, intergroup results of present study were not in accordance to Studer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] study.</p><p>In this study, preoperative defect size did not differ statistically from each other in both groups, either in the vertical dimension (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) or in the horizontal dimension (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), as well as for the extension of the defect size (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The observation time was also similar for both surgical groups. This allows the conclusion that both groups possessed the same presurgical conditions regarding defect morphology; therefore, differences between these groups which were determined after surgery were not related to presurgical existing differences.</p><p>Modified subepithelial connective tissue graft (combined onlay&#x02013;connective tissue graft) showed significantly better results. This may be because in the recipient site combined graft solves the two purposes; first it increases the horizontal width by connective tissue portion, and second it also increases vertical height by intact epithelium. The advantages of this kind of graft have been documented as:[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>

</p><p>For the present study a simple and economical measurement method was applied, which allowed a fast and easy assessment of ridge defects prior to and after surgery. The drawback of this method lies in its limited precision, and the location of the defect size assessment does not necessarily remain at the same location between the pre- and post-operative measurements. Consequently, this measurement method may be defined as a semi quantitative one. The alternative for the assessment of three-dimensional volume differences could be the projection Moir&#x000e9; technique. This method offers volume assessments with sufficient accuracy. However, it is time-consuming and demands significant computer equipments.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It would be of interest to measure the present data with the Moire projection method and compare its results with the present study, possibly establishing the presented method as a fast control method.</p><p>It must be critically commented that the aim of the ridge augmentation procedure was to augment &#x0201c;as much as possible.&#x0201d; The exact graft volume which was placed in the recipient site was not measured in this study due to its limited accuracy. The known graft volume would possibly give more accurate information about the efficacy of different surgical procedures, if the volumetric outcome is quantitatively assessed, e.g., by projection Moir&#x000e9; technique.</p><p>The results of this small cohort study would have had more validity if power calculation was also a consideration criterion. Differences in the outcomes of the various studies might be due to the variation in several associated factors, that can alter the extent of dimension gain after soft tissue grafting procedure, like patient selection, defects characteristics, data collection, biochemical characteristics of grafted materials, surgical variation, and patient attitude towards the treatment.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, modified connective tissue graft is a better option as compared to subepithelial connective tissue in pouch for the treatment of alveolar ridge deficiency.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors of this manuscript declare that they have no conflicts of interest, real or perceived, financial or non-financial in this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thoma</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000e4;mmerle</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Cochran</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000f6;rlach</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Uebersax</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Soft tissue volume augmentation by the use of collagen-based matrices in the dog mandible &#x02014; A histological analysis</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2011</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>1063</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22092478</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thoma</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Cochran</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ender</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Soft tissue volume augmentation by the use of collagen-based matrices: A volumetric analysis</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2010</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>659</fpage><lpage>66</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20642631</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schropp</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wenzel</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kostopoulos</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Karring</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone healing and soft tissue contour changes following single-tooth extraction: A clinical and radiographic 12-month prospective study</article-title><source>Int J Periodontics Restorative Dent</source><year>2003</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>313</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12956475</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seibert</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reconstruction of deformed, partially edentulous ridges, using full thickness onlay grafts.
