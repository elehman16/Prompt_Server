</p><p>The purpose of this paper was to compare maropitant and acepromazine on the incidence of vomiting, signs of nausea, ptyalism, and increased panting in dogs premedicated with hydromorphone.

Food was withheld from all dogs 12&#x000a0;hours before premedication; however, water was always available. A trained observer (SH) blinded to the treatment groups documented emetic events, signs of nausea, ptyalism, and increased panting from the time the hydromorphone was administered until the time dogs were induced for surgery. Vomiting was defined as abdominal contractions followed shortly by expulsion of stomach contents from the mouth. Signs of nausea were characterized by excessive licking of the lips, excessive swallowing, and a hunched posture. Increased panting was defined as a noticeable increase in panting behavior in dogs during the period of premedication, before versus after hydromorphone administration.</p><p>The data were analyzed by Fisher's Exact Test<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12414-note-1005">5</xref> to determine if there were associations between the treatment group and the occurrence of adverse effects. Each side effect (emesis, signs of nausea, salivation, and panting) was assessed individually. If a significant association was found between the proportion of dogs exhibiting and not exhibiting the side effect among the four treatment groups, pairwise comparisons were made between treatment groups. A significance level of 0.05 was used for comparisons among all groups, whereas Bonferroni's correction was used to adjust for the effect of multiple pairwise comparisons (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0083).</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim12414-sec-0011"><title>Results</title><p>All 60 dogs completed the study.

When maropitant is delivered 1 hour before intramuscular hydromorphone vomiting is prevented in all dogs, a finding that is comparable to the results of our study. Acepromazine administered 15&#x000a0;minutes before hydromorphone will prevent vomiting in 24% of dogs,<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> and in our study acepromazine prevented vomiting in 53% (8/15) of the experimental group.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of maropitant administered SC in dogs have been well documented. The peak mean plasma concentration from a 1&#x000a0;mg/kg dose of maropitant in dogs occurs 45&#x000a0;minutes after subcutaneous administration.<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> In our study, maropitant eliminated vomiting in all dogs when given 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;minutes before hydromorphone, but appeared to be less effective (vomiting observed in 27% of dogs) when administered concurrently with hydromorphone. Based on our results, maropitant has antiemetic effects which occur shortly after subcutaneous administration, but are which are most effective when given at least 30&#x000a0;minutes before hydromorphone.</p><p>Excessive panting is an adverse effect of morphine and is believed to be related to an initial rise in body temperature.<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> In the dog, hydromorphone is believed to have similar effects on the thermoregulation center as morphine, thus similarly leading to excessive panting. Both hydromorphone and oxymorphone administered as preanesthetics agents initiate excessive panting in experimental dogs.<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> When these drugs are combined with acepromazine, the incidence of panting significantly decreases.<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> In our study, hydromorphone appeared to induce increased panting in most dogs, and this effect seemed to be alleviated by acepromazine but not by maropitant. Phenothiazines cause central nervous system depression and skeletal muscle relaxation, and it is possible that these effects antagonized the hydromorphone&#x02010;induced panting seen in our dogs.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. We did not include sick or diseased dogs in our study, and the results of our study therefore are not being directly applicable to dogs with conditions that predispose to emesis. Additionally, reporting of adverse effects such as nausea and increased panting was based primarily on the subjective assessment of an anesthesia clinician, since objective scoring systems for such adverse effects have not been established. In order to reduce the impact of the subjectivity of assessment, all clinical signs were evaluated by a single experienced clinician who was blinded to treatment groups. Omitting ptyalism as a sign of nausea, although justifiable on the basis that maropitant alone can cause ptyalism, may have led us to underestimate the incidence of nausea. According to the Freedom of Information Summary regarding the veterinary&#x02010;approved formulation of maropitant, published in 2007, nausea in dogs is defined as increased salivation, lip licking, frequent and/or exaggerated swallowing motions, lethargy, restlessness, or panting.<xref rid="jvim12414-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Finally, although we calculated a sample size that would enable us to elucidate the effects of our various drug protocols on the incidence of vomiting, it is still possible our study was underpowered with regard to achieving significance for other clinical signs such as nausea.</p><p>In conclusion, based on our study in healthy dogs, maropitant citrate administered 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;minutes SC before hydromorphone markedly diminished the incidence of opioid&#x02010;induced vomiting compared to concurrent saline or acepromazine. When maropitant was administered concurrently with hydromorphone, the incidence of vomiting was also reduced significantly when compared to a control group, but not when compared to acepromazine. We also detected an association between the administration of maropitant and an increase occurrence of ptyalism, and between the administration of acepromazine and a decreased occurrence of panting. Further studies are needed to better determine the ideal timing of maropitant in association with opioid administration, to determine the effects of maropitant when used with a mu&#x02010;agonist opioid in sick or debilitated dogs, and to determine whether a combination of maropitant and acepromazine together might better reduce the incidence of both vomiting and panting in dogs receiving opioids.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim12414-sec-0013"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Dr Robert Wills, MS, DVM, PhD, ACVPM (epidemiology), for his help with statistics and the Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine Class of 2015 for their technical assistance.</p><p>This project was supported in part by a donation of Cerenia from Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ.</p><p>
