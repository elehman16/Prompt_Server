In part 1, patients received add-on monthly 50-mg subcutaneous golimumab for 6&#x02005;months. The percentage of patients with good/moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28)&#x02013;erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) response was compared in patient subgroups with various concurrent or previous DMARD treatments. In part 2, patients with EULAR responses but not remission were randomly assigned to receive IV+SC or subcutaneous golimumab to month 12; DAS28&#x02013;ESR remission was measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>3366 patients were enrolled. At baseline of part 1, 3280 efficacy-evaluable patients had mean disease duration of 7.6&#x02005;years and mean DAS28&#x02013;ESR of 5.97 (SD=1.095). At month 6, 82.1% achieved good/moderate EULAR responses and 23.9% attained remission. When EULAR responses were analysed by the number of previously failed DMARD or the concomitant methotrexate dose, DMARD type, or corticosteroid use, no statistically significant differences were observed. Part 2 patients (N=490) who received IV+SC or subcutaneous golimumab achieved similar remission rates (&#x0223c;25%).

Gaining information about TNF inhibitor responses among RA patients with a range of concomitant medications and treatment histories has the potential to improve treatment strategies, especially as the use of TNF inhibitors becomes more widespread and treatment goals evolve. In addition, no studies have evaluated the potential benefit of using a complementary intravenous plus subcutaneous (IV+SC) strategy to increase the chances of achieving remission. Strategies that target remission as the goal of therapy have shown improved overall disease control,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the higher drug exposure and weight-based dosing of an intravenous regimen may make it useful for attaining remission.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>Here we report the results of the GO-MORE trial, a two-part study that investigated the use of golimumab as add-on therapy for RA patients who were receiving a variety of concomitant DMARD in typical clinical practice settings.

The most frequently reported TEAE in the IV+SC golimumab group were upper respiratory tract infection (6.1% of patients), nasopharyngitis (5.3%) and diarrhoea (2.9%). In the subcutaneous golimumab group, the most frequently reported TEAE were nasopharyngitis (7.1%), urinary tract infection (3.9%), bronchitis (3.1%) and headache (3.1%). TEAE leading to early withdrawal occurred in 4.9% and 2.4% of patients in the IV+SC golimumab and subcutaneous golimumab treatment arms, respectively. In the IV+SC golimumab group, injection site pain occurred in one (0.4%) patient.

This remission rate is similar to the rates reported in other observational studies of TNF inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) in patients with RA, which ranged from 8% to 28%.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref> The remission rate is also comparable to the ReAct study, which investigated the efficacy of adalimumab with or without concomitant DMARD (16% vs 20% at 3&#x02005;months, respectively).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The study population was typical of clinical practice settings, and confirms the benefit of adding golimumab to conventional DMARD therapy. Patients showed response to treatment as early as the start of month 2 (after only one injection of subcutaneous golimumab) and had steady improvement in several measures of disease control over 6&#x02005;months of treatment. EULAR response was consistently achieved, regardless of the concomitant methotrexate dose, concomitant DMARD background, concomitant corticosteroid use, or the number of previously failed DMARD. Previous pivotal RA trials did not study the efficacy and safety of golimumab when used with background treatments other than methotrexate.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the current study, patients had similar response patterns whether they received golimumab with concomitant methotrexate or leflunomide. In addition, golimumab efficacy was not affected by the dose of concomitant methotrexate. Similar results have been reported for certolizumab pegol with concomitant methotrexate<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and adalimumab with concomitant methotrexate or with other DMARD.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In part 2, to evaluate possible continuation treatment strategies with golimumab, patients who responded but did not achieve remission after 6&#x02005;months of subcutaneous golimumab treatment were eligible to receive an additional 6&#x02005;months of treatment with either a subcutaneous-only regimen or switch to a short-term intravenous golimumab regimen to induce remission, followed by subcutaneous golimumab. Both strategies were equally effective; each had a DAS28&#x02013;ESR remission rate of approximately 25%. The reason for the similar responses between the treatment groups remains unclear. The loss of the numerical difference between the two treatment arms observed early in part 2 may indicate that small improvements achieved with intravenous golimumab should be maintained with intravenous golimumab instead of resumed subcutaneous golimumab. This study did not test this possibility. Another uninvestigated potential explanation is that a plateau effect prevents increased intravenous golimumab efficacy despite greater peak concentrations.</p><p>In general, golimumab was well tolerated. The pattern of TEAE was consistent with previous reports on golimumab and other TNF antagonists in this population,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> with no new signals identified. In this study, serious adverse event occurred in a lower percentage of patients (5%) than previously observed in a large, similarly designed study with the TNF antagonist adalimumab (13%); however, the three system organ classes with the greatest number of serious TEAE (infections and infestations; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders) were the same between the studies.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In part 1, 0.7% of patients (26 patients) had a TEAE in the &#x02018;neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified&#x02019; category and 0.4% of patients (15 patients) had a serious TEAE in this category; in part 2, four of these events occurred, three of which were serious. These rates are comparable to those reported in a meta-analysis of randomised, controlled trials in patients with RA; malignancies were reported in 0.7% (123/15&#x02005;989) of patients who received biological agents with methotrexate and 0.6% (65/9,819) of patients who received either placebo and/or any non-biological DMARD.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In part 2, the percentage of patients with serious TEAE was numerically greater in the IV+SC golimumab group (6.9%) than the subcutaneous golimumab group (2.4%); however, the percentage in the IV+SC group was comparable to the percentage for patients who had subcutaneous golimumab treatment in part 1 (5.7%). This percentage is also similar to that observed in the GO-FURTHER trial, in which patients with RA received a combination of intravenous golimumab and methotrexate, and 4.1% of patients reported serious adverse events over 24&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> With other TNF inhibitors, serious infection risk has been shown to decrease after 6&#x02005;months of treatment.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In the current study, serious infections occurred in 1.7% of patients at month 6. At month 12, the rate had increased to 2.0% in the IV+SC golimumab group and decreased to 0.8% in the subcutaneous golimumab group.</p><p>One strength of the GO-MORE study is that the number of enrolled patients was large enough to allow for comparison of responses among various patient subpopulations and collection of safety data on a broad sample of patients with RA. Although the open-label, observational, non-randomised design of part 1 makes the study subject to certain biases, it is also beneficial because the data are likely to be representative of that obtained in clinical practice.</p><p>Overall, the results from the GO-MORE study suggest that adding golimumab to several different non-biological DMARD has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in a broader RA patient population than was studied in previous clinical trials. In this typical clinical practice population, approximately 80% of patients achieved good or moderate EULAR response, and approximately 25% achieved remission at month 6, regardless of concomitant or previous DMARD treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figures</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203229-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1478" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web tables</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203229-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1483" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Kathryn Clausen, PhD, and Ellen Stoltzfus, PhD, of JK Communications, Inc., Conshohocken, PA, USA.
