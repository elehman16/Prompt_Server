This trial will recruit 38 women between 18 and 45&#x02005;years of age with secondary dysmenorrhoea with uterine fibroids. The investigational drugs, either GBH or placebo, will be administered to the participants three times per day for two menstrual periods (8&#x02005;weeks). The participants will be followed up for three menstrual cycles after administration of the drugs. The primary outcome will be the Numeric Rating Scale score of average menstrual pain. All analyses will be performed with SAS (V.9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) by a statistician blinded to the allocation of the groups. Statistical analysis will be undertaken on the intent-to-treat (ITT) basis with a 95% CI using the last observation carried forward for missing values. The ITT analysis will include all randomised patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This research protocol has been reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the trial centre (number WSOH IRB 1606-03).

They are the most common benign uterine growths in women of childbearing age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> They are also called uterine leiomyomata, myoma, fibromyoma and fibroids.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The main symptoms may include heavy, painful or prolonged menstrual periods; bleeding between periods; pelvic or low back pain; fullness in the lower abdomen, with or without urinary or rectal symptoms, due to compression; and reproductive problems, such as infertility, multiple miscarriages or early onset of labour.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although several surgical approaches have been recommended for the management of UFs, these methods are invasive and cause tissue injury and other adverse events.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There are also pharmacological therapies, such as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists, but rapid recurrence, wide-ranging adverse side effects and reduced bone mineral density have limited their usage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>East Asian countries, including Korea and China, have used alternative therapies for treating UFs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> These treatments include acupuncture and various herbal medicines. Studies have reported on the effectiveness of these treatments, but most were pilot trials with small sample sizes. Large-scale clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of these treatments.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>In Korean medicine, the main contributor to menstrual abdominal pain is blood stagnation. If the flow of blood or qi is interrupted, it may cause pain. The signs of blood stasis include easy bruising, tender abdominal pain and clots in menstrual blood. Gyejibongneyong-hwan (GBH) is one of the most popular Korean medicine formulas for periodical pain caused by dysmenorrhoea. GBH makes blood more fluid to induce smooth blood flow and reduce pain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of GBH on UFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This clinical trial will be conducted as a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled comparison study.

If for any reason a study participant is not kept blinded to the treatment code by an investigator or a clinical research coordinator in charge of performing assessments, the study will be discontinued for that participant.

We are aiming to publish the study protocol first, and we will then conduct a well-designed trial. It is better to do the power analysis for selection of the optimal number of participants.
