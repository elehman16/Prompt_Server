stimulation (tDCS) and feedback training (FT) on subacute stroke patients with unilateral
visuospatial neglect. [Subjects] The subjects were randomly assigned to a tDCS + FT group
(n=6) and a FT group (n=6). [Methods] Patients in the tDCS + FT group received tDCS for 20
minutes and then received FT for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. The control
group received FT for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. [Results] After the
intervention, both groups showed significant improvements in the Motor-Free Visual
Perception Test (MVPT), line bisection test (LBT), and modified Barthel index (MBI) over
the baseline results. The comparison of the two groups after the intervention revealed
that the rDCS + FT group showed more significant improvements in MVPT, LBT, and MBI.
[Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that tDCS combined with FT has a positive
effect on unilateral visuospatial neglect in patients with subacute stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>TDCS</kwd><kwd>Feedback training</kwd><kwd>Neglect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Unilateral visuospatial neglect is a neurological disorder that occurs frequently after
stroke. It is defined as the loss of visual perception of objects within the visual area
opposite to the lesion hemisphere<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unilateral visuospatial neglect aggravates
the recovery of functional ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
delays the motor recovery phase of stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, many therapeutic approaches that aim to reduce the symptoms
of visuospatial neglect in stroke patients have been investigated (e.g. visual scanning
training, limb activation, mental imagery, feedback training, sensory stimulations, and
prism adaptation)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is a
dearth of guidance on the choice of the approach method<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Feedback training (FT) was recommended for the rehabilition of patients with visuospatial
neglect in a systematic review by Luaut&#x000e9; et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. FT requires subjects to look at the center of a mirror so that they
can see the reflection of the body on the side of visuospatial neglect. The FT approach is
reported to have a positive effect in cases who lack appropriate awareness of a neurological
deficit who are recognized as having poor treatment outcome<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) activates a specific area of the brain
non-invasively, and can induce polarity-specific excitability changes in the brain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, tDCS has gained increasing attention as a the treatment method for visuospatial
neglect<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The area of the right
posterior parietal cortex has been suggested that to be a suitable target area for improving
motor functions and alleviating the symptoms of visuospatial neglect<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. tDCS increases cortical excitability and changes the neural
structures in damaged areas of the brain, inducing neuroplasticity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> have reported the benefical effect of tDCS for visuospatial neglect
patients. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated combined methods (tDCS + FT),
using randomized controlled trials, and compared the effect of tDCS on visuospatial neglect
in patients with acute stroke. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the
effects of tDCS combined with FT in subcute stroke patients with unilateral visuospatial
neglect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were selected from among those with unilateral visuospatial neglect admitted
to W university hospital in the Republic of Korea. They were randomly divided into two
groups. Subjects who provided their informed consent and met the inclusion criteria were
enrolled in this study. The inclusion criterion was more than 15% deviation to the right
from the center in the line bisection test (LBT)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion criteria were (1) severe cognitive impairment
rendering a person unable to understand the instructions given by a therapist; (2)
contraindications for intervention; or (3) unstable medical or neurologic conditions.</p><p>Participation in the study was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood the contents of
this study. Written informed consent, after providing an explanation of the study purpose
and the experimental method and processes, was obtained from all of the subjects. The study
was approved by the institutional review board of Daejeon University and followed the
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>A three-week training study was designed to evaluate the effect of tDCS + FT on unilateral
visuospatial neglect. The severity of visuospatial neglect was assessed pre- and
post-treatment using the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (MVPT) and the line bisection
test (LBT). The capacity to perform daily living activities was assessed using the modified
Barthel index (MBI).</p><p>The experiment began on the day after the subjects had been divided into groups. For both
groups, the intervention progressed during the regularly scheduled therapy sessions and all
other routine interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation proceeded as usual. Each participant
performed a training program consisting of 15 sessions lasting 50&#x02005;min/day, 5 days a week for
three weeks.</p><p>Subjects in the tDCS + FT group received tDCS for 20 minutes and then performed the FT
training. Subjects sat on a chair with both arms on the armrest in a comfortable position. A
sponge electrode of 7&#x000d7;5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> (area; 24&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>) for tDCS (Phoresor Auto
model PM 700, IOMED, Salt Lake City, USA) was soaked in 0.9% physiological saline and
applied to the head of the participant using as tight a band as possible without creating
discomfort. The anode electrode was attached to the right posterior parietal cortex (P4) was
accompanied by cathode tDCS of the second circuit was positioned over the left posterior
parietal cortex (P3). Therefore, in the first tDCS circuit, the anode was placed over P4 and
the cathode was placed over the left supraorbital area. Stimulation was applied with a 1 mA
stimulus intensity for 20&#x02005;min<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both group received FT for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. FT used a vertical
mirror held parallel to the sagittal plane to provide visual feedback of participants&#x02019;
neglected side body. The subjects were asked to look at the center of the mirror so they
could see the reflection of visual input coming from the left side of the body.</p><p>The Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (MVPT)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> is a 36-item multiple-choice test that evaluates visuospatial
neglect. The line bisection test (LBT)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
was used to investigate the quality and severity of visuospatial neglect. The distance from
the left of each line to patients&#x02019; marks and to true line centers were measured. The
deviation was measured. The modified Barthel index (MBI)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to evaluate activities of daily living (ADL).</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline data. Category variables (gender,
side of stroke) were compared between the groups using of the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.
Between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics (age, weight, height, time after
stroke, MVPT, LBT, and MBI) were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Within-group
comparisons of pre- and post-test values in each group were made using Wilcoxon signed rank
test and between-group comparison for post-test values were performed using the Mann-Whitney
U-test. The significance level used was p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Participants in the tDCS + FT group performed the FT after receiving tDCS and those in the

training (FT) in patients with subacute stroke and unilateral visuospatial neglect. Both
groups showed significant changes after the intervention, and the tDCS + FT group showed
more significant changes than the control group in the MVPT, LBT, and MBI results. The
findings of this study show that tDCS combined with FT decreased the symptoms of
visuospatial neglect significantly more than FT alone.</p><p>In recent years, brain activation has been employed in rehabilitation of brain damage<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal
cortex (P4), which is the most critical lesion site for visuospatial neglect<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The results prove that tDCS can alleviate the symptoms of visuospatial neglect.</p><p>The neural mechanism of tDCS is proposed to activate the brain leading to brain plasticity,
and is potentially mediated by glutamatergic and neurotrophic mechanisms, which are known
found to be important in activity dependent brain plasticity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stimulation of the posterior parietal cortex may facilitate the
functioning of this brain region, and therefore improve spatial perception or awareness of
the body.</p><p>The FT method is recommended with a grade B. It uses a visual-feedback procedure to
increase self-awareness of the subjects visual neglect symptoms<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neglect is a reduction in body awareness, response ability,
or reaction to novel stimuli which can affect perception and mental representation of
spatial information, as well as planning and execution of motor action<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, overcoming visuospatial neglect is critical for the
improvement of functional outcomes, both as an independent measure and in connection with
other variables<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Applying tDCS had a positive effect on the symptoms of visuospatial neglect in subacute
stoke patients in addition to the FT effect. FT has already been shown to reduce
visuospatial neglect, and selective stimulation of the brain helps to improve awareness of
the body<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, only a small number of hospital patients in the
hospital were recruited, so the data may not be representative of stroke patients as a
whole. Second, there was no follow up to measure the long-term effect, so the durability of
the effect could not be determined. Thus, the results should be considered with caution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial,
