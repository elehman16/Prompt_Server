No difference in the effect of screening was seen between men younger than 60 and those older than 60. Screening reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer in women younger than 60 (relative risk 0.71; 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.84), but not significantly in those aged 60 or older (0.90; 0.80 to 1.02). Colorectal cancer mortality was significantly reduced in both younger and older men, and in women younger than 60.

In four large scale randomised trials, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening has been shown to reduce both incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and one meta-analysis has shown consistent effects across the trials, with similar length of follow-up.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Flexible sigmoidoscopy visualises only the distal part of colon. To partly overcome this limitation, individuals with pathological findings in the distal colon are referred for colonoscopy, because they might have clinically significant pathology in the proximal colon.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in younger versus older individuals and in women versus men is currently unknown. There are reasons to believe that the effectiveness might differ in men and women. Women have proximal advanced neoplasia without a distal adenoma more frequently than men, which could trigger referral for colonoscopy.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, in past decades, there has been a proximal shift in the localisation of colorectal cancer that appears more pronounced in women than men, especially among older women.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Thus, the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening might be small or negligible in older women. If this hypothesis is confirmed, screening recommendations for colorectal cancer might need to be reconsidered.</p><p>To investigate the impact of sex and age on the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, we launched a collaboration between the investigators of three of the four large scale randomised trials.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We merged aggregated data and conducted a pooled analysis of subgroups for sex and age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We examined data from three trials: the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO), the Italian Screening for COlonREctum trial (SCORE), and the NORwegian Colorectal CAncer Prevention trial (NORCCAP).<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We invited the investigators of a fourth large scale flexible sigmoidoscopy screening trial (the UK Flexi Scope trial) to participate, but they declined.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Data from a fifth flexible sigmoidoscopy screening trial, the Telemark Polyp Study, were not included owing to the trial&#x02019;s small size (799 enrolled individuals). Accordingly, data from 60% of control participants and 67% of screening participants of all flexible sigmoidoscopy screening trials were available for analyses.</p><sec><title>PLCO</title><p>The flexible sigmoidoscopy screening part of the PLCO trial included individuals aged 55-74<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> who were invited by post. Individuals were enrolled between 1993 and 2001 at 10 screening centres in the USA. Exclusion criteria were a history of prostate, lung, ovarian, or colorectal cancer; ongoing treatment for any type of cancer except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; or a history of lower endoscopy in the previous three years (beginning in 1995). Those who accepted the invitation were randomised to flexible sigmoidoscopy at inclusion and after three to five years, or to usual care (with no organised screening). Compliance with the first screen was 83.5%, and 86.6% of participants underwent at least one screening examination. A positive screening test was defined as any lesion or mass that was detected during sigmoidoscopy, and all individuals with a positive test were referred to their primary care physician for further investigation, of which 95.6% included a colonoscopy. Colorectal cancer was defined as adenocarcinoma or carcinoid in the colon or rectum. Cancers were ascertained through questionnaires that were mailed annually, and all were verified through medical records. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00002540).</p></sec><sec><title>SCORE</title><p>The SCORE investigators invited individuals aged 55-64 in six regions of Italy between 1995 and 1999.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Exclusion criteria were a history of colorectal cancer, adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, having had a lower endoscopy within the previous two years, two or more first degree relatives with colorectal cancer, or a medical condition that precluded a possible benefit from screening. Individuals who accepted the invitation were randomised to once only flexible sigmoidoscopy, or to usual care (no screening). Compliance with screening was 58.3%. A positive screening test was defined as colorectal cancer, any polyp that was greater than 5 mm in diameter, three or more adenomas, or any adenoma with high grade dysplasia or villous histology. Screened patients who tested positive were referred for colonoscopy at the screening centres. Colorectal cancer was defined as adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. Cases of colorectal cancer were ascertained by periodic linking of the trial database to the hospital discharge records and databases of the pathology departments. Blinded experts from the local cancer registries reviewed the candidate colorectal cancer cases. The trial is registered at isrctn.gov (ISRCTN27814061).</p></sec><sec><title>NORCCAP</title><p>Between 1999 and 2001, individuals aged 50-64 living in two areas of Norway were identified through the Population Registry.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A personal history of colorectal cancer was the only exclusion criterion. A random sample of people was offered once only flexible sigmoidoscopy or the combination of once only flexible sigmoidoscopy and once only immunochemical testing for faecal occult blood (FlexSure OBT, Beckman-Coulter). The remaining population aged 50-64 who lived in the same areas served as controls and were not offered screening. Compliance with screening was 63%. A positive screening test (defined as colorectal cancer, any adenoma, a polyp with diameter 10 mm or greater, or a positive faecal immunochemical test) qualified for colonoscopy referral at the screening centres. Colorectal cancer was defined as adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. Data were extracted by linking the participants&#x02019; national identity numbers to the nationwide Norwegian Cancer Registry. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00119912).</p></sec><sec><title>Aggregated analyses</title><p>The investigators of the three trials provided aggregated data stratified by sex and age (in 5 year age groups), the number of individuals at risk, and the number of events (colorectal cancer cases and deaths) for each year of follow-up. From the three groups, we collected data on compliance with screening, follow-up colonoscopy, quality of bowel cleansing, and insertion depth during screening. The a priori primary outcome of the present study was to determine the incidence of colorectal cancer in the distal and proximal colon by sex and age group. Mortality due to distal or proximal colorectal cancer by sex and age group was the secondary outcome. We chose this approach to optimise power in the analyses (the event ratio of colorectal cancer cases to deaths was about 4:1). The distal colon was defined as the rectum and sigmoid, while the proximal colon was defined as the colon proximal to the sigmoid descending junction. Patients provided written, informed consent in the context of each trial (only screening attenders in NORCCAP). No new consent was obtained for the pooled analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were extracted from the databases used in the most recent publications. Data from the PLCO trial differed somewhat from those previously published,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> owing to the withdrawal of consents and updating of the trial database. We performed pairwise comparisons (stratified by sex and age group) of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening versus no screening using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects model and report relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and forest plots. We applied a random effects model in a sensitivity analysis, and the results were comparable. Heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>) was assessed according to recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration: 0-30%=might not be important, 30-50%=moderate heterogeneity, 50-75%=substantial heterogeneity, 75-100%=considerable heterogeneity.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>We also constructed standardised cumulative risk plots using the screening group as the standard. The risk per year of follow-up was calculated as the number of colorectal cancer cases or deaths during that year divided by the mean number of people at risk for the same year. In the primary analyses, we included data for individuals aged 50-74 and stratified the analyses according to sex and age at screening (&#x0003c;60 years <italic>v</italic> &#x02265;60 years).</p><p>We performed sensitivity analyses of the 55-64 year age group only because this was the age range covered by all three trials. We also analysed the data after extending the definition of distal colon to include the descending colon. To explore the impact of compliance with screening and the quality of the examination (screening flexible sigmoidoscopy and follow-up colonoscopy), we included compliance, bowel cleansing, and insertion depth at screening, and colonoscopy referral rate in univariate random effect metaregression models. The caecum intubation rate for colonoscopy examinations was not available for all trials.</p><p>To assess the heterogeneity between sex and age groups, we also included an interaction term between sex and age group and performed a multivariate metaregression analysis. Using the metareg program<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> in Stata, we weighted the regression model to include variance within the study as well as residual variance between trials. Because the stratified data in the metaregression model were extracted from the same trials, we included indicator variables for the different trials in the regression model in addition to sex, age group, and the interaction term. All analyses were conducted with Stata 13.0 software (StataCorp) and Review Manager software version 5.2 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration). P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant and all analyses were by intention to treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient involvement</title><p>No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Altogether, the three trials comprised 115&#x02009;139 individuals randomised to screening and 172&#x02009;789 individuals randomised to usual care; 144&#x02009;846 (50.3%) were women and 143&#x02009;082 (49.7%) were men.

There was moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=33%, P=0.16) between the studies when the results for all women were pooled (fig 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"/>). The heterogeneity disappeared completely when data for women younger and older than 60 years were pooled separately (I<sup>2</sup>=0% for both comparisons).

This finding was consistent in all three trials (fig 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"/>).</p><p>In a sensitivity analysis, we included the descending colon in the definition of distal colon, and the results were comparable with those presented above: only 160 (3.8%) of 4157 cases of colorectal cancer were located in the descending colon. In a second sensitivity analysis, we included procedural characteristics (compliance with screening, colonoscopy referral rate, bowel cleansing, and insertion depth of the endoscope at the screening examination) in univariate metaregression models, but none of these procedural characteristics was statistically significant. Thirdly, we included only individuals in the age group 55-64 years (the age range covered by all three trials, web table 3). Finally, we excluded the PLCO trial because of its large size compared with SCORE and NORCCAP. The results were comparable with the main analysis (web table 4, web figs 1 and 2).</p><p>To explore whether the difference in effectiveness of screening could be attributable to the distribution of colorectal cancer in the distal and proximal colon among men and women in different age groups, we used the control group (no screening) and calculated the proportion of colorectal cancers in the distal (rectosigmoid) colon compared with the proximal colon (fig 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"/>). As shown, the proportion of distal versus proximal colorectal cancer was smaller for women than for men in all age groups. Proximal location of colorectal cancer occurs more frequently with increasing age. The distal/proximal ratio was about one in women aged 55-59, and less than one in those age 60 and over, while the same observation was made for men aged 70 and over.</p><fig id="f7" fig-type="figure" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Fig 7</bold>&#x000a0;Proportion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases among men and women in the distal (rectosigmoid) and proximal colon (oral to the descending sigmoid junction) in the usual care groups in PLCO, SCORE, and NORCCAP trials.

Cooperation between our research groups enabled us to include aggregated data from almost 300&#x02009;000 individuals followed for 10 to 12 years. We found that flexible sigmoidoscopy is an effective screening tool in men. Incidence of colorectal cancer decreased by 24% and mortality by 33%, regardless of age at screening. In women, the effect was smaller, and confined to women younger than 60 years.</p><p>The uniform effectiveness in the distal colon is expected, because this part is visualised during the screening examination. The effectiveness of screening in the proximal colon, however, depends on concomitant pathological findings in the distal and proximal colon. Several studies have found such an association,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but others report that proximal advanced neoplasia without distal lesions are more common in women than in men,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which could explain why flexible sigmoidoscopy is less effective in women. Our results support this suggestion, but we also show that the smaller effect in women depends on age at screening.</p><p>In women younger than 60, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer in the proximal colon, and in the sensitivity analyses for women aged 55-59 at screening, mortality was also reduced. The age difference in women might be due to technical issues with the procedures for sigmoidoscopy and subsequent colonoscopy (for those women who test positive at screening). Studies have identified greater difficulties in undertaking colonoscopies in women.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, we found no large differences in performance or compliance (bowel cleansing, endoscope insertion depth, adherence to colonoscopy follow-up, caecum intubation rate) in older women compared with younger women (web table 1), and procedural characteristics were not statistically significant when they were tested in univariate meta regression models. More men than women were referred for colonoscopy due to findings at screening, which could explain the difference between the sexes in the proximal colon, but this cannot explain the age difference observed in women. This difference might be due to differences in the location of colorectal cancers in younger versus older women. As shown in figure 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"/>, distal colorectal cancer is more frequent than proximal colorectal cancer in younger women, whereas after the age of 55-60, proximal colorectal cancer dominates. A similar trend is seen in men, but the shift from a higher proportion of distal to a higher proportion of proximal cancers occurs 10 years later than in women.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Reports from several countries have shown similar findings, in addition to a temporal trend towards greater incidence of proximal colorectal cancer in recent decades, especially in women. <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This is unlikely to be the only explanation for the observed difference in sex and age, however. The ratio of distal to proximal cancers is only marginally different in women between the age ranges of 55-59 and 60-64 (fig 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"/>), while there seems to be a change in the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening at around age 60.</p><p>In recent years, it has become evident that colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Current screening strategies focus on the detection of adenomas, but adenomas&#x02014;through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02014;is only one of the precursors to colorectal cancer. About 16% of colorectal cancers develop through the serrated pathway, with the sessile serrated adenoma or polyp (SSA/P) as the precursor lesion.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These lesions are most often proximal, and in one study, 52% of individuals with advanced proximal serrated polyps (defined as SSA/P &#x02265;10 mm with dysplastic features, or traditional serrated adenomas) did not have a distal lesion that could be detected at flexible sigmoidoscopy and which would trigger a full colonoscopy.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the same study, distal adenomas were associated with proximal adenomas, but not with proximal advanced serrated lesions. Thus, flexible sigmoidoscopy could be inadequate in detecting these polyps.</p><p>Risk factors for adenomas and serrated polyps might differ between men and women and could be important when flexible sigmoidoscopy is considered as a screening tool.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Being male is a well established risk factor for adenomas, but the evidence for sex as a risk factor for SSA/P is limited and conflicting.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Some reports have found that being female is an independent risk factor for SSA/P, but others have not confirmed this finding.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> There is unlikely to be a male predominance for SSA/P, however. Advancing age is probably also a risk factor for SSA/P, as it is for adenomas.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, with increasing age, proximal SSA/P and proximal adenomas become more prevalent. A considerable proportion of these proximal polyps might not have a distal lesion that could trigger a full colonoscopy. The proportion without a distal adenoma might be more pronounced in women than men and could explain the difference that we observe in women in the present pooled analysis.</p><p>The analysis of colorectal cancer mortality is more difficult to interpret. The number of deaths are few and the confidence intervals wide when the data is stratified in subgroups. This could explain why the point estimates for death due to proximal colorectal cancer seem discordant with those for proximal colorectal cancer incidence. Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality via polypectomy, which prevents incidence of colorectal cancer and results in fewer tumours being at risk for causing death due to colorectal cancer. Flexible sigmoidoscopy also reduces mortality via early detection, because screen detected tumours have a more favourable prognosis. An interesting finding is illustrated in figure 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"/>. Cancers detected through screening are almost exclusively located in the distal colon, as evident from the starting points of the curves. Possible explanations are that the proximal colon is not visualised in most screening participants, that distal polyps are poor predictors of synchronous proximal colorectal cancer, and that few proximal colorectal cancers were prevalent at the time of sigmoidoscopy screening. Because few proximal cancers were detected early at screening, any screening effect in the proximal colon needs to be mediated through prevention, and not by early detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of study</title><p>Strengths of this study include the large number of individuals and consistent results between trials, with no heterogeneity in the stratified analyses, but there are several limitations. Firstly, the statistical test for heterogeneity has limited power to detect differences between trials when the number of studies is small.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Secondly, the PLCO trial is larger than the other two trials and includes older individuals (&#x0003e;65 years), which could create bias. For example, in the screening group, 79% of individuals 60 years or older were recruited from the PLCO trial, which might limit the generalisability of the results. Results from the sensitivity analyses do not support the existence of such a bias, however. In the analyses restricted to the 55-64 year age group from all three trials, and in analyses restricted to SCORE and NORCCAP only, the results were comparable with the main findings (supplementary material).</p><p>Thirdly, even if our findings were consistent across the three trials and the numbers are large and of high statistical precision, we would appreciate validation in independent samples. The only available data source for validation is the UK Flexi Scope trial, which would have added 50% more individuals to the pooled screening group and might have affected our results.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the UK trial, however, proximal colorectal cancer incidence rates were almost identical in the group that was screened and the group that received usual care, probably due to the low rate of colonoscopy referrals (5%), compared with the three other trials (8.8-21.9%).<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Inclusion of the UK trial in the present pooled analysis might thus have obscured the difference in sex and age with regards to the proximal colon, because few participants had visualisation of the proximal large bowel.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Finally, even if almost 300&#x02009;000 individuals were included in our pooled analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between men and women in any age group, and the results should be interpreted with this in mind. However, almost 72&#x02009;000 women were 60 years and older, of whom 662 were diagnosed with proximal colorectal cancer. Not at any point since randomisation was there any difference between the screening group and the control group (fig 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"/>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and policy implications</title><p>Currently, screening recommendations for colorectal cancer are similar for men and women, both with respect to screening modality and screening age. Our results could serve as a basis for more individualised recommendations determined by the age and sex of those eligible for screening. The idea of screening recommendations that are specific to these categories, however, raises concerns about acceptability in the population and also whether different life expectancy between men and women should be taken into account. Most important is to offer a screening programme that indeed reduces colorectal cancer morbidity. According to our findings, flexible sigmoidoscopy is a valid screening option for men and younger women, but is not as effective for women aged 60 years and older. Whether other screening tools to more effectively detect proximal tumours&#x02014;such as colonoscopy or the faecal occult blood test&#x02014;offer a better alternative for older women is currently unknown and warrants further investigation.</p><boxed-text position="float" id="boxa" content-type="4"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic? </title><list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><p>Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening has been shown to reduce incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer in randomised trials</p></list-item><list-item><p>The effectiveness of such screening by age and sex is unknown</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><p>Aggregated data from three large scale randomised trials showed a difference in the effect of screening between the sexes; flexible sigmoidoscopy screening reduces incidence of colorectal cancer in men, and in women younger than 60</p></list-item><list-item><p>In women aged 60 and over, incidence of colorectal cancer was not reduced by screening, possibly because of increased prevalence of cancers in the proximal colon in older women</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other screening modalities that more effectively detect proximal tumours should be considered in older women</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="data-supplement"><label>Web extra</label><p>Extra material supplied by the authors</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p><bold>Appendix: Supplementary material</bold></p></caption><media xlink:href="holo034022.ww_default.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></notes><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank Jan Odgaard-Jensen at the Norwegian Knowledge Center for the Health Services for assistance with statistical analyses.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Contributors: All authors had access to all data and take responsibility for the integrity of the data.
