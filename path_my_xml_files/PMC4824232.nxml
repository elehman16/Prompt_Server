The proportions of patients with adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 47% in the chloroquine arm (31 of 65 patients) and 66% in the DHA-PPQ arm (42 of 63 patients) in the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier intention-to-treat analysis (absolute difference 19%, 95% confidence interval = 0&#x02013;37%), thus establishing non-inferiority of DHA-PPQ. Fever clearance time (median 24 versus 12 hours, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), parasite clearance time (median 36 versus 18 hours, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and parasite clearance half-life (mean 3.98 versus 1.80 hours, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) were all significantly shorter in the DHA-PPQ arm. All cases of recurrent parasitemia in the chloroquine arm occurred from day 33 onward, with corresponding whole blood chloroquine concentration lower than 100 ng/mL in all patients.

Drug levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In brief, the liquid chromatography system was a LaChrom Elite (Merck&#x02013;Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by EZChrom Elite version 3.18 HPLC System Manager Software (Merck&#x02013;Hitachi). Solid phase extraction (SPE) on Isolute-96-CBA (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to process 100 &#x003bc;L of plasma/whole blood samples. After the SPE procedure, 50 &#x003bc;L of reconstituted solution was injected into HPLC system. Chloroquine, MCQ, and quinine (internal standard) were separated using a mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer 25 mM (pH 2.60) and acetonitrile (88:12, v/v) with 2 mM sodium perchlorate on a ZORBAX SB-CN 150 &#x000d7; 4.6-mm, 5-&#x003bc;m column equipped with 5-&#x003bc;m guard cartridges ZORBAX SB-CN 12.5 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/minute at ambient temperature in 10 minutes. The retention time of chloroquine was 4.62 minutes, MCQ was 5.95 minutes, and that of quinine (internal standard) was 7.50 minutes. The diode array detector was set at a wavelength of 343 nm. The method was linear over the range of 10&#x02013;5,000 ng/mL for both chloroquine and MCQ in plasma and whole blood with <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.99. The limit of detection was 4 ng/mL and limit of quantification was 10 ng/mL in both plasma and blood for both chloroquine and MCQ. The intra-, inter- and total assay precisions were less than 10% for chloroquine and MCQ in plasma and whole blood samples. In plasma, the accuracies varied between 101% and 103% for chloroquine and MCQ; whereas in whole blood, the accuracies ranged from 97.0&#x02013;102% for chloroquine and MCQ. The mean recoveries of chloroquine and MCQ were 89.58&#x02013;91.24% and 84.22&#x02013;91.32% for plasma and 77.74&#x02013;82.06% and 75.88&#x02013;79.76% for blood, respectively.

Data from 1995 in southern, central Vietnam showed that of the evaluable <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients, 23/23 (100%) had sensitive infections,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but in another 28-day study conducted from 1997 to 2000 in southern Vietnam, recurrent parasitemia was reported in 18/113 (16%) patients, suggesting the emergence of chloroquine resistance.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a more recent 28-day study of 64 <italic>P. vivax</italic> cases, also conducted in central Vietnam (2009), there were 9.4% recurrences.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Our 63-day study at two sentinel sites in an area of moderately high malaria transmission in southern Vietnam confirmed that both chloroquine and DHA-PPQ are well-tolerated and efficacious treatments for <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria. DHA-PPQ was definitely not inferior to chloroquine and in some therapeutic aspects was superior. Fever and parasite clearance were more rapid, and overall recurrence rates were lower.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Experience from the use of DHA-PPQ in the treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in Vietnam over many years showed that this is a safe and well-tolerated regimen. If DHA-PPQ is accepted for the treatment of both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, the procurement and distribution of antimalarials of the national malaria control/elimination program will be simplified.</p><p>There were 47 &#x0201c;late treatment failures&#x0201d; in this study which, except for one recurrent parasitemia on day 28 in the DHA-PPQ arm, happened after day 35 when blood concentrations of both drugs had declined. Primaquine was not given in this study, and so it is difficult to determine the nature of these recurrences (i.e., whether they were relapses from liver hypnozoites, recrudescences caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment or reinfections). According to Baird, recurrent parasitemia within 35 days of chloroquine therapy supports a provisional diagnosis of resistance.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The earliest case of recurrent parasitemia in the chloroquine arm occurred on day 33 with corresponding chloroquine and MCQ concentrations of 10.7 and 8.6 ng/mL in the patient's whole blood and plasma, respectively. Among recurrent parasitemias in the chloroquine arm, 17/28 (61%) occurred from day 42 to day 49 suggesting these recurrences were probably relapses from latent hypnozoites, as elsewhere in the southeast Asia region.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The lower rate of recurrences in the DHA-PPQ arm may reflect more potent suppression of relapses or reinfections during the follow-up period.</p><p>Regarding G6PD status among enrolled patients, only one case of deficiency was recorded in a male of S'Ti&#x000ea;ng ethnic minority. Confirmation of G6PD status using the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method in our study population is in progress and results will be reported later. Previous studies have shown that G6PD deficiency determined by the methylene blue reduction test and by G-6-PDH kit (Sigma diagnostics, Dorset, United Kingdom) was 8.7% (23/266) in Kinh ethnic people and 14% (36/258) in S'Ti&#x000ea;ng people, respectively,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> although rates in <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria are often lower as G6PD deficiency provides some protection. All the patients in our study received 14-day primaquine on day 63 or day of recurrent parasitemia (except the one G6PD deficiency case mentioned above), and there was no hemoglobinuria or other adverse effects.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that chloroquine is still an effective treatment of <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria but that DHA-PPQ offers clinical and operational advantages.</p><p>In recent years, benefits and disadvantages of using ACTs, especially combinations with partner drugs that have long half-lives (DHA-PPQ, artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine), have been reviewed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition to prompt clinical and parasitological responses with shorter fever clearance times and parasite clearance times, ACTs that provide very rapid reduction in parasite biomass, including gametocytemia, may suppress resistant strains more effectively than chloroquine alone, and consequently, possess a transmission blocking potential.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Operationally, using ACTs in remote areas in malaria-endemic regions or in the private sector where the correct differential parasitological diagnosis is limited may help to avoid wrong drug choices and consequent severe complications. In terms of cost-effectiveness, an additional cost linked with using ACTs for both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria may be a concern for policy makers, but in Vietnam the cost difference would not be large because DHA-PPQ is locally produced. In any case, the clinical and operational benefits of a single simple effective treatment would outweigh the disadvantages.</p><p>To conclude, chloroquine remains efficacious for the treatment of <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria in southern Vietnam. DHA-PPQ, not inferior to chloroquine in efficacy, is an alternative treatment with many advantages over chloroquine: shorter parasite clearance half-life, parasite clearance time, and fever clearance time and lower proportion of parasite clearance time &#x0003e; 48 hours.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the health staff of Dak O and Bu Gia Map communes for allowing us access to malaria patients and the patients for participating in the study.
