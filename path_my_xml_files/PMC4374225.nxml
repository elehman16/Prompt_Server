Both spinal and epidural have been used as an adjunct to GA for LC effectively and safely, and have provided better analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Spinal anesthesia (SA), including segmental thoracic SA has been used as a sole anesthetic technique for LC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] SA offers the advantages of less postoperative pain, less postoperative nausea vomiting, early ambulation and more oriented and awake patient at the end of surgery in comparison to GA.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Neuroendocrine stress response is a major event during laparoscopy as tissue manipulation and pneumoperitoneum result in intense stimulation to the nervous system leading to corticosteroid and catecholamine release.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This results in hemodynamic surge in the form of raised systemic vascular resistance and hypertension and tachycardia in majority of the cases and raised serum cortisol level.</p><p>This study was undertaken to compare the effect of GA and SA on the various hemodynamic parameters (heart rate [HR], mean arterial pressure [MAP]), serum cortisol level and any ventilatory impairment (oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] and end-tidal carbon-dioxide [EtCO<sub>2</sub>]) during LC in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) PS 1 patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethics committee clearance and written informed consent from patients, 30 patients of ASA physical status I, aged 18-65 years, body weight 50-70 kg scheduled for LC were included in this clinical trial. Any patient with a history of allergy or spinal surgery or any other systemic disease or on any medications known to affect sympathetic response and cortisol secretions were excluded from the study. The patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups of 15 each &#x02014; Group A-received GA and Group B &#x02014; Received SA. Randomization was done following a computer-generated randomization table. Blinding could not be done for both the patient and observer for the obvious difference in procedure.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-184-g001"/></fig><p>Patients in group A were administered 3-5 mg/kg thiopentone sodium, 0.03 mg/kg midazolam, 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl intravenous (i.v). They were maintained with sevoflurane (2%) after endotracheal intubation with atracurium besylate (0.5 mg/kg), which was repeated intermittently. In group B, SA was administered at L<sub>2-3</sub> level in sitting the posture with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl using 26 gauge spinal needle. Then 15&#x000b0; Trendelenburg position was maintained for 10 min and sensory level was checked at intervals of 30 s till it reached T<sub>4</sub> level or till 10 min, whichever was earlier. In patients in whom adequate sensory level was not achieved, GA was administered and were excluded from the study. In both the groups, lactated ringer solution was infused at 10 ml/kg for 30 min before administration of anesthesia and then maintained at 4 ml/kg/h intraoperatively. In both groups, 8 mg ondansetron and 8 mg dexamethasone were administered i.v and 10 ml of 1% lignocaine was instilled in the right subdiaphragmatic space after pneumoperitoneum. In group B, if patients complained of shoulder pain further, they were treated with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg i.v and midazolam 0.03 mg/kg i.v.</p><p>For cortisol assay, venous blood was collected from the arm opposite to that in which i.v fluid was infused, before administering anesthesia and 30 min after pneumoperitoneum. Blood was collected in plain red topped venipuncture tubes without any anticoagulant and was allowed to clot. The samples were centrifuged to separate plasma and were refrigerated at 2-8&#x000b0;C for a maximum period of 5 days. The assay was done with microplate enzyme immunoassay (AccuBind ELISA Microwells, Code: 3625-300). The study was done for a period of 5 days as the serum samples could be stored at desired temperature only for 3-5 days.</p><p>Patients were monitored intraoperatively using multi-channel monitors (HR, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiogram). HR and MAP were recorded at 10 min interval.

This was circumvented by some authors by using nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) instead of CO2.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The pain due to CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation responded well to i.v opioids e.g., alfentanil, fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we have treated such pain with judicious use of i.v fentanyl and instillation of lignocaine 1% under the undersurface of diaphragm on the right side as soon as possible after pneumoperitoneum was created and by using low CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation rate to maintain intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) &#x0003c;12 mm Hg. As carbonic acid produced after CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation produces referred pain in shoulder after contact with under the surface of diaphragm, instillation of local anesthetic prevented this pain.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgeries have shown various hemodynamic changes, e.g., increased MAP (29%) and increased cardiac index (22%).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The increase in systemic vascular resistance during laparoscopic surgeries has multiple origins e.g., - a reflex sympathetic response to the pneumoperitoneum induced decline in cardiac output, release of various neurohumoral factors due to peritoneal stretching and influence on posture. The spinal sympathetic block compensates for the increased sympathetic tone resulting from pneumoperitoneum in head-up position and offsets the vasomotor constriction of splanchnic organs and leg muscles. This explains why none of the patients experienced intraoperative hypertension. Vasodilatation due to SA induced sympathetic blockade, and avoidance of positive pressure ventilation lessens the hemodynamic perturbations due to pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study, MAP was found to be always lower in SA group than in GA group.</p><p>Usual finding of hypotension was not found in this study, which may be attributed to liberal fluid therapy, low IAP, minimal operating table tilt and absence of any cardiovascular disease in the patients. HR was also found to be lower in the SA group in this study, though not significant statistically.</p><p>None of the patients in either group showed any incidence of desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;95%) or hypercapnia (EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;45 mm Hg).</p><p>Among neuroendocrine hormones, cortisol and catecholamines have been shown to rise following pneumoperitoneum even with other different anesthetic techniques (GA, GA + epidural).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a study Calvo Soto <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that SA alone has prevented the rise in cortisol level, but epidural anesthesia could not do so.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In this study, patients who received SA revealed less cortisol level after pneumoperitoneum that was statistically significant, compared with the patients who received GA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). When the pre and postpneumoperitoneum cortisol levels were compared in the SA group alone, there was a significant fall after pneumoperitoneum (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). With GA, cortisol level was seen to rise after pneumoperitoneum, though not statistically significant.</p><p>Limitations of the current study are - inadequate number of patients (based on the result of previous study, we calculated the sample size of at least 24 in each group with a power of 0.9 and type one error of 0.05) not measuring other markers of stress response, no objective measurement to exclude any microaspirations. Since the serum samples could be stored at desired temperature only for 3-5 days, we could get only such number of patients.</p><p>This inference would be better validated if performed in a muticenter trial with more number of patients including those with other comorbidities e.g., hypertension, diabetes etc., and if other markers of stress response as adrenocorticotropic hormone, catecholamines could be measured. More objective scoring system for patient satisfaction such as a numeric rating scale can be used to quantify satisfaction as was done by Naguib and Samarkandi[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] can be used to enhance the quality of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine
