This behaviour is best captured using critical thinking assessments. The aim of this paper is to describe a rigorous, pre-registered study which will investigate the effect of an online mindfulness intervention on Executive Functioning, critical thinking skills and associated thinking dispositions.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The design employed is a randomised-controlled 2 (condition) X 2 (time) parallel-group design which is explanatory in nature. A sample of at least 60 participants will be recruited from the pool of students at NUI Galway, with those between the ages of 18 and 65 with an adequate level of English included. Participants will be randomly assigned following screening, using block randomisation with a fixed block of 6 and a 1:1 ratio, to either the mindfulness meditation group or a sham meditation group. Both groups will be given access to the Headspace app. This is an app which provides guided meditations to users. Participants in each group will receive unique codes granting access to either the experimental or active-control intervention materials. Group allocation will be double-blinded. The primary outcome measures will assess mindfulness, executive functioning, critical thinking, actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition. Secondary outcome measures will assess eudaimonic and hedonic wellbeing, positive and negative affect, and real-world outcomes. These will be measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Manipulation checks will assess adherence to the intervention, meditation quality and task difficulty and enjoyment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If this intervention proves effective, it will show the potential of mindfulness practice to facilitate everyday critical thinking and should stimulate more interest in this line of research. If ineffective, claims regarding mindfulness and thinking skills should be tempered. This research was funded by a Galway Doctoral Research Scholarship awarded to the first author and was facilitated by Headspace Inc. who provided the intervention materials. The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry and any protocol amendments will be recorded there (RCT ID: ISRCTN16588423. Registered 7th January 2016).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Critical thinking</kwd><kwd>Thinking dispositions</kwd><kwd>Executive functioning</kwd><kwd>Executive function</kwd><kwd>Dual processes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001634</institution-id><institution>National University of Ireland, Galway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>In a world where we have more information than ever before available to us, it is vital to be able to analyse this information, evaluate its quality, relevance, credibility, and logical soundness and apply it in appropriate circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This ability is often described as critical thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In psychological literature, critical thinking is considered a metacognitive process involving skills such as analysis, evaluation and inference that, when used appropriately, increase the chances of producing a logical conclusion to an argument or solution to a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Developing these thinking skills is important in order to make the most of the information available to us rather than just passively assimilating it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Critical thinking is recognised as an important higher-order cognitive process which requires a non-automatic response to a problem situation in order to avoid the inappropriate application of heuristics and biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The demand for skill in critical thinking has made the question of what determines effective critical thinking an essential one to investigate. Research has focused on types of instruction such as critical thinking infusion and immersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], dispositional factors such as cognitive effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], open-mindedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and truth-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and cognitive ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Investigations into the importance of thinking dispositions and cognitive ability converge in research on the self-regulation of higher-order cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently, mindfulness, a state of attention involving non-reactive awareness of present moment internal and external stimuli, has also been a target of research and has been suggested as beneficial for critical thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous intervention studies have shown improved performance in aspects of critical thinking following mindfulness training but have not examined the underlying mechanisms (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). A recent cross-sectional study found evidence for inhibition mediating a positive relationship between mindfulness and critical thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In considering the self-regulation of critical thinking, mindfulness is a functionally relevant construct. Though conceptualisations of mindfulness vary, all highlight the role of mindfulness in enhanced self-regulation of thought and emotion and all contrast mindful information processing with automatic, habitual or heuristic information processing, often referred to as mindlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The link between mindfulness and self-regulatory processes can best be explored by considering the currently most cited operational definition of mindfulness in light of cognitive models of self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, in cognitive models of self-regulation, the mobilisation of self-regulatory resources is characterised by the effective operation of the executive functions (EFs) that support and govern working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These processes also regulate attention and&#x000a0;are integral to the process of of mindfulness&#x000a0;which consists of two components: present-moment attentional focus coupled with non-reactive monitoring of one&#x02019;s ongoing experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Practitioners of mindfulness meditation cultivate a state of non-reactive present-moment attention by focusing their attention on the present-moment, usually using an anchor such as their breath, and paying full attention to any internal or external stimuli that arise while supressing the elaboration of affective cues triggered by these stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. From time to time, the attention of the practitioner will wander, at which point they should notice this and bring their attention back to the present moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>There is an emerging consensus that EF involves three basic processes: updating, inhibition and shifting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These processes are engaged during the practice of mindfulness and empirical studies have shown that regular mindfulness practice can enhance these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Updating refers to the active revision and monitoring of thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. During a mindful state, the act of focusing in the present moment requires constant updating of working memory as internal and external stimuli change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The updating and maintenance of working memory is a vital self-regulatory process as it facilitates the accurate active representation of goals and goal-related information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Inhibition refers to the active, deliberate suppression of thoughts or responses and the maintenance of attention on goal-relevant information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Inhibition is involved in keeping attention focused on the present moment by inhibiting elaboration of and reactivity to affective cues. This allows for the early engagement of emotion regulation before intense emotional reactivity to the attended thoughts, feelings and sensations can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Shifting can refer to flexibility in use of different strategies to achieve a goal or flexibility in switching between multiple goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This is engaged during a mindful state when the mind wanders and attention must be directed back to the present-moment. Furthermore, cognitive flexibility has been shown to increase as a result of mindfulness practice using tasks such as the Stroop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the Hayling task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Each of these EF processes of updating, inhibition and shifting support higher-order cognitive processes involved in problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], metacognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In fact, it has been suggested that the operation of working memory by EFs is the key mechanism through which higher-order cognition is engaged. The default interventionist dual-process theory of higher-order cognition posits two distinct types of cognitive processing. Type-1 processing generates intuitive, automatic responses by default. Type-2 processing allows further reflective processing but requires the engagement of EF which may or may not intervene depending on the individual and context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, critical thinking depends on Type-2 cognitive processes which depend on EF. An emerging body of theoretical and empirical work has linked mindfulness with enhanced executive functioning and certain types of higher-order cognition related to critical thinking, including insight problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], moral reasoning and ethical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, each of these studies suggested (but did not examine) that mindfulness facilitated the interruption of automatic responses and allowed more reflective processing, consistent with default interventionist theory.</p><p>It has been claimed that mindfulness should facilitate critical thinking in higher-education, based on early Buddhist conceptualisations of mindfulness as clarity of thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is clearly theoretical support and some empirical evidence for this claim but it is important to test the veracity of this claim in the most rigorous way available. The most rigorous way to test the effects of mindfulness is using randomised-controlled intervention studies which compare mindfulness training to a control condition. This design has been used to test the effects of Mindfulness-based Stress reduction, Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy and focused mindfulness meditation training programmes on health, wellbeing and cognitive outcomes (see reviews &#x02013; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). However, for the most part, the control groups employed have involved waitlist controls rather than an active-control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Still, this is an improvement from initial studies which were often non-randomised or lacked any control groups or even manipulation checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. An active-control group is desirable in order to rule out the potential effects of relaxation, received attention and demand characteristics. Strategies for designing an active-control condition have included using audiobooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], using progressive muscle relaxation training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and using sham meditation training. Sham meditations are the most sophisticated approach but also the least used due to their relatively recent development. They involve breathing exercises which are introduced to participants under the label of mindfulness practice. It is important that these exercises are guided by the same facilitator and for the same amount of time as the guided mindfulness practice which the experimental group engage in. Therefore, the one key difference between the two groups is the nature of the instructions given. Where the active-control group are instructed to &#x0201c;continue breathing as we sit in meditation&#x0201d; every few minutes, the experimental group are given clear instructions on how to pay attention to their breathing in order to cultivate a mindful state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Advances in technology are allowing the design of mindfulness interventions with more experimental control than previously possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The development of smartphone and web applications focused on the delivery of guided meditations in particular has made it easier to include active control conditions, objectively measure time spent meditating and reduce the resources needed for running an intervention as well as the demands placed on the participants. Previous studies involving smartphone delivery of mindfulness interventions focused on workplace stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and compassion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Each of these studies showed comparable results to previous traditional interventions focused on the same outcome variables and can be considered more rigorous due to the standardisation of instruction across participants in the experimental group, the inclusion of active-control materials which participants expected to benefit from in the same way as those in the experimental condition, and objective measures of adherence to the intervention (provided through the app) rather than self-report.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The current study</title><p>This protocol paper describes the development of an intervention which makes use of the Headspace mindfulness meditation app for smartphones, tablets and web browsers to evaluate its effects on executive control, critical thinking and key thinking dispositions as well as the real-world outcomes of critical thinking. This intervention was developed in order to test, in the most rigorous way available, hypotheses developed as a result of careful review of the literature on the effects of mindfulness on self-regulation and cognitive abilities and studies carried out previously by the authors suggesting that mindfulness may facilitate more effective critical thinking. The rationale for this intervention relies heavily on a specific type of dual-process theory known as the default-interventionist theory of higher-order cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which can be used as a framework to integrate research on the effects of mindfulness on attention, executive function and self-regulation of behaviour in general and research on the self-regulation of higher-order cognition, such as critical thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the central research question here is: does regular mindfulness meditation practice facilitate critical thinking through the enhancement of executive function? To answer this, the proposed study aims to ascertain whether a 6-week online mindfulness meditation intervention increases trait mindfulness, executive function, critical thinking performance and endorsement of key critical thinking dispositions to a greater extent than an active-control sham meditation condition. The hypotheses to be tested can be seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. This aim will be achieved by testing these hypotheses using the measures and analyses described in the next section. It is also intended to investigate the role of executive function in mediating the predicted positive relationship between mindfulness and critical thinking performance. Finally, the study aims to explore the participants&#x02019; experiences of taking part in an online mindfulness meditation intervention and the real-world outcomes they perceived.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study hypotheses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Outcomes</th><th>Variable</th><th>Measure</th><th/><th>Hypothesis</th><th>Analysis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary</td><td>Mindfulness</td><td>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire</td><td>1</td><td>Mindfulness will increase more for the mindfulness meditation (MM) group than for the sham meditation (SM) group from t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>4</sub>

However, blinding can be readily undone on a participant-by-participant basis if necessary.</p><p>Potential participants will be invited to take part by email and through advertisements on social media. Announcements regarding the study will also be made by the researchers in lectures attended by 1st year and 2nd year undergraduate psychology students.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>Intervention materials will be delivered via Headspace, a commercially available application which runs on all major smartphones, tablets and web browsers. The Headspace meditation scripts are designed by an individual with Buddhist monastic training who guides users through mindfulness meditations and key concepts related to mindfulness meditation using both audio and visual materials. In order to participate, individuals are required to have access to a smartphone or desktop computer with Internet access. Headspace makes meditating accessible by combining technology and simple techniques that are designed for new meditators. Participants can practice at any time of day wherever they prefer. Headspace offers straightforward, guided, bite-sized mindfulness training that is non-religious. We have signed guarantees with Headspace that participant data collected through Headspace will never be sold, distributed, or publicised (except anonymously in scientific publications with Headspace having no involvement in the conduct, analysis, or reporting of the research in any way).</p><p>Participants will be sent an email introducing Headspace and describing the sign-up process. To get started, participants are required to register on headspace.com using their name and email address. Each participant will be given a unique code providing free access to Headspace for the duration of the study. After registering, participants may begin meditating straight away.</p><p>The proposed intervention is 6-weeks in length. All participants will be encouraged to practice meditation/sham-meditation daily for the course of the 6-weeks by listening to each of the 30 ten-minute guided sessions which they will access through the Headspace app. The nature of the sessions they can access depends on the group they are assigned to.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental condition</title><p>Participants in the experimental condition will gain access to 30 sessions of guided mindfulness practice. These sessions introduce the concept and practice of mindfulness training and each session gradually builds on the previous one. The sessions are guided by Andy Puddicombe, a trained Buddhist monk who is also a registered meditation consultant with the UK Health Commission. Each session begins with the participant begin instructed to sit, close their eyes and take deep breaths. Following this, participants are guided through mental body scan exercises intended to cultivate a mindful state which involve practicing focusing attention on present-moment sensations in the body without emotionally elaborating on these sensations. Gradually participants learn to re-direct their attention when the mind wanders and to broaden their present-moment awareness to all current internal and external stimuli. Towards the end of the course of sessions, participants are encouraged to apply this type of awareness to everyday activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Active-control condition</title><p>Participants in the active-control condition will gain access to 30 sessions of guided sham meditation practice. These sessions discuss meditation and introduce breathing exercises under the guise of mindfulness practice. However, specific instructions for how to pay attention to the breath or other stimuli are not given. Instead, participants are encouraged to sit quietly, with their eyes closed and every few minutes they are reminded to take deep breaths as they sit in meditation. These sessions are also guided by Andy Puddicombe and accessed in exactly the same way as content in the experimental condition. This approach was taken as it controls for both physiological relaxation and expectations regarding meditation. Other approaches used in previous studies have only controlled for one of these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For example, progressive muscle relaxation only controls for physiological relaxation, while mind wandering inductions only control for expectations regarding meditation. These approaches did improve on previous attention-only and audiobook controls and all of these are a significantly better approach than waitlist controls when possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Adherence</title><p>Objective adherence data will be collected through the Headspace accounts of the participants.

One email and one text message per week will be sent to participants to encourage them to adhere to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data collection</title><p>Primary and secondary measures will be taken at baseline and following the end of the intervention (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In terms of primary outcome measures, we will assess critical thinking using the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and items from the Heuristics and Biases literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], mindfulness with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]), thinking dispositions with the Need for Cognition scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and the Actively Open Minded thinking scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and executive function with the Sternberg working memory task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] presented on Inquisit software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Objective measures of meditation adherence (no. of sessions initiated and completed and no. of minutes spent meditating) will be gathered through the Headspace app. Secondary measures will assess effects on wellbeing in order to compare with previous studies employing Headspace. The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] will be used. All of the measures except the Sternberg Working Memory Task will be presented using SurveyGizmo. Data Collection will take place during the week preceding the start of the intervention in the PC Suites of the School of Psychology at NUI Galway. Three sessions will be scheduled in order to facilitate attendance at different times, each of which will be able to accommodate up to 30 participants comfortably. A break with food and refreshments will be given half way through the procedure. This data collection approach will be repeated during the week following the end of the intervention.</p><p>Manipulation checks will be carried out during weeks 2 and 4 of the intervention and will focus on mindfulness meditation quality and task expectations, enjoyment and difficulty. Mindfulness meditation quality will be assessed using the 6 item Practice Quality- Mindfulness questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] while task expectations, enjoyment and difficulty will be assessed using the Technology Acceptance Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and Intervention Acceptability items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

These situations involve medical research, social policy analysis and other types of problems encountered in everyday life. Five domains of critical thinking are assessed using the HCTA: Verbal reasoning, argument analysis, thinking as hypothesis testing, likelihood and uncertainty, and decision-making and problem-solving. The test includes 5 sets of questions (one open and one closed) for each of these domains. The scoring guide provides answers for forced-choice questions while open-ended questions are graded according to specific grading prompts (for more detail see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]). Greater scores are awarded to more accurate and comprehensive answers and total scores can range from 0 to 194 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The internal reliability of the HTCA tends to be adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

It will also test whether executive function mediates the relationship between mindfulness and critical thinking in line with default interventionist theory, previous cross-sectional studies which examined this relationship, and previous experimental studies which suggested this relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It will achieve this aim by randomising participants to either an experimental condition involving the learning of mindfulness meditation or an active-control condition involving guided sham meditations which will both be delivered through the same online application, Headspace. Dispositional mindfulness, executive function and critical thinking will be assessed at baseline and following the end of the intervention along with measures of intervention adherence, wellbeing, thinking dispositions and real-world outcomes of critical thinking. Manipulation checks assessing intervention acceptability and meditation quality will also be administered.</p><p>This study has many strengths. It is pre-registered with the ISRCTN registry which is openly accessible. The use of an active-control which is identical in expectations (which will be measured) and presentation (i.e. through the Headspace application and by Andy Puddicombe, a trained Buddhist monk) represents an advance from the usual attention or waitlist controls employed in previous mindfulness meditation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another advance is the use of objective measures of intervention adherence. Where most previous studies have relied on self-report measures of adherence (when included), the application used to deliver the intervention materials in this study will also track the amount of guided meditations participants engage in and for how long they engage with them. Finally, participants will be allocated to their respective groups without knowing which was the experimental condition and this information will also be kept from the primary researcher until after data analysis is complete in order to ensure a double-blind RCT design.</p><p>There are however some weaknesses associated with this study also. While every effort was made to ensure that the only difference between the guided mindfulness meditations and the guided sham meditations would be the provision of specific instructions to do with building specific mindfulness skills in the experimental condition, it could be that this manipulation makes these guided sessions more engaging and enjoyable than the guided sham meditations. This could lead to differences in attrition rates across the two conditions. Attrition rates in general could be larger than expected which may affect the statistical power of the analyses. Finally, participants will be drawn from the student population only and so any conclusions made based on this study may not be generalizable to the wider population. However, critical thinking is a skill which is of particular importance as an outcome of university education and therefore this study may have practical benefits.</p><p>Many companies, universities and other institutions are introducing mindfulness programmes with the promise of improving thinking skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].
