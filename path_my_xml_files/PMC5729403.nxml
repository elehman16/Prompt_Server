Contributing factors include lack of standard and comprehensive procedures for ALHIV transitioning from pediatric to adult care. This has contributed to poor retention at, and following transition, which is problematic especially in high ALHIV-burden, resource-limited settings like Nigeria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using a two-arm cluster randomized control design, the Adolescent Coordinated Transition (ACT) trial will measure the comparative effectiveness of a graduated transition and organized support group intervention against the usual practice of abrupt transfer of Nigerian ALHIV from pediatric to adult care. This study will be conducted at 12 secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities (six intervention, six control) across all six of Nigeria&#x02019;s geopolitical zones. The study population is 13- to 17-year-old ALHIV (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;216, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;108 per study arm) on antiretroviral therapy. Study participants will be followed through a 12-month pre-transfer/transition period and for an additional 24&#x000a0;months post transfer/transition. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of ALHIV retained in care at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months post transfer. Secondary outcome measures are proportions of ALHIV achieving viral suppression and demonstrating increased psychosocial wellbeing and self-efficacy measured by psychometric tests including health locus of control, functional social support, perceived mental health, and sexual risk and behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We hypothesize that the ACT intervention will significantly increase psychosocial wellbeing, retention in care and ultimately viral suppression among ALHIV. ACT&#x02019;s findings have the potential to facilitate the development of standard guidelines for transitioning ALHIV and improving health outcomes in this population. The engagement of a consortium of local implementing partners under the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance allows for nationwide study implementation and expedient results dissemination to program managers and policy-makers. Ultimately, ACT may also provide evidence to inform transitioning guidelines not only for ALHIV but for adolescents living with other chronic diseases in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03152006">NCT03152006</ext-link>.

Nearly 92% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is the leading cause of mortality among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of the estimated 1.75 million ALHIV in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 240,000 are living in Nigeria, which represents the second highest burden of adolescent HIV globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2013, an estimated 11,000 deaths occurred among Nigerian ALHIV, representing 9.2% of AIDS-related deaths among all African adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Loss to follow-up (LTFU) and poor retention in care are associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity among ALHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that LTFU rates are higher and retention lower among ALHIV, compared to adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A recent nationwide study reported a LTFU rate among Nigerian ALHIV at 16.1% after a mean follow-up of 28&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition to LTFU, poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in virologic treatment failure and contributes to increased mortality among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The healthcare transition period is particularly high risk for LTFU and other poor health outcomes among ALHIV. Healthcare transition is defined as &#x0201c;the purposeful, planned movement of adolescents and young adults with chronic physical and medical conditions from child-centered to adult-oriented healthcare systems&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Barriers to successful transition have been categorized as: (1) patient/family related (e.g., knowledge deficits in self-management skills); (2) provider-related (e.g., lack of time for transitioning, confusion about roles, and pediatricians&#x02019; belief that adult providers would provide inadequate care); and (3) system-related (e.g., lack of formal transitioning program, lack of trained adult providers to competently care for transferred adolescents, and challenges in establishing an interdisciplinary team) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">A recent nationwide survey conducted by our study group determined that Nigerian ALHIV are routinely transferred from pediatric to adult care at age 15 or 18&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Factors limiting successful transition and post-transition retention include: lack of preparation, poor logistics, poor communication between pediatric and adult providers, loss of the &#x0201c;pediatric family&#x0201d; relationships of ALHIV, transition readiness and system-related issues such as access to care, and continuity of care post transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The most commonly identified components of successful transition include: provision of psychological support to help adolescents deal with anxieties and anger, provision of information, e.g., on risky sexual behavior and access to/navigation of medical services, and providing education on disease state and the importance of adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nigerian ALHIV are also reported to seek social support as a coping strategy for stress related to visiting the hospital and taking drugs regularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additional factors that promote successful healthcare transition for ALHIV include: open communication between pediatric and adult staff, peer educator support, access to tailored HIV information, and capacity-building for ALHIV to meet their own psychosocial needs especially in self-efficacy and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">While national policy documents in Nigeria recognize HIV among adolescents as an important issue, none of them address healthcare transition and no guidelines exist for transition of Nigerian adolescents living with HIV or, for that matter, any chronic health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a feasible, acceptable, and sustainable model of healthcare transitioning for adolescents in Nigeria. Nigeria&#x02019;s healthcare system remains weak, and HIV care is predominantly foreign donor-supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Any new intervention or program should require relatively little additional external funding. Thus, the intervention we propose, Adolescent Coordinated Transition (ACT), is designed to integrate well with, and exert leverage on, the existing healthcare system whilst incorporating effective strategies for healthcare transition.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p id="Par32">The ACT intervention relies on the social cognitive theory (SCT) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although we considered other frameworks such as the Health Belief Model and the Ecological Model, the constructs of the SCT are particularly relevant to HIV/AIDS treatment and risk reduction among adolescents. Many identified challenges lie with the adolescent or within their environment. SCT recognizes that health behavior is influenced by factors within the person (knowledge of the importance of HIV treatment, how to access treatment during transition, and self-efficacy for service utilization in adult clinics) as well as facilitators or barriers within a person&#x02019;s social and structural environment (the HIV clinic, peers, or support groups).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the social cognitive theory</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2347_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The ACT intervention encompasses a graduated transition period coordinated with an organized support group, which aims to increase retention rates among ALHIV after transfer to adult care. The coordination denotes a complementary pediatric-adult team approach to support the clinical and psychosocial health of the transitioning ALHIV. The graduated transition provides an extended period of time for the transitioning ALHIV to become familiar with adult care while separating from pediatric care. A transition period, rather than abrupt transfer, minimizes the grief associated with the loss of the pediatric &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; and maximizes opportunities for the ALHIV and adult care providers to establish trusting relationships. The ACT intervention is to be compared to the usual care which is abrupt transfer of ALHIV to adult care with neither a transition period nor an organized support group.</p><p id="Par34">ACT&#x02019;s secondary objectives are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par35">To measure the comparative effectiveness of the ACT intervention versus usual care on post-transfer viral suppression rates among ALHIV at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months post transfer</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">To measure the comparative effectiveness of the ACT intervention versus usual care on psychosocial wellbeing as measured by psychometric tests at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months post transfer</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Formative consultations</title><p id="Par40">Key information that shaped the design of this study came from multiple formative consultations across the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA), a collaboration of the 20 largest HIV implementing partners in Nigeria supported by the President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. NISA-wide consultations held with experienced Nigerian healthcare providers highlighted lack of a transition process for adolescents with common chronic illnesses in Nigeria. There are no guidelines or standard practices for healthcare transitioning for sickle cell anemia, diabetes, asthma, or HIV in Nigeria. As such, the standard of care either is absent or varies widely between providers, healthcare facilities and different parts of the country.</p><p id="Par41">During recent assessments for the establishment of PEPFAR-supported adolescent HIV clinics across NISA&#x02019;s network, we consulted with Nigerian ALHIV. We found ALHIV eager to be involved in their own healthcare including transitioning; however, they uniformly expressed feeling more comfortable in pediatric care because of time and attention rendered to them. Lessons learned from these consultations (e.g., the need for adult care providers to establish trust with ALHIV, a transition period and not abrupt transfer, and adolescent-friendly psychosocial support) provided critical contextual data to inform our intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par42">The study is a two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of a graduated, coordinated healthcare transition plus organized support group intervention with the usual care of abrupt transfer among ALHIV. ACT adopts the Type 1 Hybrid Design described by Curran and colleagues, which tests the effect of an intervention on relevant outcomes while observing and gathering information on the implementation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Type 1 Hybrid Design integrates impact and process evaluation with the dual goal of testing intervention effectiveness while identifying factors influencing implementation in context.

The ACT trial is to be implemented by five PEPFAR implementing partners who are NISA members: APIN Public Health Initiatives Limited (APIN), the Center for Clinical Care and Clinical Research Nigeria (CCCRN), Centre for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP), FHI 360 Nigeria, and the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN).

Twelve healthcare facilities were selected and randomized 1:1 to the intervention and control arms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These 12 study sites were pair-matched by geographic location and level of care and then randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or to the control group (CG).

The randomization of facilities was carried out using scripting language in R (v. 3.3.2) by the project statistician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We first created a random number between 1000 and 10,000 and used the result to seed the group assignment so that the results would be reproducible.

Six geopolitical zones are included in the design, with two sites (one replicate per arm) located in each zone. The factors considered for the sample size estimate are: at least 80% power, assuming 20% effect size, a confidence level of 95%, a correlation among repeated measures of 0.3, and an intra-class correlation within clusters of 0.05. Further, we assume equal numbers of clusters between CG and IG, and clusters within those conditions to be of equal size. Based on these assumptions, a baseline number of 15 participants per site was needed. This was, however, adjusted for several assumed losses. Based on knowledge of healthcare in this area and among target participants, the following participant loss estimates were made: healthcare transfers out of study sites at 5%, participant moving out of study area at 5%, deaths during the study at 7%, and study withdrawal/dropout at 5%. This results in a total of 22% dropouts, requiring an additional three participants (15&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.22) for a total of 18 participants per site. Additionally, we anticipate a 30% rate for declining to participate. Hence, we will need to approach an additional five ALHIV (18&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.3) for a total of 23 ALHIV currently enrolled as taking ART at study initiation to ensure that the requirement of 18 participants per site is met.

An initial test of proportions will be conducted at each time period to compare these percentages using a one-way test, and exact <italic>p</italic> values will be calculated using a permutation distribution. Additionally, a Poisson regression model with a time offset will be explored, which will allow for the development of a model to compare rates between the control and intervention arms while accounting for events (i.e., retention) per unit time, which allows time to vary for each subject as well as allowing the inclusion of potential covariates (for example, age, and time since HIV diagnosis).</p><p id="Par75">Similarly, for secondary objective 1, the study will assess the differential impact that the intervention has on viral suppression. For this measure, ACT will test the difference in the percentage of study participants achieving viral suppression, under the hypothesis that the IG percentages will exceed CG percentages at each time period.

Additionally, ACT aims to understanding the potential of psychologically based intervening variables to influence important study outcomes (i.e., increased retention rates and suppressed viral load). To examine important temporal changes in psychological factors, mean changes will be calculated for HLC, FSSQ, MHC-SF, and SRBBS scores from the transfer baseline to 12 and 24&#x000a0;months post transfer. Additionally, between-group comparisons will be made using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Owing to multiple tests among the same subjects, an approximate type 1 error of .05 will be maintained either directly through the use of a technique designed to accommodate repeated-measures designs (e.g., RM-ANOVA), or through the use of post-hoc adjustment of <italic>p</italic> values (e.g., Bonferroni&#x02019;s method).</p><p id="Par77">Simultaneously, ACT will examine direct and indirect contribution of psychosocial factors on viral-load suppression and retention of study participants in both study arms through multiple mediation model analyses as recommended by Preacher and Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

The study team&#x02019;s Nigeria and U.S.-based researchers have extensive HIV research and program experience, a well-established local presence, and a track record of successfully conducting implementation research in Nigeria. The design is a cluster-randomized trial built on existing programs, which allows for determination of the real-life effectiveness of the intervention using triangulation of multiple concurrent data collection methods. Additionally, the ACT trial&#x02019;s intervention encompasses the core elements of healthcare transitioning, including a standard transition procedure, transition readiness assessment, tracking, monitoring, and planning, and transfer of care.

First, HIV care at the 12 study sites is supported by five different NGOs, which might create some difficulties for coordination and quality control of study activities. To mitigate this potential problem, one NGO, IHVN, is charged with centrally coordinating and maintaining quality control for key study activities and data. Related to this, to ensure an acceptable level of quality of care for ALHIV, we also restricted eligibility to facilities with experience in and adequate staffing for HIV care delivery. However, this might reduce the generalizability of our findings for facilities with limited staffing. Lastly, our study population comprises adolescents who are likely mostly perinatally infected, which may limit the applicability of study findings among adolescents who acquired HIV through other routes of transmission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Potential implications for practice and research</title><p id="Par94">Findings from the ACT trial will potentially contribute evidence towards addressing the high AIDS-related mortality rates observed among adolescents, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
