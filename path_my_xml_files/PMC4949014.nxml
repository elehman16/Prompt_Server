Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; has a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, and specific inhibition of this pleotropic cytokine with biological anti-TNF agents has been a major advancement in the treatment of these diseases including Crohn's disease.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Anti-TNF therapy is generally well tolerated.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, because these agents have immunosuppressive properties, long-term use may increase the risk of serious infections,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and careful consideration is given to the initiation of therapy. Only 3 anti-TNF therapies, including infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol, are currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in the United States.</p><p>In randomized controlled trials, approximately 40% to 60% of patients with Crohn's disease had an initial response to induction therapy with anti-TNF therapy during the first 2 to 6 weeks, and of those approximately 40% to 60% were in remission after 6 months of therapy.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, the duration of clinical response varies widely among patients. Results of PRECiSE 2, a randomized, placebo-controlled study of certolizumab pegol maintenance therapy in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, showed that approximately 40% of initial responders lost response within 6 months after treatment initiation.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In clinical practice, 30% to 40% of patients treated with adalimumab required dose escalation; however, approximately one-third of those who received increased doses failed to maintain responses longer than 6 months.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These examples illustrate that both primary and secondary failure to anti-TNF therapy remain significant challenges in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease. Given the need for long-term maintenance therapy and the small number of available anti-TNF therapies, identifying strategies to maximize the benefit that a patient can derive from each agent is important. Recent studies have shown that reinduction therapy with another<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or the same<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> anti-TNF agent in patients with secondary treatment failure provides clinically important short-term benefits. However, the longer-term benefit of reintroducing the same therapy to patients with primary and secondary treatment failure, including patients who previously received as little as 1 dose of induction treatment, has not been explored.</p><p>Certolizumab pegol is a recombinant, humanized, polyethylene glycol&#x02013;conjugated antigen-binding antibody fragment (Fab') with specificity for human TNF&#x003b1;. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies, PRECiSE 1<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and PRECiSE 2,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> demonstrated that certolizumab pegol is effective in the induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Unlike patients in PRECiSE 2, who were randomized to maintenance treatment with placebo or certolizumab pegol after responding to 6 weeks of induction therapy with certolizumab pegol, patients in PRECiSE 1 were randomized to consecutive induction and maintenance treatment with either placebo or certolizumab pegol at the start of the trial. Patients who completed PRECiSE 1 or PRECiSE 2 were eligible for inclusion in PRECiSE 3, an open-label, 7-year extension study.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In contrast, PRECiSE 4 (NCT00160706) was an open-label extension study for patients who withdrew from either treatment arm of PRECiSE 1 or PRECiSE 2 owing to exacerbation of Crohn's disease and was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of chronic certolizumab pegol therapy for up to 7 years. Here, we report efficacy and safety outcomes from the PRECiSE 4 study, which included patients with no previous exposure to certolizumab pegol, as well as patients with primary or secondary certolizumab pegol treatment failure.</p><sec id="s1"><title>MATERALS AND METHODS</title><p>The PRECiSE studies were conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee at each center. All patients signed an informed consent form.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>PRECiSE 4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT00160706) enrolled patients from 141 centers in 24 countries, with initial enrollment in February 2004 and completion in May 2012. Patients with active Crohn's disease who withdrew from PRECiSE 1 or 2 owing to the exacerbation of Crohn's disease (determined by the investigator and defined as an increase of &#x02265;70 points in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index score above baseline or an absolute score &#x02265;350 points) were eligible to enroll in PRECiSE 4.</p><p>The enrollment criteria and study design for PRECiSE 1 and 2 have been described.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In brief, both studies enrolled patients &#x02265;18 years of age with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of 220&#x02013;450 points). Patients in PRECiSE 1 were randomized to receive placebo or certolizumab pegol 400 mg for induction at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and subsequent maintenance treatment until week 26. In PRECiSE 2, all enrolled patients received certolizumab pegol 400 mg induction treatment at weeks 0, 2, and 4, and patients with response at week 6 were randomized to receive placebo or certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks until week 26. Patients were eligible for entry into PRECiSE 4 at any time after completing the week 2 assessment of PRECiSE 1 or week 6 randomization in PRECiSE 2, if exacerbation of Crohn's disease occurred.</p><p>Patients enrolled in PRECiSE 4 were stratified in 3 separate analysis groups according to their treatment in the qualifying studies: patients who received placebo in PRECiSE 1 study were classified as First Exposure group, patients who received placebo after induction therapy with certolizumab pegol in PRECiSE 2 were classified as Reinduction/First Maintenance group, and patients who received both induction and maintenance therapy with certolizumab pegol 400 mg in PRECiSE 1 or PRECiSE 2 were classified as Reinduction/Remaintenance group.</p><p>Baseline was defined as the week 0 assessment in each of the qualifying studies (PRECiSE 1 and 2). For PRECiSE 4, patients were treated with a 3-dose induction regimen of certolizumab pegol 400 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by maintenance therapy of 400 mg every 4 weeks until week 360 (up to 92 doses).</p><p>Patients who required rescue therapy for exacerbation of their disease were considered to have treatment failure and were withdrawn from the study. These patients were considered to be nonresponders/nonremitters from the time of discontinuation. In addition, patients who received rescue therapy but were not withdrawn from the study (in deviation from the study protocol) were classified as nonresponders/nonremitters from the time of receiving rescue therapy. Rescue therapies included anti-TNF therapy other than certolizumab pegol, natalizumab, corticosteroids at a dose &#x0003e;15 mg of prednisolone or equivalent above the dose at study entry, introduction of immunomodulator therapy or any increase in immunomodulator dosage above that at study entry, and surgery or in-patient hospitalization for exacerbation of Crohn's disease.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Assessments</title><p>Efficacy was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) in the intent-to-treat population, which included all patients who received at least 1 injection of certolizumab pegol and provided at least 1 postbaseline efficacy measurement. HBI scores were recorded at weeks 2 and 4, every 4 weeks until week 104, every 8 weeks until week 256, every 12 weeks until week 352, at week 362/withdrawal visit, and at week 372 (safety follow-up or 12 wk after the last dose). Efficacy evaluation was based on the proportion of patients who achieved remission (HBI total score &#x02264;4) at various time points. Confirmed loss of remission was defined as HBI &#x0003e;4 at 2 consecutive visits.</p><p>Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least 1 injection of certolizumab pegol based on adverse event (AE) reports, laboratory analyses, physical examination, and tuberculosis (TB) evaluation. AE data were obtained by observation and direct questioning at each visit. All AEs were classified by System Organ Class and Preferred Term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 6.1). Any infection that required treatment with parenteral antibiotics was considered a serious infection.</p><p>Concentrations of certolizumab pegol and anti&#x02013;certolizumab pegol antibodies (ADAbs) were measured during PRECiSE 1 and 2 at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 26, and during PRECiSE 4 at weeks 2 and 4, every 4 weeks until week 104, and at weeks 128, 156, 180, 208, 232, 256, 316, 362/withdrawal visit, and the safety follow-up visit (week 372 or 12 weeks after the last dose). The concentration of certolizumab pegol or certolizumab pegol ADAbs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Patients were considered certolizumab pegol ADAb-positive if the certolizumab pegol ADAb concentration was &#x0003e;2.4 U/mL at any point during the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed, as this was an open-label extension study with safety as the primary objective. Remission rates were analyzed based on observed cases (with patients who discontinued excluded from the analysis) and separately by nonremitter imputation (NRI; with patients who discontinued or received rescue therapy considered in the analysis as nonremitters). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis was performed to estimate times to confirmed loss of remission for each certolizumab pegol exposure group, with differences between groups assessed by log-rank test. Incidence rates (IRs; cases per 100 patient-years) with 95% CIs were calculated for serious AEs. Multiple reasons for discontinuation were considered for the calculation of discontinuation rates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Disposition</title><p>A total of 322 patients who withdrew from PRECiSE 1 and 2 were eligible for inclusion in PRECiSE 4 and 310 patients were enrolled in the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All 310 patients were included in the safety population and 309 patients were included in the intent-to-treat population. The median number of certolizumab pegol doses in the First Exposure (n = 115), Reinduction/First Maintenance (n = 75), and Reinduction/Remaintenance (n = 120) groups was 14, 21, and 7, respectively. Patients in the First Exposure group stayed in PRECiSE 1 for a mean period of 61 days before withdrawing and entering PRECiSE 4. Patients in the Reinduction/First Maintenance group stayed in PRECiSE 2 for a mean period of 111 days and subsequently were certolizumab pegol&#x02013;free for a mean period of 82.3 days, with most (53.3%) starting to receive certolizumab pegol 400 mg in PRECiSE 4 after a drug-free interval of 12 weeks. Patients in the Reinduction/Remaintenance group stayed in the qualifying studies for a mean period of 81 days and were certolizumab pegol&#x02013;free for a mean period of 21.7 days (slightly less than the expected interval of 28 d between scheduled maintenance doses of 400 mg certolizumab pegol) before starting reinduction therapy in PRECiSE 4; all patients in this group received certolizumab pegol 400 mg within &#x0003c;8 weeks of withdrawing from the qualifying studies. Overall, 286 patients discontinued therapy over the 7-year study period for 1 or more reasons, with the most common being AEs (n = 158), lack of improvement/disease deterioration (n = 124), and subject decision (n = 68) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Thirty-seven percent of the PRECiSE 4 study population had no previous exposure to certolizumab pegol, whereas 63% experienced primary or secondary failure of previous certolizumab pegol induction or maintenance therapy. The results presented here show that 29% of all patients who entered the study were in clinical remission after 1 year of therapy, although slightly more than half of all enrolled patients withdrew from the study during the first year. The mean time to confirmed loss of remission was significantly shorter for patients who received reinduction therapy after primary or secondary failure to certolizumab pegol (Reinduction/Remaintenance group) than for patients in the First Exposure Group. However, at any given time point during the 7-year treatment period, at least 60% of all patients who remained on therapy were in remission. Overall, these findings suggest that the reintroduction of certolizumab pegol therapy after primary or secondary treatment failure with certolizumab pegol can be an effective strategy for achieving long-term remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.</p><p>The results of PRECiSE 4 confirm the sustained efficacy of de novo certolizumab pegol therapy in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease previously observed in PRECiSE 3,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> as 1-year remission rates for patients with no previous exposure to certolizumab pegol were remarkably similar in the 2 trials (35% in PRECiSE 3 and 33% in PRECiSE 4). Although longer-term remission rates in clinical trials of infliximab and adalimumab are only available for patients who responded to initial induction therapy, the data overall suggest that certolizumab pegol has comparable efficacy in patients with no primary or secondary treatment failure.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>PRECiSE 4 and PRECiSE 3<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> were both 7-year open-label extension studies of the PRECiSE 1 and 2 trials. However, because of the differences in eligibility criteria, 55.0% of patients in PRECiSE 3, compared with only 2.3% of patients in PRECiSE 4, were in remission at study entry. The stark difference in patients' disease activity at study entry in the 2 trials may explain at least in part the differences in discontinuation rates (53% in PRECiSE 4 versus 29% in PRECiSE 3 during the first year) and overall remission rates by NRI analysis. Furthermore, the discontinuation rate in PRECiSE 4 may have been affected by &#x0201c;trial fatigue&#x0201d; among patients asked to attend a total of 92 study visits over 7 years, combined with the fact that certolizumab pegol became commercially available approximately 4 years after initiation of the trial.</p><p>Our findings suggest that lower remission rates and shorter times to loss of remission are to be expected for the reintroduction of anti-TNF therapy in patients who previously experienced treatment failure with the same agent. This is consistent with findings by others showing that previous discontinuation of adalimumab or infliximab therapy due to loss of response is associated with an increased risk of nonresponse to reinduction therapy with these agents (odds ratio, 6; 95% CI, 1.1&#x02013;34; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In this context, it is noteworthy that concomitant corticosteroid or immunomodulatory use in PRECiSE 4 was associated with substantially increased remission rates among patients with previous treatment failure. In this patient group, remission rates of &#x0003e;50% by NRI analysis were achieved at week 52, if patients had received 6 months of uninterrupted concomitant corticosteroid or immunomodulatory therapy. The effect of these concomitant therapies on remission rates over time (assessed by the NRI analysis) may primarily reflect the ability of patients who receive them to remain longer on certolizumab pegol therapy than other patients.</p><p>Published reports from large clinical studies that investigated the benefit of anti-TNF reinduction therapy after a drug-free interval in patients with secondary treatment failure are scarce.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> As previously reported, more than 60% of all patients with secondary failure in PRECiSE 2 who entered PRECiSE 4 achieved a clinical response with certolizumab pegol induction therapy at week 4, and 35% of all patients were in remission at week 52 based on NRI analysis.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In clinical practice, secondary failure of infliximab and adalimumab therapy is often addressed with dose escalation. However, although response rates greater than 60% can be achieved with infliximab and adalimumab dose escalation, historical data suggest that the restored responses are lost in one-third of patients treated with adalimumab within 6 months<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and in half of patients within 1 year of dose escalation.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Slightly less than one-fifth of the PRECiSE 4 study population developed certolizumab pegol ADAbs with a persistent effect on certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations. Overall, ADAb-positive status was associated with an approximately 3- to 5-fold decrease in mean certolizumab pegol concentrations throughout the study. It is currently unclear to which extent certolizumab pegol ADAb development affected achievement and maintenance of remission in PRECiSE 4; however, certolizumab pegol ADAb status had no clinically significant effects on overall safety outcomes. Interestingly, the proportion of patients on therapy who were positive for certolizumab pegol ADAbs was greatest in the Reinduction/First Maintenance group, which also had the longest mean certolizumab pegol&#x02013;free interval compared with the other certolizumab pegol exposure groups. This suggests that the more extended treatment interruptions in this group increased the risk of certolizumab pegol ADAb development.</p><p>Certolizumab pegol was generally well tolerated in the PRECiSE 4 study, and no new safety signals were detected with treatment for up to 7 years. The safety profile of certolizumab pegol in PRECiSE 4 is consistent with findings from PRECiSE 3<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and with results from long-term studies of other anti-TNF therapies used to treat Crohn's disease.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The most frequently reported AEs in PRECiSE 4 were related to Crohn's disease or infections and were primarily mild or moderate in intensity. The incidence of serious infection (6.11 cases/100 patient-years) was similar to that observed with certolizumab pegol in PRECiSE 3 (4.37 cases/100 patient-years)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and adalimumab in ADHERE (6.1 events/100 patient-years).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Of note, cases of TB, which occurred in other long-term studies,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were not reported in PRECiSE 4, although PRECiSE 4 was conducted worldwide, including in countries in which TB has not been eradicated.</p><p>The incidence of malignancies in PRECiSE 4 was low (1.29 cases/100 patient-years) and similar to findings in PRECISE 3 (1.06 cases/100 patient-years)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and ADHERE (1.6 events/100 patient-years).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Inflammatory bowel disease, in general, and Crohn's disease, in particular, have been associated with small but significant increases in the incidence of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Results of a recent case&#x02013;control study further suggested that the increased risk of melanoma was primarily associated with the use of biologics, such as anti-TNF therapies (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.08&#x02013;3.29), whereas the increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was associated with the use of thiopurine-based immunomodulators (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.66&#x02013;2.05).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, a recent analysis of pooled data from studies of adalimumab provided evidence that adalimumab therapy in combination with immunomodulators, but not as monotherapy, may increase the risk of nonmelanoma cancer in patients with Crohn's disease.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In PRECiSE 4, only 1 case of melanoma and 4 cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer (3 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 1 case of squamous cell carcinoma) were reported during the 7-year study period. The IRs for basal cell carcinoma in PRECiSE 3 (0.21 cases/100 patient-years),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> PRECiSE 4 (0.48 cases/100 patient-years), and ADHERE (0.4 events/100 patient-years)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were similar and within the range of IRs reported for the general US population (approximately 0.1&#x02013;1.0 cases/100 person-years, depending on year of assessment and state).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Of note, all patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer received concomitant immunosuppressants.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings show that for many patients with exacerbation of Crohn's disease, including those who experienced primary or secondary failure to certolizumab pegol induction (or reinduction) and subsequent maintenance treatment with certolizumab pegol, resulted in long-term clinical remission. No new safety signals were detected with exposure to certolizumab pegol for up to 7 years, and IRs for serious infections and malignancies were consistent with reports from other long-term studies of anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's disease. Overall, the results suggest that many patients taking certolizumab pegol for moderate to severe Crohn's disease may still derive long-term benefit from reinduction and continuing maintenance therapy with certolizumab pegol after intermittent disease exacerbation and may not need a change to another therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the investigators and patients participating in this study.
