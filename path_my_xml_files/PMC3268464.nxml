It is expected that survival is improved by preoperative treatment with a triplet regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (divided DCS therapy). A multicenter Phase II study has been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two courses of preoperative chemotherapy followed by gastrectomy. Fifty-five patients are required for this study. The primary endpoint of the study is pathological response rate of primary lesions. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, disease-free survival, R0 resection rate and adverse events.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The standard approach for locally advanced gastric cancer is to achieve R0 resection. Although gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection, the so-called extended dissection in western countries, has been undergone, peritoneal metastases (relapse) has been found frequently in T4 gastric cancer. In order to decrease incidence of relapse after R0 resection, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. Recent study, Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC), demonstrated that S-1 is an effective adjuvant treatment for East Asian patients who have undergone D2 dissection for locally advance gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C1">1</xref>). According to the subgroup analysis of ACTS-GC, there is no prognostic difference between the patients with and without S-1 in Stage IIIb. More intensive regimen, such as S-1 plus cisplatin which has demonstrated a significant higher response rate and longer survival than S-1 alone in SPIRITS trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C2">2</xref>), is needed for Stage IIIb consisting mostly of T4 gastric cancer, while S-1 plus cisplatin should reveal low compliance and high adverse events after gastrectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C4">4</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the potential benefits of preoperative chemotherapy include increasing the likelihood of curative resection by down-staging of the tumor, eliminating micrometastases and improving compliance against chemotherapy by avoiding surgery-related gastrointestinal symptoms. Although MAGIC trial demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy achieved down-staging and revealed longer survival than surgery alone, 5 years survival rate of surgery alone in Japanese intergroup studies is &#x0223c;70% which is superior to the result of preoperative chemotherapy in MAGIC trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C5">5</xref>). It is reason why that Japanese standard surgery for locally advanced gastric cancer is gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection, while D1 dissection is standard in Western Europe.</p><p>S-1/CDDP regimen (where CDDP is cisplatin) has now become one of the Japanese standards for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer, because S-1 plus cisplatin has demonstrated significant higher response rate and longer survival than S-1 alone in the SPIRITS trial. In a preoperative setting, phase II study of S-1 plus cisplatin for the patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (JCOG0210) showed 48% of pathological response rate (pRR) in the primary lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C6">6</xref>). Some reports described that a pRR to preoperative chemotherapy may be a surrogate for longer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C7">7</xref>), but the efficacy of S-1 plus cisplatin is not sufficient in the view point of the pRR. Therefore, the combination chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (DCS therapy) has been anticipated as a more powerful regimen of preoperative setting for locally advanced gastric cancer.</p><p>We have already described the feasibility and efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy using DCS therapy in gastric cancer patients with para-aortic lymph node metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C8">8</xref>). Fifteen patients received intravenous docetaxel and cisplatin (30, 35 or 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, each dose escalation was reciprocal) on Day 1, and 15 and S-1 (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily) on Day 1&#x02013;14 every 4 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and diarrhea. Recommended dose of this combination was presumed to be 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of docetaxel and 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cisplatin. pRRs were 85% in primary lesions and 92% in lymph node metastases after two cycles of chemotherapy. These results were considered expectable for locally advanced gastric cancer.</p><p>In the present study, we hypothesize that preoperative chemotherapy combining DCS in T4 locally advanced gastric cancer would induce a 70% of pRR. The aim of this Phase II study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this regimen and to select a candidate for an experimental arm in the next Phase III trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>PROTOCOL DESIGN OF THE STUDY</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purpose</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy with DCS for the treatment of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Setting</title><p>The study is a multi-institutional prospective Phase II trial, in which participating institutions included 25 specialized centers as of 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Endpoint</title><p>The primary endpoint is pRR of the primary lesion.

This regimen performed two cycles every 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Surgery</title><p>After two cycle of DCS therapy, conventional examinations (such as a CT scan of the whole abdomen and chest, and endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract), were carried out to assess the resectability of the tumors. Surgery was performed between 4 and 8 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. The type of operation depended on the location and extent of the primary lesion, but the resection lines had to be at least 5 cm from the edge of the macroscopic tumor. En bloc resection of adjacent organs was performed when their involvement was suspected. D2 lymphadenectomy was routinely performed as described earlier and if necessary, para-aortic lymphadenectomy was also permitted.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Pathological Examination of Surgical Specimens</title><p>All resected specimens were examined by pathologists and the pathological response to chemotherapy was evaluated according to the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HYR183C9">9</xref>). Lesions were graded according to the amount of viable tumor cells of the tumor as follows: Grade 0, no evidence of effect; Grade 1a, viable tumor cells occupy more than two-thirds of the tumorous area; Grade 1b, viable tumor cells remain in more than one-third but less than two-thirds of the tumorous area; Grade 2, viable tumor cells remain in less than one-third of the tumorous area; Grade 3, no viable tumor cells remain. In this study, patients showing Grades 0 and 1a were regarded as pathological non-responders and those showing Grades 1b, 2 and 3 were regarded as pathological responders.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Follow-up</title><p>S-1 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day as adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed after R0 resection for 1 year, if possible. For patients with consequent R1&#x02013;2 resection or non-resection, subsequent therapy is not stipulated and is decided by each clinician.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL METHODS</title><p>This trial determined the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery for locally advanced gastric cancer. In JCOG0210 study, pRR of patients with preoperative chemotherapy consisting of S-1 and cisplatin followed by gastrectomy was 48%. Regarding the regimen in this study, triplet regimen is more powerful than doublet regimen in JCOG0210. Therefore, the primary hypothesis was that a 70% pRR would be achievable using this regimen but a pRR of &#x0003c;50% would not be desirable. In this Phase II trial, the planned sample size was 50 patients, which was calculated by Southwest Oncology Group's two-stage attained design based on a target pRR of 70% and a minimum pRR of 50%, with an a error of 0.05 and a,b error of 0.2. Assuming a dropout or ineligibility rate of &#x0223c;10%, the target number of enrolled patients was determined to be 55 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>UMIN REGISTRATION OF THE
