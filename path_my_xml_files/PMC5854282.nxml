In addition to the core symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, children with ADHD show functional impairments in different areas of daily life such as planning their homework, estimating the time needed to complete an assignment, staying focused on tasks at hand and building and maintaining meaningful social relationships with their peers [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These problems have been shown to adversely impact the daily life functioning of children with ADHD as well as their academic performance in the long-term [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recently, behavioral scientists and health care professionals have been exploring new ways to optimize the daily life functioning in children with ADHD by improving their engagement with treatment through the use of video games to support behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The integration of game elements into existing treatment procedures (also called gamification) has been shown to enhance motivation and treatment effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The field of serious gaming is relatively new and therefore efforts are more focused on evaluating impacts on outcomes instead of identifying moderating variables that are linked to those outcomes. However, in addition to gathering evidence about the effectiveness of the Serious Game (SG) intervention on group-level as in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) it is important to gather more information on an individual level and identify characteristics that predict favourable outcomes of the SG intervention [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This will enable healthcare professionals to optimize the match between individuals and their treatment and as such allocate children who are likely to benefit from these interventions to this intervention and offer alternative treatments for children for whom the intervention is less effective. This will support the development of personalized treatment allocation algorithms and promote behavior scientists and researchers to examine pre-defined individual characteristics that are predictive for favourable treatment outcomes. A mismatch between children&#x02019;s pre-treatment characteristics and their treatment can elevate the risk of non-response to treatment, which means that emotional and financial burdens for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, their relatives and the wider community remain [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Most of the available literature on potential moderators in the treatment of children with ADHD is from the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder study [MTA-study; <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the most recent and largest treatment study in young patients with ADHD. The MTA study compared treatment as usual to behavioral intervention, medication or a combination of behavioral intervention and medication treatment. Amongst other moderation analyses, this study demonstrated that a certain pattern of comorbidity was associated with differential treatment responses. Specifically, they found that children with ADHD diagnosed with a single comorbid anxiety disorder (but NOT a comorbid CD) showed better treatment outcomes when receiving a behavioral intervention. While children with a double comorbidity (i.e., comorbid anxiety AND CD) benefitted the most from treatment combining medication and behavioral therapy [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A more recent smaller scale study explored moderators of treatment response to a behavioral parent training combined with treatment as usual (TAU) as compared to stand-alone TAU [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results indicated that no or a single-type comorbidity [anxiety/depression or ODD / CD] is a significant moderator of treatment outcome demonstrating that behavioral parent training is more beneficial for these subgroups of children. Other possible moderating variables such as age, gender, ADHD severity, Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and medication use have been reported to be non-significant moderators of treatment outcomes in the MTA study [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Other potential moderators relevant for the current study are gender and experience with computer gaming. A study by Chou and Tsai [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated that boys spent more time playing computer games than girls and also enjoyed it more. Furthermore, previous research has shown that children with higher levels of game experience were more engaged with serious gaming [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, this motivation, experience and engagement may enhance effectiveness of the Serious Game (SG) intervention [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As an adjunct to TAU for children with ADHD, an engaging and accessible serious game (called &#x0201c;Plan-It Commander&#x0201d;) aimed at improving functional outcomes in different areas of daily life such as time management, planning/organizing and cooperation skills was developed [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The effectiveness of &#x0201c;Plan-It Commander&#x0201d; was evaluated in a multisite open-label RCT (N = 170) and results showed that children with ADHD who played the SG intervention improved significantly more on the parent-rated primary outcome measure of time management and secondary outcomes measures of responsibility and working memory compared to children with ADHD who received TAU [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Due to the lack of moderation studies of serious gaming in children with ADHD, we based our hypotheses regarding the strength of specific moderators or the direction of effects on other studies examining moderator effects of treatment outcomes in ADHD [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the current study, the role of 10 pre-intervention characteristics that were explored before in moderation studies [i.e., gender, age, IQ, medication use, computer experience, ADHD subtype, severity of inattention problems, severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity problems, comorbid ODD and CD symptoms] will be explored as possible moderators for the SG intervention on the primary outcomes [i.e. time management, planning/organization, cooperation] through a Virtual Twins (VT) analysis. This VT method explicitly aims at identifying subgroups that are likely to get a high benefit from the treatment as compared to the estimated treatment effect of the total group of participants [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. VT has been successfully applied in the field of psychotherapy and pharmacogenetic research, see Doove and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and Hou and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], respectively for some recent successful examples. In sum, the present study will use VT analysis to identify subgroups in which the effect of the SG intervention in improving several behavio<strike>u</strike>ral outcomes is considerably better than the effect of treatment as usual crossover group (TAUx).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>This study used data from a 20-week multisite open-label RCT consisting of a Serious Game intervention (SG), developed to improve behavioral problems in children with ADHD, and a TAUx [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Across four sites in the Netherlands and Belgium, 170 participants were recruited and selected as part of the previous mentioned RCT, for more details on the study see [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to missing values on these outcome measures, the number of available cases for analysis was 143. Participants&#x02019; mean age was 9.90 years (SD = 1.26) at intake and they were all diagnosed with ADHD. The sample was 82% male and had an average IQ (M = 106; SD = 14.49). At baseline children had to be stable on pharmacological and/or psychological ADHD treatment for 8 weeks prior to baseline (determined by health care professionals on the basis of medication data and behavioral observation). Comorbidities common to ADHD like ODD were allowed. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of CD, autism spectrum disorder or acute psychiatric problems (i.e., substance abuse problems, depression, mania) requiring immediate or other medical treatment were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from parents and 12-year-old children.

In this study, we compared outcomes between the SG intervention and TAUx conditions during the first ten weeks. Participants were instructed to play the serious game for one hour three times a week.

Therefore, a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a first factor pertaining to treatment methods and a second one to subgroups [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as well as regression analyses with suitable interaction terms being included in the regression model [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] could not address our research question. For such a situation in which no clear a priori hypotheses exist on the subgroups for which an intervention is especially effective, Virtual Twins (VT) [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] is a suitable method to use for generating hypotheses [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The VT methodology is based on the concept of counterfactual or potential outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In VT analysis, for every person two potential outcomes can be defined; one for the SG intervention and one for TAUx. These two potential outcomes represent the outcomes that would be observed if the person in question were subject to the SG intervention or TAUx, respectively. As a first step, VT estimates for each person the two potential outcome values (also referred as virtual twins); the difference between these estimates represents for each person an estimate of that person&#x02019;s individual differential treatment effect. In a second step of VT, this estimated individual differential treatment effect is entered as the criterion variable in a regression tree analysis [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], together with the available pre-intervention characteristics as predictors. Such a regression tree analysis implies that the total group of participants is repeatedly subdivided on the basis of binary splits of the pre-intervention characteristics into subgroups (i.e., leaves) that are increasingly homogeneous with respect to the criterion variable. The resulting series of splits can be represented by a tree structure like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193681.g002">Fig 2</xref> (which will further be discussed in the Result section). The union of the leaves of such a tree for which the average individual differential treatment effect exceeds some pre-specified threshold <italic>c</italic>, then constitutes the subgroup that is generated by the VT algorithm. Subsequently, an estimate of the enhanced treatment effect in the subgroup compared with the average treatment effect is determined. For this we will rely on the so-called re-substitution method as proposed by Foster and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], where the difference between the estimated treatment effect in the subgroup and in the total group of persons is being calculated (based on observed rather than estimated potential outcome values).</p><fig id="pone.0193681.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0193681.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Results of the application of Virtual Twins with outcome time management.</title><p>The ellipses in the figure represent the internal nodes containing the split variables, with below each ellipsis the corresponding split point.

When VT outputs a subgroup with an enhanced treatment effect for one or more of the outcome measures, we will accompany the estimate of the enhanced treatment effect in the subgroup by confidence intervals as measure of reliability of the estimate (so-called percentile bootstrap confidence intervals) [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

Results of a multisite open-label RCT indicated the superiority of a SG intervention on the parent-rated primary outcome measure of time management and secondary outcomes measures of responsibility and working memory [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We used the VT method to explore the role of several pre-intervention characteristics in predicting enhanced treatment effects on time management, planning/organizing and cooperation skills (included as primary outcome measures in the multisite open-label RCT). Although children appear to improve mainly on their time management skills (group-level), our moderator effects were particularly observed for the outcome variable of planning/organizing skills. We found that two groups benefitted on planning/organizing skills more from the SG intervention, compared with the estimated treatment effect of the total group: a) girls in general, and b) boys with both a lower score on hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and a higher score on CD symptoms. We found no effects of age, IQ, medication use, game experience and ADHD diagnosis on the three primary outcome measures. Our results imply that for these subgroups allocation to the SG intervention has a higher chance of treatment success.</p><p>In other moderation studies, for example the MTA study, gender was tested as a moderator, but was not associated with outcomes in any of the treatment conditions [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, our results indicated that gender influences treatment success: in our study, girls benefitted more strongly from the intervention. Explaining this result in terms of lower levels of ADHD symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] or higher verbal IQ [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] among girls is not valid given that this was shown by the output of the VT analysis and therefore seen as unrelated to the enhanced intervention effects concerning plan/organize skills in the current subgroup. Therefore, other variables (e.g., motivation, parental characteristics) that were not measured in the current study might be at work and the underlying mechanism related to this favourable outcome of the SG intervention remains to be explored. As demonstrated by Van den Hoofdakker and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] parental characteristics can moderate treatment outcomes. Hence, our study, one of the first to examine gender as a moderator, contributes to the ADHD literature by demonstrating that game-based interventions are not equally effective for boys and girls.</p><p>In addition, we also found enhanced treatment effects for boys with both lower initial levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity and a higher CD symptom score. In our study, boys with scores falling in the normal to subclinical range of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, who are therefore likely to be more stabilized on their TAU, benefitted the most from the intervention. In contrast, our finding with CD symptoms is more counterintuitive. CD symptoms are associated with aggressive/externalizing behavior, which suggests that they may interfere with treatment effectiveness. However, the CD symptoms score for our participants fell within the normal range (i.e., from 0 to 48), with a (sub)clinical cut off score at 5 depending on gender and age. This suggests that there were no serious clinical symptoms that could interfere with the intervention. Thus what mechanism causes this enhanced effect for this subgroup remains to be explored in further research.</p><p>In our previous study, we only found a marginal treatment effect of the SG intervention on participant&#x02019;s planning/organizing skills (group-level). However, we did find a moderating effect on this outcome measure in the current study. This was surprising, and illustrates the value of examining moderator variables even if overall treatment effects are not present [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><sec id="sec026"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Thus far, there has been a lack of studies examining moderating variables in the field of serious gaming within mental health care [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Apart from examining intervention effects on group level, it is important to examine moderator variables because individuals can show different treatment responses. The current study, one of the first to investigate the role of moderating variables, gives some indications for whom the intervention works best. These results could be used to direct more informed decisions regarding intervention allocation as it will enable healthcare professionals to optimize the match between individuals and their treatment. The results indicate that gender, levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity, and presence of CD symptoms should be taken into account when deciding upon treatment in clinical practice. Our results demonstrate that girls, and boys with both lower hyperactivity/impulsivity and a higher CD symptom score, benefitted the most from the intervention. In short, the SG intervention improves time management skills in children with ADHD (who already receive TAU) and enhanced treatment effects are present for specific subgroups on planning/organizing skills.</p><p>Our results are also important from a clinical perspective, as they may help stimulate personalized and targeted interventions. These results could contribute to a personalized clinical approach, indicating for whom an additional serious game treatment is most effective. In this regard, the DBDRS questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which was used in the current study to screen for ADHD and comorbid ODD and CD symptoms, could be used as a screener to support treatment indication. This questionnaire is a widely used and accepted instrument within the clinical field. Replication of the findings with larger samples is needed before reliable clinical implications about subgroups can be made [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results should therefore be interpreted as more hypothesis generating and specific to the current sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are also some limitations of this study that should be addressed in future work. First, although non-parametric approaches like VT have clear advantages over linear models [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in this study, the power to detect subgroups was relatively low. Despite this issue, we did find several significant moderators, to prevent ourselves from overfitting these data, we used a bootstrap-based procedure for estimating a measure of uncertainty. As compared to other RCTs, our sample size of children with ADHD was relatively large, but for the current method, even larger samples are needed to replicate these findings [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Second, although it is clinically important to determine long-term effects, we were not able to examine effects of moderation on the longer term [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as these data were not available for the TAUx group. Third, although we included a broad range of moderators, we acknowledge that we did not investigate the potential role of other pre-intervention characteristics as possible moderators of treatment outcome. For example, we did not test the role of parental support, parental ADHD diagnosis, or the child&#x02019;s motivation, all factors that have been demonstrated to be relevant by other studies [<xref rid="pone.0193681.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193681.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Finally, although our results are intriguing and when replicated relevant for clinical practice, we can only speculate why our subgroups show enhanced treatment effects. We hope that future research examining mediating factors will address this question as well.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study found two groups that benefitted most from SG intervention among a clinical sample of children with ADHD: girls in general, and boys with both a lower score on hyperactivity and a higher score on CD symptoms.
