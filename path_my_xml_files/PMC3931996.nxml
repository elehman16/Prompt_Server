IHD is the most common cause of death in the UK (mainly as a consequence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)), causing approximately 82 000 deaths per year, and accounting for &#x000a3;29.1 billion pounds1 within the National Health Service (NHS).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Primary angioplasty has significantly improved the outcome for patients with AMI, however there remains a significant risk of mortality at 30&#x02005;days (7%) despite optimal medical management.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As treatment improves, there is an increase in the numbers of survivors of AMI but this means that there is also an associated increase in the incidence of heart failure (15&#x02013;20%) in patients who still develop significant myocardial damage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While early reperfusion therapy directly decreases the amount of myocardial necrosis, a consequence of ischaemic damage, at least 50% of the final infarct size results from the damage caused by ischaemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This means that there are two targets for therapeutic intervention in the early stages of AMI; decreasing initial myocardial ischaemia by prompt restoration of coronary flow and preventing the damage caused by I-R injury as the blood supply is restored. While early reperfusion is achieved by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) it is possible that cell therapy may play a role in limiting the I-R injury.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This, therefore, provides an additional rationale for administering cell therapy at an early stage after myocardial infarction, which is independent of the concept of cardiac regeneration and has important therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The heart and regeneration</title><p>Until recently the heart has been considered as a terminally differentiated organ with no ability to self repair (cf hepatic regeneration).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, recent studies<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> imply that there may be a background level of cellular renewal by engraftment and differentiation of primitive cells. Limited regeneration could occur through circulating primitive bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) that could engraft in the heart in response to injury<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or from a resident cardiac stem cell population.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Clearly, this reparative potential is not capable of an adequate response to significant myocardial damage but the discovery of this endogenous repair process has provided a further rationale for the use of cell therapy based on the amplification of this natural process.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Stem cell therapy and myocardial infarction</title><p>The seminal work by Orlic <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in 2001 demonstrated a significant increase in cardiac function following injection of allogeneic bone marrow-derived cells 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;h after a mechanically induced myocardial infarction in a mouse model. In further separate preclinical studies in which progenitor cells were injected 1&#x02005;h after induction of myocardial infarction an angiogenesis-type response was seen in the release of angiogenic ligands and related cytokines compared to the controls.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Recent experiments using mouse models have shown that earlier infusion time (immediate, compared to 1&#x02005;week) and higher cell concentration has a greater impact on left ventricular (LV) function post-mechanical infarction.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These studies, therefore, support the rationale of the trial design reported here for attempting to deliver cell therapy as soon as possible after AMI.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>AMI stem cell therapy in man</title><p>To date, the majority of clinical trials evaluating stem cell therapy after AMI have been phase I or II studies designed to look for safety and feasibility with surrogate measures for early signs of efficacy. The first randomised trial investigating cell use post-AMI was TOPCARE-AMI. This showed an improvement in the LV function from 51.6&#x000b1;9.6% at baseline to 60.1&#x000b1;8.6% at 4&#x02005;months in the cell therapy arm vs 51.0&#x000b1;10% at baseline to 53.5&#x000b1;7.9% in the control arm.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Improvement in patients treated with cell therapy was also seen in the BOOST study (bone marrow transfer to enhance ST&#x000a0;elevation infarction regeneration) that demonstrated a 6.7% improvement in LV function at 6&#x02005;months from baseline in the stem cell arm compared to 0.7% in the control arm (p=0.0026).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The largest randomised control trial to date is the REPAIR-AMI trial (intracoronary progenitor cells in AMI). This double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 204 patients assessed LV function change after 4&#x02005;months in patients treated with autologous bone marrow-derived cell therapy compared to controls. REPAIR-AMI showed a statistically significant improvement in LV function in cell-treated patients compared to the control arm (5.5&#x000b1;7.3%. vs 3.0&#x000b1;6.5%, p=0.01).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Further follow-up of patients with REPAIR-AMI has demonstrated a reduction in mortality in the cell-treated group although the trial was not statistically powered to assess this.</p><p>In contrast to these studies, a number of clinical trials have been published that failed to reproduce these positive findings. In the LEUVEN-AMI, Janssens <italic>et al</italic>, reported no change in global left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) after autologous BMCs administration 24&#x02005;h following myocardial infarction. Subgroup analysis for this trial did however demonstrate a reduction in infarct size in cell-treated patients compared to controls. It is not clear why this improvement did not lead to beneficial effects on LV function.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, ASTAMI<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and HEBE<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> trials have both failed to show beneficial effect of BMCs on LVEF and LV volumes in patients with AMI. Recently published trials have examined the effect of the timing of infusion of cell therapy on outcome. The LATE TIME study, a double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial of 87 patients showed no improvement in LVEF after cell infusion therapy at 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks post-AMI.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The TIME trial (a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 120 patients) also failed to show improvement in LVEF with a late infusion at 7&#x02005;days postinfarction. Interestingly, this trial also looked at infusion at 3&#x02005;days postinfarction but unlike REPAIR-AMI and BOOST it failed to show statistically significant improvement in LV function.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition to this, the literature has not reported any significant harm following early injection of BMCs in animal models, despite the views of some that this may be hazardous either to the subject or the cell products. The aim of REGENERATE-AMI is to ensure that this lack of evidence is addressed in the safety analysis of the trial.</p><p>There has been considerable debate regarding the discrepancies in the results of these clinical trials and also the failure to translate the success of preclinical experiments into man.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Possible explanations include variations in the cell processing methods, the use of adjunctive therapies and the patient population, highlighting the need for a standardised, widely applicable approach in order to assess whether cell therapy has a role in the management of myocardial infarction.</p><p>Bearing in mind these issues and the preclinical benefits of early delivery of cell therapy, REGENERATE-AMI has been designed to establish for the first time whether an early time point for delivery of cells (&#x0003c;24&#x02005;h) is safe, beneficial and feasible when used as an adjunct to the established treatment of AMI. Patients presenting to heart attack centres with evidence of large infarcts (anterior territory) will have their bone marrow taken and then be randomised to receive either the mononuclear fraction from this sample or saline alone. This phase II clinical trial is novel in the timing of the infusion of the bone marrow-derived product (less than 24&#x02005;h following index revascularisation procedure). This time point will be the closest to that used in the preclinical models, which demonstrated a significant benefit in restoration of cardiac function. Additionally, the inclusion of only anterior AMIs will target the patient population most likely to benefit as identified in the earlier trials.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;17</xref> The cell preparation technique will use the methodology of the REPAIR-AMI trial.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Study design</title><p>REGENERATE-AMI is a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow progenitor cells is feasible, safe and shows positive evidence of activity (ie, improves cardiac function) after an acute anterior myocardial infarction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004258F1">figure 1</xref>) when administered in addition to standard care.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013004258F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of study design.

Clinical endpoints include the acute safety and tolerability of intracoronary stem cells following ST elevation myocardial infarction (haemodyamics and inpatient major adverse cardiac events (MACE), heart failure status (NYHA), heart failure admissions, quality of life (UK sites only) and assessment of MACE endpoints at 6 and 12&#x02005;months (death (independent of cause and sudden death), myocardial infarction (Q-wave and non-Q-wave), coronary revascularisation {(coronary bypass or PCI)}). Further safety endpoints such as rates of cardiac device, that is, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) insertion will be recorded at 1&#x02005;year.</p><p>All data will be anonymised prior to analysis, which will be performed by an independent member of the department not associated with the trial. Scans will be stored on a separate storage device to the reporting system&#x02014;either CD or encrypted hard drive.</p></sec><sec id="s5j"><title>Cardiac MRI</title><p>Each patient will undergo CMR on the day of hospital discharge (Day 3), 3&#x02005;months and 1&#x02005;year following PPCI using each site's local CMR scanner. Each examination will use cine-CMR for ventricular volumes and function, and delayed enhancement (DE)-CMR for infarct size assessment and evaluation of microvascular obstruction. Myocardial oedema will be assessed at all time points using three slice T2-weighted triple inversion turbo spin echo short TI inversion recovery imaging. Myocardial salvage will be calculated from the T2 imaging and infarct size on the Day 3 scan. The inversion time will be optimised to null normal myocardium. Images will be analysed in a blinded fashion by two experienced operators. Scar and oedema volumes will be calculated by manually drawing endocardial and epicardial contours followed by semiautomated selection of normal remote myocardium per slice. Infarct size will be calculated using the full-width half maximum method as previously described.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5k"><title>CT imaging</title><p>Patients who are unable to undergo CMR will be imaged using cardiac CT (approximately 5% of patients). Analysis will use specialised cardiac CT circulation software with intraventricular tracings of end systolic and end diastolic timings.</p></sec><sec id="s5l"><title>Quantitative left ventriculography</title><p>The angiographic endpoint of the study is the change in global LVEF at 6&#x02005;months relative to baseline measured by quantitative left ventriculography. LV angiography is used as a secondary endpoint for the purpose of comparison to early trials such as REPAIR-AMI,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> that also used LV angiographyas an endpoint. Left ventricular angiography is performed in the 30&#x000b0; RAO position and recorded at a minimum of 15&#x02013;30 frames per second. Contrast is injected over 10&#x02005;s. At least two well-opacified sinus beats that are not postpremature beats must be obtained. A simultaneously recorded ECG must be supplied as well as the aortic and LV pressures before and after contrast injection. LVEF and volumes are calculated with the centreline method.</p></sec><sec id="s5m"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Echocardiography will be used to assess LV systolic function using wall motion scoring and calculation of ejection fraction using Simpson's rule. Echocardiography will be performed using imaging protocols that will be standardised to ensure conformity. Assessment of LV function will be performed on the day of PPCI prior to stem cell infusion, 3&#x02005;days after the PPCI (prior to discharge), at 6&#x02005;months and also at 1&#x02005;year to track the changes in cardiac function that occur over time as part of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s5n"><title>Adjudication of potential endpoints</title><p>All measurements will be assessed and adjudicated by a blinded expert. In the event of poor recordings, the expert decides whether the measurement at hand is of sufficient quality to be taken into the endpoint evaluation. Measurements of insufficient quality are dealt with in the analysis in the same manner as missing measurements. Potential MACE events will be assessed by a blinded Safety Committee. All core laboratory readings and adjudications will be completed and entered into the computer database before the study is unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="s5o"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To calculate the target sample size for the trial, an absolute increase in ejection fraction of 6% compared to baseline as measured by CMR will be considered significant and consistent with previous studies that used advanced imaging to measure endpoints.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The published SD for these observations is approximately 8% and in keeping with what has been observed by Janssens <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> For a statistical power of 90% and a probability of a type I error of 0.05 using a two-sided t test, with an estimated 25% dropout at 1&#x02005;year we will recruit a total of 100 patients in this study. Previous trials have shown a 2% improvement in patients who underwent PPCI alone.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, using this information we will perform a post hoc analysis to compare the two groups, which will have 80% power to detect a 4% difference.</p><p>The analysis of the data will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Baseline demographic and clinical variables are summarised for each randomised arm of the study. Continuous variables will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR). Categorical data are presented by frequencies and percentages.</p><p>The statistical comparisons within the treatment arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be performed using the independent-samples t test as the principal analytic tool. Further statistical comparison between treatment arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be performed using the analysis of covariance including LVEF values at 12&#x02005;months as dependent variables and the associated baseline values and the factor treatment as independent variables. Estimates of the treatment effect are presented together with 95% CI. Comparisons will be between the stem cell-treated and placebo control-treated group for the primary and secondary outcomes. Estimates of the treatment effects will be presented together with 95% CIs. All p values will be two-sided.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>For clinical outcomes such as the incidence of MACE (predefined clinical scenarios; death, myocardial infarction, re-admission for heart failure or revascularisation), Kaplan-Meier curves displaying the pattern of events during the 6-month and 12-month follow-up period are drawn. Statistical significance and 95% CIs are calculated using Cox&#x02019;s proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec id="s5p"><title>Adverse events reporting</title><p>An independent Data and Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be formed to monitor patient safety as the study progresses. The DSMB has been selected by and communicates directly to the study&#x02019;s Executive Committee. The DSMB will meet prior to initiation of the clinical study to determine whether stopping rules are needed or appropriate. If a serious concern with the safety of the patients in the trial would arise, the DSMB may recommend early termination of the study.</p><p>The DSMB will review safety issues throughout the trial which will include unexpected serious adverse events, mortality, complications of bone marrow aspiration, complications of the intracoronary infusion, complications of (diagnostic) study procedures and serious or life-threatening arrhythmia&#x02019;s. Every 3&#x02005;months, all safety events are reported to the DSMB statistician, who will prepare tabulations by treatment groups. Fatalities are reported on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec><sec id="s5q"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Important ethical issues to consider with this type of trial are the need to obtain informed consent in the acute setting, the possible risk of BMCs use, the requirement for further interventional angiography and infusion shortly after the index procedure.</p><p>There are challenges in obtaining informed consent from an acutely unwell patient with AMI, as both the patient's physical condition and treatment with pain relief have the potential to make this difficult. A number of steps will be taken to deal with this. First is to ensure that patients are in a stable clinical condition when they come back for repeat procedures, therefore we have excluded patients who are unconscious, critically unstable (cardiogenic shock) and deemed unable to consent (ie, unable to understand in local language). Second, all patients will be provided with a patient information sheet prior to consent and the study will be discussed again with the patient after the procedure when they are on the ward. Lastly, if the patient has been given pain relief treatment or sedation during the initial PPCI that could alter their decision-making we shall ensure that the patient has enough time to recover prior to consent.</p><p>BMCs are the patients&#x02019; own cells, therefore there is no risk of an allergic reaction. The repeat angiography and the infusion of BMCs or placebo into the coronary artery could lead to possible complications but this will be reduced by:

Data collection will be completed by mid-2014. Primary and secondary analysis will start immediately after data monitoring is completed. Publications will be prepared for submission in late 2014. The results of the trial will be published according to the CONSORT statement. Dissemination of results will focus on publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at both national and international cardiology meetings and National Health Service (NHS) groups. In accordance with recommendations, REGENERATE-AMI has been registered with a public registry ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></sec><sec id="s5s"><title>Summary</title><p>REGENERATE-AMI will be the first RCT of autologous bone marrow-derived cells delivered to patients less than 24&#x02005;h after presentation with acute AMI. The results of the study will demonstrate whether such early delivery is achievable and safe. The efficacy results of this trial will complete a time course for cell administration that has been complied as a result of previous studies and will therefore provide valuable information for the planning of future phase III clinical trials using autologous cell therapy in AMI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e265" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004258.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e266" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004258.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TC, SH, DAJ, CK, AM and MP participated in preparation and writing of manuscript.
