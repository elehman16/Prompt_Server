While there is now evidence to support the use of HF to reduce extubation failure, there have been no appropriately designed and powered studies to assess the use of HF as primary respiratory support soon after birth.

Eligible infants are preterm infants of 28&#x02013;36<sup>+6</sup> weeks&#x02019; gestational age (GA) who require primary non-invasive respiratory support for respiratory distress in the first 24&#x02005;h of life. Infants are randomised to treatment with either HF or NCPAP. The primary outcome is treatment failure within 72&#x02005;h after randomisation, as determined by objective oxygenation, blood gas, and apnoea criteria, or the need for urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of intubation, pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, nasal trauma, costs associated with hospital care and parental stress. With a specified non-inferiority margin of 10%, using a two-sided 95% CI and 90% power, the study requires 375 infants per group (total 750 infants).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been granted by the relevant human research ethics committees at The Royal Women's Hospital (13/12), The Royal Children's Hospital (33144A), The Mercy Hospital for Women (R13/34), and the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (2013/1657).

Every year, 15 million infants are born preterm and &#x0003e;1 million die from complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is one such complication occurring in 44% of very low birthweight infants (&#x0003c;1500&#x02005;g);<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> therefore, identifying the optimal method for providing breathing support is crucial for this group. Ventilation via an endotracheal tube (ETT) has improved preterm survival, but has increased rates of lung damage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As a result, &#x02018;non-invasive&#x02019; techniques (without an ETT) have been developed to minimise lung damage. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is an effective mode of support for newborn infants with respiratory distress. It reduces extubation failure in previously ventilated infants,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is an effective alternative to intubation and mechanical ventilation at birth for preterm infants with RDS.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Published randomised trials have reported successful use of NCPAP without intubation and mechanical ventilation in 48&#x02013;54% of infants born at 25&#x02013;30&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> NCPAP also significantly reduces the need for transfer of infants &#x0003e;30&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation with respiratory distress, born in non-tertiary neonatal units.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, NCPAP has significant limitations; the need for the prongs to completely fill the nostrils can result in damage to the nasal mucosa and septum.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Excessive leak around the prongs and through the mouth can lead to inadequate support, whereas excessive pressure may result in pneumothoraces;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> both of these may require intubation and ventilation. Pressurised gas can cause abdominal distension,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the bulky fixation devices obscure the infant's face. Both of these problems interfere with feeding and positioning. These challenges are driving the search for alternative treatments.</p><p>In recent years, high flow (HF) therapy has become popular and is used in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the USA<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> as well as in NICUs and non-tertiary neonatal units within the UK, Australia and New Zealand.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref></p><p>HF refers to heated, humidified, blended oxygen delivered into the nose via loose fitting short binasal prongs, at a flow of at least 1&#x02005;L/min.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>While the use of commercially available HF systems has been adopted by many NICUs, there is relatively little evidence to support its efficacy as respiratory support in the neonatal population, particularly when used as the primary mode of respiratory support. The popularity of HF seems to be due to other perceived advantages, for example, that the cannulae are easier to apply than NCPAP prongs, may be more comfortable for infants, may be associated with less nasal trauma and may enable easier access to babies&#x02019; faces, thus allowing for greater opportunities for feeding and parental bonding.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> If HF therapy was demonstrated to be as effective as NCPAP, these other factors might lead to it being preferred in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Evidence of clinical efficacy of HF</title><p>Pooled analysis of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has demonstrated that NCPAP prevents extubation failure, in comparison to ambient oxygen alone.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A 2011 Cochrane review of four randomised studies comparing NCPAP with HF in 177 infants found the trials unsuitable for meta-analysis due to methodological differences, and concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the use of HF as post-extubation respiratory support in preterm infants.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In 2013, three RCTs were published, comparing NCPAP with HF as post-extubation respiratory support. Studies by Collins<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and Manley<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> included 435 very preterm infants (&#x0003c;32&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation) randomised at extubation, and both trials demonstrated no significant difference in extubation failure within 7&#x02005;days between the NCPAP and HF groups. Yoder<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> conducted a trial including 432 infants of &#x02265;28&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation (of whom 291 were randomised at extubation). There was no significant difference between the study groups for the primary outcome of intubation/reintubation within the first 72&#x02005;h of treatment. These three trials suggest that HF is a viable alternative to NCPAP as post-extubation support.</p><p>While NCPAP is well established as a primary respiratory support mode for preterm infants, there is little evidence for HF in this setting. A retrospective review of infants initially treated with HF, compared with an earlier cohort managed with NCPAP, found fewer early intubations in the HF cohort.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The largest of the aforementioned RCTs included a subgroup of 141 infants who had not been previously intubated and ventilated. Although these infants were not analysed separately, the data are encouraging and show that HF may be a useful therapy for early respiratory distress. A small pilot RCT including 38 preterm infants managed with either early HF or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation demonstrated no difference in treatment failure. However, there are no appropriately designed and powered RCTs comparing HF with NCPAP as primary treatment for early RDS in preterm infants.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Potential advantages and safety of HF</title><p>Concerns that airway pressures generated by HF could be very high have been allayed by an accumulation of data demonstrating that HF generates airway pressures at, or below, those resulting from NCPAP, especially when a leak is maintained around the prongs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;25</xref></p><p>In late 2005, one of the commercially available HF devices was associated with bacterial infection.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A worldwide brand recall took place before the device was reintroduced in early 2007, without further reported problems.</p><p>Preterm infants with RDS are at risk of pneumothorax, a recognised complication of NCPAP therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Pneumothorax is also a potential risk in HF therapy. However, reports of pneumothoraces in preterm infants treated with HF are rare; only two cases were reported from the 431 infants randomised to receive HF in recent RCTs,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> compared with 10/436 infants randomised to receive NCPAP. However, most infants in these studies had previously been intubated and received surfactant replacement, therefore pneumothorax rates would be expected to be low. Preterm infants treated with primary NCPAP from birth, who have not received surfactant, have much higher pneumothorax rates of up to 9%;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the risk of pneumothorax during primary HF support is unknown.</p><p>Three RCTs have convincingly demonstrated that HF results in less nasal trauma than NCPAP.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> Further studies have shown HF is preferred by parents<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and by nursing staff.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Other perceived advantages of HF, such as greater infant comfort and better establishment of feeding, remain unproven.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Rationale and aim</title><p>Neonatal HF use, including use as primary support, is rapidly increasing around the world. It is crucial that HF therapy is applied without causing harm by making appropriate assessment of its use before it becomes widely accepted in the neonatal practice. If HF does provide comparable support to NCPAP for preterm infants with early respiratory distress, then it is likely that it will be widely adopted in preference to NCPAP in NICUs as it is easier to use, more comfortable for infants,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> reduces nasal trauma, and is preferred by clinicians and parents.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, it is of concern that HF is being used as primary respiratory support for preterm infants in the absence of good quality evidence of its efficacy in this setting. The HIPSTER trial is the first appropriately powered and designed trial to assess HF as primary support for preterm infants.</p><p>Non-inferiority trials are relatively uncommon in neonatal practice, but appropriate in this case due to the advantages associated with HF, which would make it preferable to NCPAP provided that it is non-inferior in efficacy. The choice of non-inferiority margin is important in such a trial, and our margin of 10% was chosen in view of the fact that the primary outcome was treatment failure and not a more critical outcome, such as death, and that infants who have treatment failure on HF will be offered NCPAP, which may &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; them from intubation and ventilation. This non-inferiority margin is half the size of that used in a previous post-extubation trial of HF published by our group<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> given that the expected rate of treatment failure in the population of The HIPSTER trial, a study of primary respiratory support, is lower, and therefore the criteria for non-inferiority should be stricter.</p><p>A potential limitation to this trial is that blinding is not possible. We have attempted to minimise this by setting objective treatment failure criteria, which were agreed on by all participating centres. Some infants randomised to HF will have received a brief period of NCPAP before randomisation, which conceivably could affect interpretation of the results. However, we have aimed to restrict the impact of this by making any infant who has received four or more hours of NCPAP ineligible for the trial and by the use of antenatal consent when possible, and a retrospective consent process at the lead centre. Acceptance of such a process requires the approval of both the HREC and the treating clinical team, and this may vary from site to site. We feel retrospective consent is appropriate in this trial given that HF has already been adopted into standard practice as a mode of primary respiratory support by some neonatologists<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and that along with the inclusion of &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; NCPAP, the HREC adjudged that infants in the HF group were not exposed to additional risk in comparison to those treated with NCPAP.</p><p>The use of HF in neonatal practice is now well established, but good quality evidence is required to determine in which clinical settings this is appropriate. If this trial demonstrates that HF is non-inferior to NCPAP as primary support, then this practice is likely to be widely adopted around the world. However, if HF is inferior to NCPAP, then this study will ensure that preterm infants, who require non-invasive respiratory support, receive the optimal treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the following for their contribution to the trial: <italic>HIPSTER investigators</italic>: TE Calisch, D Cartwright, C Collins, G Flagstad, D Fugelseth, DH Fr&#x000f8;island, M Gr&#x000f8;nn, C Klingenberg, A Leknessund, A Malhotra, B Nakstad, M Pritchard, A Ronnestad, AL Solev&#x000e5;g. <italic>Research nurses/assistants</italic>: B Argus, MI Austgulen, A Brett, U Grepperud, KG Gustavsen, EA Hansen, B H&#x000f8;ium, A J&#x000f8;rstad, G Lack, E Ludvigsen, PJ Lyseggen, L McKeown, B Mills, CS Nygaard, C Wong, E Yeomans. <italic>Royal Women's Hospital Research Fellows</italic>: L McGrory, J O'Shea. <italic>Data Safety Monitoring Committee</italic>: H Liley (chair), K Lee, K Wheeler.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CTR conceived and designed the trial protocol, wrote the first draft and revised the manuscript for intellectual content.
