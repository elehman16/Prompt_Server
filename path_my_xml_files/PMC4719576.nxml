However, its potential for improving fetal and neonatal outcomes has not been realised. The reasons for this are complex, but the most likely reason is the difficulty of interpreting the fetal heart rate trace correctly during labour, when the birth attendant has many competing tasks. If intrapartum monitoring is ever going to improve fetal and neonatal outcomes then the interpretation of the fetal heart rate has to be substantially improved. This improvement then has to be sustained and be independent of any health professional&#x02019;s individual ability. Computerised interpretation of the fetal heart rate and intelligent decision-support has the potential to deliver this improvement in care. The aim of EFM is to detect abnormalities of the fetal heart rate pattern during labour that are associated with asphyxia so that action can be taken to expedite delivery and prevent stillbirth and the development of encephalopathy. Therefore the potential benefits of EFM are immense. Prevention of even a modest proportion of perinatal asphyxia will improve the health and well-being of thousands of children and their families throughout the world each year. In addition the NHS Litigation Authority bill for obstetrics was &#x000a3;269&#x000a0;m in 2001/2 and is rising. This could be substantially reduced. Furthermore, if this technology can work in the complex process of labour it also has the potential to improve patient safety in a wide range of health-care settings.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The problem of perinatal asphyxia</title><p>Perinatal asphyxia, if severe, can result in intrapartum stillbirth. If less severe it results in the development of an encephalopathic state in the newborn. This is characterised by a decreased level of consciousness, altered reflexes and abnormal tone and ultimately permanent damage to the brain. Moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy occurs in approximately 2/1000 births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With more severe asphyxial encephalopathy there is an increasing risk of death or neurodevelopmental abnormalities: up to 30&#x000a0;% of affected neonates will develop seizures and approximately 25&#x000a0;% of infants who have moderate asphyxial encephalopathy will develop cerebral palsy. Almost all infants with severe encephalopathy die or survive with multiple handicaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Perinatal asphyxia may account for up to 30&#x000a0;% of cases of cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and it is a very significant health-care and financial burden on the NHS. A reduction in the number of babies born with perinatal asphyxia would reduce the associated mortality and, amongst survivors, the burden of ill health and incapacity. It could also result in substantial savings in litigation costs in the UK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Efficacy of continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM)</title><p>Continuous EFM was invented in the 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The recorder displays the fetal heart rate and maternal uterine activity and displays this on a continuous line graph, called the cardiotocograph (CTG) tracing. EFM was widely introduced in the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It became controversial in the 1980s when it was shown that it was poorly predictive of Apgar scores and fetal acid&#x02013;base status at delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The largest randomised controlled trial (the Dublin trial) showed no reduction in perinatal mortality or in cerebral palsy using EFM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of all trials indicated some benefits of continuous EFM: for example, a 58&#x000a0;% reduction in odds of deaths attributable to intrapartum hypoxia (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 2 to 83&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in risk of neonatal seizures (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, 20 to 69&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. EFM is widely used on many women during labour in the UK. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for fetal monitoring in the NHS detail explicit criteria for which women should have continuous EFM during labour; these equate to approximately 60&#x000a0;% of all women in labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The effect of continuous EFM versus intermittent auscultation on the incidence of deaths attributable to intrapartum hypoxia</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th rowspan="2">No. of patients in the EFM group</th><th rowspan="2">No. of patients in the IA group</th><th colspan="2">No. of perinatal deaths</th><th colspan="2">Perinatal deaths due to fetal hypoxia</th></tr><tr><th>Study</th><th>EFM</th><th>IA</th><th>EFM</th><th>IA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Haverkamp <italic>et al</italic> (1976) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]</td><td>242</td><td>241</td><td>2 (FD 0, ND 2)</td><td>1 (FD 0, ND 1)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Renou <italic>et al</italic> (1976) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]</td><td>175</td><td>175</td><td>1 (FD 0, ND1)</td><td>1 (FD 1, ND 0)</td><td>0</td><td>1 (FD)</td></tr><tr><td>Kelso <italic>et al</italic> (1978) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]</td><td>253</td><td>251</td><td>0</td><td>1 (FD 0, ND 1)</td><td>0</td><td>1 (ND)</td></tr><tr><td>Haverkamp <italic>et al</italic> (1979) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]</td><td>230 229</td><td>231</td><td>3 (FD 0, ND 3)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wood <italic>et al</italic> (1981) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]</td><td>445</td><td>482</td><td>1 (FD 0, ND 1)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>MacDonald <italic>et al</italic> (1985) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td><td>6474</td><td>6490</td><td>14 (FD 3, ND 11)</td><td>14 (FD 2, ND 12)</td><td>7 (FD 3, ND 4)</td><td>7 (FD 2, ND 5)</td></tr><tr><td>Neldam <italic>at al</italic> (1986) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]</td><td>482</td><td>487</td><td>0</td><td>1 (FD 1, ND 0)</td><td>0</td><td>1 (FD)</td></tr><tr><td>Luthy <italic>et al</italic> (1987) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]</td><td>122</td><td>124</td><td>17 (FD 1, ND 16)</td><td>18 (FD 1, ND 17)</td><td>0</td><td>1 (FD)</td></tr><tr><td>Vintzileos <italic>et al</italic> (1993) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]</td><td>746</td><td>682</td><td>2 (FD 0, ND 2)</td><td>9 (FD 2,ND 7)</td><td>0</td><td>6 (FD 2, ND 4)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>9398</td><td>9163</td><td>40 (4.2/1000)</td><td>45 (4.9/1000)</td><td>7 (0.7/1000)<sup>a</sup>

In one case&#x02013;control study, the intrapartum management of 38 babies severely asphyxiated at birth was compared with that of 120 controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the control group, 29&#x000a0;% of babies had an abnormal CTG, but in only 9&#x000a0;% was the abnormality severe. In contrast, 87&#x000a0;% of the babies asphyxiated at birth had an abnormal CTG and in 61&#x000a0;% of cases the abnormality was severe. The most striking finding, however, was the length of time required for the staff to recognise the CTG abnormality. With moderate abnormalities, the mean time to recognition was 91&#x000a0;min (SD 61); paradoxically, with severe abnormalities it was 128&#x000a0;min (SD 100). The authors could give no plausible reason for the standard of CTG interpretation being so poor. However, it was clear from this study that if the quality of interpretation of the intrapartum CTG had been higher, the benefits from EFM would almost certainly have been significantly and substantially enhanced.</p><p>In 1990, Ennis and Vincent published the results of their study of 64 cases of poor perinatal outcome from the archives of the Medical Protection Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 11 cases continuous EFM was not performed, although indicated; in six cases the technical quality of the tracing was inadequate; in 14 cases there was a significant abnormality in the CTG, but this was either not noticed or no action was taken upon it; in only 14 cases was appropriate monitoring performed and action taken; and the CTG was missing in 19 cases. In only 16 cases was a consultant involved to aid in the interpretation of the CTG. In a further study from Oxford published in 1994, intrapartum care was assessed in 141 cases of cerebral palsy and in 62 perinatal deaths with a likely intrapartum cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The authors found that abnormal fetal heart-rate patterns were: 2.3 times as common in babies who went on to develop cerebral palsy, compared with controls; and 6.7 times as common in perinatal deaths. In addition, the authors found that clinicians&#x02019; failure to respond to these clear signs of abnormality occurred in 26&#x000a0;% of cerebral palsy cases and 50&#x000a0;% of perinatal deaths, compared with 7&#x000a0;% of controls. On the basis of these figures it can be estimated that approximately one case of cerebral palsy and one perinatal death can possibly be prevented in every 4500 deliveries. If one assumes 700,000 births per annum in the United Kingdom, 174 cases of cerebral palsy and 158 perinatal deaths could be prevented each year. More recently, Stewart et al have reported that perinatal mortality in the United Kingdom is twice as high at night as during the day, and twice as high in July and August as in the rest of the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They suggest that excess deaths may be due to over-reliance on inexperienced staff at night and a shortage of staff during the peak summer holiday months; they also suggest that the excess might be related to physical and mental fatigue of the caregivers. In 1999 the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy (CESDI) studied the proportion of 567 cases where there was evidence of suboptimal care in labour. CESDI then looked at whether improved care could possibly or probably have prevented the adverse outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Suboptimal care was identified in 71&#x000a0;% of cases; a better outcome could possibly (in 28&#x000a0;% of cases) or probably (in 22&#x000a0;% of cases) have been anticipated, if care had been adequate. The report commented that &#x0201c;fetal surveillance problems were the most common cause [of problems in labour], with CTG interpretation the most frequent criticism.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Does improving training solve the problem?</title><p>In a report of a study of the efficacy of intrapartum intervention, Young et al found that when babies with low Apgar scores were studied, in 74&#x000a0;% there was evidence of substandard care in labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Following the introduction of regular audit of low Apgar scores, with intensive feedback to clinical staff, this proportion fell to 23&#x000a0;%, but increased to 32&#x000a0;% over the following year. However, following the introduction of compulsory training in CTG interpretation for all staff, the proportion of low Apgar score cases associated with substandard care fell back once again to only 9&#x000a0;%. It is clear from this study that improved interpretation of CTGs during labour can bring about a striking increase in the quality of care, with measurable impacts on neonatal condition. However, intensive education is not sustainable in most clinical settings. With recent changes in the training of junior medical and midwifery staff, it is clear that other systems have to be developed which are less reliant on individual motivation and training. These systems need to work equally well, regardless of the time of day, day of the week, month of the year, and the level of staffing on the labour ward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Litigation and the costs to families and society</title><p>Maternity services are associated with far higher litigation costs than other services (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6310805.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6310805.stm</ext-link>). This is reflected in the various arrangements for the development of risk management standards across the UK (Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts in England, Welsh Risk Pool, Clinical Negligence and Other Risks Indemnity Schemes and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland in Scotland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Payments made (including amounts set aside for unresolved claims) by the National Health Service Litigation Authority for obstetric related incidents over the period 1995 to 2005 totalled &#x000a3;1.5 billion.</p><p>In response to a parliamentary question on 29 Jan 2007, it was stated that the total compensation payout in 2006 was &#x000a3;593 million, with &#x000a3;68 million resulting from just ten cases, all of which were in relation to pregnancy and childbirth. The BBC also reported a settlement of &#x000a3;6 million for a child with cerebral palsy after doctors &#x0201c;mis-managed her delivery&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6310805.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6310805.stm</ext-link>). Even successful defence can cost up to &#x000a3;0.5million. Not surprisingly, the Chief Medical Officer set a target19 of a 25&#x000a0;% reduction in obstetric mishaps by the year 2005. However in his 2006 report there was still a chapter devoted to intrapartum related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The BMJ in 2000 highlighted the importance of &#x0201c;system errors&#x0201d; in medical disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; analogies were drawn with errors in aviation. It has been suggested that some techniques used in this industry could be applied effectively to medical care, such as safety drills, revalidation, &#x02018;near miss&#x02019; reporting and a &#x02018;no blame&#x02019; culture. The role of expert systems and &#x02018;intelligent alarms&#x02019; was highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The potential solution: development of the intelligent decision-support software</title><p>A group in Plymouth, working on the problems of resolving human error in the management of labour, have developed intelligent computer systems as decision aids to support clinicians. The group were funded by the MRC (G9721800) for development and clinical validation of a decision-support tool for the management of labour using the CTG. This decision support software interprets the CTG in the context of an individual woman&#x02019;s labour and offers advice on the management of labour. It comprises feature extraction of all relevant data from the CTG and clinical history which have been found to influence clinicians&#x02019; decision making, and then an analysis of these within a rule-based expert system.</p><p>The specific piece of decision-support software to be evaluated in INFANT has been designed by K2 Medical Systems (a spin-off company from the University of Plymouth) to run on the K2 data collection system (Guardian&#x000ae;). The data collection system (Guardian&#x000ae;) is a system for managing information from labour monitoring. It displays the CTG on a computer screen alongside other clinical data which are collected as part of routine clinical care. As such, it replaces conventional paper labour notes, the CTG machine and other recording systems for documenting care during labour. The data collection system (Guardian&#x000ae;) does not interpret any of the data being collected, it merely acts as an interface to collect and display data. If used to its full potential it results in the labour room being a notes-free area.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>The data collection system (Guardian)</title><p>The Guardian system consists of a medical-grade PC platform, which meets the MHRA standards for a class IIa device. The design has been informed by user-preference studies and ethnographic and audio-visual observations of clinical care and decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It has a touch-screen user-interface <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.k2ms.com/">www.K2ms.com</ext-link> and is connected to a conventional CTG recorder at the woman&#x02019;s bedside.</p><p>The PC uses the Windows operating system and runs the decision-support software developed by the Plymouth Group. The clinician enters clinical information (antenatal risk factors, vaginal examination data, fetal blood sample results, etc.) via the touch-screen. This information is displayed as a partogram. The system requires little or no training to use and has been used for routine clinical care by a number of hospitals throughout the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. If a CTG is performed by ultrasound or ECG clip, the PC system automatically collects this from the RS 232 digital data-port of any CTG recorder. The system displays the CTG data on the screen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The data collection system (Guardian) displays the CTG data on the screen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2015_780_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The decision-support software</title><p>The decision-support software is a specific piece of software which has been developed to run on the Guardian&#x000ae; system. It extracts the important features of baseline heart rate, heart-rate variability, accelerations, type and timing of decelerations, the quality of the signal and the contraction pattern from the CTG. The decision-support software then analyses these data along with the quality of the signals. The system&#x02019;s assessment of the CTG is presented as a series of colour-coded alerts depending on the severity of the abnormality detected. The system can therefore be viewed as an intelligent prompt, but by recording the chronology of events it also offers the opportunity to later audit the actual clinical decision-making process in a similar way to an airliner&#x02019;s black box.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Studies using the intelligent support software</title><p>Three studies conducted by the Plymouth group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] have demonstrated that the software, when used &#x02018;off-line&#x02019;, performed as well as expert obstetricians in interpreting the CTG and managing labour subsequently, and that the system performed better than routine clinical practice. The system identified more cases that went on to have a poor outcome and anticipated clinical decision-making. In one of these studies involving labours that had resulted in a stillbirth, the system &#x0201c;intervened&#x0201d; more than six hours earlier than actual clinical practice, and more than two hours before the experts. If this translated into clinical practice, it would be reasonable to expect that a number of such deaths might have been prevented if the software had been in use at the time. In all other poor-outcome groups the system intervened much earlier than had happened in routine clinical practice and at a similar time as the experts. The system failed to predict one perinatal death, whereas the experts in the &#x02018;off line&#x02019; study and those functioning in routine clinical practice failed to predict several deaths. These extensive &#x02018;off-line&#x02019; validation studies have shown that the system matched the performance of an expert obstetrician in interpreting the CTG, and performed considerably better than routine clinical practice. Further, the system is not over-interventional. From these data it seems reasonable to hypothesise that the clinical use of this computer-based decision-support software will decrease the incidence of perinatal mortality and morbidity.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Current practice</title><p>EFM is widely used for the majority of women during labour and birth in the UK.

Hence including admission to the neonatal unit within 48&#x000a0;h of birth for equal to or greater than 48&#x000a0;h where there is evidence of compromise at birth. Since this is a mature group of babies, any difference in the incidence of these admissions is likely to result from differences in perinatal asphyxia).</p><p><italic>Note: the benefit of using a composite outcome is the increased incidence of the outcome; hence the sample size is reduced. The main problem occurs if the intervention affects different outcomes in different ways. In this trial, if the use of the decision-support software decreased deaths but increased significant morbidity there may be no difference in the short term primary outcome between the two arms of the trial, even though deaths were being prevented in one arm. The probability of this situation occurring appears very small. If decision-support prevents perinatal asphyxia it will have an effect on all the outcomes contained within the combined primary outcome.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Long term</title><p>PARCA-R composite score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] at the age of 2 years for all infants with trial primary outcome and a further subset of 7000 babies.</p><p><italic>Note: Neurodevelopmental delay and cerebral palsy are the most important long-term adverse outcomes associated with perinatal asphyxia. However the incidence of moderate or severe cerebral palsy is of the order of 1.5&#x02013;2.5/1000 live births, depending on the definition and the method of ascertainment. There is also uncertainty about the proportion of these cases that results from intrapartum asphyxia in mature infants; however, 30&#x000a0;% is a reasonable estimate3. Therefore, given the rarity of this outcome, it is unlikely that a clear difference could be demonstrated between the two groups with a trial of 46,000 births. So in order to have reassurance that any benefits of the intervention, with respect to short term outcomes, have not occurred at the expense of later neurodevelopmental delay,we will measure neurodevelopment in a proportion of the surviving children at the age of 2 years.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Intrapartum stillbirth except deaths due to congenital anomalies</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neonatal deaths up to 28&#x000a0;days after birth except deaths due to congenital anomalies</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moderate or severe encephalopathy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Admission to neonatal unit within 48&#x000a0;h of birth for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;48&#x000a0;h with evidence of feeding difficulties, respiratory illness or encephalopathy (where there is evidence of compromise at birth)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Admission to a higher level of care</p></list-item><list-item><p>Apgar score &#x0003c;4 at 5&#x000a0;min</p></list-item><list-item><p>The distribution of cord blood gas data for cord artery pH</p></list-item><list-item><p>Metabolic acidosis (defined as cord artery pH &#x0003c;7.05 and base deficit in extracellular fluid &#x02265; 12&#x000a0;mmol/l)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Resuscitation interventions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seizures</p></list-item><list-item><p>Destination immediately after birth</p></list-item><list-item><p>Length of hospital stay</p></list-item></list></p><p>Health and development outcomes at 24&#x000a0;months (for all infants with trial primary outcome and a further subset of 7000 babies):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Non-verbal Cognition Scale (PARCA-R)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Vocabulary Sub-scale (PARCA-R)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Vocabulary Sub-scale (PARCA-R)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Sentence Complexity Sub-scale (PARCA-R)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Late deaths up to 24&#x000a0;months (after the neonatal period)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Major disability and non-major disability at 2&#x000a0;years</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Cerebral palsy</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Breast feeding (collected at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Maternal<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mode of delivery</p></list-item><list-item><p>Operative intervention (caesarean section and instrumental delivery) for (i) fetal indication, or (ii) failure to progress, or (iii) combination of fetal distress and failure to progress, or (iv) other reason.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade of Caesarean section</p></list-item><list-item><p>Episiotomy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any episode of fetal blood sampling</p></list-item><list-item><p>Length of (i) first stage, (ii) second stage and (iii) total length of labour from trial entry</p></list-item><list-item><p>Destination immediately after birth</p></list-item><list-item><p>Admission to a higher level of care</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Quality of care</title><p>All babies with an adverse outcome (trial primary outcome plus cord-artery pH &#x0003c;7.05 with base deficit&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;mmol/l) and all neonatal deaths and intrapartum stillbirths will have their care in labour assessed to see if it was suboptimal.

These notes will then be examined by a panel of experienced obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists to identify if there was suboptimal care, particularly in relation to interpretation of the CTG and actions which flow from any identification of CTG abnormalities. The panels will also seek to identify cases with clear evidence of suboptimal care, where the care could be considered negligent in the event of litigation. This information will be important for evaluating whether the decision-support software decreases the risk of suboptimal care in labour; it will also be useful in the economic modelling, which will seek to explore the effect that such an intervention may have on litigation in obstetrics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Process outcomes</title><p>It is important to collect and analyse process outcomes in this trial, as a failure to detect differences in clinical or quality of care outcomes between the two randomised groups may be due to poor compliance with the alerts of the system, rather than that the system did not correctly identify abnormalities with the CTG.

Data collected via the system will be sent electronically to the trial co-ordinating centre at the UCL Clincial Trials Unit (UCL CTU) in London. Data will be extracted from the notes of babies admitted to the neonatal unit and for all neonatal deaths. It should be noted that not all data fields are collected at every centre. However, where an item is collected these data will be sent to the UCL CTU. The trial is not collecting the reason why continuous EFM is being used, as this is not recorded. All children surviving to be discharged home from hospital following their birth will be &#x02018;flagged&#x02019; at the NHS Information Centre for those born in England and Scotland and all deaths occurring after discharge home from hospital will be notified to the trial co-ordinating centre at the UCL CTU. At 2 years after trial entry a sample of 7000 surviving children (3500 in each group) will be followed up at 2 years of age. This sample will be taken from within the sample recruited during the first 2 years of the project so that follow-up of this group can be completed around the time that the trial stops recruiting. As there seems little possibility that the nature of the effect of the intervention will vary over the duration of trial recruitment, this process will be the most efficient use of resources. For children in the follow-up group, their family will be sent a two part parent-completed questionnaire to assess the child&#x02019;s health, development and well-being. The first part of the questionnaire comprises the PARCA-R, which has been previously validated as a means of assessing neurodevelopment in a trial setting. The second part focuses on general health issues, and has also been used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Major disability at 2 years will be assessed by questionnaires sent to the child&#x02019;s parents and health care professionals. Major disability will be defined according to the criteria set out in the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) and Oxford Regional Health Authority document and will include any major disability in the following domains: neuromotor function, seizures, auditory function, communication, visual function, cognitive function and other physical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Health economics</title><p>A prospective economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial, with the aim of estimating the cost-effectiveness of the intelligent decision-support software. The economic evaluation will be conducted from a health-service perspective. Information on resource utilisation will be collected through the Guardian&#x000ae; system and hospital-patient administration and maternity information systems. Observational research methods may be used to collect additional costs in intrapartum, postpartum or neonatal care. Current UK unit costs will be applied to each resource item to value total resource use in each arm of the trial. A per diem cost for each level of intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal care will be calculated using NHS reference costs where appropriate, or by sending a detailed questionnaire to the finance department of each centre participating in the trial. The unit costs of clinical events that are unique to this trial will be derived from the hospital accounts of the centres participating in the trial, although primary research may also be required. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed and primarily expressed in terms of an incremental cost per poor-perinatal-outcome prevented. The primary outcomes of the trial are likely to have longer-term consequences in terms of health status and health-service utilisation over the mother&#x02019;s and infant&#x02019;s lifetime. Consequently, two long term economic evaluations are planned, which in the first instance will estimate the cost-effectiveness of the decision-support software when surviving children reach 2 years of age, and in the second instance will incorporate the lifetime cost and health consequences of the mother and child. To inform the long-term economic evaluations, a subsample of 700 healthy infants selected within the first year of recruitment and all babies with the primary trial outcome who survive to hospital discharge and agree to follow-up will be followed up until 2 years of age or until the end of the trial, whichever comes first. Economic questionnaires completed when the infant reaches 1 and 2 years of age will document the health and social care use of the child and mother. Cost data collected until hospital discharge and from the parental questionnaires will be combined with the PARCA-R composite score at 2 years of age to inform the incremental cost per disability free life years gained when surviving children reach 2 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Given the potential long-term sequelae, these data will then be used to extrapolate long-term outcomes and costs over the child&#x02019;s lifetime, identifying future health care costs and the health status of mothers and infants from literature as well as the application of decision-analytic or markov methods to synthesise information from different sources. This will require modeling longer-term health-service utilisation from literature and also estimating the potential medico-legal claims that result from adverse events during the intrapartum and neonatal periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Proposed sample size</title><p>The proposed sample size is 46,000 births in total.</p><p>The following data sources and assumptions have been used in the calculation of the trial sample size:</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Incidence of intrapartum stillbirth</title><p>This has been estimated as 0.35 per 1000 births. This estimate is derived from the following incidence data: 0.51 per 1000 for all gestations (England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; 0.27 per 1000 for gestation&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;37&#x000a0;weeks (Trent Region, 2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This trial is restricting eligibility to women over 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation; therefore the incidence will be lower than in women of all gestational ages, which includes those with preterm births. However, it will be higher than for women at term. As women being recruited are all judged to require continuous electronic fetal monitoring it can be assumed that the identification of this &#x0201c;risk group&#x0201d; means that these women are at increased risk of adverse outcomes; therefore the incidence may be higher. In addition these estimates use a denominator of all births which includes women having elective caesarean sections who are not at risk of intrapartum stillbirth as they have no &#x0201c;intrapartum&#x0201d; period. Approximately 7&#x000a0;% of women have elective caesarean section and removal of these women will increase the incidence further. An estimate of 0.35 per 1000 births, therefore, appears reasonable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Incidence of neonatal death</title><p>This has been estimated as 0.7 per 1000 births. This estimate is derived from the following data: 3.4 per 1000 for all gestations (England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; 0.89 per 1000 in those with gestation&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;37&#x000a0;weeks (Trent Region, 2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This trial is restricting eligibility to women 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation or over; therefore the incidence will be lower than amongst women of all gestational ages, which includes those with preterm births. However, it will be higher than for women at term. A reasonable estimate of neonatal death for babies 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation or over is therefore 1.0 per 1000 births. Using data from the Trent Survey 2005, 30&#x000a0;% of neonatal deaths were due to congenital anomalies. Therefore this rate can be reduced to 0.7 per 1000 births. As women being recruited are all judged to require continuous electronic fetal monitoring it can be assumed that the identification of this &#x0201c;risk group&#x0201d; means that these women are at increased risk of adverse outcomes; therefore the incidence may be higher. An estimate of 0.7 per 1000 births, therefore, appears reasonable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Incidence of severe and moderate neonatal encephalopathy</title><p>The best estimate of the incidence of neonatal encephalopathy in babies born 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation or over is 1.3 per 1000 (Trent &#x00026; Northern Region 2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, as above, women being recruited to this trial are all judged to require continuous electronic fetal monitoring which means that they are at increased risk of adverse outcomes; therefore the incidence may be higher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Combined outcomes</title><p>Data are available on some combined outcomes. For example, the incidence of intrapartum stillbirth plus deaths on labour ward assumed to be due to intrapartum asphyxia (the incidence of which is much lower than neonatal mortality) plus severe and moderate neonatal encephalopathy was 1.7 per 1000 (95&#x000a0;% CI: 1.5 to 1.9), range 0.8&#x02013;2.3 (18 hospitals, Trent 2003&#x02013;4) and 1.9 per 1000 (95&#x000a0;% CI: 1.6 to 2.3), range 0.6&#x02013;2.3 (12 hospitals, Yorkshire Neonatal Network 2004&#x02013;5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This was for babies born at 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation or above with the incidence of these outcomes being higher in the larger hospitals, which attract women with more complicated pregnancies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Incidence of primary outcome for INFANT</title><p>We have assumed an incidence of the primary outcome of 3 per 1000 births. This has been calculated by summing the rate of intrapartum stillbirth, neonatal death and moderate and severe encephalopathy which gives an incidence of 2.35 per 1000 births. However, added to this figure is mild encephalopathy, which is reported to occur in 1.25 per 1000 births, and other significant morbidity (other admissions to the neonatal unit within 48&#x000a0;h of birth for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;48&#x000a0;h e.g. feeding difficulties, respiratory symptoms, seizures), for which there are no good estimates of incidence. This estimate of 3 per 1000 births errs on the side of caution and an increased incidence of this outcome in the trial will either (a) increase the power of the trial to demonstrate the same effect size, or (b) allow detection of a smaller effect size with the same trial size, or (c) necessitate a smaller trial if the postulated effect size (or larger) is detected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Review of primary outcome</title><p>During the early part of the trial, and with advice from the DMC, the primary outcome definition was refined to ensure it captured babies who were likely to have experienced hypoxia during labour. The component of the primary outcome &#x0201c;<italic>Admission to neonatal unit within 48&#x000a0;h of birth for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;48&#x000a0;h with evidence of feeding difficulties, respiratory illness or encephalopathy (where there is evidence of compromise at birth)</italic>&#x0201d; was initially capturing a range of conditions, many of which were unlikely to be related to hypoxia. As a consequence, a process of reviewing each case which fulfilled this component of the primary outcome was implemented. Neonatal unit discharge summaries are collected for all babies admitted to the neonatal unit within 48&#x000a0;h of birth for more than 48&#x000a0;h. For the purposes of data monitoring during the trial, two members of the co-investigator group reviewed all cases which fulfilled this criteria and using a defined data extraction form, ascribed each case as meeting the primary outcome or not. The data extraction form included key elements of the neonatal course which are most likely to be related to intrapartum hypoxia. The form is not an established or validated list of criteria and the numeric scoring was devised to give some quantification of the severity of elements of the clinical course. A score of 3 or greater was agreed to be evidence that the condition of the baby was likely to be associated with intrapartum hypoxia, acknowledging that there remained uncertainty about this, as there is no absolute measure of intrapartum hypoxia. For the final analysis, all cases meeting the broad primary outcome criteria will be reviewed by an independent panel of neonatologists to repeat this process of ascribing each case (masked to allocation) as fulfilling the definition fo the primary outcome or not. Each case will be reviewed (independently) by at least 2 neonatologists and disagreements will be resolved by discussion by the group of five neonatologists.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Effect size</title><p>The effect size which can be detected with 46,000 women (23,000 in each group), assuming a 5&#x000a0;% level of significance and 90&#x000a0;% power, is a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in poor neonatal outcome rate from 3 to 1.5 per 1000. We have approximated the number of women recruited with the number of infants born, even though women with a twin pregnancy are eligible to join the trial. Approximately 1 in 80 pregnancies are twin pregnancies, however, a proportion of these births will occur before 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation and a large proportion of the term births will be by elective caesarean section. We therefore estimate that fewer than 1&#x000a0;% of all births in the study will be twins. In a study of 164 preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the mean (SD) PARCA-R composite score at 2&#x000a0;years was 80 (SD 33) and the mean Mental Development Index (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) was approximately half a standard deviation below the standardised mean of 100. If we assume that a normal group of term infants would have a PARCA-R composite score half a standard deviation above this sample of preterm infants, then we can estimate a mean (SD) 2&#x000a0;year score of 96 (SD33). Based on this estimate, a follow up sample of size 7000 (3500 per arm) in the INFANT study would have over 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of 3 points in the PARCA-R component score with a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level. The incidence of severe metabolic acidosis (cord-artery pH &#x0003c;7.05) is 10 per 1000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our proposed sample size will therefore enable us to detect a 28&#x000a0;% relative risk reduction in incidence with over 80&#x000a0;% power in those babies who have their cord artery pH measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Assumptions</title><p>Variations in some of the assumptions of incidence will produce marked variations in the required sample size as the overall incidence is so low.

Participants will be analysed in the groups into which they were randomly allocated, regardless of allocation received. All women and babies with available data will be included, except for protocol violations and women randomised in error who did not give consent or who were under 16&#x000a0;years of age. The number (percentage) of babies with the composite primary outcome will be presented for each group, and the risk ratio plus 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. Risk ratios will be estimated using generalised estimating equations (GEE), or a similar method, adjusting for the stratification factors used in the randomisation (centre and singleton/twin pregnancy). This method of analysis will account for the correlation in outcomes between twins and siblings delivered in a subsequent pregnancy during the trial period. A log binomial model will be used in the first instance, but if convergence is not achieved then a log Poisson model will be used with a robust variance estimator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The mean (SD) PARCA-R Composite score will be presented for each group, and the mean difference between groups plus 95&#x000a0;% CI will be calculated and compared using GEE (Gaussian model with identity link).

Non-parametric bootstrap methods will also be used to calculate 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. In the absence of stochastic data for all variables, a series of multi-way sensitivity analyses will be undertaken, to explore the implications of uncertainty on the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

For neonatal outcomes of the small number of babies admitted to the neonatal unit, we will collect data for all of these babies through the research midwives employed by the study in the participating centres. For the rare instances where babies are transferred out of the recruiting hospital to another hospital for specialist care, data will be collected from all the hospitals providing care for that child prior to discharge home or death. At the time of entry to the study all women will be asked for permission for their contact details to be downloaded to the trial co-ordinating centre along with their clinical details from the Guardian&#x000ae; system. Families selected for follow-up at 2&#x000a0;years will be contacted by post 8&#x000a0;weeks after birth and informed that they have been selected for the follow-up study. Contact with families who agree to take part will be maintained during the period between birth and the follow-up assessment by sending a birthday card each year along with a FREEPOST change-of-address card to facilitate communication with UCL CTU about updated contact details.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial management</title><sec id="Sec42"><title>Project timetable and milestones</title><p>The aim is to randomise 46,000 women to the trial over 36&#x000a0;months.

The data will be supplied to the Chair of the DMC as frequently as they request. Meetings of the committee will be arranged periodically, as considered appropriate by the Chair. In the light of interim data, and other evidence from relevant studies (including updated overviews of the relevant randomised controlled trials), the DMC will inform the TSC, if in their view there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate that any part of the protocol under investigation is either clearly indicated or contra-indicated, either for all women or for a particular subgroup of trial participants. A decision to inform the TSC will in part be based on statistical considerations. Appropriate criteria for proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least 3 standard errors in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting, or modifying, such a study prematurely. If this criterion were to be adopted by the DMC, it would have the practical advantage that the exact number of interim analyses would be of little importance, and so no fixed schedule is proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Unless modification or cessation of the protocol is recommended by the DMC, the TSC, collaborators and administrative staff (except those who supply the confidential information) will remain blind to the results of the interim analysis.

All publications using data from this study to undertake original analyses will be submitted to the TSC for review before release. To safeguard the scientific integrity of the trial, data from this study will not be presented in public before the main results are published without the prior consent of the TSC. The success of the trial depends on a large number of midwives and obstetricians. For this reason, chief credit for the results will not be given to the committees or central organisers, but to all who have collaborated and participated in the study. Acknowledgement will include all local co-ordinators and collaborators, members of the trial committees, the Trial Co-ordinating Centre and trial staff. Authorship at the head of the primary results paper will take the form &#x0201c;The INFANT Collaborative Group&#x0201d;. This avoids giving undue prominence to any individual. All contributors to the study will be listed at the end of the report, with their contribution to the study identified. Those responsible for other publications reporting specific aspects of the study may wish to utilise a different authorship model, such as &#x0201c;[name], [name] and [name] on behalf of the INFANT Collaborative Group&#x0201d;. Decisions about authorship of additional papers will be discussed and agreed by the trial investigators and the TSC. The women participating in the trial will be sent a summary of the final results of the study, which will contain a reference to the full paper.

Clinical research in the perinatal period, particularly in relation to new interventions, has the potential to lead to a wide range of unanticipated effects. Thalidomide and diethylstilboestrol are classic examples. Although such effects are most likely with new medicines, we cannot be certain that there will be no long-term consequences of this new technology and that it may become necessary, in the public interest, to undertake long-term follow-up of this cohort of recruited women and children in the future. Any further follow-up will require the necessary approvals before it can go ahead.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Discussion</title><p>This large randomised controlled trial will evaluate whether this intelligent system to support decision making in the management of labour using the cardiotocograph improves perinatal outcome for babies and mothers. By accurately identifying abnormal fetal heart rate patterns associated with perinatal compromise, the system has the potential to refine the use of intrapartum interventions such as emergency caesarean section and instrumental delivery for presumed fetal distress. By correctly identifing the distressed fetus, intervention can be offered in a timely way to improve outcomes, but it may also provide reassurance that the fetus is not compromised and the technology therefore has the potential to decrease unnecessary intervention.</p><p>The results of this trial will have importance for pregnant women and for their health professionals.</p><p>All changes to this protocol are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Document history</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>
