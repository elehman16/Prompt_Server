Standard interventions typically include cognitive and emotional control strategies (e.g. thought replacement, distraction, relaxation) to support weight loss efforts<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However excessive attempts to change or control thoughts, feelings, or bodily sensations, referred to as experiential avoidance<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, is known to contribute to a wide range of mental and chronic health problems<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Consistent with the literature on experiential avoidance, recent studies suggest that cognitive and emotional control-focused strategies could paradoxically make it more difficult for individuals with obesity to cope with food cravings and instead lead to greater caloric consumption<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.

However post-hoc analyses suggested that the acceptance-based approach produced greater weight loss among participants who reported high baseline levels of emotional eating or disinhibition, suggesting a potential target population for acceptance-based interventions.</p><p id="P9">Niemeier and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> recently conducted a new factor analysis of the disinhibition scale of the Eating Inventory<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and found that it was best represented by two factors: internal disinhibition (ID), or the tendency to eat in response to cognitive or emotional cues, and external disinhibition, which is eating in response to environmental cues<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Both lower baseline levels of ID<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and greater reductions in ID early in weight loss treatment<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> predicted better weight loss outcomes at 18-months and 12-months (no effect found for external disinhibition). Niemeier and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> then conducted an open trial assessing the impact of a combined SBT + ACT intervention on weight loss in 21 adults with obesity and high ID. They reported a higher then normal average weight loss of 12.0 kg after 6 months of treatment that was maintained over 3 months. While this study suggested that an ACT-enhanced weight management intervention might be particularly effective for individuals who report high ID, the study was limited by small sample size and lack of a comparison group, necessitating further study.</p><p id="P10">The current study was a randomized controlled trial comparing SBT to an acceptance-based behavioral intervention (ABBI) that combined standard behavioral strategies with techniques from ACT for weight loss in individuals with obesity who report high ID.

The effect of the two interventions was compared using linear and nonlinear mixed models. As a first step, unconditional models were used to determine whether a linear or nonlinear trend best fit the longitudinal trajectory of the outcomes (nonlinear was a better fit for the full study weight analysis, linear was better for all other analyses), and to evaluate the variance components associated with the slope of time to determine assignment as fixed versus random effects (intercepts and slopes were treated as random effects in all models). In a second step, treatment condition and the interaction between treatment condition and the slope of time were added to the conditional model in order to account for variability in the trajectory of outcomes. The unit of time was represented as months from baseline. All significance tests were two-tailed, with alpha set to .05. Estimated marginal means and standard errors for changes in study variables were calculated using the linear mixed modeling procedure described above.

We also calculated the proportion of participants achieving clinically meaningful weight losses of at least 5 and 10% of initial body weight at the end of treatment (12 months) and the final assessment (24 months).

Overall there were no significant differences in mean weight loss between groups at 24 months. This result is consistent with the only other randomized trial comparing an acceptance-based intervention with a standard behavioral intervention<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Secondary analyses, however, demonstrated that participants in the ABBI group regained significantly less weight during the post-treatment phase compared to those in the SBT condition. In addition, a higher proportion of ABBI participants achieved clinically meaningful weight losses of &#x0003e;5% at 24 months. Taken together, results suggest that ABBI had a positive impact on weight outcomes by reducing the magnitude of weight regain after treatment ended. These results are consistent with a previous randomized trial that showed improved weight loss maintenance for individuals receiving an acceptance-based intervention<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">It appeared that the differential impact of ABBI was strongest between 18&#x02013;24 months, well after treatment ended. Previous studies testing methods from ACT have demonstrated between group differences that occur after treatment had been discontinued. For example, Gifford and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> found no differences in smoking cessation quit rates between ACT and nicotine replacement therapy at post-treatment; however there were significant differences at both 6 and 12 months after treatment ended, with the percentage of ACT participants quitting increasing during the final follow up assessment period. Current ACT theory suggests that successful ACT increases psychological flexibility, or the ability to take action consistent with one&#x02019;s values in the face of difficult cognitive and emotional barriers. This functionally based skill set should help participants meet new challenges without interventionist assistance. The results of the current study are consistent with ACT theory and are encouraging given that weight regain after treatment termination continues to be the biggest problem with behavioral weight loss interventions. However it should be noted that, on average, the ABBI group still regained a significant amount of weight during the post-treatment phase.</p><p id="P33">In a prior study<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, post hoc analyses suggested that the beneficial effects of ACT might be most apparent in those with high emotional eating or high disinhibition. Given that participants in the current study were selected for high ID, it cannot be determined whether ABBI was particularly beneficial for this subgroup. However, the trend for better maintenance of weight loss in ABBI occurred within this subgroup. Moreover, both ABBI and SBT led to significant reductions in ID, with no significant difference between the two approaches. The changes observed in ID were consistent with a previous open trial testing an acceptance-based intervention, which found significant mean reductions in ID after a 3 month intervention (&#x02212;2.6) and at 6 months (&#x02212;2.1)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The correlation pattern in the current study indicated that changes in ID were related to changes in weight in both groups during treatment. However after treatment was discontinued changes in ID were related to weight change only in the ABBI group.</p><p id="P34">The results of this trial point to gaps in our current understanding of the potential role of acceptance-based strategies in weight management. In the current study and a previous randomized controlled trial, acceptance-based strategies did not improve weight loss during treatment. It is possible that these strategies do not add utility in the weight loss phase, or perhaps that they are weakly targeted when integrated with an already demanding core of strategies found in standard behavioral interventions. Another possibility is that structural aspects of the study limited the impact of ABBI. The average group size in the current study was larger than typical ACT intervention studies, while the session length was shorter<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. ACT experiential exercises and metaphors are interactive and build on each other, and it is possible that a traditional weight loss intervention structure does not allow for adequate time to cover content and adequately engage all group members. Despite these potential conflicts, acceptance-based strategies seem to have the potential to improve weight loss maintenance. Perhaps a targeted weight loss maintenance program, focusing solely on acceptance-based strategies and administered after an initial weight loss intervention, might have a greater impact on long-term outcomes. Future research is needed to explore this possibility.</p><p id="P35">This study had many strengths, including a randomized design, a gold standard comparison group, objective measurement of weight, blinded assessors, and the recruitment of a sample of individuals who typically demonstrate poor response to treatment. This study targeted perhaps the biggest problem in behavioral weight loss, long-term maintenance, and tested a novel intervention incorporating innovative acceptance-based strategies that theoretically target barriers to maintenance.</p><p id="P36">The study also had limitations. The sample was primarily middle-aged, Caucasian women, limiting the generalizability of the findings. In addition, ID was assessed via a self-report measure, which was subject to the same potential biases as all self-report measures. It is unknown whether ID would decrease over time (regression to the mean) in the absence of any treatment. Although the training of therapist pairs was standardized, the study did not include an assessment of therapist skill. Finally, treatment fidelity focused only on interventionist adherence to the protocol and did not assess other aspects of treatment fidelity.</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, the results of the current study suggested that an intervention combining acceptance-based strategies with standard behavioral strategies might benefit individuals who report high ID by reducing the rate of weight regain after treatment is discontinued. Both standard behavioral and acceptance-based approaches appeared effective at reducing ID. Future research needs to replicate this finding, examine the mechanisms of change, and further explore the most effective use of acceptance-based strategies for improving weight control.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01DK087704).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN2"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold>: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p><bold>Registration:</bold>
