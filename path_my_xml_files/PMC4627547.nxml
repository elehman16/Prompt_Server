The present randomized, phase&#x000a0;III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 24-week study evaluated the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, as monotherapy in Asian patients with inadequately controlled type&#x000a0;2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Patients who were treatment na&#x000ef;ve or had been treated with one oral antidiabetes drug were randomized to either linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg daily or a placebo after washout. The primary end-point was a change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin after 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 300 Asian (87% Chinese) patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to linagliptin or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. After 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, adjusted mean (standard error) glycated hemoglobin decreased by a placebo-corrected &#x02212;0.50&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.11 (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). In patients with baseline glycated hemoglobin &#x02265;8.5%, the placebo-corrected decrease in glycated hemoglobin was &#x02212;0.91&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.20% (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Adverse events occurred in 28.0 and 28.3% of linagliptin and placebo patients, respectively, but few were drug-related (3.0 and 2.0%, respectively). Hypoglycemia was reported by one linagliptin patient and no placebo patients.

In Asian patients, type&#x000a0;2 diabetes occurs at a younger age with relatively low body mass index (BMI), and also with a lower risk threshold for complications than in Western populations<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. In East Asia, these factors are compounded by an increased risk for renal complications<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>Several treatment options are available to manage hyperglycemia in patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. However, some of the most common glucose-lowering drugs have important contraindications for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (e.g., metformin and sulfonylureas), carry risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain (e.g., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones and insulin), or have the potential for gastrointestinal side-effects (e.g., metformin and &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors).</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors promote insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner by prolonging the half-life of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). In addition, DPP-4 inhibitors might improve regulation of glucagon secretion from pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells. Linagliptin is a potent, highly reversible binding to protein and selective DPP-4 inhibitor with a predominantly non-renal elimination, enabling it to be prescribed in a single 5-mg once-daily dose to patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes without dose change regardless of renal and liver function<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>In multinational phase&#x000a0;III clinical trials that included Asian as well as Western patients, linagliptin reduced hyperglycemia without showing an increased propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycemic events when used as a monotherapy or with other oral glucose-lowering drugs<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In a pooled subgroup analysis of these studies, linagliptin was shown to be an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for South and East Asian patients with inadequately controlled type&#x000a0;2 diabetes<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. A subgroup analysis of a phase&#x000a0;III trial of linagliptin added to metformin and a sulfonylurea showed that the combination was efficacious and well tolerated by Chinese patients<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>The present trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg given once daily as monotherapy in Asian (mainly Chinese) patients with inadequately controlled type&#x000a0;2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Overview</title><p>The present study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase&#x000a0;III clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, no. NCT01214239). Monotherapy with linagliptin was evaluated over 24&#x000a0;weeks after a 4-week washout of any prior antidiabetes drugs and a 2-week placebo run-in period.</p><p>The trial was carried out in compliance with the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. All participants gave written consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>The trial recruited patients in China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Men and women aged 18&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years with insufficiently controlled type&#x000a0;2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA<sub>1c</sub>] between 7.0 and 10.0%) and BMI &#x02264;45&#x000a0;kg/mg<sup>2</sup>, who had received no prior antidiabetes drugs or who had been treated with one antidiabetes drug, were eligible for participation in the present trial. Antidiabetes therapy had to be unchanged for 6&#x000a0;weeks before informed consent. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had experienced a myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack &#x02264;6&#x000a0;months before informed consent; if they had unstable or acute congestive heart failure; if they had impaired hepatic function (liver function tests &#x0003e;3 times the upper limit of normal); if they had confirmed hyperglycemia &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;mg/dL after an overnight fast during the wash-out/placebo run-in period; if they had been treated with a thiazolidinedione, GLP-1 analog, DPP-4 inhibitor, insulin or anti-obesity drug &#x02264;3&#x000a0;months before informed consent; or were treated with systemic steroids at the date of informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a two-to-one ratio to oral once-daily treatment with either linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg daily or placebo. The randomization was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the beginning of the placebo run-in period (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8.5% or &#x02265;8.5%) and by prior use of antidiabetes drugs (none or monotherapy). Patient assignments were determined by a computer-generated, pseudo-random sequence using an interactive voice response system. Access to the randomization code was restricted to dedicated randomization personnel, and the study was blinded until after the database was locked.</p><p>The use of metformin as rescue medication was allowed during the randomized period of this trial. During the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, rescue medication could be initiated with a confirmed glucose level &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;mg/dL after an overnight fast. During the last 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, rescue medication could be initiated with a confirmed glucose level &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mg/dL after an overnight fast or a random &#x0003e;400&#x000a0;mg/dL. If a patient's fasted glucose levels remained &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;mg/dL during the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment or &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mg/dL during the last 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment despite metformin rescue, he or she was withdrawn from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>End-Points</title><p>Efficacy was primarily assessed by change from baseline in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 24&#x000a0;weeks. The secondary end-points were change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the subset of Chinese patients, occurrence of target efficacy responses (&#x0003c;7.0% or &#x0003c;6.5%) and a relative efficacy response (&#x02212;0.5%), HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction from baseline over time, change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and change from baseline in FPG over time. In addition, HbA<sub>1c</sub> change was compared in patients with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8.5% vs &#x02265;8.5%, and changes in lipid profiles were evaluated as efficacy end-points.</p><p>Safety was evaluated by the incidence and intensity of adverse events (AEs) including hypoglycemia. Serious AEs were defined as events that resulted in death or were immediately life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability, required or prolonged patient hospitalization, led to congenital anomalies or birth defect or were considered to be an important medical event that might have jeopardized the patient and required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes.</p><p>Hypoglycemia was classified by investigators as asymptomatic with glucose concentration &#x02264;70&#x000a0;mg/dL, documented symptomatic with glucose concentration of 54&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mg/dL, documented symptomatic with glucose concentration &#x0003c;54&#x000a0;mg/dL but no need for external assistance, and severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions.</p><p>An independent external clinical event committee (CEC) reviewed in a blinded fashion all fatal events and events suspected of being either stroke or cardiac ischemia. The CEC evaluated whether prespecified criteria for the adjudication end-points (non-fatal myocardial infarction, other myocardial ischemia, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiovascular death) were met.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A total of 231 patients were determined to be sufficient to detect a between-group difference of 0.5% in change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 90% power (two-sided, &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05; standard deviation assumed 1.1%).</p><p>The primary evaluation of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week&#x000a0;24 used an analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a linear covariate, and prior use of antidiabetes drugs and treatment as fixed classification effects. The primary evaluation was carried out on the full analysis set, which included all randomized patients who received one or more doses of the study drug, and had a baseline and one or more on-treatment HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurement. Missing values were imputed using last observation carried forward. Categorical HbA<sub>1c</sub> responses were assessed without imputation of missing data by assuming that patients with missing values had failed to achieve the response. Changes in FPG were assessed for the full analysis set using <sc>ancova</sc> with last observation carried forward (the model included continuous baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, continuous baseline FPG, prior antidiabetes drugs and treatment). Efficacy was additionally assessed by changes in lipid profiles, and bodyweight and composition. Safety data were analyzed descriptively for the treated set, which consisted of all randomized patients who received one or more doses of the study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The trial was carried out between 11 November 2010 and 24 May 2012.

Linagliptin achieved clinically relevant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and without weight increase. The drug was well tolerated with no instances of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer or congestive heart failure (CHF). After the publication of the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus &#x02013; Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53)<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin vs Standard of Care (EXAMINE)<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> trials, concerns regarding CHF have been raised due to the finding of a statistically significant increase in risk of hospitalization for CHF associated with saxagliptin therapy in SAVOR-TIMI 53, and a non-significant hazard ratio for alogliptin of above 1.0 in EXAMINE. Thus, it is reassuring to note that no cases of CHF were reported in the present study, although patient numbers were small. A more definitive answer on the CV safety profile of linagliptin will be provided by the CARdiovascular Outcome Study of LINAgliptin vs Glimerpiride in Patients with Type&#x000a0;2 Diabetes (CAROLINA&#x000ae;)<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, expected to report between 2017 and 2018.</p><p>The results of the present trial are in accordance with those of another international phase&#x000a0;III trial with linagliptin monotherapy in a mixed population of Asian and White patients<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In that trial, patients treated with linagliptin monotherapy achieved a placebo-corrected mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard error change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02212;0.69&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.08% (95% CI &#x02212;0.85, &#x02212;0.53; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). In addition, a pooled analysis of Asian patient data from the present study and other studies using linagliptin added to other treatments showed a placebo-corrected reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x02212;0.79&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.06% (95% CI &#x02212;0.92, &#x02212;0.67; <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0001) with linagliptin and a safety profile similar to placebo<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>In the present trial, HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction &#x02265;0.5% was observed in nearly one half of the patients in the placebo group, which represents a strong placebo effect. Similar placebo effects in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve Asian (predominantly Chinese) patients have been reported<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Thus, for Asian patients with inadequately controlled type&#x000a0;2 diabetes, initial monotherapy with linagliptin could provide an alternative to initial metformin, which is recommended as first-line therapy in international treatment guidelines<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, metformin has multiple contraindications, including for some stages of chronic kidney disease depending on creatinine clearance. Although the present study enrolled patients who were in the early stages of type&#x000a0;2 diabetes, nearly 40% of the participants had some degree of renal impairment. This finding is consistent with observations of early-stage renal complications in Asian type&#x000a0;2 diabetes populations<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, and could underscore the need for alternatives to metformin as first-line therapy. Linagliptin can be used without dose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Among Asian populations, metformin might also be under-dosed to offset gastrointestinal tolerability issues. In a study carried out in Japanese patients comparing linagliptin once daily with metformin (once to three times daily) as add-on to a sulfonylurea or an &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor, comparable or lower incidence of AEs was observed with linagliptin<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The mean doses of metformin were 653.23&#x000a0;mg/day and 709.02&#x000a0;mg/day in the sulfonylurea and &#x003b1;-glucosidase groups, respectively.</p><p>The mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitors, such as linagliptin, addresses challenges endemic to Asian type&#x000a0;2 diabetes populations. Specifically, carbohydrate-rich diets causing elevation of post-prandial glucose (PPG) and glycemic variability are seen as a key factor in Asians, and DPP-4 inhibitors primarily affect control of PPG excursions. Although this trial did not include meal tolerance testing, statistically significant reductions in 2-h PPG with linagliptin have been shown in a population of Asian patients pooled from four phase&#x000a0;III trials. In that analysis, linagliptin reduced PPG by a placebo-corrected &#x02013;56.9&#x000a0;mg/dL (95% CI &#x02013;85.17, &#x02013;28.52)<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>This trial has some important limitations. The evaluation period of 24&#x000a0;weeks is relatively short to assess the safety of long-term use of linagliptin, and the trial was not powered to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Homeostatic model assessments of &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin resistance were not carried out in this study, although they were included in previous trials<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. These evaluations showed enhanced &#x003b2;-cell function with linagliptin. The extent to which the studied population is representative of patients in Asia as a whole might also be considered a potential limitation. Nevertheless, the data reported here are consistent with previous studies in Asian populations, which have shown the safety and efficacy of linagliptin as monotherapy in Japanese patients<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and when added to metformin plus sulfonylurea in Chinese patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>In summary, these results show that linagliptin monotherapy was efficacious and well tolerated over 24&#x000a0;weeks in Asian patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes who were treatment na&#x000ef;ve or had been previously treated with one oral antidiabetes drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim, Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co.
