Endodontic treatment includes removal of vital and necrotic tissues from the root canal system, along with infected root dentine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Finally, the root canal must be cleaned, shaped and obturated accurately for a successful outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The smear layer created during root canal instrumentation should be removed from the dentine surface of the canal wall and dentine tubules. This is because the smear prevents medicaments from penetrating dentinal tubules.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] On the other hand, complete removal of the smear layer improves the adaptation of filling materials to the root canal,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] while reducing apical and coronal microleakage of the root canal sealant materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Success of the smear layer removal depends on the instrumentation techniques employed and irrigation solvents used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Sodium hypochlorite solution has been the commonly used irrigant, especially due to its effective antibacterial properties and its excellent action as an organic material solvent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The use of only one irrigant is not sufficient to achieve smear layer removal. Many reports have demonstrated the decalcifying capacity of agents such as 10-17% EDTA,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] 17% ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] MTAD [mixture of tetracycline isomer (doxycycline), an acid (citric acid), and a detergent (Tween 80)],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] sodium hypochlorite, citric acid,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] 7% maleic acid,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] 9% and 18% HEBP (etidronic acid)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] These agents bring about the removal of inorganic components and debris from the instrumented canals. The decalcifying efficacy of these acidic and chelating agents depends on the root length, application time, diffusion in the dentine and solution pH.R Sudha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] had obtained optimum results with EDTA at a pH of 9 with 10% concentration and application for 1 minute. The use of a neutral pH of around 7.3 is recommended for EDTA solutions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there are a number of techniques available for root canal instrumentation. Ultrasonic and manual instrumentation in combination with various irrigating solutions enhance smear layer removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Moreover, Abbott <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] reported that NaOCl in combination with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid plus Cetavlon (EDTAC) produced clean canal walls; however, use of ultrasonic instruments did not enhance the cleaning action of the respective solutions. Ahmad[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] in his comparative study between manual and ultrasonic instrumentation techniques indicated a quantitative difference between the two. In fact, manual instrumentation and irrigation with 2.5% NaOCl demonstrated a lesser amount of smear deposition in the apical thirds of the root canal. Brannstrom[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] provided data on the effectiveness of sonic and ultrasonic preparation of the root canals including the advantages of manual shaping of the root canal system. Passive ultrasonic instrumentation combined with syringe irrigation with 1% NaOCl are capable of significantly removing the artificially placed dentine debris from simulated root canals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Yamashita[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] performed a scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis for evaluating the cleanliness of the root canal systems, following their irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% NaOCl and a combination of 2.5% NaOCl and EDTA. They conclusively reported the inferiority of all cleaning, shaping and irrigation techniques in achieving complete smear layer removal, especially at the apical thirds of the root canal systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty freshly extracted single rooted human teeth (<italic>n</italic>=60) stored in 0.5% saline solution were used as a study material. They were mainly upper incisors and mandibular premolars (teeth with single root canal), which were extracted due to their poor periodontal prognosis and orthodontic indications. The periodontal soft tissues were removed, followed by crown separation at the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) using high-speed fissure burs (Bien-Air, Bienne, Switzerland) under water spray. All the teeth were randomly divided into three groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of samples of teeth depending on instrumentation technique and irrigation protocol in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-15-118-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Group I was manually instrumented, while Group II was sonically and Group III was ultrasonically instrumented. The control groups were irrigated with saline solution. Group I was divided into subgroups, according to the irrigation protocol followed, as elaborated: I.1. irrigated with saline solution (Control Group); I.2. irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl (ADD Vision, Germany); I.3. Irrigated with 17% EDTA (Calcinase, LegeArtisPharmaDettenhausen, Germany); and, I.4. Irrigated with a combination of 17% EDTA and 5,25% NaOCl solutions. Group II was sonically instrumented and divided into the following subgroups: II.1. Irrigated with saline solution; II.2. Irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl; II.3. Irrigated with 17% EDTA; and, II.4. Irrigated with 17% EDTA and 5.25% NaOCl solutions.</p><p>Group III was ultrasonically instrumented and divided into the following subgroups: III.1. Irrigated with saline solution; III.2. Irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl; III.3. Irrigated with 17% EDTA; and, III.4. Irrigated with 17% EDTA and 5,25% NaOCl solutions. Pulp tissue was removed using a barbed broach (Dentsply, Tulsa, USA). Manual instrumentation of the root canal systems was performed using K-type Flex files (Kerr Mfg. Co., Romulus, Michigan, USA). Working lengths were established at 0.5 mm short of the anatomical apex by visually identifying #10 K-file at the apical foramina. The roots were instrumented up to #45 K-file (according to the canal volume) using a step-back preparation technique followed by irrigation with 2.0 ml of the irrigating solution at each change of instrument. The canals were irrigated with EDTA for 20-30 seconds and with sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute. Sonic-air instrumentation was performed with SONIC AIR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> MM 1500 (Micro-Mega, Besan&#x000e7;on, France), with subsonic vibration frequency 1500-3000 Hz at an optimal amplitude of oscillation of 0.5 mm. Initial instrumentation was performed with a K-file #8, #10 or #15 depending on the canal volume, and continued with Rispi-Sonic file size 1-3 for apical third of the root canal, with vertical movement of 2-3 mm of the file. The middle and coronal third was instrumented with Shaper-Sonic file #15 to #40 with up-down movement of 3-5 mm of the file. Ultrasonic instrumentation was performed with Enac-3 EM-OSADA (Enac-3 EM-OSADA, Tokyo, Japan), that produces ultrasonic vibration with a frequency of over 20.000 Hz. The power adjustment of the unit was set at level 3.</p><p>Initial instrumentation (scouting) was performed with a K-file #8 or #10, depending on the canal volume. The ultrasonic file, connected to the handpiece, was placed in the canal to the measured length. Upon activation, the file was moved passively in up-down motion to ensure it did not bind to the root canal walls. The energized ultrasonic file was used continuously for 20-30 seconds. For each consecutive file, irrigation with 17% EDTA for 20-30 seconds and with sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, was carried out. Irrigation solutions were delivered via a 10 mL syringe, at a rate of 15 mL for each canal. According to this protocol, samples of subgroup II.4.(combination of 17% EDTA and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite) were irrigated as follows: Each irrigation with EDTA was followed with equal amount of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and final irrigation was done with 2 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution.</p><p>Twenty teeth were used for each individual instrumentation technique. Irrigating solutions were delivered via a 23 gauge needle (Romed<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Holland, CH Wilnis, NL) inserted into the canal without binding into the walls. After adhering to the above established instrumentation and irrigation protocols of the respective teeth, the canals were rinsed with 2 mL saline solution to avoid long-term action of the respective irrigation solutions. All teeth were dried with paper points (Dentsply, Maillefer, Switzerland) and split along the long axis in the bucco-lingual direction to expose the entire extent of the root canal.</p><p>The resulting specimens were prepared for Scanning Electron Microscopy JEOL JSM-6335F (Tokyo, Japan) study. The blocks of teeth were cut with the ISOMET 11-1180 Low Speed SAW at the predetermined coronal, middle and the apical thirds.</p><p>The cut samples were fixed in metallic blocks and put on the Sputter Coater S150 B EDWARDS for impregnation in gold (Au) at 10 mbar pressure. Internal parts of the root canal systems were specially microfilmed. After scanning and observing each third with the microscope, an image of the most representative area of that third was taken. Three pictures were obtained from each tooth, one for each third, to give a total of 180 pictures. The images were analyzed for the amount of smear layer, scored as: 1=no smear layer; 2=few areas covered by smear layer with many dentinal tubule openings visible; 3=most areas covered by smear layer, with few dentinal tubule openings visible; 4=all areas covered by smear layer, no dentinal tubule openings visible; 5=heavy, non-homogeneous smear layer covering the complete root canal wall. Statistical analysis was performed using Friedman's test to find if there was any difference in the effectiveness of instrumentation on removal of smear layer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The level of smear layer remaining in each third, between different instrumentation techniques and irrigation protocol was as follows:</p><p>In the control group, manually, sonically or ultrasonically instrumented and irrigated with saline solution, there were no differences between the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. <italic>Control Groups</italic> (<italic>I.1., II.1. and III.1</italic>.) produced a heterogeneous smear layer (score 5, with no differences between instrumentation technique) that coated the root canal walls.
