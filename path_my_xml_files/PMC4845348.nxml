It is one of the most common reasons for referral to a rheumatologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The cost of CWP is high in terms of both individual, societal and health costs: for example, in the United States, mean per-patient costs (including pain and non&#x02013;pain-related medication, physician consultations, tests and procedures, and emergency department visits) in the 6&#x000a0;months following a new diagnosis of fibromyalgia have been reported as $3481, comparable to patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] but resulting in worse quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend pharmacological, physical, and psychological therapies although the importance attributed to individual therapies is inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is good evidence for musculoskeletal pain conditions generally that the longer the duration of symptoms, the less likely that symptoms are to improve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], including with specific interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is particularly so for CWP which, once developed, is challenging to manage and effect improvement.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1037_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for patients with fibromyalgia concluded that CBT improves coping with pain, reduces depressed mood and healthcare-seeking behaviour in such patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The delivery of CBT by telephone has been shown to be effective, acceptable and accessible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The MUSICIAN study, which we have recently concluded, tested telephone-delivered CBT (tCBT) and/or exercise for patients with chronic widespread pain consulting to their GP (using a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design). Three months after the end of therapy, both interventions resulted in significantly better primary outcome measures (patient global health) than treatment as usual (tCBT 33&#x000a0;% of participants with positive outcome, exercise 24&#x000a0;%, treatment as usual 8&#x000a0;%), but there was no significant additional benefit of receiving both interventions (combined 37&#x000a0;%). Recent analyses have demonstrated these benefits are maintained 2&#x000a0;years after the end of therapy (tCBT 35&#x000a0;% with positive outcome, exercise 29&#x000a0;%, combined 31&#x000a0;%, treatment as usual 13&#x000a0;%), and that tCBT is highly cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>We have conducted a comprehensive literature review with the aim of identifying randomised trials which had the aim of preventing the onset either of CWP or fibromyalgia. This review did not identify any such published trials. Further, a search of 11 international clinical trials registers/databases (including US, UK, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, Japan), undertaken in Autumn 2013 did not identify any ongoing trial with the aim of preventing the onset of CWP (or fibromyalgia). There are several reasons why it may be desirable to try to prevent CWP onset, namely that the majority of CWP patients do not have important symptom improvement with current management (even within trials). Prediction models from epidemiological studies have been developed to identify &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; patients, which makes such an approach feasible. Research using the General Practice Research Database has demonstrated that prior to receiving a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in primary care, persons have a long-term prior history of consultation with symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although this will be the first prevention trial in this area, the concept of prevention using CBT has been addressed in musculoskeletal disorders with respect to intervention in neck pain and low back pain before people become patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and in mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>We have conducted prospective epidemiological studies which have demonstrated that it is possible to identify &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; groups. In the first study, a high risk group for CWP onset was identified on the basis of two factors: somatic awareness (using the Somatic Symptom Scale) and illness behaviour (using the Illness Behaviour Score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This was replicated in a second study conducted by the applicants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These &#x0201c;aetiological models&#x0201d; excluded pain and therefore we have re-analysed data from the latter study (also considering pain status) to identify the best predictors of onset and which results in a model more suitable for use in prevention studies. The resulting &#x0201c;at risk model&#x0201d; requires regional pain and two of the following: maladaptive behavioural response to illness (Illness Behaviour score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4), a high number of somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2) and sleep disturbance (Sleep Problem Scale Score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4). In the second &#x0201c;validation&#x0201d; study, from a population of 2,374 persons without CWP, 653 satisfied the definition of &#x0201c;high-risk of CWP&#x0201d; of whom 139 had developed CWP twelve months later (that is a Positive Predictive value of 21.3&#x000a0;%). Amongst persons not deemed to be at high risk (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1721), 77 developed CWP which is a Negative Predictive Value of 95.5&#x000a0;%.</p><p>An Arthritis Research UK report on fibromyalgia/CWP, based on a think-tank held in July 2012, identified prevention as a research priority. We have previously shown short and long-term effectiveness of tCBT for CWP (compared to usual care), in an Arthritis Research UK funded study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Specifically this demonstrated sustained improvement in patient global assessment of change, reduced psychological distress, fear of movement and reliance on passive coping styles. Secondly we have developed and refined statistical models which identify persons at high risk for the future development of CWP. We therefore now propose a study to test whether tCBT can reduce the risk of CWP onset amongst those at high risk.</p><p>We will test the hypothesis that among patients who report regional pain for which they have already sought a consultation in primary care, and who are identified as high risk of developing chronic widespread pain, a short course of telephone-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (tCBT) reduces the onset of CWP. We will further determine the cost-effectiveness of such a preventative intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study will be a two-arm randomised controlled trial testing a course of tCBT against usual care among patients identified at high-risk developing CWP&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p>We will mail a randomly selected sample of adults aged 25&#x000a0;years and over registered with participating general practices in the study areas (NHS Grampian, NHS Highland, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde). We will require the involvement of 7 or 8 general practices. The Scottish Primary Care Research Network (SPCRN) will be involved in recruitment of patients to this study from primary care. SPCRN staff will undertake searches of GPs electronic databases to identify a random sample of potentially eligible patients. Screening survey questionnaires will then be sent out by Health Informatics Centre Services in Dundee on behalf of the practice. Patients will return completed survey questionnaires to the research team at the University of Aberdeen where they will be assessed for eligibility and sent letters inviting them to the trial if eligible.</p><p>The &#x0201c;screening questionnaire&#x0201d; will determine whether the patient a) meets the study eligibility criteria and b) would be willing to be contacted again regarding a treatment trial for &#x0201c;musculoskeletal health&#x0201d;.

Once a patient has returned a signed consent form and best-time-to-call slip, a member of the research team will phone them. The researcher will read out from a script giving information about the study, and the patient will have the opportunity then to ask questions about the study. If the patient consents to participate they will be recruited to the study and randomised to one of the arms of the trial. (It is only at this point that the participant is considered to have given informed consent).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After consent has been given to participate in the study, during the call with the participant, the researcher will contact the Trial randomisation centre at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials at the University of Aberdeen, using the internet or by telephone. This service is available 24&#x000a0;h a day. Using a computer randomisation program, subjects will be randomly allocated into one of the two treatment groups, stratified in blocks by one predictor of outcome i.e. the number of non-pain &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; factors they report (2 or 3) since this is related to the risk of CWP onset, and GP Practice. Subjects will be notified of the outcome of allocation (i.e. to which treatment group they have been assigned) during the consent/randomisation phone-call. If allocated to the active intervention, the participant will receive a phone call from a therapist to arrange an initial appointment. We will confirm the allocation to treatment arm in a letter to the participant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow up</title><p>Follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to participants at 3, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after the treatment start date (for participants in the active treatment group) or dummy treatment start date (for those in usual care). The dummy treatment start date will be based on the treatment start date of the last participant to be assigned to active treatment. Instruments included in the follow-up questionnaires will be the same as in the screening survey questionnaire. Additionally, follow-up questionnaires will include the Patient Global Impression of Change (7-item scale from &#x0201c;very much worse&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very much better&#x0201d;), and questions on health care usage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>The CBT intervention, delivered by telephone, will consist of an initial assessment (45&#x02013;60 min), 6 weekly sessions (each 30&#x02013;45 min) over six weeks, and then booster sessions at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. The intervention will be delivered by therapists trained for the study and accredited by the British Association for Behaviour and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Participants will be supported by a self-management CBT manual refined from the manual we developed for the MUSICIAN study where it was successfully used with demonstrable patient benefit.</p><p>There will be a patient-centred assessment by the therapist for problem identification, risk assessment and development of a shared formulation of the current health problem. The sessions will involve education about musculoskeletal pain (all persons will have recently consulted to primary care with regional pain), somatic symptoms and specific CBT techniques such as pacing of activity, behavioural activation, diary keeping, identifying and challenging negative and unhelpful thinking patterns and the development of a longer term management plan. Participants&#x02019; self-management manuals will include agreed collaborative goals for the therapist and patient to work towards, diaries, and some exercises to complete after specific sessions.</p><p>Therapists delivering the intervention will receive a 2&#x000a0;day training programme conducted by the investigators. Therapists will be supervised two weekly throughout the trial period by members of the trial team. Patient adherence will be examined through collecting data on number of telephone consultations conducted and evaluation of the use of CBT techniques through exercises contained in the manual.</p><p>The group allocated to usual care will receive no additional intervention &#x02013; this will reflect the fact there is no specific intervention provided to patients currently for the prevention of CWP. They will receive usual care and there will be no restriction on what this can involve. CBT within the NHS is generally restricted to persons who have developed specific conditions rather than persons at risk of those conditions. We will however monitor care received, outwith the trial, in all participating subjects, and health care usage will be recorded in follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patient safety</title><p>There are unlikely to be major safety issues in terms of delivery of the CBT. However, if the therapists delivering CBT have any concerns, one of the investigators will be available to assess these. There will be a standard template for reporting concerns and recording of any action recommended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Withdrawal</title><p>Participants will have the option to withdraw from the treatment or the study at any time. Those withdrawing from the treatment will continue to be sent follow-up questionnaires unless they specifically request not to receive them. Failure of any participant to complete a follow-up questionnaire at any particular time-point will not be counted as a withdrawal unless the participant requests not to receive any further follow-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical issues</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size</title><p>Our previous longitudinal study of onset of CWP (and subsequent replication) has suggested that 21&#x000a0;% of &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; persons identified will develop CWP over the course of the next twelve months. Our previous data is based on persons with pain and at least 2 out of 3 other &#x0201c;risk factors&#x0201d;. There are no published studies of prevention of CWP on which to base our measure of effect. However in the MUSICIAN study some subjects, although reporting CWP at the screening survey, no longer had CWP at the enrolment interview. They were however still eligible to take part, provided they had regional pain. Therefore those subjects with regional pain provide a sub-population on which to base the likely effects of the tCBT. Amongst such subjects, those who received tCBT had a reduced odds of having CWP at the end of the study OR 0.5 95&#x000a0;% CI (0.2&#x02013;1.4) compared to those in usual care.</p><p>Thus the study is powered on the ability of the current study to reduce the onset of CWP from 21&#x000a0;% to 12&#x000a0;%, with 90&#x000a0;% power and a 5&#x000a0;% significance level. We further assume, based on prior data, that 75&#x000a0;% of persons allocated to the tCBT arm will be adherent to the intervention, and that 80&#x000a0;% of all subjects will return the follow-up questionnaires to assess outcome.</p><p>Accordingly we require 473 subjects per arm that is a total of 946 subjects recruited. In MUSICIAN exactly 50&#x000a0;% of those found eligible and willing to consider taking part ultimately were randomised. A previous trial of a cognitive-behavioural intervention to prevent chronic pain found that 36&#x000a0;% of patients identified as eligible were recruited to the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If 80&#x000a0;% of eligible patients agreed to be contacted about taking part, this equates to 45&#x000a0;% of those eligible and willing to consider taking part being randomised - higher numbers for a clinical trial of CWP reflect the fact that this is a prevention trial rather than a treatment trial and may be less attractive to potential participants. Thus we aim to find a total of 2102 subjects who are eligible and willing to consider taking part. Assuming a participation rate to the survey of 30&#x000a0;%, that 1 in 4 people will be &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d;, and (using data from MUSICIAN) that 80&#x000a0;% of people who return a questionnaire agree to consider taking part, we require to survey 35 037 persons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A pre-defined statistical analysis plan will be developed and signed off by the trial steering committee before undertaking any data analysis. Comparison between arms will be on an intention-to-treat basis (main analysis) with a per protocol sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Characteristics of the study participants in the two treatment arms will be described using simple summary statistics. Descriptive statistics will include mean and standard deviation for normally distributed continuous data, median and inter-quartile range for skewed continuous data and count and percentage for categorical data. No formal statistical comparisons will be made between baseline characteristics. Primary and secondary outcomes will be described at the three follow-up times: 3, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months, using appropriate summary statistics. The primary outcome is the between arm difference in the proportions of people developing CWP from baseline to follow-up. This comparison will be made using simple chi-squared tests at each follow-up time. Appropriate adjustment will be made for the stratification factor used in the randomisation (the number of non-pain &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; factors that a participant reports at baseline) using multiple logistic regression.</p><p>Comparisons with appropriate hypothesis tests will be used for the secondary outcomes, pain, illness behaviour, somatic symptom reporting, sleep problems, quality of life and wellbeing, psychological distress, patient global impression of change measure and fatigue. Appropriate adjustment will be made for the stratification factor. Given the multiple secondary outcomes, the p-value used to denote statistical significance will reflect the multiple comparisons.</p><p>Mixed models analyses with an appropriate error structure will take into account the repeated assessment of the outcome data for the same patient across the three follow-up times. As part of sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation methods will be used, where appropriate, to address issues of missing data. However, these methods will not be applied if the use of imputation is contrary to specified rules for the relevant validated measurement scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study management and conduct</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial steering committee</title><p>A trial steering committee will be established and comprise an independent chair who has expertise in both trials and CWP and two other independent members including a user representative who has had lived experience of CWP and a clinician working with people with CWP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Inspection of records</title><p>Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study related monitoring and audits on behalf of the sponsor and REC.
