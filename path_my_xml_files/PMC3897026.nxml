Increasing interest in the use of low-dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA-antagonistic properties, which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance. Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low-dose ketamine in postoperative pain, the role of ketamine, as a component of perioperative analgesia, remains unclear. We evaluated the analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>After institutional approval and written informed consent, 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgery aged 18-80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups.

Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction. Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes.

All patients received standard monitors including electrocardiography, noninvasive arterial pressure, end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure, and pulse oximetry. Preoperative blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before anesthetic administration. Age, gender, weight, and underlying disease of patients were noted.</p><p>After preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced intravenously using sodium thiopental 4-6 mg/kg, fentanyl l2 &#x003bc;g/kg, atracurium 0.6 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. After ventilation with mask and oxygen, patients were intubated. In the case group, ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was given intravenously during anesthesia induction. Patients allocated to the control group were given an identical volume of saline. Investigator involved in data collection was not aware of the group assignment. Anesthesia was maintained using intravenous infusion of 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min propofol (propofol 10%, 0.6 cc/kg/h).

The amount of anesthetic consumption and analgesic requirements during surgery were recorded. The duration of surgery (from surgical incision till the end of operation) was also noted. The duration of extubation was recorded from discontinuation of anesthetics till extubation. In the recovery room, when the patient was awake and oriented, the evaluation of postoperative pain was performed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All patients were informed from VAS before operation stared, VAS graded from 0 = no pain to 10 = severe pain. 15 mg/kg paracetamol was given intravenously within 20 min to the patients who had VAS &#x02265; 4. If patient had VAS &#x02265; 4, 20 min after infusion of paracetamol, 0.5 mg/kg pethidine was given intravenously. If postoperative vomiting happened, it would be noted.

Identifying perioperative analgesia requirements and postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain were other objectives of this study. There are some undesired effects of the surgery such as postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting. Since serious pain was not infrequently found despite pain monitoring, the need for anesthetic techniques that reduce or even prevent postoperative pain is obvious.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that low-dose ketamine during anesthetic induction does not improve postoperative pain scores of patients undergoing strabismus, retinal detachment, and keratoplasty surgery. Our finding is consistent with those of some other studies about postoperative pain scores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Contrary to our study, Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] reported that infusion of ketamine is more effective than intravenous infusion of propofol in decreasing postoperative pain scores of children undergoing strabismus surgery. This may be due to the dose-dependent effect on pain processing of ketamine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In a study by Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>., ketamine was administrated in anesthetic dose (1-3 mg/kg) that is two times higher than our dosage. Another reason could be the duration of surgery that was less than the present study. Aydin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] reported that ketamine decreases postoperative pain of children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenotomy. Because of continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine during surgery and different surgical procedures, our finding is inconsistent with Aydin's study in postoperative pain scores.</p><p>The present study indicates that a low dose administration of ketamine does not decrease analgesic requirements in the recovery. A number of previous studies demonstrate that a low dose of ketamine has no preemptive analgesic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In contrast to our findings, Menigaux <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found that patients received small dose of ketamine (0.15 mg/kg) at the end of the surgery (intraoperative), reduced postoperative morphine requirements and improve pain scores, and mobilization 24 h after arthroscopic anterior ligament repair. In the current study, patients received IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) during induction of anesthesia. The plasma half-life of ketamine is &#x0003c;17 minutes. Analgesia produced by ketamine 125-250 &#x003bc;g/kg IV lasts approximately 5 min when the plasma ketamine concentration is &#x0003e;100 ng/ml.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The negative findings of postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements can be explained by different surgical procedures and the time of ketamine administration during surgery.</p><p>Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] found that small dose of ketamine reduced VAS and morphine-induced analgesia after outpatient surgery. Shorter duration of the surgery and simultaneous use of small dose of ketamine with morphine, 15 min before the end of operation, could be the reasons of this inconsistency with our negative finding. Nesher and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] concluded that ketamine 5 mg IV spares morphine consumption after transthoracic lung and heart surgery. The reason for our negative finding of analgesic requirements may be different surgical procedures and different dose of ketamine administration. In contrary to our study, Remrand <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] reported that 24 h ketamine infusion decreased morphine consumption at 24 h after total hip arthroplasty that may be due to different surgical procedures and 24 h ketamine infusion.</p><p>In this study, no difference was found between ketamine and control groups with respect to intraoperative additional narcotic. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation to examine the effect of low dose of ketamine on intraoperative additional narcotic.</p><p>Small dose of ketamine does not seem to be a useful adjunct to anesthetic and does not decrease the consumption of anesthetic during surgery. In this case, our finding is consistent with a number of previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In contrast to our finding, Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] indicated that infusion of ketamine is effective on decreasing the consumption of anesthetic. The duration of ketamine anesthesia is determined by the dose; lager doses produce more prolonged anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In the study by Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] patients in group K were infused ketamine 1-3 mg/kg/h but in the present study, patients in group 1 received ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. This contrast may be due to larger dose of ketamine administration in Mizrak's study that causes the lower consumption of anesthetic.</p><p>In the current study, recoveries from anesthesia and discharge parameters were similar among the groups. Our finding is consistent with a study by Aydin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>The finding of this study indicates that low dose of ketamine during anesthesia induction can improve extubation time in painful ophthalmic surgery. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation to evaluate the effect of low dose ketamine on extubation.</p><p>In strabismus surgery, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) frequency are 50% to 80% without treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] In adults, although the incidence of PONV decrease with age, it has not always been a strong risk factor. In children, however, Eberhart and coworkers have shown that an age of 3 years or older is associated with an increased risk for PONV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the incidence of PONV is lower than a study by Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] This may be due to patients aged 4-11 years undergoing strabismus surgery who enrolled for Mizrak's study. We came to the conclusion that age and strabismus surgery cause a high incidence of PONV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrates that
