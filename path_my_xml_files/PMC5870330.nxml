They found that the fracture resistance ranged between 874 N for amalgam restorations and 1287 N for amalgam/composite combination. It has been proposed that the adhesive nature of composite restoration reinforced the remaining tooth structure by stress distribution along the bonding junction that consequently increases the fracture resistance.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>However, composite resin restoration has been indicated for minimal MOD cavity preparations that maintain the remaining tooth structure and then increase the fracture resistance of teeth.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The fracture resistance of teeth with standard MOD cavities has been investigated in the literature. However, conservative MOD cavities where the occlusal extension remains in the enamel layer have not been investigated for the cuspal fracture resistance. This study was designed to evaluate the fracture resistance of maxillary second premolar teeth with standard and modified conservative MOD cavity designs where caries lesion does not extend beyond the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) to mimic the clinical situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and sample collection</title><p>Sixty maxillary second premolar teeth were collected after tooth extraction for orthodontic treatment reason and stored in 5% formalin. These teeth were sound and free of cracks, caries lesions, dental restorations, and dental anomalies. The selected teeth were imbedded in auto-polymerized acrylic resin (Trayplast, Vertix Dental, Netherlands) according to the following steps. A measurement of 2 mm below the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) was identified by a periodontal probe UNC-15 (UNC-15, Paterson Dental) for each tooth and marked with a permanent marker to simulate the biologic width of the natural teeth.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] After that, Wax up line (Modeling wax, BEGO) of 2 mm height was performed on this marker, and it was used as a reference mark during embedment of the teeth in the acrylic resin. A silicon mold was fabricated to mount teeth perpendicular in the resin block with dimensions of 3 mm of resin around the tooth structure, 5 mm below the tooth apex, and 2 mm below the CEJ. All laboratory procedures were performed by the same operator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study groups and sample preparation</title><p>Samples were randomly divided into six experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] where Group #1 (G1) consisted of 10 intact premolar teeth (control group). Group #2 (G2) included 10 samples that were prepared with separated proximal (mesial and distal) boxes that were designed to be 1 mm approximately above the CEJ for the cervical margins. In addition, the occlusal outline of the proximal boxes was performed as approximately half of the intercuspal distance buccolingually and one-third of the mesiodistal dimension for each tooth.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Group #3 (G3) consisted of 10 samples where standard MOD cavity design was prepared as proximal boxes as G2 with an occlusal extension that extended approximately one-third of buccolingual width and 2 mm in depth.

The result presented that as the progressive reduction of the tooth structure at the different groups increased as the fracture resistance decreased. Furthermore, the results showed that MOD cavities with occlusal extension in the enamel layer had significantly higher fracture resistance than MOD cavities that extended beyond DEJ.</p><p>According to Bozkurt <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the occlusal enamel thickness of premolar teeth ranged from 1.8 to 1.2 mm even with abrasion patterns after ultrasonic and histologic evaluations. As our methodology was designed to evaluate the effect of violation of DEJ on the fracture resistance of MOD cavities, G4 and G5, where the occlusal cavity preparation did not extend beyond the DEJ (1 mm in depth), presented significantly higher fracture resistance as compared to G3 where the preparation violated the DEJ. In the meantime, G6, where the preparation depth was 2 mm and the width was 1 mm, it showed significantly lower fracture resistance as compared to G4 and G5. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between G6 and G3 (standard MOD) which might be due to the violation of DEJ.</p><p>In disagreement with this result, Sakaguchi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported in two-dimensional finite element study that the premolar teeth stiffness was not affected by the separation of the enamel layer between the two cusps at the central groove. They suggested that the tooth deformation could be enhanced by dentin elasticity and integrity. This difference could be explained by the different methodology and experimental tests that have been used.</p><p>In agreement with this study, different studies showed that the standard MOD cavity affected the structural integrity of the tooth and might be considered as a major cause of cupsal fracture. Lopez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared the cuspal flexure between MOD cavity and M and D boxes. They concluded that higher cuspal deflection presented with standard MOD cavities. Mondelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that MOD cavity had the lowest fracture resistance value as compared to Classes I and II two surfaces, especially when the one-third of the interocclusal distance was prepared. They considered that the isthmus width was the impact factor that affected the fracture resistance of different groups.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that the composite restoration is the preferred restorative material to restore MOD cavities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Liu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that composite resin significantly provided a higher fracture resistance for MOD cavities with proximal boxes than using ceramic materials. The explanation of this result is that the lower modulus of elasticity of composite resin could cause lower stresses generated around the junction between the tooth structure and the restoration. In addition, the bonding between the surrounding tooth structure and composite resin is better than that with the ceramic materials.</p><p>In the present study, samples were subjected to 2000 cycles of thermal cycling ranged between 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C to mimic clinical situations where dental restorations affected by the change in the temperature of oral environment. The essential factor for sample aging is the creation of mechanical stresses into the restoration which could affect the fracture resistance of restorations and remaining tooth structure.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The selection of temperature range was based on the most tolerated temperature in the oral cavity. Crabtree and Atkinson[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that the temperature of tooth surface during eating hot meal ranged between 43&#x000b0;C and 53&#x000b0;C. The duration of thermal cycling has been varied in the literature to simulate the clinical scenario. Gale and Darvell[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] claimed in their extensive review that 10,000 cycles of thermal cycling test in the laboratory representing a clinical relevant of 1 year in service of dental restorations. Therefore, the number of cycles (2,000 cycles) that was used in this study simulating almost 2-3 months of dental restorations in the oral environment.</p><p>Limitations of the present study included that although this <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation was attempted to mimic clinical situations, it was with the limited presentation of actual oral cavity environment where multiple factors may affect the end result such as pH, saliva, oral temperature, and occlusal loading. Moreover, the MOD cavities in the present study were designed with specific dimensions, which in the actual clinical scenario controlled by the extent of caries lesions.</p><p>Clinical implications could be attributed to MOD cavities with minimum occlusal preparations that may not require full crown coverage because it significantly performed better than standard MOD cavities.</p></sec><sec
