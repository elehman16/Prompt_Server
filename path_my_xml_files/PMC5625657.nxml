UFI is a great therapeutic challenge in countries like Nepal because of the lack of available point-of-care, rapid diagnostic tests. Often patients are empirically treated as presumed enteric fever. Due to the development of high-level resistance to traditionally used fluoroquinolones against enteric fever, azithromycin is now commonly used to treat enteric fever/UFI. The re-emergence of susceptibility of <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> to co-trimoxazole makes it a promising oral treatment for UFIs in general. We present a protocol of a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin versus co-trimoxazole for the treatment of UFI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This is a parallel-group, double-blind, 1:1, randomized controlled trial of co-trimoxazole versus azithromycin for the treatment of UFI in Nepal. Participants will be patients aged 2 to 65&#x000a0;years, presenting with fever without clear focus for at least 4&#x000a0;days, complying with other study criteria and willing to provide written informed consent. Patients will be randomized either to azithromycin 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (maximum 1000&#x000a0;mg/day) in a single daily dose and an identical placebo or co-trimoxazole 60&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (maximum 3000&#x000a0;mg/day) in two divided doses for 7&#x000a0;days. Patients will be followed up with twice-daily telephone calls for 7&#x000a0;days or for at least 48&#x000a0;h after they become afebrile, whichever is later; by home visits on days 2 and 4 of treatment; and by hospital visits on days 7, 14, 28 and 63. The endpoints will be fever clearance time, treatment failure, time to treatment failure, and adverse events. The estimated sample size is 330. The primary analysis population will be all the randomized population and subanalysis will be repeated on patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and culture-negative patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Both azithromycin and co-trimoxazole are available in Nepal and are extensively used in the treatment of UFI.

The non-specific clinical presentation of many infections that cause UFI makes it difficult to distinguish one cause from another based on clinical history, physical examination and basic initial laboratory investigations alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">UFIs in industrialized countries are often attributed to a viral syndrome but in the developing world UFI may be commonly caused by enteric fever, rickettsial illness, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, etc. depending upon local epidemiology. The common causes of UFI in Kathmandu, Nepal includes enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever and murine and scrub typhus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The pooled data of 2092 patients with UFI enrolled in four clinical trials conducted in the same study setting showed culture positivity in 885 (41%) patients for either <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> or <italic>Salmonella paratyphi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A study conducted in serum samples of a proportion of randomly selected patients from one of these trials showed serological evidence for acute murine typhus in 17% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21/125) of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, the spotted fever group rickettsioses, Q fever, leptospirosis, hantavirus infection, brucellosis and dengue may also cause UFI in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">There is no reliable point-of-care diagnostic test to determine rickettsial infections, self-remitting viral infections and many other febrile illnesses. Blood culture which is the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; test to determine enteric fever takes from 3 to 7&#x000a0;days. Therefore, treatment has to be guided by the clinical characteristics of the syndrome that the patient presents with and knowledge of local epidemiology of these common diseases. We have observed that most patients with UFI in Nepal are empirically treated as presumed enteric fever (in a high-incidence area) or as fever without a focus requiring antimicrobials (in a relatively low-incidence area). Our working definition for UFI is fever of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;38.0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for at least 4&#x000a0;days&#x02019; duration with no clear-cut focus of infection such as productive cough, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or any signs of neck stiffness or localized abscess. We exclude the patients with a fever duration of less than 4&#x000a0;days and a recorded temperature&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in an attempt to exclude the majority of patients with probable self-remitting viral infection. An appropriate antimicrobial, in addition to the supportive treatment, needs to be administered empirically to these patients in a setting where a large proportion of these UFIs is known to be caused by bacterial and rickettsial illnesses. Orally administered azithromycin is commonly used to treat UFI in Nepal and remains effective against enteric fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Fluoroquinolones cannot now be used to treat enteric fever in Nepal and South Asia as high levels of resistance have emerged against them within the <italic>S. typhi</italic> population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is further supported by endemic prevalence of a fluoroquinolone-resistant subclade of H58 <italic>S. typhi</italic> in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This highlights the need for alternative antimicrobial treatments and to consider using the first-line drugs chloramphenicol, amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole for enteric fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These drugs are the &#x0201c;low-hanging fruits&#x0201d; in UFI treatment as suggested by by O&#x02019;Neill&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] recent review on the global burden of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p id="Par21">Co-trimoxazole has been commonly used in the past for the treatment of enteric fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, resistance to co-trimoxazole emerged two decades ago, but has subsequently largely disappeared and nearly all <italic>S. typhi a</italic>nd <italic>S. paratyphi</italic> A isolates from Nepal are now susceptible to this drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Anecdotal reports claim that it performs well clinically for treating UFI in Nepal and it is a widely available at low cost. Its effectiveness against enteric fever is corroborated by a recent case report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and demonstrable low co-trimoxazole Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) for <italic>S. typhi</italic> and <italic>S. paratyphi</italic> A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Both azithromycin and co-trimoxazole are available in Nepal and are extensively used in the treatment of UFI.

It is, therefore, an azalide antimicrobial. It acts by inhibiting ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent protein synthesis by binding to the receptor at the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

It competes with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit the conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. This action inhibits the production of dihydrofolate intermediates and interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Trimethoprim is a 2, 4-diamino-5-(3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine.

It thus interferes with the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, the precursor of folinic acid and ultimately of purine and DNA synthesis.

This corresponds to the observed values for gatifloxacin in culture-negative patients and ceftriaxone for culture-positive patients in our previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The shape parameter of the Weibull distribution was assumed to be 0.75 for culture-negative patients and 1.5 in culture-positive patients. This estimation is conservative (i.e., implies slightly more variability) compared to the observed FCT distributions in the previous three typhoid trials conducted in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Regarding the effect size, we assume that co-trimoxazole is associated with a two-fold slower FCT in culture-negative patients and the same FCT as azithromycin in culture-positive patients. Of note, for the culture-negative patients, a 2.26-fold slower FCT was observed in the ceftriaxone arm compared to gatifloxacin in our previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign, a symptom, or disease (including an abnormal laboratory finding) temporarily associated with the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Clinical or laboratory events are considered AEs only if they occur after the first dose of study treatment. Stable chronic conditions, such as arthritis, which are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen are not considered AEs and will be documented in the subject&#x02019;s clinical chart as medical history.</p><p id="Par149">Serious adverse event (SAE) an AE is considered to be &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; if it results in one of the following outcomes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par150">Death</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par151">Life-threatening event (the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par152">Inpatient hospitalization (new admissions) or prolongation of existing hospitalization (beyond what is expected for normal clinical care)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par153">Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of a person&#x02019;s ability to conduct normal life functions)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par154">Congenital anomaly/birth defect</p></list-item></list>

The studies that have used co-trimoxazole have generally been of small sample size and have not included all UFIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par161">Azithromycin is recommended for the treatment of the rickettsial fevers but its usefulness for UFI treatment in settings where rickettsial infections and enteric fever are common needs to be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There have been no trials performed for the treatment of UFI in our setting of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric fever.</p><p id="Par162">There have been attempts to develop protocols for the initial investigations and management of UFIs in South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but the choice of antimicrobial in such protocols is still empirical and guided by subjective judgment. This study should pave the way for defining antibiotic guidelines for such presentations in Nepal.</p><p id="Par163">The findings of this study will be important for clinicians as it will help them choose the best empirical treatment for UFI and reduce the rates of treatment failures and the risk of complications, and thus directly reduce patient suffering. This will also avert the need of using multiple antimicrobials to treat a common presentation of illness in Nepal and South Asia and thus may prevent the overuse of antimicrobials especially in the treatment of UFI.</p><p id="Par164">This paper outlines the study protocol following the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines for intervention trials (the SPIRIT Checklist is included as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>)</p><sec id="Sec57"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par165">The trial is currently ongoing.
