Some three-dimensional cultured skin models were described to provide a promising means for both fundamental and applied skin research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ccid-6-043">5</xref> and Testskin was used for evaluation of stimulating ceramide production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ccid-6-043">6</xref> Test samples were prepared as follows. Vehicle control samples consisted of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (&#x02013;). Test samples consisted of AHYP (Kyowa Hakko Bio, Tokyo, Japan) dissolved in PBS (&#x02013;) and then adjusted to pH 7.0 with 4 N NaOH. AHYP samples were prepared at 1 or 3 mg/mL. Each sample (0.2 mL) was applied to the top of the three-dimensional cultured skin model twice a day for the times mentioned above.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid extraction and HPTLC assay</title><p>Epidermal layers were detached from the cultured three-dimensional skin model, then rinsed with PBS (&#x02013;) and freeze-dried. Lipids containing ceramide were extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1) by sonication for 5 minutes. The pooled lipid extracts were dried under N2, and then the pellets were dissolved in 250 &#x003bc;L of chloroform:methanol (2:1).

Total RNA was isolated by using a TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA, USA). One microgram of RNA was provided for cDNA synthesis by using the superscript first-strand synthesis system according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Life Technologies). The resulting first-strand cDNA from each RNA sample was amplified with TaqDNA Polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany), with primers designed with DNASIS Mac version 3.5 (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan), namely forward 5&#x02032;-GTGACCACAACCCGAATG-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-GATTACAGGCATCCCGTAG-3&#x02032;. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 15 seconds at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 minute at 50&#x000b0;C. The PCR products were electrophoresed and stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Life Technologies), and quantified by scanning densitometry with the CS Analyzer version 2.0.

After 4 weeks&#x02019; application, TEWL was increased on control-treated forearms but unchanged on AHYP-treated forearms. Since both test creams contained such ingredients as water, glycerin, squalane, etc, which could act as moisturizers, it was difficult to show a significant difference between control and AHYP cream, while pruritus intensity significantly declined only in the AHYP-treated forearms between 0 and 4 weeks. Relative levels of Cer[EOS-O] (ceramide 1 linoleate) are depleted in winter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ccid-6-043">27</xref> Ceramides themselves are not considered to maintain skin hydration, but they help to prevent water loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ccid-6-043">28</xref> Although we did not measure ceramide contents in the human study, our data strongly suggest that AHYP application potentiates the barrier function of the skin by promoting ceramide synthesis and suppressing TEWL increase. This could be the mechanism by which AHYP alleviates pruritus.</p><p>AHYP affected Cer[EOP] content dose-dependently, however Cer[NS] and Cer[AP] content changes did not correspond with it. It is suggested that there are optimum AHYP concentrations for each ceramide synthesis promotion. In our study, AHYP concentrations were limited, and further study will be necessary. We observed no cytotoxicity in the three-dimensional cultured skin models at the test concentrations of AHYP (1 or 3 mg/mL), and there were no adverse effects in the clinical trial using 1% (w/w) AHYP. These results, together with the fact that AHYP has been used as a medicament for a long time, support the safety of AHYP as a topical ingredient.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that AHYP, which is an acetylated derivative of an amino acid, increases ceramide synthesis by upregulating <italic>SPTLC1</italic> expression in three-dimensional cultured skin models. Topical application also alleviated pruritus in atopic dermatitis patients. Our data support the safety of AHYP and present a new function for this compound as a useful ingredient for improving the skin barrier in dry skin and atopic dermatitis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr Rieko Tsubouchi, head of the Ginza Skin Clinic, Tokyo, and Dr Kyoko Yanagisawa, head of the Idea Skin Clinic, Daikanyama, Tokyo, for their help in obtaining advice on the clinical trial.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ccid-6-043"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kr&#x000fc;ger</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Klasser</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000f6;ssinger</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oxaceprol: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in osteoarthritis with a non-conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</article-title><source>Clin Exp Rheumatol</source><year>2007</year><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17417987</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ccid-6-043"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Molimard</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Guillon</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Monsaingeon</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>N-acetyl hydroxyproline effect on the development of experimental intermediary burns in rabbits</article-title><source>Rev Eur Etud Clin Biol</source><year>1972</year><volume>17</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>625</fpage><lpage>639</lpage><comment>French.</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4647915</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ccid-6-043"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pasolini</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Pancera</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Manganoni</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cetta</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Zanaboni</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leg ulcers caused by prolidase deficiency</article-title><source>G Ital Dermatol Venereol</source><year>1998</year><volume>123</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>493</fpage><lpage>496</lpage><comment>Italian.</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3248820</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ccid-6-043"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ocana</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>P&#x000e9;rez de Vargas</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilhelmi</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Sclerodermiform porphyria cutanea tarda.
