Yet, to date, there are no interventions being delivered in Ireland that concurrently target PA, healthy eating and sedentary time amongst school children. In direct response to this need, a health promotion intervention titled &#x02018;Project Spraoi,&#x02019; (pronounced &#x02018;spree&#x02019;) was developed. The term Spraoi is a Gaelic Irish word, directly translated as &#x02018;fun&#x02019;. This intervention, incorporating the Social Ecological Model of Health Behaviour <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, attempts to create environments which promote PA and healthy nutritional choices to provide the individual with the knowledge, skills and motivation to engage in health enhancing behaviours.</p><p id="p0020">The primary aim of &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; is to be the first study to implement and evaluate an intervention targeting increased PA, reduced sedentary time and improved nutritional habits among Irish primary school children. Secondary aims are to evaluate intervention effects on (i) physical markers of health (body mass (BMI), body fat (BF), cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure (BP) and (ii) nutritional knowledge and habits (questionnaires) among Irish primary school children. This current article describes the methods of the project, which adheres to the Consolidation Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p id="p0025">The Irish Department of Education and Skills website <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> listed 349 primary schools in Cork City and County in the 2011/12 academic school year. The Principal in each of these schools was sent a preliminary questionnaire in May 2013 examining (i) current policies and practices relating to PA and nutrition in their schools, (ii) barriers and facilitators relating to the promotion of increased PA and improved nutritional habits in their school, and, (iii) their schools interest in implementing the &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; intervention. Each of the 151 schools who returned the questionnaire expressed an interest in implementing &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019;. For the purposes of this evaluation, however, certain inclusion criteria were set. These included (i) medium size (100&#x02013;300 pupils) <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, (ii) have proximity (20&#x000a0;km) to the research Institute, (iii) willingness to implement the &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; intervention, and, (iv) not currently participating in another PA and/or healthy eating intervention in their school. Future plans are to offer the intervention to all interested schools in the region; subject to positive findings from the evaluation and the securing of external funding.</p><p id="p0030">In Year 1 of the research (academic year 2013/14), a sample of schools meeting this criteria (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) with similar demographic characteristics relating to location (urban, rural), school type (single sex, mixed), socioeconomic status (DEIS (schools in lower SES areas), non-DEIS) were matched and randomly assigned as intervention or control. Participants in control schools did not receive any of the intervention components. They did, however, undertake all physical measurements, have their PA, sedentary and fitness levels monitored and completed the questionnaire/s at the same time points as the intervention participants.</p><p id="p0035">Due to practical, logistical and financial constraints, the research team are implementing a stepped wedge intervention design <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and rolling out the intervention sequentially to trial participants. In Year 1 of the research, 4 intervention schools and 2 control schools participated. In Year 2 (academic year 2014/15), 3 additional intervention schools and one extra control school were recruited (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The research team envisage that intervention schools will maintain involvement with &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; and new schools will be offered the intervention annually. Yet, this arrangement is dependent on school interest and procurement of research funding. Where possible, schools acting as control schools for a period of 2 years will be invited to become an intervention school.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Sampling framework &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; year 1 &#x00026; 2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0040">This paper proposes that in Year 3 of the research (2015&#x02013;2016), the project will grow to include a representative sample of Cork schools, which will be stratified by school location, gender and socio-economic status and will be drawn from schools who have expressed a willingness to implement the &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; intervention. The sample size necessary to detect changes in minutes in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is based on previous studies <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Sample sizes are calculated to detect a mean difference of 10&#x000a0;min per day of school day MVPA, between intervention and control groups at the end of the intervention period. A standard deviation of 12&#x000a0;min is used <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Using G&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;Power 3.1.9.2 software, an ANCOVA with 5% level of significance and power of 80%, yielded a sample size of 48 participants (24 per group) per cohort (Senior Infants (5&#x02013;7 year olds) and Fourth Class (9&#x02013;11 year olds)), per school. To allow for possible drop outs, at least 54 participants (27 per group) will be recruited, per school. In year 1 of the study, 6 schools will be included in the study.</p><p id="p0045">Prior to the commencement of the intervention, one of the lead researchers visited each principal and/or lead teacher at a participating school and the full outline of the study explained; along with the distribution of information sheets and consent forms. The consent form required all participating Senior Infant and Fourth Class children in each school and their parent/s/guardian/s to consent to having each of the physical measurements taken and to wear an accelerometer at baseline and follow-up. The research team chose these two age groups to be tested as part of the evaluation, based on children of these age ranges being at the advent of important ages for forming and understanding health habits. Cork Institute of Technology's Research Ethics Committee granted approval of the study (September 2013).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Development of intervention and evaluation framework</title><p id="p0050">&#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; is based on a New Zealand (NZ) health promotion intervention &#x02018;Project Energize&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.projectenergize.org.nz" id="intref0010">www.projectenergize.org.nz</ext-link><underline>),</underline> which was first implemented in 2004 and is currently delivered to all 244 primary and intermediate schools in the Waikato District Health Board region of NZ. &#x02018;Project Energize&#x02019; has reported positive impacts on prevalence figures for overweight and obesity, physical fitness and nutritional behaviour among NZ children <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p id="p0055">Project Spraoi differs to Project Energize in four main ways. Firstly, Project Spraoi is based in the northern hemisphere, where although similarities in temperate climate with New Zealand are noted, there are distinct cultural, economic and educational differences between the two countries. Necessary adjustments have therefore been made to the planning, delivery and evaluation of the intervention in Ireland, which need to be assessed for effectiveness.</p><p id="p0060">Secondly, the Project Spraoi intervention is primarily a research-led programme, receiving internal funding from the host institution, Cork Institute of Technology. As a result, the Energizers are all postgraduate researchers, who deliver both the intervention in their school/s and act as the primary data gathers for the evaluation. This is not the case in New Zealand. Project Energize is an externally funded health promotion intervention, delivered by a team of employed Energizers who work for District Health Boards. Although it continues to inform the planning and delivery of the programme, the research arm of their intervention has always existed as a separate entity.</p><p id="p0065">Due to financial and methodological constraints, it has not been possible to ensure that each Project Spraoi Energizer refrain from being involved in the evaluation data collection process for their school/s, which could lead to bias. Yet, steps have been put in place to ensure that each Energizer has minimal interaction with their intervention school at the time of evaluation. They are also only instructed to gather data of an anthropometric nature from their intervention school/s at the time of data collection. All evaluation tools that could require one to one interaction e.g. questionnaires and teacher/principal/child feedback, are administered by a researcher who has no connection with the school being analysed.</p><p id="p0070">Thirdly, although Project Spraoi has the same overarching aims to that of Project Energize, and uses similar intervention and evaluation material, the Spraoi intervention and evaluation are research driven, in that each postgraduate project focuses on a specific outcome in more detail to that of the original Energize programme/evaluation. These include, but are not limited to, 1) nutritional intake (analysis of food diaries) 2) physical activity levels (accelerometry) 3) Fundamental Movement Skills (movement proficiency) and 4) Qualitative interviews (to gain more in depth insight from all participating individuals involved in programme delivery). Such data will allow for more in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of the Irish intervention to take place.</p><p id="p0075">Finally, in order to evaluate the public health effects of &#x02018;Project Spraoi,&#x02019; the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) theoretical framework of programme evaluation is being adopted (42). This approach is used to assess the public health impact of an intervention; with its main goal to bring attention to the essential elements of a particular programme. It is envisaged that this then helps to encourage others to focus more on the essential elements of a specific intervention, so as to improve the effectiveness of its implementation in the future.</p><p id="p0080">The RE-AIM framework comprises five main themes (i) Reach: the proportion of eligible people in the target population who participate in an intervention and the extent to which those participants represent the target population (ii) Efficacy: the extent to which the intervention has a positive effect on relevant outcomes (iii) Adoption: an organizational measure of the number of programme providers who implement a programme and the extent to which they represent all possible programme providers (iv) Implementation: an organizational measure of the quality of the intervention's delivery and its adherence to the essential elements of the research programme and (v) Maintenance: a measure of the intervention's effectiveness at achieving the desired outcome for an extended time <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Intervention</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Energizers</title><p id="p0085">At study commencement (October 2013), the research team assigned each intervention school with a designated Energizer. The &#x02018;Energizer&#x02019; aimed to provide support and assistance for school personnel to effectively implement &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019;. The Energizers were recruited via &#x02018;Project Energize's recruitment protocol, which required them to be teachers/graduates in the fields of exercise, nutrition and/or P.E. Prior to the commencement of the study, experienced Energizers from &#x02018;Project Energize,&#x02019; NZ visited Ireland to provide training to the Irish Energizers on the intervention philosophy, structure and content. The Irish Energizers meet formally each month in order to share experiences, resources and ideas. External support remains ongoing via teleconference at regular intervals (3 monthly) with the NZ Energize team.</p><p id="p0090">The Energizer carried out a &#x02018;school stocktake&#x02019; with a school leader, which involved a structured interview around current school policy, practices and resources relating to PA and nutritional habits. The Energizer also undertook a needs analysis session with school staff, which identified priority areas of improvement relating to PA and nutritional habits for each school. This bottom up approach resulted in the development of an action plan which was unique to each school. Central tenets of the programme include the promotion of 20&#x000a0;min &#x02018;huff and puff&#x02019; (MVPA) each day, improvement of nutritional habits and knowledge through targeted class based activities, promotion of increased habitual PA and reduced sedentary time. Goals were then set and reviewed every six weeks by the Energizer and the lead teaching staff. If certain goals were not met, they were adjusted accordingly. Consideration was given to making the intervention synergistic with other school priorities, goals and processes <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p id="p0095">Each school's programme is flexible and unique in its design, with the aim of the intervention being tailored to meet the needs of each individual school, throughout the delivery process. The content of the intervention is continuously evaluated and developed; based on reflections and feedback from participating schools.</p><p id="p0100">The Energizer's aimed to help each school achieve their specific goals through a variety of means; including leading and assisting in the delivery of PA and healthy eating sessions, providing schools with resources, in-service training and support on how to promote PA, healthy eating and reduce sedentary time. Depending on the needs of the school, Energizers also helped to promote existing national healthy living campaigns e.g. bike week. The amount of time Energizers visit their allocated school varied depending on the school's needs but a maximum of 1.5 days a week was recommended.</p><p id="p0105">Energizers provided assistance to parents/communities through parent-teacher activities and educational evenings with a qualified, registered nutritionist. As &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; was designed as a school based intervention, the school were the main focus for delivery and the community and parents were targeted through the school. It was intended that the same messages that &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; promoted in the school would reach into the home environment. Methods for getting messages home included: the &#x02018;Home Play PA Challenge&#x02019;; nuggets &#x02013; healthy tips published in the school newsletter; tip sheets &#x02013; colourful messages going home as a fridge magnet and the &#x02018;Home School Link&#x02019; &#x02013; healthy eating education sessions delivered in class time for children and evenings for parents.

If schools maintain involvement in &#x02018;Project Spraoi,&#x02019; these measurements will be carried out bi-annually (start and end of each academic year). Measurements were undertaken by a team of 5 researchers (who were also the Energizers), who received training on data collection procedures over 3 separate workshops, from experienced researchers. Retraining was provided by a lead researcher, prior to each new evaluation stage in order to re-familiarise the research team with the evaluation protocol. To minimise intra reliability error, where possible, the same researcher carried out the same physical measurement with each child pre and post intervention. All anthropometric measurements were undertaken by the researchers in a private setting, in small groups (6 children), for a total of 30&#x000a0;min. Each measurement was recorded twice by a researcher; with a third measure made when the pre-defined criterion was exceeded.

Yet, to date, Ireland has not introduced a fully evaluated intervention that incorporates each of these components; despite rising obesity levels. This study aims to address this issue by evaluating the effectiveness of a school-based health promotion initiative which targets increased PA, improved nutritional habits and reduced sedentary time, which may result in healthier body mass, amongst Irish primary school children. Measures of PA, nutritional knowledge/behaviours and long-term health parameters including body composition, blood pressure (BP) and fitness are gathered before and after the programme completion. For comparative purposes, these scores are compared to a separate control group that do not participate in the intervention and to counterparts partaking in &#x02018;Project Energize&#x02019;, NZ.</p><p id="p0160">Findings from a systematic review of 32 studies, with over 52,000 participants <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> reported that recent school-based interventions demonstrated more convincing evidence of their effectiveness in reducing BMI scores because they tended to be longer, more comprehensive and included parental support. The greatest effects were seen in the interventions with a duration of greater than one year and included a wide range of multiple-level efforts including: providing information on PA and nutrition, changing attitudes, monitoring behaviour, modifying environment, involving parents, increasing PA and improving diet; elements which are central to the &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; intervention.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths, limitations and findings from year one of the study</title><p id="p0165">During year one of the project (academic year 2013/14), the research team found some notable logistical issues arising, surrounding the collection of data. In order to collect the broad range of measurements in both an accurate and timely manner, a minimum of five trained researchers were required; instead of the planned four. For the evaluation of year two (academic year 2014/15) of the project, therefore, the recommendation for a minimum of five researchers was proposed and adhered to.</p><p id="p0170">Accelerometers are superior to other objective measures of PA <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, as they can quantify both the intensity and frequency of PA. Yet, their cost and the time required for data collection (7 days) is prohibitive for their practicality in large scale studies in the school-setting. Consequently, the 7-day PA data collection that took place during the year one evaluation took longer than anticipated. In year two, additional accelerometers were purchased which allowed data to be collected more efficiently.</p><p id="p0175">During year one of the data collection it was noted that younger children had some comprehension difficulties with the &#x02018;Nutritional Knowledge/Attitudes Questionnaire&#x02019;. A more practical, validated questionnaire was selected <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and is being adopted for future evaluation of the project. The &#x02018;Fit Kids R Healthy Kids&#x02019; questionnaire <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> was chosen for its reliability and validity amongst school children of a similar age range to &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019; (aged 6 years+) and was piloted in a local primary school to ensure it was appropriate and relevant for an Irish setting. The 15-item questionnaire asked questions relating to children's knowledge of healthy eating and only minor changes were necessary to make the questionnaire culturally relevant, such as including an image of the Irish Food Pyramid.</p><p id="p0180">Although a brief process evaluation was undertaken with participating teachers and children during year one delivery of the intervention, the research team felt that more insight was required in order to adhere to the &#x02018;maintenance&#x02019; theme of the RE-AIM Framework <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Consequently, a detailed process evaluation of the intervention commenced in October 2014 in one participating school (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;287) and will continue until study end to help improve the effectiveness and further development of &#x02018;Project Spraoi&#x02019;.

In order to triangulate findings, specific process evaluation questions have been developed and mapped on to the different evaluation dimensions and multiple methods for sourcing data are being used to measure the same evaluation dimension. A pragmatic approach to data collection tools has also been adopted to maximise response; while minimising the impact on intervention delivery and the workload for school staff.</p><p id="p0185">Due to the restrictions (location of school, size of school) mentioned previously, the research team were unable to get a fully representative sample of school children from Cork; preventing the generalisability of the findings.

An evaluation of the on-going NZ programme <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> that included over 5110 children from 192 participating schools, showed it to be cost effective in delivering measureable improvements in the health of children. &#x02018;Project Energize&#x02019; children scored better on the 550&#x000a0;m run than their counterparts, were more physically active, had smaller waist circumferences, less overweight/obesity, had a reduced rate of rise in systolic BP and were better informed about practicing healthy eating habits than before the intervention began <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.
