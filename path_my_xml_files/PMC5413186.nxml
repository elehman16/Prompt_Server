However, their physiological basis and precise functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the physiological basis and behavioral relevance of driving beta and gamma oscillatory activity in the human M1 using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). tACS was applied using a sham-controlled crossover design at individualized intensity for 20 min and TMS was performed at rest (before, during, and after tACS) and during movement preparation (before and after tACS). We demonstrated that driving gamma frequency oscillations using tACS led to a significant, duration-dependent decrease in local resting-state GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition, as quantified by short interval intracortical inhibition. The magnitude of this effect was positively correlated with the magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> decrease during movement preparation, when gamma activity in motor circuitry is known to increase. In addition, gamma tACS-induced change in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition was closely related to performance in a motor learning task such that subjects who demonstrated a greater increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition also showed faster short-term learning. The findings presented here contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of motor rhythms and suggest that tACS may have similar physiological effects to endogenously driven local oscillatory activity. Moreover, the ability to modulate local interneuronal circuits by tACS in a behaviorally relevant manner provides a basis for tACS as a putative therapeutic intervention.</p><p><bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</bold> Gamma oscillations have a vital role in motor control. Using a combined tACS-TMS approach, we demonstrate that driving gamma frequency oscillations modulates GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition in the human motor cortex. Moreover, there is a clear relationship between the change in magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition induced by tACS and the magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition observed during task-related synchronization of oscillations in inhibitory interneuronal circuits, supporting the hypothesis that tACS engages endogenous oscillatory circuits. We also show that an individual's physiological response to tACS is closely related to their ability to learn a motor task. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of motor rhythms and their behavioral relevance and offer the possibility of developing tACS as a therapeutic tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>concurrent tACS and TMS</kwd><kwd>GABA inhibition</kwd><kwd>gamma oscillations</kwd><kwd>motor excitability</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>tACS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decades, there has been an increasing understanding of the importance of oscillatory neural activity in underpinning behavior. In the motor domain, synchronized oscillations in the beta (15&#x02013;30 Hz) and higher-gamma (60&#x02013;90 Hz) frequency bands are known to be of particular importance. Specifically, beta band oscillations are the dominant oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) at rest (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Murthy and Fetz, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Salmelin and Hari, 1994</xref>) and a reduction in beta oscillatory power is routinely observed immediately before and during transient voluntary movements (movement-related beta desynchronization [MRBD]; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, an increase in gamma power occurs shortly before movement onset and during movement execution (movement-related gamma synchronization [MRGS]) and has been suggested to reflect the initial activation of primary motor neurons subserving movement (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cheyne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Muthukumaraswamy, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cheyne, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gaetz et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, it has been shown in humans that driving higher-gamma oscillations facilitates, and driving beta oscillations inhibits, motor performance (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>), thus demonstrating a causal role of these brain rhythms in motor control.</p><p>At a mechanistic level, a growing body of research supports a link between oscillatory activity in both the beta and gamma bands and the balance of excitation and inhibition within reciprocally connected networks of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal cells within M1 (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Whittington et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Yamawaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atallah and Scanziani, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gaetz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buzs&#x000e1;ki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Guerra et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, however, more research is needed to advance our understanding of the physiological basis underlying these motor rhythms and their behavioral relevance.</p><p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive tool that allows the frequency-specific modulation of neural oscillations (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zaehle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Feurra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>) and has been valuable for demonstrating the causal nature of the oscillation&#x02013;behavior relationship (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Thut et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Helfrich et al., 2014</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that tACS modulates intrinsic brain oscillations via direct entrainment (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zaehle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Helfrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000f6;hlich, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Witkowski et al., 2016</xref>), so its effect is most pronounced when stimulation frequency matches the natural frequency of the stimulated neuronal elements (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zaehle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Thut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Reato et al., 2013</xref>). tACS therefore has the potential to be used to study local oscillatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to evaluate the neurophysiological basis of driving oscillatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic> using tACS. Specifically, we examined the effects of beta and gamma frequency tACS applied over the M1 for 20 min. The effects of tACS on resting physiological measures were examined and, due to the well recognized patterns of changes in beta and gamma frequency power during movement preparation, the after-effects of tACS on pre-movement physiological measures were also evaluated. Moreover, given the converging evidence demonstrating the critical role of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition in both motor cortical oscillations and learning (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gaetz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Stagg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Pollok et al., 2014</xref>), we addressed the question of whether the magnitude of tACS-induced changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> activity could be related to individual differences in motor learning. We hypothesized that beta tACS would increase, and gamma tACS decrease, GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition, as assessed via short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and, further, that these changes would be related to the degree to which an individual could learn a motor task.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title/><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy subjects (age 24.9 years, range: 21&#x02013;30 years; 9 male) gave their informed consent to participate in the study in accordance with Central University Research Ethics Committee approval (University of Oxford; MSD-IDREC-C2&#x02013;2014-026).

Concurrent surface electromyography (EMG) of the right extensor digitorum communis and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle were recorded using bipolar surface electrodes. Both MEG and EMG data were sampled at 1000 Hz with a band-pass filter of 0.03&#x02013;330 Hz and stored for offline analysis. Head position was continuously monitored with respect to the MEG sensors using four head-position (HPI) coils. The locations of HPI coils and of three anatomical fiducials (the nasion and two preauricular points) were digitized using a 3D tracking system (Polhemus, EastTrach 3D) to define the subject-specific Cartesian head coordinate system. In addition, vertical and horizontal electro-oculogram electrodes were used to allow for detection and removal of eye-blink artifacts.</p><p>MEG data were acquired during a single session consisting of resting-state (8 min; eyes open) and a Go/NoGo task. In the Go/NoGo task, a blue circle cue, presented for 200 ms, instructed participants to prepare for an abduction of the index finger of their right hand. The cue was then replaced by a fixation cross for 1000 ms (cue&#x02013;stimulus interval). A subsequent visual stimulus presented for 200 ms (colored circle: green for Go or red for NoGo) indicated whether they should perform (Go) or withhold (NoGo) the prepared response. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible on the Go trials. The stimulus was then replaced by a fixation cross for a duration that varied randomly between 2000 and 4000 ms (intertrial interval). The task consisted of a total of 70 trials and lasted &#x0223c;5 min.

The onset of EMG was identified in each trial as the time when the signal exceeded a threshold of 3 SDs of the EMG activity in the 150 ms period preceding the onset of TMS artifact.

Chloride-free conductive gel was used as a conducting medium between the scalp and the electrodes. One electrode was centered over the TMS-derived FDI hotspot of left M1 (see below); the other was positioned on the contralateral supraorbital ridge.</p><p>tACS was administered in a within-subject design. Subjects participated in two active sessions, with different tACS frequency applied at each session, and one sham session. All sessions were separated by at least 1 week. Subjects received tACS at IBF or, if no distinct beta peak was identified, group-averaged beta frequency (mean 20.1 Hz, SD = 2.07), gamma frequency (75 Hz), or sham stimulation.</p><p>Stimulation intensity was determined on a subject-by-subject basis and was set to be the highest amplitude that did not elicit phosphenes or discomfort. This resulted in an average stimulation intensity (peak-to-peak) of 0.69 &#x000b1; 0.11 mA for beta frequency tACS and 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.36 mA (mean &#x000b1; SD) for gamma frequency tACS. Current was ramped up and down over the first and last 5 s of stimulation. The total duration of stimulation was 20 min for active sessions and 10 s for the sham session. Impedance was kept at &#x0003c;5 k&#x003a9;.

The left M1 was stimulated in all subjects. The optimal scalp position to elicit MEPs (referred to as the motor hotspot) in the right FDI muscle was determined before each session, with the TMS coil held at 45&#x000b0; to the midsagittal line with the handle pointing posteriorly. The hotspot was marked on a tight-fitting cap to ensure reproducible coil positioning and TMS pulses were delivered through the M1 electrode. For the duration of the sessions, the subjects were seated comfortably in an armchair with their eyes open.</p><p>Surface EMG was recorded via disposable neonatal ECG electrodes (Henley's Medical) from the FDI of the right hand using a belly-tendon montage with a ground electrode over the ulnar styloid process. Signals were sampled at 5 kHz, amplified, filtered (10 Hz-1 kHz), and recorded using a CED 1902 amplifier, a CED micro1401 A/D converter, and Signal software version 3.13 (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p></sec><sec><title>Motor thresholds.</title><p>The resting 1 mV motor threshold (MT<sub>1mV</sub>) and active motor threshold (aMT) were determined at the beginning of each tACS/TMS session. The MT<sub>1mV</sub> was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity required for eliciting an MEP of &#x0223c;1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude in at least 5 of 10 consecutive trials in the relaxed FDI muscle. The active motor threshold was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity necessary to evoke a 200 &#x003bc;V peak-to-peak MEP in at least 5 of 10 consecutive trials while subjects maintained &#x0223c;30% of the maximum contraction of the FDI.</p></sec><sec><title>Paired-pulse TMS protocols.</title><p>Two paired-pulse protocols were performed in the study: SICI with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2.5 ms to assess GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kujirai et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Di Lazzaro et al., 2005</xref>) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with an ISI of 12 ms as a measure of NMDA receptor activity (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Ziemann et al., 1996</xref>). The conditioning stimulus was set at 70% of aMT and the test stimulus was set at MT<sub>1mV</sub> for both protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Rest measures.</title><p>Resting-state MT<sub>1mV</sub>, SICI, and ICF were measured before, during (at T1 = 5 min and at T2 = 15 min after tACS onset), and after tACS. Fifteen trials per condition were applied before and after tACS and 10 trials per condition were applied during tACS. Due to potential changes in motor cortex excitability after tACS, 10 single-pulse MEPs were recorded at the original intensity immediately after stimulation had ceased. If the amplitude of the resulting MEP differed markedly from 1 mV, then the stimulation intensity was altered accordingly (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amadi et al., 2015</xref>) before other post-tACS measures were taken.

To avoid any potential interactions between tACS and task performance, pre-movement measures were not performed during stimulation. The TMS measures were performed in a pseudorandomized order at two different timings during movement preparation: an early time point (25% of mean RT) and a late time point (65% of mean RT), resulting in four different pre-movement protocols: MT<sub>1mV early</sub>, MT<sub>1mV late</sub>, SICI<sub>early</sub>, and SICI<sub>late</sub>. The 25% and 65% RT were adjusted to each subject's mean RT according to a previously described procedure (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Murase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hummel et al., 2009</xref>).

The peak-to-peak amplitude for each MEP was then calculated. Any MEPs outside of 2 SDs of the mean for each condition for each block were rejected. Next, a single iteration of Grubbs' test with a significance level of 0.05 was performed for each TMS condition separately and any significant outliers excluded. Collectively, these rejection criteria resulted in the exclusion of &#x0003c;5 trials per subject in any condition.</p><p>Given that precontraction at very low EMG levels can affect MEP amplitudes, the above exclusion criterion may not be sufficient to detect such subthreshold fluctuations in the signal. To further control for background EMG activity, we calculated the root mean square of the EMG signal in the 80 ms preceding the TMS pulse. A repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA with one factor of session (beta, gamma, sham), one factor of protocol (rest protocols or pre-movement protocols), and one factor of time (baseline, post, or T1, T2) showed no significant main effects or interactions (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting that there were no differences in EMG activity between the experimental conditions.</p><p>SICI and ICF were expressed as a ratio of the mean conditioned MEP amplitude to the mean unconditioned MEP amplitude (MT<sub>1mV</sub>). For the pre-movement data, the TMS measures were analyzed separately for each pre-movement time point (0.25 and 0.65 RT).</p><p>Finally, to investigate the offline effect of tACS on dynamic changes in corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition over the pre-movement time span, a linear function was fitted to each subject's MT<sub>1mV</sub> and SICI amplitudes (expressed as a ratio of the mean conditioned stimulus to the unconditioned stimulus amplitude [MT<sub>1mV</sub>] occurring temporally closest to it) against the position in the pre-movement period when the TMS pulse was delivered. The effect of tACS on the slope of this function was then assessed. The steeper the slope, the higher the increase in dynamic MT<sub>1mV</sub> and SICI modulation (less inhibition) approaching movement.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB 8 software (version R2014b; The MathWorks), Prism (version 7; GraphPad Software), and SPSS (version 22.0; IBM).</p><p>Normality of data distribution was tested by D'Agostino&#x02013;Pearson omnibus normality test.

As hypothesized, gamma frequency tACS led to a significant reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition, as assessed by SICI. Interestingly, a reversal of this effect was observed at a later stimulation period, which, to our knowledge, constitutes the first-time evidence of homeostatic changes induced by prolonged application of oscillatory currents. Further, the change in magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition due to gamma tACS was positively related to the magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition observed during task-related synchronization of oscillations in inhibitory interneuronal circuits, supporting the hypothesis that tACS engages endogenous oscillatory circuits. Finally, the change in inhibition was strongly related to an individual's ability to learn a motor task.</p><sec><title>Gamma tACS modulated GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition during stimulation</title><p>We have shown that gamma tACS modulated GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition significantly during stimulation. There is broad consensus from the animal and human literature that gamma oscillations reflect underlying GABAergic activity (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Towers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mann and Paulsen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gaetz et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with our hypothesis, the exogenous application of a prokinetic gamma rhythm reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition early during stimulation. It is worth noting that, although the predominant oscillatory activity in the sensorimotor cortex at rest is at beta frequency (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Salmelin and Hari, 1994</xref>), different types of neurons differ in the degree to which they are intrinsically responsive to gamma-band synchrony in their inputs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Otte et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that local inhibitory subnetworks that exhibit gamma frequency oscillations despite being disengaged at rest are more susceptible to the exogenously applied oscillatory current at this frequency because it is closest to their resonant frequency. The changes induced in the affected circuits may manifest as, for example, changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition, as shown here.</p><p>Despite our initial hypothesis that beta tACS would increase TMS-assessed GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition, we found no effect of beta tACS on this measure. It is difficult to know how to interpret this lack of an effect, especially given the extensive animal and simulation literature that strongly suggests a role for GABA<sub>A</sub> interneurons in beta oscillations (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Roopun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Yamawaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that beta tACS was delivered at insufficient intensity in the present study (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Moliadze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cancelli et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is worth noting that a recent study also showed no effect of beta tACS on SICI when the phase of tACS was not controlled for despite the use of a higher stimulation intensity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Guerra et al., 2016</xref>). Future research will focus on establishing optimized stimulation parameters to increase the value of tACS as a tool to study oscillatory activity and also its therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Magnitude of tACS-induced changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition was related to GABA<sub>A</sub> change in a period of gamma recruitment</title><p>Whether tACS is capable of driving activity in circuits that are not engaged is still an open question. To start to address this point, we investigated the relationship between the physiological changes in response to gamma and beta tACS and the physiological changes (before stimulation) during the pre-movement period, when endogenous gamma activity is increasing and beta activity decreasing. We showed a positive association between the magnitude of gamma tACS-induced change in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition and the magnitude of late pre-movement GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, supporting the hypothesis that tACS engages local inhibitory circuits involved in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations. In addition, these findings may be of importance for clinical stimulation protocols because they may allow us to probe stimulation efficacy before therapeutic application.</p></sec><sec><title>Gamma tACS-induced modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition predicted motor learning</title><p>The next question we sought to address was whether gamma tACS was able to modulate intracortical neuronal circuits in a behaviorally relevant manner. We observed a strong association between gamma tACS-induced change in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition and the degree of motor learning such that subjects who demonstrated a greater increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition at an early time point during and after stimulation also showed faster short-term learning. Although these findings provide clear evidence for the behavioral relevance of physiological changes induced by gamma oscillatory current in the motor domain, the question remains as to why stimulation-induced modulation of inhibition is related to performance in the motor learning task. Although speculative at this point, a stronger inhibition due to gamma tACS may reflect a higher inhibitory capacity at an individual level, which has been shown to be related to increased precision in GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic transmission and better manual motor performance (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stinear and Byblow, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Heise et al., 2013</xref>). This is also in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that greater pre-movement inhibition is related to successful performance in the motor learning task (J. Dupont-Hadwen, S. Bestmann, C.J. Stagg, unpublished observations).</p></sec><sec><title>Duration-dependent effects of gamma tACS: evidence for homeostatic plasticity?</title><p>One striking aspect of gamma tACS-induced changes in cortical excitability was the opposite pattern of responses early (5 min) as opposed to later (15 min) during stimulation. Although not reported previously in the context of tACS, time-dependent reversal of effects have been documented frequently in studies of homeostatic plasticity in human M1, having been induced by other noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Siebner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Batsikadze et al., 2013</xref>). For example, continuous theta-burst stimulation applied to the human M1 led to an increase in corticospinal excitability, but the opposite effect was observed when the stimulation duration was doubled (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gentner et al., 2008</xref>). It is worth noting that, although the duration-dependent changes reported here appear to have a homeostatic character, they do not outlast stimulation offset. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the duration dependency of exogenously applied oscillatory currents and their potential therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec><title>After-effects of tACS on pre-movement physiological measures</title><p>Based on the state and frequency dependency of tACS effects (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feurra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Neuling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Santarnecchi et al., 2013</xref>) and the well recognized distinct patterns of changes in beta and gamma frequency power as well as cortical excitability during movement preparation (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds and Ashby, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Zaaroor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Muthukumaraswamy, 2010</xref>), here, for the first time, we also evaluated whether externally driving oscillatory activity at these frequencies can lead to plastic changes in cortical excitability, as indexed during movement preparation. We did not find any after-effect of tACS on these measures. It is plausible that any potential tACS-driven event-related physiological changes did not outlast the stimulation period. Nonetheless, the ability to evaluate the effects of exogenously applied oscillatory current on cortical excitability in an event-related paradigm, as shown here, opens the door to new investigations in the motor domain, which are likely to provide important new data on the relationship between oscillatory activity and underlying cortical excitability.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In all sessions, tACS was applied at individualized amplitude, below the individual phosphene and/or discomfort threshold. The phosphene and cutaneous perception threshold was lowest for beta tACS, in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chaieb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Turi et al., 2013</xref>), which resulted in the use of different stimulation intensities for different frequencies of tACS. We have further reported that, to the best of our knowledge, the observed effects were not related to the intensity, but rather to the frequency of stimulation, which, when at sufficient intensity, was capable of inducing the reported effects. Nonetheless, the use of the same intensity for all stimulation sessions would have been necessary to establish equivocally the frequency specificity of the findings presented here.</p><p>In addition, we did not include pre-movement TMS measures during tACS because we wished to avoid any potential interactions between stimulation and movement. However, this may have prevented us from demonstrating the relationship between oscillatory activity and the underlying cortical excitability changes that accompany the movement preparation period.</p><p>Finally, in approximately half of the participants, the frequency of beta tACS was matched to their individual peak at beta frequency based on the MEG data acquired in Session 1. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of small intraindividual variations in the beta-band peak across sessions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that driving gamma frequency oscillations using tACS leads to significant, duration-dependent changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition. We also show for the first time a clear relationship between the change in magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition induced by stimulation and the magnitude of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition observed during task-related synchronization of oscillations in inhibitory interneuronal circuits, supporting the hypothesis that tACS engages endogenous oscillatory circuits. Further, gamma tACS-induced change in inhibition was closely related to an individual's ability to learn a motor task. The findings presented here contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of motor rhythms and suggest that tACS modulates local endogenous circuits in a behaviorally relevant manner, offering the possibility of developing tACS as a potential therapeutic tool.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>This work was carried out in the National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre based at Oxford University Hospitals, National Health Service Foundation Trust, Oxford University.
