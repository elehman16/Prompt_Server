It involves a network of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6. Furthermore, there is an up regulation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF) &#x003ba;B. It has previously been shown that clonidine is able to significantly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in surgical patients. We therefore hypothesise that the clinically used central alpha-2 agonist clonidine has the ability to improve survival in experimental sepsis by inhibiting the sympathetic tone and consequently inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine release.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To investigate this therapeutic potential of clonidine in a prospective randomised laboratory investigation we used a murine model of caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced sepsis. Animals receiving pre-emptive injections were treated with either clonidine (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) or dexmedetomidine (40 &#x003bc;g/kg) 12 and 1 hours before the operation, as well as 1, 6 and 12 hours afterwards. Another group of animals only received clonidine (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) 1, 6 and 12 hours after the operation, while the pre-emptive injections were normal saline.

Besides its classical use to treat hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], its area of use has spread further and is now used as an adjunct for epidural analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and to treat withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or migraines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is also given as a pre-medication before cardiac surgery to treat cardiovascular fluctuations in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that central acting alpha-2 agonists inhibit noradrenergic neurotransmission and have a strong sedative component secondary to sympathetic inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This formerly adverse side effect is nowadays widely used in critical care settings to sedate patients and to reduce the amount of co-medication needed. A recent study has shown the beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine over lorazepam as an adjunct sedative in a critical care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore clonidine is an integral part of the sedation regimen in German intensive care units (ICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of central acting alpha-2 agonists like clonidine is based on their ability to reduce the central sympathetic tone by stimulating central alpha-2 receptors in the medulla oblongata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the balance shifts to the benefit of the parasympathetic nervous system. The exact pathway is not yet known, but recent evidence points towards the involvement of cerebral binding receptors for imidazol in the signal transduction cascade of clonidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The same mechanism of action is also true for dexmedetomidine, which is even more specific in acting as a central alpha-2 agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Sepsis is one of the main causes of death in European and US ICUs. The onset and perpetuation of inflammation involves a complex network of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, causing upregulation of controlling transcription factors such as nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unbalanced overproduction of these mediators provokes overwhelming reactions resulting in systemic inflammation and eventually lethal multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Evidence that the clinically used medication clonidine has the potential to be a prophylactic option in treating sepsis has come from Kim and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. They have shown that clonidine pre-medication is able to significantly reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in patients undergoing hysterectomy. Another recent study has shown that clonidine used as an adjunct sedative in critically ill patients was able to reduce the occurrence of pneumonia in those patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We therefore hypothesise that the clinically used central alpha-2 agonist clonidine has the ability to improve survival in experimental sepsis by inhibiting the sympathetic tone and consequently inhibiting the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Caecal ligation and puncture</title><p>Caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] after approval by the appropriate local review committee and in compliance with governmental guidelines. In brief, female C57BL/6 mice aged 12 to 16 weeks were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg ketamine (Ketanest, Pfizer Pharma, Karlsruhe, Germany). The caecum was exposed through a 1.0 to 1.5 cm abdominal midline incision and subjected to a ligation 6 mm from the caecal tip followed by a single puncture with a G23 needle. A small amount of stool was expelled from the puncture to ensure patency. The caecum was returned into the peritoneal cavity and the abdominal incision was closed by layers with 5/0 prolene thread (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany). No antibiotics were administered in this model. For the sham-operated mice serving as controls, the caecum was mobilised but no ligation or puncture was performed.</p><p>Animals receiving pre-emptive injections were treated with either clonidine (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) or dexmedetomidine (40 &#x003bc;g/kg) 12 and 1 hours before the operation, as well as 1, 6 and 12 hours afterwards. Another group of animals only received clonidine (5 &#x003bc;g/kg) 1, 6 and 12 hours after the operation, while the pre-emptive injections were of normal saline. The control groups for each intervention received solvent (0.9% saline) injections at the corresponding time points. All injections were given intra-peritoneal. CLP was performed blinded to the identity of the treatment group. Survival after CLP was assessed four to six times a day for at least five days. Blood pressure was measured in anaesthetised mice with femoral manometric catheters 0, 6 and 24 hours after CLP.</p><p>To harvest blood for determination of cytokines, mice from the pre-emptive clonidine group and their corresponding controls were deeply anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injections of 30 &#x003bc;l/g Avertin (stock: 1 g tribromethanol/620 &#x003bc;l 2-methyl-1-butanol, 180 &#x003bc;l per 10 ml 0.9% sodium chloride (Braun, Melsungen, Germany)) 24 hours after CLP. To conduct electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis and ELISA, the liver was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</title><p>Nuclear proteins from snap-frozen mouse tissues were isolated as described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Specificity of binding was ascertained by competition with a 160-fold molar excess of unlabelled consensus oligonucleotides. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound DNA probes by electrophoresis through 5% native polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol and 0.5&#x000d7; tris-borate EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) at -80&#x000b0;C using intensifying screens for 48 to 60 hours.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>incubation of whole blood samples</title><p>The ethical principles as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki were honoured in the present study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg (S-123/2008). Venous blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of healthy volunteers after giving their informed consent. After discarding the first 2 mL, blood was collected in one 10th volume of citrate (3.8%, Becton Dickinson Vacutainer, New Jersey, USA) and samples were immediately used for the experiments. The samples were incubated for 24 hours either with lipopolysaccharide (1 &#x003bc;g) alone, with clonidine alone (10<sup>-4 </sup>M) or with LPS (1 &#x003bc;g) plus clonidine (10<sup>-4 </sup>M). In the latter experiments clonidine was added one hour before LPS administration. This was followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm, the serum was frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until ELISA was performed</p></sec><sec><title>ELISA</title><p>Plasma and supernatants were subjected to ELISA for determination of Il-1&#x003b2;, Il-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; contents.

The means of the groups were compared by analysis of variance using the Student's t-test. When Kaplan-Meier estimates of group survival distributions are shown, the logrank test was used to compare two or more survival distributions. A result was denoted as statistically significant if the p-value of its corresponding test statistic was less than 0.05.

At baseline (performance of CLP), blood pressures did not differ between both groups (114.0 &#x000b1; 9.9 mmHg versus 109.7 &#x000b1; 3.2 mmHg; p = 0.69). Furthermore, there was no difference between the two groups after six hours (97.0 &#x000b1; 3.4 mmHg versus 96.1 &#x000b1; 6.0 mmHg; p = 0.90) and there was no difference when compared with baseline (control group, baseline versus six hours: p = 0.08 and clonidine, baseline versus six hours: p = 0.10). However, after 24 hours mice receiving a pre-emptive administration of clonidine had relatively preserved blood pressures when compared with baseline (93.7 &#x000b1; 4.6 mmHg versus 109.7 &#x000b1; 3.2 mmHg; p = 0.02) while the control animals were significantly hypotensive when compared with baseline (114.0 &#x000b1; 9.9 mmHg versus 76.4 &#x000b1; 5.4 mmHg; p = 0.002) and also when compared with animals pre-emptively treated with clonidine (76.4 &#x000b1; 5.4 mmHg versus 93.7 &#x000b1; 4.6 mmHg; p = 0.024).</p><p>These results show that clonidine is not causing significant hypotension that contributes to its effect of prolonging survival or lowering cytokine response.

As pro-inflammatory markers we choose IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, as in the animal experiments. Administration of clonidine alone had no effect on the concentrations of either mediator chosen, compared with untreated controls (data not shown). Incubation with LPS on the other hand (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) showed a marked increase of each mediator compared with the untreated controls (LPS alone versus untreated control: p = 0.0005; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This increase of IL-1&#x003b2; after LPS incubation did not significantly differ from incubation with LPS plus clonidine (LPS alone versus LPS plus clonidine 10<sup>-4</sup>: p = 0.89; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The same was true for IL-6, which increased about the same amount after incubation with LPS alone or with LPS plus clonidine (LPS alone versus untreated control: p = 0.0001; LPS alone versus LPS plus clonidine 10<sup>-4</sup>: p = 0.88; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

This points to the importance of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in mediating an inflammatory response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown in this study that pre-emptive administration of clonidine or dexmedetomidine is able to significantly improve survival in sepsis induced by CLP. This is accompanied by a reduction in the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, as well as a decrease in NF-kB binding activity, thereby inhibiting an overwhelming inflammation response to sepsis.</p><p>The use of central alpha-2 agonists as an adjunct sedative in critically ill patients in an ICU setting has been discussed in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A first hint that sympatholytics are beneficial in sedating ICU patients comes from Pandharipande and colleagues who additionally refer to a vagomimetic component of dexmedetomidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They have shown that sedation with dexmedetomidine instead of lorazpam not only leads to significantly less delirum or coma, but also improves survival in those patients. Unfortunately, they did not report the incidence of sepsis in their patients. Another recent study, however, was able to show that patients treated with clonidine for alcohol withdrawl had significantly less pneumonia than those treated without a sympatholytic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>To determine the exact survival benefit in sepsis after sympathetic inhibition, we performed CLP, which causes lethal peritonitis by microbial infection and is a valid animal model for human sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Pre-emptive administration of either clonidine or dexmedetomidine was potent enough to significantly reduce mortality in CLP-induced sepsis. This supports the reasoning to consider the use of a sympatholytic drug as an adjunct sedative in both high-risk patients before undergoing major surgery and in ICU patients prone to sepsis. When the administration of clonidine was delayed until after the operation, no further protective effect could be elicited. This is consistent with previous studies that also failed to show a protective effect of late activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It contradicts the findings of Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] who demonstrated that nicotine treatment could be delayed for 24 hours after sepsis induction. This might be at least in part explained by the use of antibiotics in the study, whereas our animals did not receive any antibiotic treatment. Also different mice strains were used in that study which may be different in the susceptibility to CLP-induced peritonitis.</p><p>The improved survival in pre-emptively treated animals correlates with a reduction in NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity shown by EMSA. This corresponds to previous findings, showing a similar blunting of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway on activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is well known that most inflammatory signals merge in activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and NF-&#x003ba;B has been shown to play a critical role in modulating mortality in experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and clinical sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, the elicited down-regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity after clonidine administration is a potential explanation for the improved survival in CLP-induced sepsis as shown here.</p><p>Furthermore pre-emptive administration of clonidine significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;, although these pro-inflammatory cytokines were still detectable in considerable concentrations. However, it has been shown that complete elimination of TNF-&#x003b1; after CLP-induced sepsis coincides with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although increased levels of IL-6 seem to be predictive for poor survival and increased infectious complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Sympatholysis might therefore be sufficient to reduce cytokine levels low enough to prevent septic shock and consecutive death. It might also be necessary not to decrease cytokines too low in order to be sufficient for clearing bacterial infections.</p><p>Our study showed that peripheral <italic>in vitro </italic>administration of clonidine is not sufficient to reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines measured. This finding supports the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of clonidine is not peripherally mediated but rather based on its ability to centrally activate alpha-2 receptors and thereby decrease sympathetic tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To date, the role of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system has not been readily established. Recent studies, however, have suggested that there seems to be a connection between the central muscarinic network and the vagal cholinergic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], influencing each other. Furthermore, it has been shown that activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway by vagal stimulation can be utilised to protect against experimental sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This was performed either directly by injection of nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], electrical stimulation of the vagal nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or indirectly by increasing the amount of acetylcholine (Ach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our study points toward the possibility that direct sympatholysis might be sufficient enough to activate this pathway. It is interesting that the effect of clonidine does not correlate with significant hypotension that contributes to prolonging survival and lowering cytokine response. In fact the pre-emptively treated animals have improved blood pressure control and less hypotension than untreated ones.</p><p>Our study is limited by the use of ketamine as an anaesthetic for the CLP procedure. Ketamine is a noncompetitve inhibitor of the nicotinic Ach-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] that might leave the receptor unresponsive to Ach elevations induced by changes in vagal tone. However, in our study, animals received only a single dose of ketamine and the elimination half time of ketamine is about three hours. This might have attenuated the effects observed for the treatment with clonidine, which might have been even more pronounced if anaesthesia had been achieved using a different drug. Furthermore, there is also significant modulation of the Ach-haemostasis during surgical interventions.</p><p>Nevertheless, pre-emptive administration of either clonidine or dexmedetomidine was potent enough to significantly reduce mortality in CLP-induced sepsis. This supports the rationale to use clonidine or dexmedetomidine as an adjunct sedative in an ICU setting in order to reduce the occurrence of sepsis. Furthermore, administration of a central acting alpha-2 agonist might be considered as a pre-emptive therapeutic option in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate that the clinically used central acting alpha-2 agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine improve survival in murine experimental sepsis. This is most probably due to their sympatholytic effects that lead to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. Our findings provide a rationale for further exploration and may have important implications for the use of clonidine or dexmedetomidine as adjunct sedatives in the pre-emptive treatment of patients with a high risk for developing sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; The clinically used central acting alpha-2 agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidene improve survival in murine experimental sepsis</p><p>&#x02022; Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators due to sympatholytic effects of above mentioned drugs most probably responsible for this effect</p><p>&#x02022; Sympatholytics like clonidine or dexmedetomidine may therefore be useful adjunct sedatives in the pre-emptive treatment of patients with a high risk for developing sepsis</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Ach: acetylcholine; CLP: caecal ligation and puncture; ELISA: enzyme immunosorbent assay; EMSA: electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ICU: intensive care unit; IL: interleukin; NF: nuclear factor; SEM: standard error of the mean; TNF: tumour necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SH, JS, TW, MW and EM designed the study.
