In addition to reducing the bone height, it alters the morphologic features of bone leading to an array of osseous defects or deformities. Such periodontal bony defects need to be treated since the pattern of behavior of gingiva is conditioned by the architecture of the underlying supporting alveolar bone. These deformities of the alveolar bone unless corrected may interfere with the eradication of the pockets and make the maintenance difficult, thereby leading to recurrence of the disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The ideal goal of periodontal therapy is the reconstruction of the bone and ligamentous attachment that have been destroyed by the disease. Several studies have shown that conventional periodontal therapeutic procedures do not result in regeneration of the supporting tissues, to a predictable degree.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>This has led to various attempts to reconstruct lost periodontium by using different regenerative methods, one of which is bone grafting procedure. The use of bone grafts to promote periodontal regeneration has been the subject of extensive interest. From the time of Hegedus in 1923[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and through the studies of Schallhorn in 1970's showed the usefulness of osseous grafts in infrabony defects in order to improve bone regeneration and achieve a greater amount of new connective tissue attachment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Currently, a bone substitute based upon the inorganic component of bone, a natural derived porous bone mineral of bovine origin called Bio-Oss&#x02122; manufactured in Wolhusen and marketed by Geistlich Biomaterials, a Swiss company, has been used in periodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery. It promises to be biocompatible and supports bone formation. Its morphology, porosity, internal surface, crystalline structure, and chemical composition are reported to be similar to that of human bone. In experimental studies, Bio-Oss&#x02122; was found to resorb slowly and integrate in natural remodeling process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Considering all the above factors the present study has been taken up with the following aims and objectives:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate Bio-Oss&#x02122; a bovine-derived xenograft in the repair of human infrabony vertical defects resulting from moderate to advanced periodontal disease and compare with conventional open flap debridement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the amount of reduction from baseline osseous defect depth parameters and amount of bone fill subsequent to grafting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine whether the use of this graft would improve the periodontal status of the involved teeth, such as reduction in probing pocket depths, gain in clinical attachment after six months and compare the results obtained with conventional open flap operation without using any graft.</p></list-item></list>

Intrasulcular incisions with reflection of full thickness flaps were utilized to retain as much soft tissue as possible in order to obtain primary closure. Vertical releasing incisions were not required in any of the patients. Complete debridement of the osseous defect and thorough root planing were done using curettes.

There has been a complete shift from resective pocket eradicative procedures to techniques and methods aimed at regeneration and conservation of the periodontium. Bone being the crux of periodontal disease has obviously received lot of attention. A number of bone grafts have been used in different clinical trials with different degree of success. Upon analysis of the various clinical reports it is seen that most of the bone graft materials such as DFDBA, FDBA, Hydroxyapatite, Ceramics etc., have resulted in significant improvement in the clinical parameters. However, the amount of bone fill, the type of bone tissue that has formed, the exact nature of healing have not been consistent. Many of these bone grafts have been found to be no more than fillers of bone defects without demonstrating any osteogenic or osteoconductive potential.</p><p>In the present study, Bio-Oss&#x02122; the natural porous bone mineral resulted in significant improvement of all clinical parameters with a mean bone fill of 54.065%. This compares well with the results obtained in other studies using other types of bone grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] This is also comparable to the study of Richardson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] where the bone fill was reported to be 55.8% using Bio-Oss&#x02122;.</p><p>Another significant aspect of this study is the negligible amount of bone fill in sites of open flap debridement without the use of graft. This feature was seen despite considerable improvement in other clinical parameters like reduction in probing pocket depth and gain in attachment level. It should be noted here that all the other factors remained the same between experimental and control sites. Hence, this study proves yet again that conventional periodontal therapy does not result in significant bone fill.</p><p>Most of the sites treated with simple surgical debridement demonstrated some degree of crestal bone loss (mean - 0.20 mm). Only one site treated with Bio-Oss&#x02122; demonstrated crestal bone loss. Four sites showed no difference in the crestal height before and after the study period. Seven sites demonstrated some degree of increase in the height of the alveolar crest (mean 0.10 mm). This compares with the studies of Meffert <italic>et al</italic>., where hydroxyapatite was used and Schallhorn RG and Hiatt WH[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] where cross-matched iliac allograft of cancellous bone and marrow was used. The reason for crestal bone loss in the solitary case could have been due to the presence of a very wide osseous defect where it would not have been possible to fill up the entire defect with the graft material.</p><p>One of the advantages of using any of the popular bone graft material in vogue the minimum recession of the gingiva that is seen post-operatively. In the present study also sites treated with Bio-Oss&#x02122; showed significantly less recession than the control sites.</p><p>Like in earlier studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Bio-Oss&#x02122; exhibited favorable handling properties such as:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Ease of delivery to the site,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ease of packing the material into the defect,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ability of the material to demonstrate an adhesion once placed in the defect, even with significant hemorrhage of the wound site, providing a stable graft.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The type of bone defects taken up in this study varied from three-walled defects to one-walled defects, often combined ones. Whereas, in strictly three-walled so called intrabony defects the potential for bone fill is quite predictable, this is not so with combined or bizarre defects. Hence, from the results of this study, it appears that morphologic variations in the osseous defects did not interfere with the efficacy of Bio-Oss&#x02122;.</p><p>The methods employed for evaluating the results of this study were simple. Many other studies advocated reentry procedure at the end of the study period to assess the results. However, re-entry was not considered in this study as the procedure although enables changes in the bone levels to be measured visually, still does not show the actual type of healing that has occurred. Since none of the teeth included in the study required extraction histological study was obviously not taken up.</p><p>The results of this study suggested that Bio-Oss&#x02122; as a bone graft material is quite predictable when used in infrabony defects in bringing about bone fill and improvement in clinical parameters. However, further investigation with a larger sample on a prolonged post-operative follow-up is required to conclusively establish the efficacy of this material. Further, histological evaluation to determine other changes such as the type of new bone that is formed, any evidence of cementogenesis, regeneration of the attachment apparatus should be taken up in the future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study envisaged to evaluate the efficacy of a bovine derived xenograft Bio-Oss&#x02122; and to compare with open flap debridement in human infrabony periodontal defects.</p><p>Twelve patients who were diagnosed to have adult periodontitis having at least two angular defects were taken up for the study. Periodontal flap operations were carried out in the selected sites. Twelve sites were filled with Bio-Oss&#x02122; constituting the experimental group and the other 12 sites were surgically debrided without graft placement thereby serving as controls. The results showed that significant improvement in all clinical parameters were observed in sites treated with Bio-Oss&#x02122; than compared to control sites. This included reduction in probing pocket depth, gain in attachment level and bone fill. In addition sites treated with Bio-Oss&#x02122; demonstrated minimum post-surgical gingival recession compared to control sites.</p><p>The control sites although exhibited considerable reduction in probing pocket depth and gain of attachment did not however show any appreciable bone fill.
