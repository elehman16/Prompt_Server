(developed for this purpose), comparing the effect of its use on the accuracy of
working cast of implant-supported restorations to the conventional vibrator. </p></sec><sec><title>Material and methods</title><p>From a master cast with 2 implants, 30 transfer moldings were made randomly and
divided into three groups: Group I (GI): pouring performed in an outsourced dental

prostheses enabling security, comfort and longevity to treatment. The beginning of the
construction of prosthetic treatment requires the faithful reproduction of the working
cast of the situation found in mouth, to reduce the errors inherent to this
stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Numerous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup> have tried to find the "perfect" fit between prosthetic
components and the implant. However, the variables found in the steps of the clinical
and laboratory procedures involved in the fabrication prostheses become an obstacle in
the search for a perfect fit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>, leading
to errors that make it impossible to obtain a dental implant with a perfect framework
fit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>During the production stages of a cast, some processes may influence the correct
analogue position of the working cast, increasing the chances of distortion and misfit
of the final prosthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>. The casting
material used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>, the casting
technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> and the casting
impression conditions are factors that can influence the accurate reproduction of the
clinical situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Another important aspect to be considered is the step of sending the molds to the
laboratory. A study by Christensen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>
(1997) demonstrated that most jobs ready to be poured with gypsum were deficient in some
aspect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>. The
literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>, although large
and concerned with the techniques and impression materials, is scarce when dealing with
the variables of everyday practice. A small number of studies focused on the influence
of factors such as casting of the plaster cast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> or the technique for casting on dimensional changes of the
casts.</p><p>In an attempt to minimize distortions in the procedures for obtaining a working cast,
improve the accuracy of implant prostheses and assist dentists, we developed a small,
silent and portable vibrator. We hypothesized that this device would be able to reduce
the vibration generated by conventional devices, thus leading to fewer changes in the
working cast, better adaptation between the cylinders of implant-supported dentures and
their respective analogues. This would result in a more faithful copy of the situation
in the mouth, with minimal bubbles and dimensional change in the working cast.</p><p>The purposes of this study were to test the technique of casting plaster using this
portable vibrator device, comparing it with conventional methods, and to evaluate the
influence of this device on the position of implant analogue working casts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>A master acrylic resin template (Palaton - Dencril, Pirassununga, SP, Brazil) of a Class
IV edentulous maxillary arch, with two external hexagonal implants &#x000d8; 3.75x11 mm (Master
Screw; Conex&#x000e3;o Sistemas de Pr&#x000f3;teses, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) positioned in the region of
the maxillary right lateral incisor (A) and maxillary left lateral incisor (B) was
manufactured for the study design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Two
abutments (Micro-unit; Conex&#x000e3;o Sistemas de Pr&#x000f3;teses, Aruj&#x000e1;, SP, Brazil) were installed
by manual ratchet key until a torque of 20 N.cm was produced according to the
manufacturer's directions and 30 transfer moldings were made with open trays. This cast
was then randomly divided into three groups, depending on the plaster casting
technique:</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Step-by-step fabrication of the portable device designed to casting plaster (a):
electric toothbrush; (b): bristles of the brush removed; (c): hole on tip of the
toothbrush in place of the bristles; (d): installation of the tip of a brush on
the opposite side of the bristles and (e): portable vibrator ready</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-05-0517-g01"/></fig><p>Group I (GI):pouring performed at an outsourced dental laboratory with conventional
plaster vibrator (10 casts);</p><p>Group II (GII):pouring performed at UFSC laboratory with conventional plaster vibrator
(10 casts);</p><p>Group III (GIII): pouring performed with the portable vibrator fabricated for this study
(10 casts).</p><p>To make the impressions, standard size (no. 3) perforated plastic trays were used (JG,
JON, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil), with an opening at the top of two holes designed for the
removal of screws for transferring squares. The material of choice for the impression
was polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) (Express XT Silicone Addition, 3M ESPE, USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup> and manipulation was done by the single
step double impression technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>. The transfer copings were screwed in
their abutments in the master cast and splinted together with a metal rod and acrylic
pattern resin (Trim Plus Red - Acrylic Pattern; Harry J. Bosworth Company, Skokie, IL,
USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>, reducing the distortion
of polymerization. After 10 min of union with transferring acrylic resin, heavy-body PVS
was handled according to the manufacturer's instructions and the tray was loaded with
the material, while light-body PVS was injected into the region of the implants and
their components. To standardize the molding, heavy-body PVS was measured in a plastic
syringe injector for elastomer (JON) filled with slurry by cast. Setting of the dummy
tray was held constant with manual pressure until it clicked into a reference point
located on the mannequin, then held in position for 10 min to complete polymerization of
the material. All impressions were made in the same temperature-controlled air
conditioning between 18&#x000ba;C and 22&#x000ba;C. After the mold was ready, the transfer copings were
loosened to remove the impression and screwed to the respective analogues of the
abutments (Conex&#x000e3;o Sistemas de Pr&#x000f3;teses). For all transfer copings a torque of 10 N.cm
was applied manually with a keyed ratchet (Conex&#x000e3;o Sistemas de Pr&#x000f3;teses), but the
placement of analogues was performed with a digital grip, because the torque applied by
a 10 N.cm ratchet could cause rotation of the transferor PVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Adaptation of
impressions prior to the tightening grip and digital analogue was again verified by the
transferor with explorer no. 05 (Duflex SS White, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil).</p><p>When the impressions were ready, with the union of the analogues, they were randomly
assigned to groups according to the technique of casting plaster. The 30 plaster casts
used microgranulated special type IV plaster (Durone, Dentisply, Petr&#x000f3;polis, RJ,
Brazil), and pouring was conducted in an area for at least 60 min and at most 3 days
after the order was ready.</p><sec><title>Fabricating the portable vibrator</title><p>For casting plaster of Group III, we developed a portable vibrator made from an
electric toothbrush (360&#x000ba; Sonic Power, Colgate Palmolive Ind. e Com. S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP,
Brazil). The bristles of the brush were removed using a carborundum disk-type cutter
and maxi-cut, and a hole in the place of the bristles was made for installation of
the tip of a brush on the opposite side (round marta brush Tropical 006, Tigre, S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, SP, Brazil), maintaining a slight inclination toward the end to facilitate
placement of the plaster inside the impression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Casting molds for Group I</title><p>Ten impressions were sent to the outsourced laboratory, in a routine procedure for
work on prosthetic implants. Along with the impressions, an order tab was included
with the request for plaster casting of special type IV, for a minimum
standardization with the other groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Casting molds for Groups II and III</title><p>The casts of Groups II and III were poured with 100 g of powder type IV gypsum,
proportioned to 22 mL of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup> and hand-mixed for 60 s. Insertion of
the plaster cast was performed according to the technique assigned to each group,
with Group II using the leaked vibrator with conventional casting and Group III with
the portable vibrator. After a period of at least 1 h of setting time for the
plaster, the working casts were removed from the mold. All casts were stored at room
temperature for at least 92 h before assessment of misfit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. To standardize the samples, all steps of molding,
tooling, and casting of plaster were made by the researcher in charge, while handling
the PVS was done by an assistant operator.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of discrepancies in the position of casts and analogues</title><p>Verification of the accuracy of the position of analogues and comparison between
groups was performed to develop an infrastructure (IE) from two metal cylinders of
titanium abutment micro-unit, bolted to the abutment of the master cast (MC) and
joined together by a titanium bar and laser welding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>To calculate the misfit of the casts and make comparisons between groups, we measured
the vertical misfit of IE in the MC to verify the reliability of the adaptation and
the value of the initial IE misfit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. Then, the evaluations also were carried out in testing casts
(TC) of Groups I, II, and III, with IE placed on them, whose respective averages were
subtracted from the initial value obtained for MC in order to obtain the real misfit
value. The implants of MC and related analogues of the tested casts were recorded as
A and B, from left to right, as with the cylinders of IE. Evaluation of misfit was
based on the protocol of tightening the screw only to test the passivity of the
implant structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup>, which had the
grip of a retainer and evaluation of the contrary retainer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Infrastructure placed on the master cast (MC) (a) and the test cast (TC) (b) to

1.0 &#x000b5;m (UHL MM-100-BT, UK), equipped with a digital camera (KC-512NT; Kodo BR
Electronics Ltd., S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and analyzer unit (QC 220-HH Quadra-Check
200; Metronics Inc., Bedford, NH, USA). The casts were placed randomly under the
microscope so that the blind evaluator did not know to which group they belonged. All
casts were evaluated at identical points and cylinders A and B of IE were marked with
a carborundum disk &#x000d8; 75x0.2 mm on the handpiece.</p><p>The readings were performed by an examiner on two calibrated points on the buccal (1
and 2) and two in the lingual face (3 and 4), ordered from left to right. The
sequence of assessment was followed by the tightening of the screw in the implant B
with 10 N.cm and measuring the distance in micrometers (&#x000b5;m) of 1-4 points on the
interface of the cylinder to the abutment/analogue interface, identifying the
considered misfit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). The same
procedure was then performed for B. Each point was measured three times and the
average value used for the analysis.</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Microscopic image of the misfit generated at the interface of one point</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-05-0517-g03"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Means and standard deviations for each plaster casting technique were calculated and

produces a smaller misfit between cylinders of implant-supported dentures and their
respective analogues in comparison with the conventional techniques for casting
plaster.</p><fig id="f04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Means and standard deviations(SD) of the misfit (&#x003bc;m) for the three groups.

followed to reduce errors and obtain a clinically acceptable product. According to
dental knowledge, the larger the number of pontics and retainers in prosthesis, the
greater the chances of mismatch. Since the installation of the abutment to the working
model, there are countless chances of errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. Also, the fact that the analogues are screwed to the
implant makes them susceptible to displacement, especially during vibration of plaster
during pouring.</p><p>This work aimed to check the effectiveness of a new portable vibrator on the plaster
pouring of implant-supported dentures, also to verify if this device reduces the
possibility of misfit between cylinders of implant-supported dentures and their
respective analogues. The results of the present work showed that the portable vibrator
led to lower misfit values between cylinders of implant-supported dentures and their
respective analogues when compared to conventional vibrator. A minimum misfit was found
when using the new vibrator, but the "perfect" adaptation is almost impossible to
reach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>Extrapolating to clinical results of acceptable misfit of an implant-supported
prosthesis, the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> is unable to show an ideal value of
adjustment that will not jeopardize the entire system for prosthetic reconstruction.
According to Tossi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> (2010) values of
marginal fit between frameworks to multiple-units are clinically acceptable within 150
&#x000b5;m range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. Carr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> (1996) in an <italic>in vivo</italic>
study on primates verified that there is no statistically significant difference in bone
response around the implants supporting frameworks with 38 &#x000b5;m and 345 &#x000b5;m
misfits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>According to literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup>
the marginal misfit can be influenced by the technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup> and by the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> used to fabricate the
frameworks. However, this research suggests that the vibration is also an important
factor at this point, reminding that it refers to just one of many steps that are
required to get a prosthetic piece. During the other steps required to complete
prosthesis fabrication, such as firing porcelain several times and finishing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> done by a laboratory technician, misfit
values will be further enhanced, thus emphasizing the importance of using laboratory
techniques and devices that decrease the possibility of distortion in the final
piece.</p><p>The new portable vibrator not only contributes to decrease the misfit, but also has the
advantage of being a small, soundless and low-cost device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The casting technique using the portable vibrator allowed a smaller misfit between the
