Vyanga is a disease which decreases the glowing complexion of face and affects the skin. Even though it is considered as kshudra roga (minor disease), it has got a major importance as a cosmetic problem in the society. It is characterized by the presence of painless and bluish-black patches on face. Treating this condition has become a problem, since safe drugs are not available for long term therapy. So the study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Arjunatwak lepa with Madhu and Panchanimba churna internally.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>For clinical study, 30 clinically diagnosed patients were registered and divided into two groups with 15 patients in each group. In Group-A patients were administered with Arjunatwak lepa with Madhu for 21days. In Group-B patients were administered with both Arjunatwak lepa with Madhu and Panchanimba churna internally for 21days</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>In Group A, out of 15 patients, 09 patients were cured completely, which was statistically significant at the level of <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01. 4 patients have shown marked improvement, 2 patients showed slight improvement. In Group B, out of 15 patients, 12 patients had attained normal skin color, which was statistically highly significant at the level of <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, 1 patient had mild improvement, 2 patients have moderate improvement. Statistically significant result was obtained in symptom bluish-black patch over the face. The clinical study has shown that combined therapy in Group-B gives better results than topical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>From the observations and results of this study, it can be concluded that combined therapy using Arjunatwak lepa along with Panchanimba churna have provided better results in depigmentation of the patches seen in Vyanga roga than local therapy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
