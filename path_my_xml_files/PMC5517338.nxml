One randomised trial has studied two- versus four-drug regimens with a duration of 12&#x000a0;months of treatment after resection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Within the European comprehensive treatment strategy for childhood LGG, the International Society of Paediatric Oncology&#x02013;Low Grade Glioma (SIOP LGG) Committee launched a randomised trial involving 118 institutions and 11 countries to investigate the addition of etoposide (100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, days 1, 2 &#x00026; 3) to a four-course induction of vincristine (1.5&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10 wkly) and carboplatin (550&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> q 3 weekly) as part of 18-month&#x000a0;continuing treatment programme. Patients were recruited after imaging diagnosis, resection or biopsy with progressive disease/symptoms. Some 497 newly diagnosed patients (M/F 231/266; median age 4.26&#x000a0;years (interquartile range (IQR) 2.02&#x02013;7.06)) were randomised to receive vincristine carboplatin (VC) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;249) or VC plus etoposide (VCE) during induction (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;248), stratified by age and tumour site.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>No differences between the two arms were found in term of survival and radiological response. Response and non-progression rates at 24&#x000a0;weeks for VC and VCE, were 46% versus 41%, and 93% versus 91% respectively; 5-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were 46% (StDev 3.5) versus 45% (StDev 3.5) and 89% (StDev 2.1) versus 89% (StDev 2.1) respectively. Age and diencephalic syndrome are adverse clinical risk factors for PFS and OS. 5-year OS for patients in early progression at week 24 were 46% (StDev 13.8) and 49% (StDev 16.5) in the two arms, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The addition of etoposide to VC did not improve PFS or OS. High non-progression rates at 24&#x000a0;weeks justify retaining VC as standard first-line therapy. Infants with diencephalic syndrome and early progression need new treatments to be tested. Future trials should use neurological/visual and toxicity outcomes and be designed to discriminate between the impact on disease outcomes of &#x02018;duration of therapy&#x02019; and &#x02018;age at stopping therapy&#x02019;.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>A randomised trial in the commonest brain tumour type in children &#x02013; low grade glioma.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Tumour response assessment at 6&#x000a0;months identifies those at greatest risk of subsequent progression and death.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Intensifying induction treatment with etoposide does not improve progression-free survival.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>International consortium successfully recruits from 11 European countries in a childhood brain tumour.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Carboplatin hypersensitivity is reduced by coadministration of etoposide.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Low grade glioma</kwd><kwd>Childhood</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>Randomised trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Childhood Low Grade Gliomas (LGGs) arise during brain growth, developing in all areas of the central nervous system (CNS). LGGs are predominantly of grade 1 histology&#x000a0;and are generally not anticipated to undergo malignant transformation during childhood. Resectability varies with location; hypothalamic-chiasmatic tumours in particular are generally considered unresectable, they present when the children are very young and can threaten vision, endocrine function and require non-surgical therapy <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The SIOP Brain Tumour LGG Subcommittee had developed a comprehensive, multimodality treatment strategy for Childhood LGG, the International Society of Paediatric Oncology&#x02013;Low Grade Glioma (SIOP LGG) committee, which was piloted and widely accepted clinically <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Patients with progressive disease post-surgery or disease threatening neurological function were considered for non-surgical treatment.</p><p>Radiotherapy (RT) had previously been the mainstay of treatment for incompletely resected LGG, but RT does not confer a survival benefit or advantage in delaying first progression <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Historically, the introduction of chemotherapy in this disease group was aimed at delaying or obviating the need for radiotherapy to minimise cognitive, endocrine and vascular consequences <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A variety of agents, given singularly and in combinations, had been tried with a variety of indications in institution-based trials, producing comparable results <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. High initial tumour non-progression rates (approximately 70&#x02013;90%) could be achieved, but 5-year PFS rates declined after stopping treatments, especially in children diagnosed who were less than 1&#x000a0;year of age <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The first SIOP LGG study was a multinational (UK, Germany &#x00026; Italy) single arm pilot study, launched to test selection criteria for non-surgical treatments in newly diagnosed patients with LGG. Non-surgical therapy was stratified by age, those &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years of age were offered VC and those &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;years of age were recommended for radiotherapy.</p><p>The 12-month chemotherapy regimen of the first SIOP LGG study comprised VC with an intensified 3-month induction and a 9-month, reduced-intensity continuing phase <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. An analysis of risk factors confirmed the improved outcome for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated visual pathway glioma (NF1-VPG), whereas NF1-negative patients had a higher risk for progression after stopping chemotherapy.</p><p>In launching this trial, we intended to investigate drug intensification in the non-NF1 group by adding etoposide to the standard VC combination, driven by reports of multiagent, Soci&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; Fran&#x000e7;aise d'Oncologie P&#x000e9;diatrique (SFOP) regimens <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the ongoing Children's Oncology Group (COG 9952) randomised trial comparing&#x000a0;two drugs (VC) versus&#x000a0;four drugs (thioguanine, procarbazine, CCNU (lomustine), vincristine [TPCV] regimen) <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Treatment duration was extended to 18&#x000a0;months, on the working hypothesis that childhood LGG is a chronic disease process, driven by normal growth across childhood and therefore requiring therapy extended over significant developmental periods. This is the first report of the results of this randomised trial of chemotherapy intensification in childhood LGG.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Study strategy and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study strategy</title><p>The International Society of Paediatric Oncology&#x02013;Low Grade Glioma subcommittee (SIOP-LGG) 2004 study was a multinational protocol for previously untreated patients aged up to 16&#x000a0;years with the histological diagnosis of a LGG according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classifications of 2000 and 2007. The radiological diagnosis of an LGG was accepted for visual pathway glioma (VPG) in non-NF1 patients with extensive visual pathway involvement and additional hypodensity of the tumour on a native computed tomography (CT)-scan.</p><p>At diagnosis, best safe resection of the primary tumour was recommended.

Therefore, at the time the study was launched, primary chemotherapy was recommended for all children aged less than 8&#x000a0;years where there was either progressive or symptomatic disease or threat to neurological functions such as loss of vision. Older children could be included to receive chemotherapy by local physician's choice.</p><p>Within the chemotherapy arm of the study, non-NF1 patients with an LGG irrespective of histological subtype or location, excluding isolated optic nerve tumours, were eligible for the prospectively randomised trial to receive either &#x02018;standard&#x02019; VC or the &#x02018;intensified regimen plus etoposide&#x02019; (VCE) during the induction period.

Volume calculation followed an approximation to the formula of the rotational ellipsoid ((a&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;c)/2). Changes in tumour size were given in % of the reference volume and categorised in progressive disease (PD, &#x0003e;25% increase in volume or new lesion), stable disease (SD, volume changes &#x0003c;25%), improvement (IMP, 25&#x02013;50% volume reduction), partial (PR, &#x0003e;50% volume reduction) and complete response (disappearance of all lesions). For the individual comparison the respective sequence had to be the same at baseline and follow-up, and if the best sequence changed also measurements had to be repeated. Contrast enhancement had no influence on staging. In non-measurable tumours for whatever reason (very irregular or poor discrimination from surrounding normal brain) volume changes were estimated, and changes were interpreted with caution. The central review process evolved during the trial with technical advances in transmitting scans. Where it was carried out, the reviewers noted that the treatment centres underestimated response, making it unlikely that the response rates are an overestimate.</p><p>Assessment of ophthalmological function was detailed in the protocol and response was graded as &#x02018;better, same, worse&#x02019;, as no internationally consented response criteria had been available.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Material and methods</title><p>All trial patients who were randomised to be treated with chemotherapy between 1st April 2004, and 14th April 2014 and followed-up until 31st December 2014 are included.

VC- compared to VCE-arm although proportions of interruptions due to tumour progression were similar, 69.7% versus 71% respectively. Four interruptions were due to deaths, 1 in VC-arm and 3 in VCE-arm; three were related to tumour progression, one a toxic death relating to an infant with severe DS who died within the&#x000a0;1st week of treatment from a Rotavirus sepsis that pre-dated commencing therapy. The protocol specified non-infectious status as a prerequisite for starting chemotherapy.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in patients in both arms, being less frequent in VCE (31/242 VC and 17/236 VCE). Most allergic events were managed according to protocol recommendations (82%), with the consequences listed in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. During consolidation, the frequency of hypersensitivity events continued to be lower in the group in the VCE arm during induction (VC n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;117, VCE n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;44 patients). Mild hypersensitivity reactions were associated with no consequences, during induction in 53.7% (VC) and 72.2% (VCE), during consolidation in 35.1% (VC) and 33.8% (VCE). A switch of treatment to recommended alternatives occurred in 78/185 events in 117 patients (VC) and 24/71 events in 44 patients (VCE) during the consolidation phase. This difference in hypersensitivity rates between the two arms of the trial was an unexpected finding. The variation in alternative regimens used after discontinuation of carboplatin therapy precluded us from trying to analyse the impact of hypersensitivity on subsequent tumour responsiveness or toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Response assessment</title><p>Response assessment was scheduled at 24&#x000a0;weeks from the start of treatment and performed after a median time of 24.3&#x000a0;weeks for the evaluable patients on an intention-to-treat basis. Comparing VC (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;211) and VCE (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;210) using available scans, radiological response comprised volume reduction&#x000a0;respectively, in 46% versus 41%, stable disease (SD) in 46% versus 51%&#x000a0;and progressive disease (PD) in 7% versus 9% (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The study was designed to use PFS as primary end-point. Clinical response/progression were allocated by the treating physician. We checked information about imaging and visual assessments. Compliance was variable across national groups. Central radiological review was performed for more than 50% of MRI controls throughout the treatment phase. The proportion of reviewed scans increased during the course of treatment, as technical solutions for sharing scans improved in national health systems in some countries.</p><p>Neurological improvement or stabilisation was reported for three quarters of patients (VC 75.3%, VCE 77.8%), but we lack information as to whether this can be attributed to treatment or to rehabilitation. An accurate assessment of visual function and specifically of visual acuity in response to treatment is available only in a limited number of patients. Overall, ophthalmologic response (predominantly visual acuity) for patients with VPG was reported better/stable in 48/78 VC- (61.5%) and 35/68 VCE-patients (51.5%), and deteriorated in 6/78 (7.7%) versus 7/68 (10.3%).

It has recruited patients after diagnosis using standardised selection criteria for high risk or actual, progression. The proposed hypothesis, that the addition of a third drug to intensify treatment will improve response rates and PFS, is not supported.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Main question of the trial</title><p>The response rates in the two arms VC and VCE, respectively, were 46% versus 41% for volume reduction (CR, PR, OR), and non-progression rates were 93% versus 91% at 24 weeks after the start of treatment. The 5-year PFS and OS survival rates for VC and VCE arm were 46% and 45% (PFS) and 89% and 89% (OS).</p><p>Due to differences in eligibility criteria and treatment details, comparison of our results to the only other randomised trial in this disease (COG 9952) <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> is difficult. Also the time-point of evaluating patient and tumour status differed. Response rates in the COG trial were assessed at the end of one year's chemotherapy and excluded those who had dropped out during treatment. The non-progression rate in the COG 9952 at&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;year was 68% in both arms (CV: complete/partial 35%, minor 15%, stable disease 17%; TPCV: complete/partial 30%, minor 22%, stable disease 16%). Their 5-year Event Free Survival (EFS) was 39% for the CV- and 52% for the TPCV-arm, and 5-year OS was 86% for CV and 87% for TPCV. Their analysis identified significant sustained EFS advantage for the TPCV drug regimen, using a &#x02018;cure model&#x02019;. Their EFS results bracket our 5-year PFS results, whilst the OS results are similar.</p><p>For the CV arm in COG 9952 5-year EFS was 34%, while 5-year PFS in SIOP-LGG 2004 was 46% for the VC-arm. The two protocols differ with respect to length of treatment and dosing scheduling of the drugs. In the SIOP-LGG 2004, carboplatin (550&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was given 3-weekly in induction, 4-weekly in intensification phase prior to week 24 and 6-weekly during continuation phase for 12&#x000a0;months. In COG study, carboplatin (175&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was given weekly for induction over 10&#x000a0;weeks and during the continuation phase but at a reduced intensity. Another difference between the studies is the duration of therapy. Only a possible prospective randomised trial could solve the issue, if the difference in carboplatin scheduling and in the duration of therapy could have some impact on EFS or PFS. One of the reasons to prolong the 12-month vincristine&#x02013;carboplatin therapy of the SIOP-group had been the convincing EFS of the original vincristine-carboplatin regimen, which lasted for 84&#x000a0;weeks <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. But the question of the &#x02018;optimal&#x02019; duration of chemotherapy for LGG has never been addressed properly until this study.</p><p>The other significant difference between the two studies is the choice of drugs in this patient group who are very young and who have enhanced familial cancer risk implicated by their tumour diagnosis <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The COG 4 drug arm (TPCV) includes three drugs with known genotoxicity at significant cumulative doses (6 thioguanine, 640&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>; procarbazine 1600&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>; CCNU 880&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The SIOP VCE arm specified etoposide at a ceiling cumulative dose of 1200&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> in order to limit exposure and the known risk of secondary AML. VC is considered of low genotoxicity although carboplatin is an alkylating agent. The histology of the one secondary malignancy in the VCE-arm in this study could not be retrieved. The higher 5-year EFS for TPCV in COG 9952 is of interest, however it did not translate to improved OS. It is our understanding the TPCV is not in routine use in USA despite the improved EFS rate. Concern about the risk of second malignancy may be a factor.</p><p>Definitions of response have been standardised internationally <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and central review of radiologic response assessment was organised nationally in our trial. The impact of timing of response assessment has not been investigated previously. Our choice of week 24 as main time point for response assessment was driven by the concept of slow growing and thus slowly reacting tumours. In this trial's analysis, progression at week 24 proved to be the most important risk factor for death in the multivariable model, OS being only 46% and 49% for patients in PD at week 24 after both VC and VCE, with a hazard ratio of 16.96. This risk factor has not been reported previously.</p><p>The relevance of tumour response to chemotherapy for the functional status has to be considered in conjunction with the primary goal to defer radiotherapy. While there were some reports on the improvement of DS with chemotherapy <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and the ophthalmologic outcomes were better for responders in the French series <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, no trial had assessed visual or neurological outcome in detail <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our trial reports clinical improvement or stabilisation for the majority of our patients following induction. The difficulties we encountered in assessing visual response, particularly in very young children, were linked to a lack of standardisation of visual and clinical measurements and weak clinical contact with specialists in measurement of visual function by trial participants, which impaired compliance with reporting. Nevertheless, for the majority of patients with visual pathway glioma early stabilisation/improvement of vision, mainly visual acuity, was reported. Single patient histories were rather heterogeneous, rendering it difficult to provide a comprehensive statement regarding neurologic function in view of interim surgery for hydrocephalus or tumour or second and third line non-surgical treatments during long-term follow-up.</p><p>Our patient cohort was recruited from 11 European countries, all of them with a unique national health system.

<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which were fairly complete for their countries, suggests that the large number of randomised patients is representative.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Toxicity</title><p>Overall, there were more haematological toxic events and infections reported in the VCE-arm, although overall treatment time during the induction up to week 21 did not differ between the two arms. On the other hand, fewer drug sensitivity reactions were reported in the VCE-arm. The explanation for this latter significant observation suggests an interaction between etoposide and carboplatin influencing mechanisms of hypersensitivity. Management of hypersensitivity according to protocol recommendations did not jeopardise intention-to-treat analysis. This unexpected finding could not be further analysed for the interaction between etoposide and hypersensitivity on progression risk because of diverse treatment substitutions and variations in duration of ongoing therapy after carboplatin discontinuation.</p><p>Detailed reporting of toxicities revealed a significant number of side-effects without differences between the two chemotherapy arms. It cannot be differentiated however, if they rather reflect the overall burden of treatment or the general condition of the patients (e.g. diencephalic syndrome). This relates specifically to neurotoxicity (grade 3 and 4), which was reported during induction for 18 VC- and 17 VCE-patients for motor and for 13 VC- and 14-VCE-patients for sensory impairment (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The reduced number of relevant toxicities during consolidation most probably followed the extended treatment intervals.</p><p>Thirty-eight patients interrupted induction or consolidation therapy without progression or death, (10 during induction, 28 during consolidation). During induction, four interruptions related to toxicity, and one each for non-compliance, visual deterioration, neurological deterioration, physician's and patient's decision and unknown. During consolidation ten incidents interrupted for allergy, eight for toxicity, four due to patient's refusal/intolerance, three attributable to physician's decision, three unknown. This significant proportion of patients interrupting therapy emphasises the importance of considering the tolerability of therapy, particularly for those with non-progressive disease. Selection of patients with the highest risk of progressive disease will be important to justify the use of therapies with significant risks of such toxicities in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Patient tumour and treatment-related risk factors</title><sec id="sec4.3.1"><label>4.3.1</label><title>Age</title><p>Early reports of chemotherapy in LGG had focussed on younger children below 5&#x000a0;years, but had included older patients.

Our trial confirms a noticeably lower PFS and OS for infants and children with diencephalic syndrome <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which is associated with large, centrally located tumours. The majority of patients with progression at week 24 are from this very young group with diencephalic syndrome.</p><p>This trial does identify an impaired PFS for the greater than 8-year-old group in the VCE-arm, with a lower OS for the older group in both arms. Both these observations were unexpected. We had not intended to randomise between VC and VCE in the entire larger than 8-year age group as radiotherapy was originally proposed as primary treatment for patients with progressive or symptomatic disease. Compliance with treatment allocation across all centres has not been specifically studied in this age group, nor has analysis of anatomical or symptom subtypes being offered RT versus chemotherapy. The numbers of patients from this age group are relatively small with 48 (VC) and 48 (VCE) patients being drawn from the 8- to 16-year-old age group compared to 163 (VC) and 165 (VCE) in the main 1-&#x0003c;8-year age group and 38 (VC) and 35 (VCE) in the &#x0003c;1-year group. Finally there is a greater proportion of non-pilocytic tumours at non-visual pathway supratentorial midline locations in these arms, mirroring age incidence patterns described by Stokland <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>
<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Randomisation was not stratified for histology, but non-pilocytic, i.e. diffuse astrocytoma does not predict for PFS in this analysis.</p><p>For these reasons the difference between VC and VCE regarding PFS in the older age group is of interest&#x000a0;but requires additional data and analysis to suggest an interpretation. The observation of reduced OS in the older age group similarly raises questions related to the impact of tumours arising later in childhood. The previous COG study excluded children over 10&#x000a0;years <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Future studies will need to consider carefully, stratification by age groups, obtain biological data about tumour types and recording of pubertal status if the impact of late childhood and adolescence on tumour behaviour and sensitivity to treatment is to be better understood.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.2"><label>4.3.2</label><title>Dissemination</title><p>Primary dissemination of LGG has been described to be an unfavourable prognostic factor <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, confirmed by this report with an impaired PFS.

We could not identify tumour site as a prognostic factor for PFS or OS, in contrast to the unfavourable prognosis for thalamic tumours in the COG trial <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The issue of the potential role of tumour dimension in predicting response to therapy and more importantly ultimate patients' outcome still remains an open question.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.4"><label>4.3.4</label><title>Histology</title><p>The impact of the different low grade histologies on response to chemotherapy, PFS and OS has not been systematically investigated in the past. Pilocytic astrocytoma is the majority group in all trials. Clinically diagnosed patients without biopsy are also included in previous reports, particularly where tumours involve visual pathways and hypothalamus. A trend for a higher progression rate was reported for fibrillary/diffuse astrocytoma in the COG 9952 trial <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but was not confirmed in this multivariable analysis. The analysis of Stokland identified that fibrillary/diffuse astrocytoma had a significantly lower PFS rate, the cohort included treated and untreated as well as NF1 and non-NF1 patients <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this study, histological subtype did not predict PFS but is a relevant prognostic factor for OS. We conclude that patients with diffuse glioma WHO grade 2 have a trend for poorer outcomes and need to be offered further treatment, if they progress after chemotherapy. Glioneuronal and pilocytic histology had the most favourable OS; the other groups including imaging-diagnosed patients had inferior OS.

In our trial, the presence of a postoperative residual was no indication to chemotherapy on its own. Patients also had to have severe tumour-related symptoms or tumour progression. More than 60% of patients started treatment within 3&#x000a0;months of diagnosis. Those starting treatment following a phase of observation had pure radiological progression in 19.5%, while the others had symptomatic plus radiological progression. The actual tumour dimension at the time of starting therapy was not consistently recorded particularly for visual pathway or hypothalamic-chiasmatic glioma in the present study. Thus the impact of tumour dimension on tumour response and PFS could not be reliably studied. The extent of initial tumour resection was not an independent prognostic risk factor at multivariable analysis. Residual disease alone, in our view, is not an indication for non-surgical therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.6"><label>4.3.6</label><title>Chemotherapy</title><p>With only few formal phase II studies, the introduction and use of chemotherapy for LGG largely based upon results from small patient series, including regimens with vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, cis- or carboplatin, procarbazine, CCNU, thioguanine, etoposide&#x000a0;or vinblastine <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

A comparative analysis of the respective toxicities is hampered by the heterogeneous use of drugs or combinations as first line or salvage treatments.

A revised set of internationally standardised eligibility criteria, response definitions and procedures are in development for the next generation of trials which will include ophthalmologic, neurological and QoL outcomes as primary outcome measures in addition to the standard PFS and OS.

The new MAPKinase pathway targeted drugs becoming available offer the opportunity to be tested as part of either primary therapy randomisation in newly diagnosed cases or in patients who are progressing during, or at the end of induction. Trials should be designed to discriminate between the impact of &#x02018;duration of therapy&#x02019; and &#x02018;age at stopping therapy&#x02019; as being factors that may determine progression risk. Those presenting in the 1st year of life with diencephalic syndrome and progressive disease, despite therapy, need new treatments to be tested as they are at greatest risk of suffering neurological and endocrine damage and are at high risk of death. The &#x0003e;8-year-old group needs further study to understand the interactions between age, pubertal development, histology and sensitivity to chemotherapy.<boxed-text id="dtbox1a"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="dtbox1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p>Childhood low grade glioma are predominantly pilocytic grade 1 tumours with a small proportion of grade 2 tumours and other rare entities, a proportion are diagnosed without biopsy on imaging characteristics. Together they represent 40% of all childhood brain tumours and are the commonest solid tumour of childhood requiring active management. A small proportion of these non-malignant tumours is thought to eventually transform to more malignant phenotype in adulthood. Currently there are no established predictive factors for this risk. Most are sporadic, arising within a single location including hypothalamus, chiasm, optic nerves, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord, with primary and secondary dissemination in 5&#x02013;10%. About 15% are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), with a majority of tumours affecting the visual pathways, many being multifocal, but also involving brainstem and cerebellum. In NF1, surveillance programmes of visual function are in place to identify children with visual changes justifying brain imaging. Sporadic tumours, on the other hand, present clinically throughout childhood although there are classical age distributions associated with different anatomical locations i.e. hypothalamic chiasmatic tumours most commonly present in the first 2&#x000a0;years of life, the younger the patient the larger the tumour. Cerebellar tumours can occur throughout childhood. Cortical tumours tend to occur in later childhood, as do brainstem and spinal tumours.</p><p>Multidisciplinary strategy: Previous multicentre pilot study had tested the applicability and acceptability of a multidisciplinary treatment selection versus observation strategy across Europe and found high clinical compliance. Furthermore, patient, genetic, symptom, anatomical and tumour factors had been identified as stratifying factors for treatment selection.</p><p>Treatment: Historically treatment has relied upon primary resection, where clinically feasible, without neurotoxicity. Where not feasible and if progressive, radiotherapy was used leading in many cases to severe neurotoxicity affecting the child's subsequent growth, endocrine and cognitive development and risk of second tumours. In the 1980s chemotherapy was reported to successfully control tumour progression in very young children with progressive, unresectable tumours. Vincristine and actinomycin D were used initially. We had conducted a prolonged international pilot study investigating the role of vincristine carboplatin combination in carefully selected patients which has been reported in two publications studying the impact of selection criteria on progression risk and the interaction between patient and treatment factors on progression free and overall survival.</p><p>At the time of launching this trial we knew:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>We would expect high overall survival rates (&#x0003e;85% 5-year OS) (children under 1&#x000a0;year of age at diagnosis with diencephalic syndrome and hypothalamic tumours having the poorest overall survival);</p></list-item><list-item id="u0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>over 60% of LGGs were pilocytic astrocytoma;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>grade 2 diffuse astrocytoma had poorer progression-free survival;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0050"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Visual pathway glioma and other LGGs associated with NF1 had a favourable prognosis for progression-free and overall survival.
