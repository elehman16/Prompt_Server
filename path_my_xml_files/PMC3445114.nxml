Despite rigorous physical conditioning, there is still a high risk for muscular, skeletal, and other high-velocity contact injuries that result in acute and chronic inflammation. The relationship between higher levels of circulating inflammatory eicosanoids and the associated health risk of vascular disease resulting in heart attack and strokes are rarely considered in this young man&#x02019;s game.</p><p>The National Football League (NFL) has been the leader among professional sports teams with regard to player safety and health-related issues. From the introduction of protective pads and helmets to the modern use of computers for concussion testing and collision analysis, the NFL has sought out the most modern, state-of-the-art capabilities to protect and improve the players&#x02019; well-being. Most of these previous technological improvements have involved equipment and field improvements, which have resulted in longer NFL player careers. Many players remain on active NFL rosters into their early to mid-30s when the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) starts to become significant in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941738108326978">19</xref></sup></p><sec id="section1-1941738108326978"><title>Cardiovascular Risks in NFL Players</title><p>In all organized sports the most devastating event that can occur is the death of a player, on or off the field.

Possibly the most important heart-healthy nutrients are the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA from fish and fish oil. New and important findings are continually being reported about the benefits of fish oil for those with cardiovascular disease. These include evidence from randomized, controlled, clinical trials on how omega-3 fatty acids improve heart health by reducing triglyceride levels, decreasing the growth of atherosclerotic plaques, improving arterial endothelial function, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the risk of thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941738108326978">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941738108326978">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1941738108326978">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1941738108326978">47</xref></sup></p><p>Fish oil is also a powerful supporter of the body&#x02019;s natural anti-inflammatory response, which counteracts the progression of heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941738108326978">12</xref></sup> Omega-3 fats within the endothelium reduce the inflammatory response that occurs from the oxidization of blood lipids that have invaded blood vessels. This invasion typically promotes the process of plaque development and initiates multiple atherogenic effects. Endothelial responses to oxidizing lipids within the intima cause a migration and activation of inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, which release chemotactic chemicals, in turn accelerating the inflammatory response. An increased proportion of EPA and DHA within the cell membranes reduce the inflammatory response by inhibiting the production of the proinflammatory eicosanoid PGE2 while supporting the production of anti-inflammatory PGE3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738108326978">22</xref></sup></p><p>Evidence from serum studies has shown that higher tissue levels of omega-3 fats significantly reduce the risk for heart attack.

As new research emerges, it is becoming increasingly evident that fish oil influences several additional parameters of cardiovascular and metabolic health. When overweight individuals (body mass index [BMI] &#x0003e; 25) combined fish oil (2 g total omega-3) and regular exercise, this combination lowered triglycerides, increased HDL cholesterol, and improved endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilatation when compared to sunflower oil placebo. Both fish oil and exercise independently reduced body fat and improved cardiovascular and metabolic health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941738108326978">25</xref></sup></p><p>Evidence from prevention studies suggests that taking EPA and DHA ranging from 500 mg to about 1500 mg per day significantly reduces deaths from heart disease (all causes). A significant and ever-growing body of scientific evidence that shows how important omega-3 fats are for cardiovascular health suggests that individuals with existing risk factors for cardiovascular disease should consume a minimum of 1 gram of EPA and DHA per day. Individuals with elevated serum lipids need 2 to 4 grams of EPA and DHA daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941738108326978">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1941738108326978">40</xref></sup> For many, these recommendations cannot be easily achieved through diet alone, and a high-quality fish oil supplement is recommended.

Since this entire lipoprotein particle can enter the arterial intima, the vLDL concentration and particle size are most important variables.
