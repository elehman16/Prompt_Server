The goal of this study was to measure the antiviral and antibacterial properties of the bioactive metabolites of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> in the serum of experienced marathon runners following supplementation. Marathon runners, randomly divided into two groups, ingested 600&#x02009;mg/day of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24, 6 female, 18 male) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24, 7 females, 17 males) for 30&#x02009;days prior to, the day of, and 7&#x02009;days post-marathon. Blood serum samples were collected the day before, 15&#x02009;min post-, and 1.5&#x02009;h post-marathon. Serum from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>-supplemented runners collected after marathon running did not attenuate the marathon-induced susceptibility of HeLa cells to killing by vesicular stomatitis virus. However, the use of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> induced antiviral activity at early times post-infection by delaying an exercise-dependent increase in virus replication (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.013 compared to placebo). Serum from both groups collected 15&#x02009;min post-marathon significantly promoted the growth of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in culture as compared to serum collected the day before the marathon (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003, all subjects). Furthermore, the serum from subjects ingesting <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> did not display antibacterial properties at any time point as indicated by a lack of group differences immediately (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.785) or 1.5&#x02009;h (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.633) post-marathon. These results indicate that bioactive compounds in the serum of subjects ingesting <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> may exert protective effects against virus replication following intense and prolonged exercise by inducing antiviral activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic></kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>vesicular stomatitis virus</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>bacterial growth</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">PoliNat (Las Palmas, Spain)</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="5006"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> (also known as golden root, rose root, Arctic root) is a perennial herbaceous plant in the Crassulaceae family found at high altitudes in the Arctic and mountainous regions throughout Europe and Asia (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It has historically been used to treat a range of conditions, including fatigue, depression and anxiety, impotence, and nervous system disorders (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> has also received attention for its potential adaptogenic and ergogenic properties including the enhancement of physical and mental performance and reduction of fatigue (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). More recently, <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> and polyphenolic bioactive compounds from the plant, such as rosavin, salidroside, syringin, triandrin, and tyrosol, have been reported to exert beneficial effects against several pathogens. For example, flavonoids isolated from the roots of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> have been shown to inhibit the activity of neuraminidases from <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and influenza virus, and exert anti-influenza virus activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Salidroside, a major bioactive component of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> has been reported to modulate the expression of antiviral cytokines, such as IFN&#x003b3;, and TNF&#x003b1;, and inhibit the replication of coxsackievirus B3 perhaps through modulation of oxidative stress (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). More recently, studies have shown that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> inhibits dengue virus multiplication by regulating the innate immune response genes, RIG-I, MDA5, and ISG, to promote an effective antiviral immune response (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Taken together, these data highlight the antiviral capacity of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> and its potential as a therapeutic strategy against a variety of infectious diseases.</p><p>Although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have yielded promising results, the antimicrobial capacity of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species in humans has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to measure the antiviral and antibacterial activity in the serum of athletes ingesting <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> or placebo for 30&#x02009;days prior to participating in a competitive marathon. This work is an extension of a study investigating the adaptogenic potential of <italic>Rhodiola Rosea</italic> in experienced runners completing a marathon (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Shanely et al. reported that ingesting <italic>Rhodiola Rosea</italic> supplements for 30&#x02009;days prior to marathon running did not reduce the muscle damage and inflammation generated by strenuous exercise. Intense endurance exercise, including marathon-type exertion, is known to induce deleterious changes in the immune system. During strenuous exercise, there is a substantial increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production resulting in oxidative stress, structural damage to the skeletal muscle fiber ultrastructure, inflammation, and transient immune dysfunction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Transient immunosuppression induced by prolonged, intense exercise is associated with increased incidence and severity of acute respiratory infections. Studies have observed decreased salivary IgA levels and natural killer (NK) cell function in endurance athletes, both of which offer protection against respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and rhinoviruses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, there is great interest in determining efficacious countermeasures for athletes in order to reduce the risk of acquiring infections following strenuous exercise.</p><p>There are limitations to measuring the anti-pathogenic effects of therapeutics in human subjects due to ethical constraints. Because of this, we have developed <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to evaluate the ability of serum from supplemented individuals to inhibit the growth of bacteria, and the replication and cytopathic effects (CPE) associated with virus infections, <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Our previous studies using these techniques have yielded consistent and reproducible results allowing us to carry out human studies safely and non-invasively (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In this study, we determined that <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> suppresses an exercise-induced increase in virus replication, but has no effect on the growth of the bacteria, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>). Consistent with previous reports, our data demonstrate that <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> contains compounds that act as antiviral agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The details of the subjects and research design associated with this study have been previously published (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The subjects participated in the Thunder Road Marathon on November 17, 2012 in Charlotte, NC, USA. Of the 55 volunteers, 48 runners completed all aspects of the study. Subjects were trained competitive runners with a marathon personal record of 4.5&#x02009;h or less within the last 1.5&#x02009;years, 25&#x02013;65&#x02009;years of age, and willing to avoid the use of additional supplements or medications known to affect inflammation.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a prototype of negative-strand RNA viruses, such as rabies and influenza viruses. It is highly cytopathic for cells from a variety of different species, including neurons and respiratory epithelial cells, thus making it a desirable model for the study of pathogenic viruses (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recombinant wild-type VSV (rwt virus) contains genes from several wt strains of VSV. Rwt virus and recombinant VSV expressing EGFP (green fluorescent protein) as a foreign gene (rwt-GFP virus) have been described previously (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Virus stocks were prepared in HeLa cells using methods described previously (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For all virus infections, HeLa cells were infected in DMEM with 7.5% FBS at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 PFU/cell.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Antiviral activity</title><p>The ability of VSV to kill permissive cells in the presence of various concentrations of serum was measured in order to assess the antiviral properties in serum samples from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> and placebo subjects. Specifically, serum samples at each time point were heat-inactivated for 30&#x02009;min at 56&#x000b0;C (HI-serum) to prevent the complication of complement-mediated cell lysis. HeLa cells, susceptible to infection by VSV, were grown in 96-well dishes (in DMEM plus 7.5% FBS) until they reached approximately 70&#x02013;80% confluency. At this time, cells were incubated with HI-serum at a serum to media ratio of 1:2. At various times post-incubation (0 and 4&#x02009;h), cells were infected with rwt virus at a MOI of 3 PFU/cell. Cells were assessed for viability using MTT assay (MTT Cell Proliferation Kit, Roche Diagnostics) at 24 and 48&#x02009;h post-infection. Controls included incubation of cells with serum alone (serum-alone samples) to measure potential cytotoxic effects of the serum, virus alone (virus-alone samples) to determine the cytotoxic effect of virus, and untreated and uninfected cells (mock) as background controls. Data were quantitated by dividing the values obtained from each sample by the mock value. All data were then normalized to the serum-alone data to adjust for differences in the serum responses between subjects. These values were then normalized to the pre-race values in order to more clearly observe changes following exercise and recovery periods.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Virus replication</title><p>To determine the effect of serum from test subjects on the replication capacity of VSV, HeLa cells were grown in six-well dishes until they reached 70&#x02013;80% confluency. As described above, cells were incubated with HI-serum at a serum to media ratio of 1:2. At 4&#x02009;h post-incubation, cells were infected with rwt-GFP at an MOI of 3&#x02009;PFU/cell. At 6 and 12&#x02009;h post-infection, cells were washed, harvested in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and subjected to flow cytometry to measure the fluorescence of GFP within cells. Two parameters were measured: (1) The percentage of cells expressing GFP, as an indication of the number of cells supporting virus replication, and (2) the geometric mean fluorescence, measuring the degree of replication within cells. All data were normalized to the pre-race values.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Antibacterial activity</title><p>Serum samples from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> and placebo supplemented subjects were tested for their effect on the growth of select bacteria.

Studies have shown that an aqueous extract derived from the rhizome of <italic>Rhodiola imbricata</italic> induces the expression of the innate immune response genes, RIG-I and MDA5, in response to infection with dengue virus (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic DEx (D/H) box helicases that function as pattern recognition receptors for the detection of intracellular viral products, such as viral nucleic acids, leading to the expression of type I interferons (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Type I IFNs secreted from infected cells bind to the IFN&#x003b1; receptor (IFNAR) on surrounding cells to initiate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral functions. Two key components of IFN-mediated action against viruses are 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase (2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-OAS) and MxA, which inhibit viral replication by inducing viral RNA degradation and inhibiting spread (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). RIG-I responds to a variety of positive and negative strand RNA viruses, including VSV (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> regulates the antiviral response in infected cells in a manner similar to <italic>Rhodiola imbricata</italic> and this effect may be responsible for the decrease in virus replication that we observed when cells were incubated with serum from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> versus placebo subjects. Future studies will investigate the effect of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> extracts and supplementation on type I IFN induction by innate immune receptors and downstream effects on IFN signaling pathways.</p><p>We did not observe a significant effect of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> on the ability of cells to delay the CPE associated with VSV infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our study, cells were infected synchronously with a wild-type (wt) strain of VSV expressing the viral matrix (M) protein. M protein inhibits host gene expression in infected cells resulting in the suppression of the cellular antiviral immune response (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> supplementation may have successfully delayed the early steps of the replication cycle of VSV in infected HeLa cells by inducing expression of antiviral factors, but the VSV M protein may have ultimately suppressed the beneficial effect of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> by shutting off expression of antiviral genes. In support of this hypothesis, studies have reported that the inhibition of host gene expression by M protein in HeLa cells leads to cellular damage and stress resulting in the acceleration of cell death via the mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptotic pathway (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is possible that exposure of cells to a lower concentration of virus in our study would allow serum factors from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>-supplemented subjects to have the opportunity to induce a more robust antiviral response and attenuate the replication and spread of VSV. Furthermore, <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> may exert more beneficial effects during natural viral infections, where cells would be exposed to lower levels of virus particles than those artificially administered in our cell culture study.</p><p>Limited studies have investigated the effect of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> and extracts from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> on infections by bacterial pathogens. Cybulska et al. reported that <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> extracts containing salidroside and rosavin demonstrated some inhibitory activity against <italic>Neisseria Ghonorrhea</italic> isolates with different antimicrobial resistance phenotypes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although this study highlights a potential inhibitory effect of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species on bacterial infections, in our study, serum from subjects ingesting <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>-collected post-marathon failed to suppress the growth of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in culture. In fact, marathon running stimulated the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in both placebo and <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> groups. These results are similar to our recent findings in which serum from athletes ingesting a blueberry&#x02013;green tea&#x02013;polyphenol soy protein complex (PSPC) promoted the growth of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> similarly to the placebo group following a 3-day intensified training period (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, polyphenolic tea catechins are effective in decreasing expression of bacterial virulence factors, such as those responsible for biofilm formation and motility (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that salidroside and other phenolic compounds from <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>-supplemented subjects exert antibacterial effects that were not measured in our study, such as biofilm formation or changes at the level of gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, salidroside from <italic>Rhodiola crenulata</italic> was shown to be an active compound responsible for preventing <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> biofilm formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Additionally, since we did not measure the levels of polyphenols in the circulation at any time during our study, it is possible that levels of the active compounds in <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> may be below the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) for the bacteria tested in our study. Because studies have indicated that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> induces cellular changes that are antiviral in nature, it is likely that viruses and other intracellular pathogens may be more susceptible to the effects of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> supplementation than extracellular pathogens. From a practical viewpoint, endurance athletes are prone to acute viral illnesses following heavy exertion, making the antiviral effects of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> more applicable to the athletic condition.</p><p>During strenuous exercise, there is a substantial increase in ROS, which is not only associated with cell and tissue destruction, but with the regulation of immune responses at the level of both T cells and antigen-presenting cells (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Oxidative stress and excessive production of superoxides has also been found to enhance infections associated with a variety of different viruses and promote tissue damage, perhaps by activation of the transcription factor NF-k&#x003b2; leading to enhanced inflammation and apoptosis of infected cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, naturally occurring nutritional sources of antioxidants containing polyphenolic compounds have the potential to an attenuate oxidative damage by acting as ROS scavengers, metal chelators, and enzyme modulators (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is intriguing to consider that polyphenols in <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> may decrease the risk of acquiring virus infections following rigorous exercise by inhibiting oxidative stress. However, Shanely et al. showed that supplementation of our subject group with <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> did not lead to changes in the expression of extracellular heat shock protein (HSP) 72, a marker of oxidative stress, or the levels of inflammatory cytokines following marathon running (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that alternative mechanisms, such as those at the cellular level, may be responsible for the attenuation of virus replication that we observed in this study. Our future studies will be aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> induces antiviral activity in athletes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by PoliNat (Las Palmas, Spain).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Panossian</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikman</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sarris</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Rosenroot (<italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>): traditional use, chemical composition, pharmacology and clinical efficacy</article-title>. <source>Phytomedicine</source> (<year>2010</year>) <volume>17</volume>:<fpage>481</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>93</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.phymed.2010.02.002</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20378318</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nieman</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Laupheimer</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ranchordas</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stear</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Castell</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name></person-group>
