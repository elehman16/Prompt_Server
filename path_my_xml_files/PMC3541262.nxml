A formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a has been produced without fetal bovine serum and without human serum albumin as an excipient (not currently approved for use in the US). The objectives of this study were to evaluate tolerability, injection-site redness, subject-reported satisfaction with therapy, and clinical safety and efficacy of the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a versus IFN&#x003b2;-1b in IFN&#x003b2;-treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RRMS. The objectives of the extension phase were to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of IFN&#x003b2;-1a.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, parallel-group, open-label study was conducted at 27 clinical sites in the US. Eligible patients aged 18&#x02013;60 years were randomized to receive either IFN&#x003b2;-1a, titrated to 44 &#x003bc;g sc three times weekly (tiw) (<italic>n</italic> = 65), or IFN&#x003b2;-1b, titrated to 250 &#x003bc;g sc every other day (<italic>n</italic> = 64) over 12 weeks. Following this, all patients received IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g tiw for 82&#x02013;112 weeks. Primary endpoint was mean change in patient-reported pain, as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) diary pain score (from 0 mm [no pain] to 100 mm [worst possible pain]) at the injection site, from pre-injection to 30 min post-injection over the first 21 full-dose injections. Secondary assessments included proportion of patients pain-free as recorded by VAS diary and the Short-Form McGill Pain questionnaire VAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 129 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Mean (standard deviation) change in VAS diary pain score was not significantly different between groups, although numerically lower with IFN&#x003b2;-1a versus IFN&#x003b2;-1b from pre-injection to immediately post-injection (1.46 [2.93] vs. 4.63 [10.57] mm), 10 min post-injection (0.70 [1.89] vs. 1.89 [5.75] mm), and 30 min post-injection (0.67 [2.32] vs. 1.14 [4.94] mm).

At the doses approved for the treatment of RRMS, both IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b have established long-term safety and tolerability profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, injections with these drugs are commonly associated with injection-site reactions (ISRs), injection-site pain, and flu-like symptoms (FLS), which can lead to poor adherence to treatment in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>A formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a has been developed without fetal bovine serum and without human serum albumin as an excipient, although this formulation is not currently approved for use within the US. In a 96-week study in patients with relapsing MS, the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a was associated with a lower prevalence of ISRs than had been seen in two earlier studies with the original IFN&#x003b2;-1a formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

The study consisted of a 12-week randomized comparative phase, which was followed by a safety-extension phase of up to 112 weeks (range 82&#x02013;112 weeks). The study was open-label, except for blinded assessments of ISRs. The initial central Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission was approved by Coast IRB, Colorado Springs, Colorado and, later, Schulman Associates IRB, Cincinnati, Ohio. For those sites that were not permitted to use a central IRB for study approval, submissions were made to the local IRB. This study was performed in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and all applicable regulatory requirements. Patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study.</p><p>Eligible patients were 18&#x02013;60 years of age, had a primary diagnosis of RRMS as defined by the Poser or 2005 revised McDonald criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and had not previously received IFN&#x003b2; treatment. Patients were not eligible if they had used any other approved disease-modifying treatment for MS (e.g. glatiramer acetate) or any cytokine or anti-cytokine treatment within 3 months before study initiation, used any immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment within 12 months before study initiation, used any investigational drug or experimental procedure within 12 weeks before screening, received oral or systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone within 30 days of study initiation, or used other injectable medications on a regular basis during the week before screening. Other exclusion criteria included having an alternative diagnosis to RRMS and being pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential were required to use appropriate contraception. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g sc tiw or IFN&#x003b2;-1b 250 &#x003bc;g sc qod for the 12 weeks of the comparative phase. Treatments were allocated using a computer-generated randomization code. The doses of IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b were up-titrated at the beginning of the study according to the US prescribing information for each drug (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Following the 12-week comparative phase, all patients received the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g sc tiw during the safety-extension phase. Patients who transitioned from IFN&#x003b2;-1b to IFN&#x003b2;-1a could be up-titrated to the full dose of IFN&#x003b2;-1a at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who did not wish to transition from IFN&#x003b2;-1b to IFN&#x003b2;-1a were withdrawn from the study. The length of the extension phase varied between 82 and 112 weeks, depending on the patient&#x02019;s date of enrollment.

Patients used the VAS diary to record the level of pain on a scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain), immediately before, immediately after, 10 min after, and 30 min after the injection. The SF-MPQ also included a VAS for patients to record the level of the maximum amount of pain experienced during the 60 min after injection, from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain). In addition, patients were requested to describe the types of pain that they experienced during the 60 min after injection. Patients completed the VAS diary and the SF-MPQ after every injection during the comparative phase and for the first 4 weeks of the safety-extension phase.</p><p>The Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSTSQ) adapted from Cramer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] included patient assessments of mood, treatment satisfaction, FLS, and ISRs. The MSTSQ was issued to patients at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48. Mean values are reported for each treatment phase.</p><p>ISRs were assessed at each visit during the first 48 weeks by a healthcare professional who was blinded to treatment assignment. ISR measures included the diameter of injection-site redness, injection-site swelling, bruising, and consideration of patient-reported itching, within 72 h of the most recent injection.</p><p>Compliance was recorded throughout the study and was defined as the actual number of injections divided by the expected number of injections, expressed as a percentage. Safety assessments included AEs (coded to system organ class and preferred term using the MedDRA dictionary [Version 9.1] and summarized by severity and relationship), vital signs, hematology, and serum chemistry. Analgesic use among patients with and without AEs related to FLS was summarized by treatment group during the comparative phase and by treatment group and overall population during the extension phase.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the mean change in the VAS diary pain score from pre-injection to 30 min post-injection over the first 21 injections of full-dose IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b treatment (&#x0201c;full-dose period&#x0201d;). Due to the different titration schedules and dose frequencies of each treatment, the first 21 full-dose injections were administered during Weeks 5&#x02013;11 in the IFN&#x003b2;-1a group and during Weeks 7&#x02013;12 in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Secondary endpoints included mean changes in the VAS diary pain score from pre-injection to immediately post-injection and 10 min post-injection; MSTSQ assessments; rater-blinded assessment of the mean diameter of injection-site redness; and SF-MPQ assessments, including the proportion of patients pain-free as recorded on the SF-MPQ VAS. Types of pain and severity experienced by the patient were also recorded on the SF-MPQ. The number of relapses and severity were secondary efficacy endpoints. Relapses were patient-reported and not objectively assessed; the number and severity of relapses were observational clinical assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis population was the intent-to-treat population (all patients randomized to treatment). The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one injection of study drug. The safety-extension population consisted of all patients who received at least one injection of study drug and had available extension phase data. Baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with effects for treatment group and pooled site for continuous variables and the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel general association test, adjusted for pooled site, for categorical variables.</p><p>The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in mean change in VAS pain score at 30 min post-injection from pre-injection across the treatments at full dose. The primary endpoint was evaluated with a two-way ANOVA model on signed ranked data, including treatment group and pooled site as main effects. The same method was also used to analyze treatment comparisons of the mean changes in the VAS diary pain score from pre-injection to immediately post-injection and 10 min post-injection, as well as mean SF-MPQ pain score at 60 min post-injection. An ANOVA model was used for between-group comparisons; for MSTQ scores, treatment group and pooled site were main effects; for injection-site redness, treatment group and site were main effects. The proportion of patients pain-free on SF-MPQ VAS was analyzed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel general association test, adjusted for site, or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, if appropriate. Injection-site swelling, bruising, and itching were compared between groups using a Cochran&#x02013;Armitage trend test. In the comparative phase, all statistical tests were two-sided and used a significance level of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Patient-reported relapses during the comparative phase were compared using a Poisson regression model with the total number of relapses as the dependent variable and treatment group and pooled site as independent variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of sample size</title><p>A total of 100 patients (50 per arm) was calculated to provide at least 90% power to detect the difference between treatment groups for the primary objective, when the expected treatment effect size (the difference between the treatment groups divided by the standard deviation [SD]) was at least 0.735. The effect size was based on a difference between the treatment groups of 0.025 mm and an SD value of 0.034 mm. The difference between the treatment groups was based on a mean change of 0.1 mm in the IFN&#x003b2;-1a group and 0.125 mm in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b group, and assumed that the mean VAS diary pain scores at pre-injection in the two treatment groups were similar. The calculation also assumed a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, a common SD of the change of &#x02264;0.034 mm, and a Type I error rate of 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>Between May 2006 and July 2009, a total of 129 patients were enrolled: 65 were randomized to IFN&#x003b2;-1a and 64 to IFN&#x003b2;-1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

The high rates of long-term compliance suggest good tolerability with both IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b, although compliance is usually greater in the clinical trial setting than in everyday clinical practice, prompting the need for long-term real-world-evidence studies.</p><p>Differences between the treatment groups were also not statistically significant for a number of other secondary assessments for pain. These included the mean increase in VAS pain score at all three post-injection timepoints, and the percentage of patients pain-free on both the VAS diary and the SF-MPQ. The MSTSQ overall satisfaction, injection system, and background information scores also did not differ significantly between the treatment groups during the full-dose period of the comparative phase. Overall, the results suggest that the use of the new formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a with auto-injectors did not adversely affect tolerability outcomes and user satisfaction any more than the commercially available formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1b.</p><p>Rater-blinded assessment of ISRs were also not statistically different between the groups, except in injection-site bruising, which was significantly more common with IFN&#x003b2;-1a than with IFN&#x003b2;-1b during the full-dose period, and injection-site swelling, which was significantly more common with IFN&#x003b2;-1b than with IFN&#x003b2;-1a during uptitration. The observed differences in these two parameters could be due to the different natures of the two &#x003b2;-IFNs, the contents of the formulations, and mechanics of the auto-injector devices. Determination of the plausible explanation would require further studies. Overall, most patients (&#x0003e;80%) did not experience FLS or ISRs on the MSTSQ during the comparative phase. Data on which side effects within the definition of FLS caused patients the most concern would be useful endpoints to study in future studies.</p><p>While relapse rate at Week 12 of the comparative phase was significantly higher for IFN&#x003b2;-1a than for IFN&#x003b2;-1b, the clinical relevance of these subject-reported relapses remains unclear. Importantly, the study was not designed to compare efficacy objectively, so the results of those analyses should be interpreted with caution. However, overall treatment satisfaction did not differ between patients treated with IFN&#x003b2;-1a and those treated with IFN&#x003b2;-1b. Very low VAS pain scores from before injection to all timepoints were also reflected in the overall population of the safety-extension phase.</p><p>AEs reported during the comparative and safety-extension phases were consistent with the known safety profiles of IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b. Elevated serum ferritin may be a useful biomarker for monitoring responses to IFN&#x003b2; treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; in this study, elevated serum ferritin levels were observed in both groups, and more commonly so in the IFN&#x003b2;-1a group than in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b group.</p><p>The high discontinuation rate observed during the extension phase may be due to the occurrence of AEs and/or the perceived commitment of remaining in the study, when there was availability of the original formulation commercially, and where a treatment switch was inevitable at study termination.</p><p>A number of previous studies compared the side-effect profile of the original IFN&#x003b2;-1a with that of IFN&#x003b2;-1b in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a small, non-randomized exploratory study of 20 patients, mean increases in VAS pain scores from before injection to immediately, 10 min, and 60 min after injection were greater in patients receiving IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g sc tiw than in patients receiving IFN&#x003b2;-1b 250 &#x003bc;g sc qod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although comparisons between groups were not tested for statistical significance. In a larger randomized study of 301 patients with RRMS, treatment with either the original formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a 22 &#x003bc;g sc once a week or IFN&#x003b2;-1b 250 &#x003bc;g sc qod did not show any significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of FLS or skin reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In an observational cohort study of 445 patients with RRMS, a greater percentage of patients receiving IFN&#x003b2;-1b 250 &#x003bc;g sc qod were pain-free over 15 full-dose injections immediately, 30 min, and 60 min after injection compared with patients receiving the original IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g sc tiw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the study was not randomized or controlled. Injection of IFN&#x003b2;-1a at room temperature to reduce possible sensation of cold burning as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations for use was also assumed. In another observational cohort study, the percentage of patients reporting an ISR did not differ significantly between those receiving the original IFN&#x003b2;-1a and those receiving IFN&#x003b2;-1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], lending evidence to a mild, variable tolerability between sc preparations of IFN&#x003b2;-1b and IFN&#x003b2;-1a.</p><p>The serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a was evaluated with the aim of improving local tolerability to injection. An additional potential benefit is reduced immunogenicity; following independent observations in a 96-week study, a lower prevalence of neutralizing antibodies was observed in patients receiving the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a, as compared with patients treated with the original IFN&#x003b2;-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, in this present study, no data were collected on the development of neutralizing antibodies to IFN&#x003b2;-1a to allow comparison with the above study findings.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Injection depth may affect pain and ISRs, although the various injection depth options that patients used were not recorded. This study mirrored general-practice use of auto-injectors, whereby patients choose their individual depth setting.</p><p>The utilization of VAS pain scores at smaller-ranging scales, for instance, from 0 to 10 mm, may have been more useful in obtaining a more sensitive picture of injection-site pain with these therapies. Also, except for inspection of injection-site redness, the study was not blinded. Lack of patient blinding may have influenced some of the patient-rated measures such as ratings of relapse, pain, and FLS. The clinical relevance of patient-reported relapse data is unclear and so, with the lack of objective assessment of relapses, results of those analyses should be interpreted with caution. In the statistical analyses of patient-rated measures, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Although a limitation, no statistically significant differences across groups on any of the patient-rated assessments were observed, suggesting that this aspect of the study design was not a serious weakness of the study. However, to ensure certainty in any future analyses, the blinding of patients is recommended to reduce any potential of bias in the patient-rated measures.</p><p>Although the safety-extension phase was useful in gaining data on longer-term tolerability to IFN&#x003b2;-1a, large dropouts and confounding variables such as treatment switch from a high dose of IFN&#x003b2;-1b to IFN&#x003b2;-1a did not permit systematic analyses from which valid interpretations and conclusions could be made.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results from this study in IFN&#x003b2;-treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RRMS regarding tolerability and safety of the serum-free formulation of IFN&#x003b2;-1a and IFN&#x003b2;-1b demonstrate that these treatments are accompanied by comparable and low levels of injection-site pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Barry Singer has received research support from Acorda, Biogen-Idec, EMD Serono, Genzyme and Roche, and has been a speaker and/or consultant for Acorda, Bayer, Biogen Idec, EMD Serono, Genentech, Genzyme, Pfizer, Novartis, and Teva.</p><p>Daniel Bandari has been a speaker and/or consultant for Acorda, Biogen Idec, EMD Serono, Pfizer, Novartis, and Teva Neuroscience.</p><p>Mark Cascione has received research support from Novartis, Teva, EMD Serono, Genzyme, Sanofi-Aventis, and Biogen Idec, and compensation for consulting and/or honoraria for speaking from Acorda, Bayer, EMD Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, and Teva Neuroscience.</p><p>Christopher LaGanke has received research support and has been a consultant and/or received honoraria from Novartis, Acorda, Biogen Idec, Tech Neuroscience, Bayer, EMD Serono, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Genzyme, and Opexa.
