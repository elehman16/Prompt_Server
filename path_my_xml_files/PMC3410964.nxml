However, more research is needed regarding children&#x02019;s adherence to a range of behaviors relevant for weight maintenance over long-term follow-up. Overweight children (<italic>N</italic>=101, aged 7-12 years), along with an overweight parent, participated in a 20-week family-based behavioral weight loss treatment (FBT) and were then assigned to either a behaviorally-focused or socially-focused 16-week weight maintenance treatment (MT). Treatment attendance and child and parent adherence (i.e., reported use of skills targeted within treatment) were examined in relation to child percent overweight change from baseline to post-FBT, post-MT, and 2-year follow-up. Higher attendance predicted better child weight outcomes at post-MT, but not at 2-year follow-up. Adherence to self-regulatory skills/goal-setting skills predicted child weight outcomes at 2-year follow-up among the behaviorally-focused MT group. Future research is needed to examine mediators of change within family-based weight control interventions, including behavioral and socially-based targets. Incorporating self-regulatory weight maintenance skills into a comprehensive MT may maximize children&#x02019;s sustained weight control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Childhood obesity</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>weight maintenance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The prevalence of pediatric overweight has increased dramatically (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Parental involvement is also associated with child success, perhaps via promoting children&#x02019;s behavioral adherence (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, many pediatric studies of self-reported adherence focus only on short-term outcomes (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Further research is needed to extend these findings to include a detailed examination of which specific targeted behaviors (e.g., behavioral, social support-focused) are most associated with long-term outcome.</p><p id="P4">In the present study, two novel family-based weight maintenance treatments (MTs) that used either a behaviorally-based or socially-based approach were examined. The primary outcome study (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) previously reported that children achieved better weight outcomes in MT as compared to a no-maintenance treatment-control, with socially-based treatment demonstrating the best efficacy, especially among children low in social problems. The present analyses sought to replicate previous findings regarding weight loss treatment attendance and adherence, and augment literature regarding whether treatment attendance and adherence to specific targeted behaviors within MT predicted children&#x02019;s short- and long-term weight outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods and Procedures</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Participants and Procedure</title><p id="P5">Participants were 101 overweight children (aged 7-12, <italic>M</italic>=9.9&#x000b1;1.4 years; 71% female), each with at least one overweight parent, involved in an RCT of a 20-week family-based behavioral weight loss treatment (FBT) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) followed by randomization to one of two 16-week MTs. Families were permitted to advance to the MT phase regardless of weight loss or attendance/adherence during FBT. Families who completed FBT but were randomized to the no-maintenance treatment-control (<italic>n</italic>=49) were excluded from the present analyses. At least one parent/guardian attended with the child; all except 1 participating parent were overweight (<italic>M</italic> body mass index [BMI]=35.1&#x000b1;5.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). At the start of the program, families were asked to pay an incentive deposit of $100, which was returned to them in $25 increments upon completion of each follow-up assessment (post-FBT, post-MT, 1-year follow-up and 2-year follow-up). Telephone contacts and mailings were used to encourage families to return for distal follow-up assessments.</p><p id="P6">FBT taught families to modify their diet and physical activity through using behavioral weight loss skills (e.g., self-monitoring, stimulus control). Families were assigned to either Social Facilitation MT (SFM; <italic>n</italic>=50) or Behavioral Skills MT (BSM; <italic>n</italic>=51), both of which consisted of 16 weekly sessions, including individual family meetings and separate parent/child group meetings. MT sessions focused in part on continued dietary and physical activity recommendations to support weight maintenance (i.e., remaining within &#x000b1; 1.5lbs of post-FBT weight). However, the treatments differed in content. BSM built on FBT&#x02019;s behavioral approach and added weight maintenance-specific skills (e.g., &#x0201c;getting back on track&#x0201d; after a lapse and other weight maintenance skills training) and motivational enhancement techniques. SFM emphasized developing and utilizing social networks to support weight maintenance and decreasing social barriers to physical activity. For example, SFM included a focus on augmenting coping skills for eating- and weight-related teasing/criticism, as well as on promoting a positive body image. Self-monitoring in SFM included tracking peer-related activities involving healthy eating and physical activity, as well as parental positive reinforcement for these behaviors.

The BSM parent measure also included a parenting skills subscale. Each MT subscale contained 4-11 items and demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alpha=.59-.85).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P11">Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS v19.0.

Separate BSM and SFM models were needed, as MT adherence questionnaires were treatment-specific. Of the 101 MT families, child percent overweight data was available from 86 families at 2-years post-FBT. Intent-to-treat analyses were also performed, using the last observation carried forward (e.g., child percent overweight at post-MT was used to replace missing values at 2-year follow-up), which enabled use of the full sample (<italic>N</italic>=101).

This extended weight control treatment previously has been shown to produce sustained improvements in children&#x02019;s relative weight as well as a range of psychosocial variables (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); the present study builds upon these findings to show that higher post-MT child-reported self-regulatory/goal-setting skills usage predicted long-term but not post-treatment outcome. During treatment, regular contact with treatment providers (i.e., session attendance) may maximize children&#x02019;s weight control, whereas high adherence to behavioral skills targeted by the program differentiated children who were most successful after treatment contact ended, perhaps via skills mastery throughout contexts outside the clinic (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Children&#x02019;s adherence did not significantly predict outcomes in SFM, which may reflect the distinct BSM- and SFM-specific adherence measures. SFM produces sustained weight control and domain-specific improvements in socially-focused outcomes, including validated measures of peer support for healthy behaviors and teasing-related problem-solving (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the present SFM adherence assessment&#x02014;including behaviors that may appropriately change over time as social support improves&#x02014;may not have sufficiently captured families&#x02019; actual level of relevant adherence. Children may more easily recall engaging in self-regulatory and goal-setting skills (e.g., dietary monitoring and self-weighing) due to greater familiarity with FBT techniques that were continued throughout BSM. As self-regulatory skills predicted children&#x02019;s long-term outcome, integrating these skills into a comprehensive socially-focused weight control program may produce the most robust weight outcomes (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Including child age and sex did not appear to impact findings, although it is likely that the present analyses were underpowered to detect age differences within the age group examined (7-12 years, <italic>N</italic>=101). Children of this age require varying degrees of parental involvement and instruction when attempting self-regulatory strategies (e.g., self-monitoring of dietary intake or weight). Findings support the utility of emphasizing these crucial skills within family-based weight control interventions, including capitalizing on parental modeling and guidance, especially for younger children. Considering the importance of these skills for sustained weight control, it likely would provide added benefit to integrate self-regulatory strategies throughout treatment (e.g., by continually monitoring families&#x02019; adherence to self-regulatory/goal-setting behaviors to reinforce their use and problem-solve around potential barriers to adherence. Although a higher proportion of children in the maintenance treatment were female, male children achieved even better weight outcomes; replication of longitudinal adherence analyses within larger samples would clarify whether findings equally apply to boys and girls.</p><p id="P18">Higher attendance predicted better child weight outcomes at post-treatment, but&#x02014;in contrast to a study by Kalarchian and colleagues (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)&#x02014;not at long-term follow-up. Of note, however, the present sample&#x02019;s attendance rate was higher and therefore more restricted in range (e.g., FBT dropouts, who had poorer FBT attendance, were not randomized to MT). Attendance is likely only a proxy for treatment adherence, which has been measured in a myriad of ways, including self-reported adherence to treatment components, as in the present study, and self-monitoring log completion or home food environment assessments (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Adherence measures were relatively brief and treatment-specific (i.e., families in BSM and SFM completed distinct questionnaires), and only assessed behaviors in the past month (for FBT) or two months (for MT). Further, adherence questionnaires relied on retrospective self-report (or parent-report on their children), whereas other methods (e.g., observations collected via home assessment or real-time monitoring via telephone) might have enhanced validity and lowered measurement error. Lastly, some SFM children likely successfully received social support or experienced less teasing by the end of treatment, which then might have led them to report less usage of some socially-based skills (e.g., asking for support, practicing ways to handle teasing) at post-MT (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Future studies should examine adherence as a mediator of outcome, using multiple assessments throughout treatment rather than solely at post-treatment.</p><p id="P20">Further studies are needed to identify the most potent strategies for improving families&#x02019; adherence. Mastery-based education or programs of increased dose and/or duration may enhance adherence by allowing sufficient practice and integration of newly learned skills into families&#x02019; daily habits.
