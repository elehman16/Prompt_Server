All subjects were subjected to a dietary assessment and counseling at three stages, i.e., initiation of the study, mid-Ramadan and post-Ramadan, by a trained dietician.

The duration of fasting varies by geographical location and season. During summer and northern latitudes, the fast can last up to 18 hours or more. Fasting begins after a meal before dawn (<italic>sahur</italic>) and is completed after sunset by usually consuming sweetened water or dates followed by a meal (<italic>iftar</italic>). Individuals are exempted from Ramadan fasting in circumstances such as illness or menstruation that could adversely affect health outcomes leading to interruption of fasting during such periods. In such cases, fasting is adjourned to a later period of time. During fasting it is generally assumed that the calorie consumption is low and there is a greater tendency for hypoglycemia and irregular glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.(T2DM).</p><p>The effect of experimental short-term fasting on carbohydrate metabolism has been published in the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] It has been uniformly found that a slight decrease in serum glucose from 3.3 mmol to 3.9 mmol (60 mg/dl to 70 mg/dl) occurs in normal adults a few hours after fasting has begun.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, this reduction in serum glucose tends to cease due to increased gluconeogenesis in the liver during fasting, and related decrease in insulin concentration and a rise in glucagon and sympathetic activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Glycogen stores, along with some degree of gluconeogenesis, may maintain normal serum glucose when a fast follows a large pre-dawn meal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The EPIDAR study that recruited 12,914 Muslim diabetic subjects from thirteen countries reported prevalence estimates of fasting during Ramadan as 43% for type 1 diabetes mellitus and 86% for T2DM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Although this study was the largest epidemiological report that described diabetes-related practices during Ramadan, the study failed to include a detailed dietary assessment during the fasting period although the authors report unaltered life style practices in about 50% of the individuals during Ramadan. It is generally perceived that calorie consumption is restricted during the fasting period, but there exists some degree of dietary indiscretion during the non-fasting period with excessive compensatory eating, which may contribute to hyperglycemia and weight gain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] There is paucity of information available on dietary practices and diet components during Ramadan fasting. Since calorie restriction, adherence to dietary counseling and maintenance of balanced diet forms an integral component of general diabetes management and especially during critical periods such as fasting, the current study aimed to evaluate dietary patterns and diet-adherence at different time points during 30-day fasting period of Ramadan amongst Muslims living in South India.</p><p>Diabetes management during fasting is challenging since physical activity is restricted and pharmacological therapy is usually lowered in fear of hypoglycemia. Therefore appropriate glycemic control largely relies on appropriate diet modulation of diet that efficiently maintains the blood glucose and counter-balances the fasting effects, especially hypoglycemia, without compromising religious fasting. The importance of dietary management have been strongly underscored by the diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT) and UK prospective diabetes study (UKPDS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Although, during Ramadan, the benefits of fasting appear only in patients who maintain their appropriate diets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] most patients with diabetes find it increasingly difficult to understand and adhere to the nutritional component of their treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In the current study, we therefore describe the general dietary pattern followed by Muslims during religious fasting and the degree of compliance to the prescribed diet during Ramadan</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All subjects in this dietary survey were Muslims with T2DM who intended to undertake fasting for the entire holy month of Ramadan (30 days).

Follow-up dietary assessment was carried out at three stages, i.e., before initiation of Ramadan fasting, mid-Ramadan (15 days after initiating fasting) and post-Ramadan (1 week after completing the fasting period) by a trained dietician. Diet was assessed using 24-hour dietary recall method and through standard questionnaires based on food frequencies as detailed below.

The amount of food intake and raw ingredients used for each food preparation was obtained individually from each subject using reference standardized cups. Participants were asked to recall their usual intake of foods and beverages over the past 6 months. Both the frequency of intake and the serving size were ascertained. The subject's intake in terms of raw equivalent was calculated as the product of the total raw amount of each ingredient and the amount of cooked food intake divided by the total food cooked per day. This method is useful in obtaining qualitative details of diet and the pattern of food consumption at household level and also includes assessment of the frequency of consumption of different foods on daily, weekly, fortnight or occasional basis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Participants were also queried with regard to the special dietary practices they followed during the fasting period, the use of dietary supplements, and food preparation methods.</p><p>The raw equivalent of the food consumed was then calculated.

The dietary recommendations were adapted to the specific needs of the individual based on nutrition assessment, desired treatment outcomes, and modification of usual food intake. All subjects were advised to strictly adhere to a two meal, two snack (one meal and one snack before onset of fasting and one meal and one snack after breaking of fast) pattern during the fasting period of Ramadan. A typical day's meal and snacks aimed at providing 1500 to 2000 calories with 65-70% calories from carbohydrate, 15- 20% from protein and 10--15% from fat.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] A prototype of dietary recommendation is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Prototype dietary recommendation based on body mass index</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-16-552-g003"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Food exchange system</title><p>The food exchange system for planning diabetic diets for the current study was based on the concept of food equivalents.

Over 50 countries across the globe have majority of Muslim population. The Islamic religion is the second largest community in India. The 2011 population census of India (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://censusindia.gov.in">http://censusindia.gov.in</ext-link>) report an approximate 13.4% (138 million) Muslims living in India clustered in minority communities, which is more than Islamic community in the Arab countries. The exact prevalence of T2DM in different religious communities in India are unknown. However, it is evident from clinical observations an health surveys that most of the Muslims in India practice religious fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. The major changes in life style pattern during Ramadan fasting are chrono-biological and behavioral.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Although there is considerable evidence on physiological alterations and diabetes management with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, little emphasis is laid upon dietary management during fasting. In the current study we aimed to investigate the dietary patterns during the Ramadan fasting and also assess adherence to prescribed diets to optimize blood sugar control among South Indian Muslims who undertook 30 day fasting during Ramadan. undertook fasting in the holy month of Ramadan. Results from our study demonstrates that there is an overall increase in calorie consumption during Ramadan fasting despite sufficient dietary counseling in our participants. Although religious fasting permits intake of food only twice a day (before and after sunrise and sunset), there appears to be compensatory overeating in adults as observed by the increase in total calorie intake during fasting. There was a significant increase in the percentage carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed during fasting, most of the later are a part of the traditional foods that are specifically consumed during Ramadan in this population. A similar pattern of high calorie intake was reported previously among healthy Muslims. Contrary to our findings, a study among 22 diabetic Muslims from Malaysia have shown low calorie consumption during Ramadan fasting, however detailed dietary description was not reported among these individuals. The calorie consumption during the entire period of fasting was also not reported among these individuals. We identified a distinct dietary behavioral pattern during the fasting period among our particpants, with regard to type of food groups consumed with a mean increase in consumption of all components of diet during 30-day fasting. This specific pattern of high calorie food intake was independent of the socio-economic strata and educational status. It was evident from the patient-dietician interview that most patients perceived that intake of large quantities of food that yield sufficient energy could help them sustain fasting and prevent hypoglycemia. Khaled <italic>et al</italic>. observed an increase consumption of dietary fat (35.8%), especially saturated fats (43.3%) among Muslims during fasting periods similar to our observations (44.2%) during mid-Ramadan. Although this dietary practice of high calorie compensation was contrary to actual religious preaching (of non-compensatory eating), the main concern among participants was interruption of continuous 30-day fasting due to hypoglycemia.</p><p>Most dietary guidelines for diabetes management are targeted towards intake of specific macronutrients. In an Indian setting, many individuals find it difficult to make dietary changes based on such numerical criteria. Therefore, our recommendations were based on overall pattern of dietary intake focusing on appropriate food choices. We focused mainly on high-carbohydrate and high-fiber (HCHF) diet during the nonfasting hours, as it is noted that diets which were high in rich complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber, and relatively low in fat, benefited individuals with diabetes mellitus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Despite repeititive counseling on dietary patterns and reinforcing prescribed diet according to patients choices and traditional practices, the compliance to prescribed diet was poor. These conclusions were not supported by questionnaire based assessments but, from overall assessment of the diet diary where the patient recorded foods consumed during fasting. We learn that although targeted counseling is implemented, it is difficult to break the traditional pattern of high-fat and high-protein diet during the period of Ramadan fasting.</p><p>Glycemic assessment by serum fructosamine at the end of the study was optimal (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005) among our participants. Several studies have reported no change in HbA1C or fructosamine in subjects who undertook fasting during Ramadan. It is important to note that the variation in diet pattern during fasting is crucial leading to hypo- and hyperglycemia.</p><p>Hypoglycemia is one of the major concerns both among patients and treating physicians who undertake short-term fasting due to religious practices. Hypoglycemia assessment ( based on self-reports) was not seen among our participants similar to previous observations in fasting diabetic patients treated with anti-diabetic drugs or insulin. However, a large epidemiological study demonstrated that the risk of severe hypoglycemia increased by 4.7 and 7.5 folds in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who undertook fasting during Ramadan. In another muticentric observational study, symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed in 20% of fating diabetic patients. We did not observe significant difference in weight or BMI change before, during or after fasting similar to observations by M&#x02019;guil <italic>et al</italic>. among 120 diabetic subjects who practiced Ramadan fasting.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. A power calculation to determine the sample size was not used due to the lack of prior similar studies evaluating the dietary habits during Ramadan. The 24-hour dietary recalls can mostly give an estimate of the average nutrient intake, and this possibly explains the difference in food intake when comparing the two dietary assessment methods. There is some element of bias in the recall of food intake as most subjects volunteered participation. However the present study gives us an insight into the dietary habits, food adherence patterns, and traditional beliefs in a unique group of Muslim subjects who undertook fasting during Ramadan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>The large proportion of Muslim subjects who undertake fasting during Ramadan represents a challenge to the treating physicians. The present study is one of the first studies that have attempted to present the overall picture of the food pattern in fasting Muslim subjects during Ramadan, and our prototype diet based on regional food practices and a culturally acceptable diet pattern is a recommendation for patients with diabetes who fast during Ramadan in India. There is a overwhelming need for additional studies that could provide assessment and dietary recommendations that are ethnic/culture specific and form mainstay of diabetes management in all religious groups that practice short-term fasting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
