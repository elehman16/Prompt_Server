Pain management is particularly relevant in obese patients who experience a higher number of cardiovascular and pulmonary events. Effective pain management may reduce their risk of serious postoperative complication, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic, ropivacaine, to reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare intraperitoneal ropivacaine (intervention) versus normal saline (placebo) in 120 adult patients undergoing bariatric bypass surgery. Ropivacaine will be infused over the oesophageal hiatus and throughout the abdomen. Patients in the control arm will undergo the same treatment with normal saline. The primary end point will be postoperative pain at 1, 2 and 4&#x02005;h postoperatively. Pain measurements will then occur every 4&#x02005;h for 24&#x02005;h and every 8&#x02005;h until discharge. Secondary end points will include opioid use, peak expiratory flow, 6&#x02005;min walk distance and quality of life assessed in the immediate postoperative period. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used and repeated measures will be analysed using mixed modelling approach. Post-hoc pairwise comparison of the treatment groups at different time points will be carried out using multiple comparisons with adjustment to the type 1 error. Results of the study will inform the feasibility of recruitment and inform sample size of a larger definitive randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of intraperitoneal ropivacaine.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board and Health Canada in April 2014.

Effective pain control encourages early ambulation, which significantly reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli (PE); enhances patient's ability to take deep breaths to decrease the risk of pulmonary complications (eg, atelectasis and pneumonia); and decreases the incidence of tachycardia and unnecessary related investigations.</p><p>The obesity epidemic has led to a significant rise in the need for surgical intervention. This recent phenomenon further highlights the importance of understanding the analgesic requirements of the bariatric patient. Pain management is particularly relevant in the obese population given their higher susceptibility for serious perioperative complications from cardiovascular, thromboembolic and pulmonary events. These include a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, hypoxia, respiratory depression and PE, which is the second leading cause of death among bariatric surgery patients.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>A number of strategies exist for controlling postoperative pain. One such method, intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA), involves the infusion of local anaesthetic into the abdomen during surgery. This procedure has been extensively studied in general surgery and gynaecology.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;6</xref> Two systematic reviews have investigated the effectiveness of IPLA as a method of reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although the timing of IPLA administration varied between included studies (ie, at predissection or postdissection), evidence overwhelmingly supports pre-emptive IPLA<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> as it blocks the afferent nerves in the peritoneum before surgical trauma.</p><p>Ropivacaine, a newer analgesic, with a better toxicity profile compared with alternatives such as bupivacaine, is currently considered the safest long-acting local anaesthetic in the market.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Two trials comparing the plasma concentration after intravenous use of ropivacaine versus bupivacaine have demonstrated that ropivacaine requires a higher plasma concentration before toxicity develops.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Importantly as an IPLA, ropivacaine has been shown to be effective at reducing pain without clinical toxicity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref> Despite promising results, there is still a paucity of studies that have specifically focused on the use of IPLA in the bariatric surgery population.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> To our knowledge, Our INtraperitoneal rOPivAcaINe in bariatric surgery (INOPAIN) study is the first trial examining the use of ropivacaine in the setting of obesity surgery. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ropivacaine as an IPLA to reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>The study recruitment began on 3 July and is expected to last 6&#x02005;months to 31 December 2014. This pilot trial is a double-blind, randomised, controlled parallel arm study. Participants, the clinical care team (surgeon and nurses) and outcome assessors will all be concealed from allocation and blinded during the trial. The pilot study will assess the feasibility of a larger definitive study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Participants will be recruited from the Ottawa Civic Hospital, an academic centre serving a catchment area of 1.3 million residents in Eastern Ontario (Ottawa and environs), Canada. LRYGB is the standard operation for obesity in Canada. Patients will be treated by one of three participating expert surgeons (JM, JDY or AN) who routinely perform LRYGB.</p><p>Eligible participants will be adults undergoing LRYGB for obesity who are able to tolerate general anaesthetic and pneumoperitoneum, and provide informed consent for the surgery. Patients with chronic pain requiring preoperative opioids will be included. Exclusion criteria are: (1) patients undergoing planned sleeve gastrectomy (intraoperative conversion to sleeve gastrectomy after IPLA delivery will be included and analysed using intention-to-treat approach); (2) allergy to local anesthetics; (3) severe underlying cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure, conduction abnormalities, and ischaemic heart disease; (4) chronic renal disease stage 3 or higher (defined as creatinine clearance less than 60&#x02005;mL/h); (5) hepatic dysfunction Child-Pugh class B or C and (6) previous foregut surgery, including oesophageal, gastric, liver and pancreas resections.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Eligible participants will initially be identified by a participating surgeon or a nurse from the Ottawa Hospital Bariatric Surgery Clinic. If the patient agrees to participate, consent will be obtained by a research assistant (RA), who is independent from the clinical care of patients. The study flow will be shown according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005823F1">figure 1</xref>). Baseline data will be captured by the surgeon at the time of enrolment into trial.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005823F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of the INOPAIN study. <italic>Source</italic>: Moher <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (IPLA, intraperitoneal local anaesthetic).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005823f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomised using a computerised simple randomisation scheme&#x000a0;in a 1:1 ratio to intervention and control arms. Randomisation will be performed on the day prior to surgery to allow for the preparation of medication by the department of pharmacy. Surgeries booked on Monday will be randomised on Friday.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>Once randomised, the pharmacy will independently prepare the treatment solution (ropivacaine or normal saline (NS)) in a standardised 100&#x02005;mL bag. The treatment solution will be attached a patient's unique identifier and will not indicate to which arm the patient is allocated. Intravenous bags will be labelled according to Health Canada regulations and will not disclose content contained in the bag. The treatment medication will be delivered to the operating room on the day of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Blinding</title><p>All parties, including the patients, surgeons, clinic/OR/floor unit nurses will be blinded to treatment arm. If emergency unblinding is required (at the discretion of the investigator), a request to the on-call pharmacy research technician will be made in order to determine the patient treatment regimen. If unblinding occurs, the event will be recorded in the patient's chart and study file with the corresponding reason for unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Interventions</title><p>Study participants will be randomised into two parallel arms. The patients assigned to the intervention arm will receive the following treatment:</p><p>The trocars will be placed in the abdomen in the usual manner. All patients will receive a total of 100&#x02005;mL of 0.2% ropivacaine. Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200&#x02005;mg total of ropivacaine in 100&#x02005;mL NS will be instilled into the abdomen prior to surgical dissection. Under direct visualisation, 50&#x02005;mL will be delivered over the oesophageal hiatus. The remaining 50&#x02005;mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30&#x02005;mL of NS to ensure any residual ropivacaine is delivered. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual. Patients assigned to the control arm will only receive intraperitoneal NS with the same delivery procedure.</p><p>The effect of irrigation and suction is unlikely to impact the absorption of ropivacaine unless the infused fluid is suctioned immediately. It has a high absorption constant and is rapidly taken up systemically.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There is ample research support for the pre-emptive delivery of anaesthetic prior to dissection.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> The intraperitoneal absorption of ropivacaine and plasma concentration has been studied and shown to have low-toxicity potential where the peak concentration was much less (1.14&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL) than the maximum tolerable level of 2.2&#x02005;mg/L.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> To ensure operator compliance, each delivered package to the operating theatre will be checked to ensure all assigned medication was delivered.</p><p>Patients in both arms will receive standardised anaesthetic protocol for induction and maintenance. Induction anaesthetic would only include fentanyl boluses for pain, ketamine or propofol for sedation, and rocuronium or succinylcholine for neuromuscular blockade. For general anaesthesia maintenance, dexmedetomidine and fentanyl boluses are to be used. Dexamethasone and ondansetron will be used as intraoperative antiemetics. No long-acting opioids will be used preoperatively or intraoperatively. Postoperatively, patients will receive breakthrough pain medication, as necessary, including morphine, hydromorphone and acetaminophen. All participants will undergo the bariatric surgery clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>Baseline data will include patient demographics and their existing comorbidities, medical and surgical history, medications, allergies and social history including smoking, alcohol and drug use. Pain history of fibromyalgia, back pain and arthritis will be documented. The patient will also be asked to complete a quality of recovery questionnaire (QR-40) and a 6&#x02005;min walk test.</p><p>Feasibility measures and the decision to proceed with the definitive trial will be determined by number of eligible patients, rates of recruitment, randomisation, data completion and quality, patient retention and cost-related data collection. The required sample size for a definitive trial will be calculated using the clinical outcome data from the pilot trial. The pilot study will be deemed feasible if the number of eligible, randomised and retained cases within the pilot trial generate the required sample size within a 12&#x02005;month period of recruitment. A more than 60% recruitment of those eligible will be seen as acceptable and 90% as satisfactory.</p><sec id="s2h1"><title>Efficacy end point</title><p>The data collection and questionnaires to be administered in the pilot trial are those proposed for the definitive trial. The primary efficacy end point is postoperative pain score, as measured by the visual analogue scale, which has been extensively validated in pain management. Changes between 13&#x02013;16&#x02005;mm are widely accepted as clinically relevant.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The secondary efficacy end points include: (1) opioid use, as measured by total opioid consumption. The quantity and route of opioid medication delivery will be captured and converted to morphine equivalent for comparison. Opioid use has been evaluated in other studies where IPLA was used. Some evidence indicate IPLA may significantly reduce the consumption of opioid.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Acetaminophen will be administered orally and overall consumption will be captured. (2) Peak expiratory flow (PEF), as measured by the incentive spirometry. PEF has not been studied in obese patients. There is no recommendation on a clinically significant change. (3) A 6&#x02005;min walking distance (6 MWD), defined as the distance (in metres) an individual is able to walk along a flat 30&#x02005;m walkway over a 6&#x02005;min period, with breaks as required. Walk testing has been validated in the obese population. Clinically significant differences occur at a minimum of 80&#x02005;m.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Pain scores will be measured at baseline, immediately in recovery, at 1, 2 and 4&#x02005;h postoperation and then every 4&#x02005;h for 24&#x02005;h, then every 8&#x02005;h up to a maximum of 48&#x02005;h postoperation. Opioid consumption will be measured immediately after the surgery, then at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24 and then 48&#x02005;h or sooner if patient is discharged earlier. PEF scores will be measured at baseline, immediately in recovery and then every 4&#x02005;h for a period of 24&#x02005;h, then every 8&#x02005;h up to a maximum of 24&#x02005;h postsurgery. Six MWD will be measured at the baseline, on postoperative days 1 and 2 and at follow-up clinic within 10&#x02005;days of operation.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Explanatory end point</title><p>Quality of life as measured by the QR-40 will be measured.

Improvement of postoperative pain management offers great benefit to patient care and quality of life. It provides surgeons and anaesthesiologists with further opportunity to improve patient comfort and; reduce complications, reduce length of stay and healthcare costs. On the other hand, if our study finds evidence to indicate equivalence between IPLA and control arms in postoperative pain control, the already established use of ropivacaine by many clinics in North America and Europe, would be challenged.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e214" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005823.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e215" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005823.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Hadi Mehrzad Namazi for helping with the database creation of the study.
