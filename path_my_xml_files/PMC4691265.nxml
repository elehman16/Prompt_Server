</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since 1950, with the &#x0201c;deinstitutionalization&#x0201d; trend in the developed industrialized nations, large size psychiatric hospitals were shut down and replaced with psychiatric wards in general hospitals and community mental health centers.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> During the last few decades, various forms of case-management systems<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> have been introduced that demonstrated improvements in mental health, lower prevalence of relapse, reduced cost of treatments, improved quality of life, and patient satisfaction.</p><p>In the last decade, participation of the consumers of mental health services as staff members have been integrated into various services such as case-management and assertive community treatment. Utilization of the consumers as staff, had a wide range of benefits.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A similar study carried by Malakouti et al. and supported by Ahebba (a non-governmental organization) also showed the effectiveness of this approach.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>After 25 years of implementing mental health into primary health care (PHC) in rural areas of Iran, because of some remarkable demographic changes in urban areas, new ideas and policies are being developed in mental health strategies and programs. The welfare organization implemented home-visit services for patients with severe mental illnesses and the Mental Health Bureau of the Iranian Ministry of Health decided to provide urban mental health program. Using community-based services in Iran, such as follow-up treatment at home, was established for certain reasons. Currently, a few community-based services such as home-visit and day care centers, provided by a collaboration between welfare organization and the private sector, are actively operating. However, these services are not sufficient in terms of supply versus demand. It is estimated that 15,000 to 20,000 psychiatric beds (depending on the index of rotation factor, rehabilitation rate, and duration of stay) are needed to provide short-term hospitalization services in case of relapse in patients with severe mental illnesses.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This is approximately double the amount of currently available beds. Lack of mental health resources, particularly community-based facilities (such as outreach services), is a common issue in developing countries such as Iran. This has caused a great deal of objective and subjective burden on the families and caregivers. The burden could be in the form of inferiority complex, shame, isolation, dealing with impaired behaviors of patients, and the cost of care.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Although there is a shortage of psychiatric beds in Iran, but there are sufficient resources that could provide effective support<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> to the currently established outreach services in treating patients cared by their families.</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of home-visit clinical case-management services, provided by trained registered nurses through telephone follow-up, in reducing the hospitalization rate (primary outcome) and other clinical symptoms (secondary outcome) in patients with severe mental illnesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study Design and Sample</title><p>The study design was a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). By block randomization method (using quaternary block) and using a random number table, patients were assigned to different groups. Considering the effect size (ES) related to Chi-square as moderate (ES=0.3) to find the difference of recurrence between groups (power of 80% and type 1 error of 0.05), each group was calculated to include 60 individuals. Assuming 25% drop out, a sample size of 240 (180&#x000d7;1.30) was considered.</p><p>A total of 241 patients with severe mental illness were recruited from four psychiatric centers (Razi, Emam Hossein, Taleghani and Rasool hospitals). Patients who declined to sign the informed consent (n=43) and dropped out during the study period (n=16) were excluded. Eventually, 182 patients (75% response rate) were enrolled in the final analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Among these patients, 65% (n=119) had bipolar mood disorder diagnosis and 35% (n=63) had spectrum diagnosis of schizophrenia. We defined severe mental illnesses as schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar mood disorder (BMD). The patients were enrolled between December 2007 to March 2008 from outpatient clinics or immediately after discharge from hospital.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Shows the CONSORT flow diagram for patient selection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMS-41-19-g001"/></fig><p>The inclusion criteria were being hospitalized at least twice in the last two years, not having good compliance according to her/his caregiver, and having diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The exclusion criteria were being in the acute phase of the illnesses, having mental retardation, addiction to psychoactive substances, and concurrently receiving the same services from other sources. We measured baseline variables at the beginning of the study and after 12 months of follow-up period. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups of home-visit, telephone follow-up, and control. The objectives of the study were explained to all patients as well as their families and informed consents were obtained. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mental Health Research.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection of Case-Manager and Training Course</title><p>Ten registered nurses with at least 5 years care experience with mentally ill patients at psychiatric hospitals or wards were initially considered through advertisements. Following an interview, four nurses were finally selected; from which three were assigned as case-managers (CM) and one for the telephone follow-up contact. During the study, periodical meetings supervised by the main investigator were held to monitor case managers and resolve possible issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Defining Groups and Intervention</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Home-Visit Group</title><p>The patients in this group had one face-to-face session (about 45 minutes) per month by a case manager. For every 20 patients, one case manager was assigned. Case managers completed the symptoms and drug side effects checklists; and would forward it to patient&#x02019;s psychiatrist if deemed necessary. Coaching the patients and their family members through informative brochures and accessibility in case of emergency were other form of interventions in this group. The patient or their families were permitted to contact the assigned case-manager on need basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Telephone Follow-Up Group</title><p>Each patient was contacted by phone as a reminder of her/his appointment. If they missed an appointment, they would be contacted again to probe for the reason. If considered necessary, patients would be encouraged to meet her/his psychiatrist.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Control Group (as-usual)</title><p>This group received &#x0201c;as-usual treatment&#x0201d;. It is a type of care where patients, who are cared by their family, receive the service on request and by presenting themselves to an outpatient clinic. Typically, the psychiatrists would prescribe the appropriate medicine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcome Measures and Evaluators</title><p>The study instruments were completed by a trained psychiatric resident and two clinical psychologists. They were blinded to the assigned group throughout the intervention.</p><p>The following measures were used in this study:</p><p>

To compare demographic and clinical variables between the three intervention groups, we used the Chi-square for nominal data and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for numeric variables. Analysis of variance was also used for comparing the mean score of questionnaires between the groups. We calculated 2&#x000d7;2 comparison of the groups by Scheffe as a post-hoc test. Paired sample t-test was used to compare the mean score of questionnaires before and after interventions among each group. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated for the independent effect of each intervention on the recurrence rate using logistic regression. Because all demographic variables were the same across groups, we just entered &#x0201c;group&#x0201d; as independent variable and recurrence as the dependent variable in the model. The level of significance was considered 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 241 patients, 182 completed the study and enrolled for the final analysis (75% response rate).

About 55% were unemployed and half of them had a low-level of education. The groups were similar in all demographic features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). The mean duration of illness was 13 years and the mean number of hospitalization was 4.5 times lifetime.

Furthermore, it would reduce the rate of hospitalization recurrence. One of the main concerns is regarding the personal safety of a case manager while providing home-visit services. During the present study period, we did not experience any dangerous behavior from patients. This was consistent with a similar study in Iran. Assuming Iran is in the category of low-middle income countries, implementation of such strategy is more applicable to the mental health budget in our setting. Certain measures were taken in advance to prevent possible hazardous conditions. The responsible person in the main office was bound to call the families to inform them about a visit by case manager and the presence of a family member alongside a patient was mandatory during the visit.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>The Impact of Clinical Case-Management Service on Hospitalization Rate</title><p>Studies in developed countries have demonstrated that case-management services might increase the rate of patient hospitalization (OR=1.84).<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> It is shown that such intervention could be effective in reducing family burden, satisfaction with the services as well as the cost of treatment and other clinical characteristics.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The result of the current study showed that patients in the as-usual group were hospitalized 2.5 times and the telephone follow-up group 1.5 times more than the home-visit group. In a study conducted in Iran, the case-managers were only trained psychologist and the hospitalization rate for the as-usual and telephone follow-up groups were 17% and 14%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The lower rate of hospitalization in the previous study could be related to comprehensive care of patients by the psychiatric team of the Iranian society supporting individuals with schizophrenia. However, in our study, the psychiatrists were spread across four different hospitals resulting in different drug treatment programs.</p><p>Although our case managers were trained nurses rather than psychologists, they did perform effectively in reducing the hospitalization rate. Being in touch with patients and their families, introduced a feel-good factor particularly through accessibility by phone in case of emergency. The patients were socially supported, scrutinized for drug treatment, and were educated to cope better with their disease. It seems that the feel-good factor was important for improved management of the disease and resulted in a lower hospitalization. This is very crucial in our society where the available acute psychiatric beds are only one-third of the required amount.</p><p>In this study, we showed that the as-usual approach did not work well in patients with severe mental illnesses. Indeed, it was considered harmful to them. Previous studies have shown that the rate of rehospitalization in Iran for patients with severe mental illnesses could be once for every 1 to 4 years.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This finding has a relatively wide range of hospitalization as an outcome for such patients. This may be due to sampling error, patient characteristics, or the time trends. We could not exactly specify which explanation is the reason for our findings. However, it could be the time trends because the features of patients with severe mental illnesses could be affected by several factors, such as familial, environmental, and natural variability of psychopathology severity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Clinical Outcomes of Providing Case-Management Service</title><p>The study results showed that all clinical features of the patients and their caregivers have improved in the home-visit group compared with the as-usual group, except for YOUNG. There is a positive relationship between isolation and burden of caring for chronic mentally ill patients.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Such services could improve the mental health of patients and their family members.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; quality of life was significantly unchanged during the follow-up. At times, there were some within group improvements in a few domains of life quality (such as pain and mental health in home-visit group). However, there was not any significant difference between interventions. One explanation could be that the improvement in the quality of life requires more time and the duration of follow-up in the present study was not sufficient to demonstrate the effect of interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Home-Visit versus Telephone Follow-Up Group</title><p>We showed KELZ, knowledge of schizophrenia, burden, and GHQ scores were different between the home-visit and telephone follow-up groups. Given that drug therapy is a crucial principle in the treatment of schizophrenia, regular supervision of patient treatment may lead to a better control of symptoms, alleviate the severity of the disease, and consequently reduce the relapse rate.</p><p>Our study had certain strengths and limitations. The most important strength was the study design. We did a randomized controlled trial on severe psychiatric patients. Conducting such trial on these patients and specially intervention in the form of home-visit is exuberant and time consuming. We required compliance of these patients to measure outcome variables; and this was achieved by using trained case managers and supporting them with almost low attrition rate. The other important point was collecting many significant clinical variables using standard questionnaires that allowed us to prepare some hypothesis testing. Although, we resorted to several hospitals to select eligible patients, the small sample size was the main limitation of the current study. However, there was some attrition beyond our control. The other limitation was the probability of visiting the patients by other psychiatrists without our coordination and control.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed that in our social and cultural conditions, clinical case-management service is capable of reducing rehospitalization and improve the clinical outcomes of individuals suffering from severe mental illness. Additionally, telephone follow-up services could have beneficiary outcome for the consumers, their caregivers, and the health system network. The results of the current study have shown that a trained case manager is capable of providing effective service that is most compatible with the socio-economic conditions of our society as a low-middle income country. Although a few patients requiring community based care are receiving such services by a team organized by the Welfare Organization (such as general physicians, psychologist, and social worker), but clinical case-management service could be cost-benefit in our country where acute psychiatric beds are limited.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Our special thanks to all patients and their caregivers who participated in this survey.
