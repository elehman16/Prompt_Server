However, COS imposes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening condition.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] OHSS is a self-limiting disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations related to increased capillary permeability and fluid retention brought about by many biochemical mediators, the most important being vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a vasoactive mediator which increases capillary permeability and is expressed at a higher level in the granulosa cells.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism postulated for this syndrome is increased vascular permeability and extravasation of fluid, which in turn causes hemoconcentration with reduced organ perfusion, alterations in blood coagulation and the resulting risk of thromboembolism, and leakage of fluid into the peritoneal cavity and lungs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] VEGF has been found to be expressed in human ovaries and it has been observed that VEGF mRNA levels increases after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration in granulosa cells and the elevated levels of the secreted proteins have been detected in serum, plasma, and peritoneal fluids in women at risk or with OHSS.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] VEGF stimulates new blood vessel development and vascular hyperpermeability by interacting with its VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The administration of a dopamine agonist in immature rats at low doses simultaneously with hCG prevented an increase in vascular permeability and did not affect angiogenesis; the effect was due to the availability of dopamine type 2 receptors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Dopamine agonists prevent the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and reduce the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> release of vasoactive angiogenic agents. As a result, vascular permeability is also reduced. Consequently, dopamine agonist at a daily dose of 0.5 mg has been supposed to be a potential new strategy to prevent OHSS and reduce its severity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Cabergoline, an ergot derivative, is a potent dopamine receptor agonist on D2 receptors. Cabergoline has been shown to prevent the increase in vascular permeability by inhibiting phosphorylation of VEGFR2, and many studies have evaluated cabergoline as a preventive strategy to reduce the incidence of OHSS using varying doses and regimens.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 0.5 mg of the dopamine agonist, cabergoline, in the prevention of OHSS in women at risk of developing OHSS when undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment cycles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was undertaken in Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine with the approval of the local ethics committee. Seventy infertile couples undergoing ICSI at a private <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization/ICSI and at risk of developing OHSS were included. The risk of developing OHSS was defined as follows: Estradiol (E2) level on the day of hCG &#x0003e;3000 pg/ml and with &#x02265;20 follicles &#x0003e;12 mm. Patients with E2 &#x02265;5000 pg/ml were excluded from the study.</p><p>A long mid-luteal gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist protocol after oral contraceptive pills pretreatment, 0.1 mg triptorelin SC (Decapeptyl; Ferring, Germany) was used for pituitary down-regulation in both groups. Once pituitary down-regulation had been confirmed, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was started using fixed dose of human menopausal gonadotropin, 150&#x02013;225 IU (Menogon 75 IU, IM injections, Ferring, Germany), for 5 days; the dose was then adjusted according to response. When three leading follicles reached 18 mm, final oocyte maturation was triggered with a single dose recombinant hCG of 250 mcg (Ovidrel; Merck Serono SA). On the day of hCG administration, couples were allocated by a series of computer generated random numbers into two groups: The cabergoline group (Group I; <italic>n</italic> = 36), received 0.5 mg daily for 8 days and the non-cabergoline group (Group II; <italic>n</italic> = 34), did not receive cabergoline. Transvaginal guided oocyte retrieval was performed 36 h later. Ultrasound guided the transfer of 1&#x02013;2 embryos was performed 72 h later. The luteal phase was supported with vaginal progesterone gel (Crinone 8%, 90 mg, Merck Serono SA), once daily up to the day of a pregnancy test.</p><p>Hematocrit, albumin, the presence of ascitis, measuring the perpendicular diameter of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas and the ovarian volume were reported in both groups on the day of hCG and 4 days later. The outcome measure was a reduction of the overall incidence of OHSS according to Golan's classification.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 17, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as percentages and relative ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval [CI]. Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, Chi-square test, and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test were performed to evaluate the statistical differences between the variables.

It is more frequently seen when a strong ovarian response occurs, characterized by the development of a large number of follicles, high E2 values, and enlarged ovaries.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Of the various pathophysiological mechanisms implicated for the causation of OHSS, it is the angiogenic molecule, VEGF, which has been found to be the biggest mediator of this potentially dreadful complication. It has been proven that VEGF stimulates new blood vessel development and vascular hyperpermeability by interacting with its VEGFR2.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Various forms of pharmacologic tools have been used for several years by many workers for the prevention and treatment of this complication in assisted reproductive technology (ART). The newer drugs, mainly the dopamine agonists in the light of the new pathogenetic and pharmacological evidence, should definitely be considered for prevention of OHSS. This prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) has demonstrated that the use of a 0.5 mg dose of cabergoline in high-risk women reduces the risk of OHSS development. We assumed that 0.5 mg of cabergoline could be safely and effectively reduce the incidence of OHSS in women undergoing ICSI treatment.</p><p>Different studies have evaluated the use of cabergoline as a preventive strategy for OHSS with a varying dose from 0.25 mg up to 1.0 mg. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled studies (<italic>n</italic> = 858 women), including the present study, comparing cabergoline versus placebo, albumin or no treatment for the prevention of severe OHSS were published. There was evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of severe OHSS in the cabergoline group (RR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29&#x02013;0.51) which agrees with our results.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The studies used different regimens, 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 12 days beginning on the day after oocyte retrieval;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 8 days beginning on the day after hCG injection;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 3 weeks beginning on the day after oocyte retrieval;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 2 days, repeating 1-week later, beginning on the day after hCG injection;[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] 0.25 mg tablet of cabergoline for 8 days beginning on the day after hCG injection;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 7 days beginning on the day after hCG injection;[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and 0.5 mg tablet of cabergoline for 7 days beginning on the day after oocyte retrieval.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There is no statistical evidence of the timing of cabergoline administration (day of hCG injection versus after oocyte retrieval) on final oocyte maturation, fertilization rate or clinical outcome for the prevention of OHSS in high-risk patients. Both treatment modalities effectively decrease the incidence of severe OHSS.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can also be divided into &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; depending on the time of onset, which helps in predicting the prognosis. The manifestations occurring within 9 days after the triggering dose of hCG reflects the excessive ovarian response and the precipitating effect of exogenously administered hCG for the final follicular maturation. On the other hand, OHSS presenting after this duration reflects the stimulation secondary to endogenous hCG from an early pregnancy. Thus, late OHSS is likely to last longer and of greater severity.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A human proof-of-concept study showed that the cabergoline reduces early onset OHSS by reducing ovarian vascular permeability in women at risk of OHSS.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Randomized clinical trials later confirmed that different commercial dopamine D2 receptor agonist exert similar effects. Paradoxically, these drugs impede the onset of early onset OHSS in 50% of women at risk of the syndrome but did not prevent late onset OHSS, which agrees with our results.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The safety of cabergoline use during infertility treatment, especially the ART outcome had been a concern. The function of VEGF during final oocyte maturation in humans is still unknown. To avoid the detrimental effect on follicular growth, final oocyte maturation, fertilization rate or subsequent clinical outcome due to blockage of the VEGF system too early, cabergoline is suggested to be administered immediately after oocyte retrieval by some investigators.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, Alvarez <italic>et al</italic>. in their study have presented that endometrial angiogenesis was not greatly altered, by the dose of cabergoline employed since neither implantation nor the overall ART outcome was affected.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The results of a Cochrane meta-analysis showed that no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;1.59; 2 RCTs, 230 women), miscarriage rate (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.03&#x02013;3.07; 1 RCT, 163 women) or any other adverse effects of the treatment (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;7.70; 1 RCT, 67 women) between the cabergoline group and the control group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A recently meta-analysis showed probably has no clinically relevant negative impact on clinical pregnancy (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.78&#x02013;1.34, 4 studies, 561 women) or on the number of retrieved oocytes (mean differences 1.15, 95% CI: 0.76&#x02013;3.07, 5 studies, 628 women). However, the estimates were imprecise for distinguishing between substantial harm, no effect, and substantial benefit considering live birth (RR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71&#x02013;1.48, 1 study, 200 women), and miscarriage (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.27&#x02013;1.76, 3 studies, 194 pregnant women). No studies reported congenital abnormalities.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In our study, we observed that clinical pregnancy and rate live births per cycle no showed differences statistically significant when compared to control group.</p><p>In conclusion, the dopamine agonist, cabergoline, reduces the incidence of OHSS when used by women who are at high risk for that complication while undergoing COS. Although the estimates were imprecise, cabergoline probably does not have a clinically relevant impact on clinical pregnancy rates or on the number of retrieved oocytes. However, the effects of cabergoline on important outcomes, namely, live birth, miscarriage, and congenital abnormalities are still uncertain.
