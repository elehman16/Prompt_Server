aerobic exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory factors in
juvenile obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Obesity and T2DM, typically common
among adults, have recently become more prevalent in the Korean juvenile population,
affecting not only their lipid profiles and oxidant stress levels, but also their BDNF and
inflammatory factor levels. [Subjects] This study enrolled 26 juveniles (boys = 15, girls
= 9) who were assigned to a control group (CG, n = 11), obesity group (OG, n = 8), or T2DM
group (TG, n = 7). [Methods] The outcome of a 40&#x02013;60-minute aerobic exercise session that
took place three times per week for 12 weeks at a maximum oxygen intake
(VO<sub>2max</sub>) of 50~60% was investigated. [Results] The exercise resulted in a
significant reduction in the resting serum BDNF and TrkB levels (baseline) among juveniles
in the OG and TG as compared to those in the CG. Additionally, the 12 weeks of regular
aerobic exercise led to significant reductions in body weight, body fat percentage, and
body mass index in the OG and a significant increase of VO<sub>2max</sub> in the OG and
TG. However, no significant differences in serum NGF or inflammatory factors were found
among the three groups. There was a significant increase in resting serum BDNF levels
following the 12 weeks regular exercise only in the OG. [Conclusion] While 12 weeks of
regular aerobic exercise had a positive effect on body composition, and increased BDNF
levels of juveniles in the OG, it did not affect the inflammatory factor levels and had no
effect on the TG.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>T2DM</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity and diabetes are common metabolic diseases. The prevalence rate of juvenile obesity
has broad and serious health implications, since obesity can increase the risks of type 2
diabetic mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), sleep apnea, and
cancer<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal glucose tolerance,
disturbed glucose tolerance, and T2DM have been identified as increasing the risk of
cognitive impairment, and are been known to induce cognitive damage, both of which are
early-stage symptoms of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and dementia<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Diabetes mellitus is also known to have adverse effects on the
peripheral nervous system leading to detrimental changes in brain structure and other
neurophysiological traits<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is generated and distributed from platelets in the
peripheral and central nervous systems, endotheliocytes, smooth muscle, immunocytes, and
skeletal muscle. It is a nerve growth and positively contributes to neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, and hippocampal neural plasticity, and enhances memory and learning<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A lower than normal BDNF level has been
observed among individuals with obesity and T2DM<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this has been reported to bring about neuropsychosis, severe
depression, and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
has also recently been found to affect metabolism in the skeletal muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Inflammatory factors are highly prevalent among individuals with obesity, T2DM, and
metabolic syndrome, and such inflammatory factors are associated with obesity and
inactivity. High levels of inflammatory factors have also been identified as an independent
factor in the progress of T2DM and CVD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on regular exercise and related neurotrophic factors has determined that exercise
can be divided between that which greatly increases the resting BDNF level<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and that which does not<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the findings are not conclusive due
to variations in exercise mode and duration.</p><p>Oberbach et al. studied the effects of regular exercise on inflammatory factors by
observing middle-aged men and women over the course of 12 months during which they performed
60 minutes of exercise once a week. There results show that as body mass index (BMI)
decreased with progression of the exercise training, serum IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels at rest decreased correspondingly. Christiansen et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> observed men and women over 12 weeks while they performed 60&#x02013;75
minutes of endurance training 3 times a week, accompanied by diet control. They also
reported a decrease in resting levels of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)
after training. In addition, CRP levels increased after one intense bout of exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a regular exercise training group had
lower levels of CRP than a control group<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although, the relationship between neurotrophic and inflammatory factors and regular
exercise has been investigated in recent research, the debate on whether regular exercise
can alter the resting BDNF level and inflammatory factor levels continues, and existing
research on the subject mainly concerns adults and the elderly. Insufficient research has
been conducted on juvenile obesity and T2DM, which are rapidly increasing. As adolescence
marks an important period of learning and development, the investigation of the effects of
regular exercise on juvenile obesity and T2DM is indispensable.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of exercise by measuring the resting levels of
neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF, and tropomyosin receptor kinase B [TrkB]), and inflammatory
factors (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; [TNF-&#x003b1;], and CRP) of juveniles assigned to an obesity
group (OG, n = 8), T2DM group (TG, n = 7), and control group (CG, n = 11) following 12 weeks
of aerobic exercise 3 times a week.</p><p>We hypothesized that juveniles with obesity and T2DM would have lower resting BDNF levels,
and that 12 weeks of regular exercise would result in increased levels of resting
neurotrophic factors and decreased levels of inflammatory factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This experiment initially recruited originally began with 45 teenagers who were assigned to
the OG (n = 15), TG (n = 15), and CG (n = 15). However, due to withdrawals, only 26
teenagers in the OG (n = 8, boys = 4, girls = 4, age; 16.3 &#x000b1;0.91), TG (n = 7, boys = 2,
girls = 5, age; 15.5 &#x000b1;2.14), and CG (n = 11, boys = 11, age; 16.4 &#x000b1;1.36) completed the 12
weeks program. All participants were between the ages of 13 and 19&#x02005;years, and there were 17
boys and 9 girls. The OG teenagers were selected based on the 1998 standards for children
and juvenile growth of the Korean Pediatrics Society: BMI &#x0003e; 95th percentile, or obesity
index &#x0003e;120%. The TG teenagers were selected from among D University Hospital out-patients
whose 2-hour glucose tolerance test was 140&#x02005;mg/dL &#x02264; blood sugar &#x02265; 200&#x02005;mg/dL, and who had no
other complicating diseases. The CG was created by age-matching with the TG and OG
juveniles. The study subjects were recruited via poster advertisements or the internet. The
study was approved by the D University Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the
subjects were included after medical examination and diagnosis by medical specialists.
Additionally, signed consent forms were obtained from the guardians of all participants
prior to the commencement of the study.</p><p>Height, weight, and BMI were measured as the physical characteristics, and body fat
percentage was measured using an impedance analyzer (Venus 5.5, Jawon Medical, Gyeongsan,

was conducted before the start of the exercise training. All participants were tested on a
Quinton Q65 treadmill (Quinton Co., USA) in a laboratory with 50&#x02013;55% humidity and a
temperature 24&#x02013;25&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. The subjects wore a Polar system (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland),
and were measured using a breath-by-breath test. Each respiration was automatically measured
for ventilatory volume, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide emission, respiratory exchange
ratio (RER), and heart rate (HR).</p><p>The exercise test was conducted using a treadmill exercise test and the Bruce protocol<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method involves steadily increasing
the exercise level until the target heart rate (THR) reaches 85% of the maximum oxygen
consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max). No subjects exhibited cardiac abnormalities or high blood
pressure before reaching the THR. To prevent accidents, participants were asked to
subjectively identify the intensity of exercise on the Borg scale of rate of perceived
exertion<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aerobic exercise was conducted for a total of 40&#x02013;60 minutes per session, 3 sessions a week,
for 12 weeks. Participants attained 50% of their oxygen consumption as measured by the
VO<sub>2max</sub> test. Between week 1 and week 4, they engaged in 30&#x02013;40 minutes
walking/running aerobic exercise on a school field under the instruction of a professional
trainer while wearing a Polar system at a calculated heart rate recovery (HRR) of 50%
VO<sub>2max</sub>. Between week 5 and week 12, the participants exercised in a similar
manner but for 40&#x02013;50 minutes at a HRR equivalent to 60% of VO<sub>2max</sub>. Each session
was preceded and followed by a 5-minute warm up and cool down, respectively.</p><p>Blood samples were drawn from the forearm vein after a 12-hour fast. Samples were
centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm for 10 minutes, stored at &#x02212;80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, and directly analyzed.</p><p>The biochemical analyses of serum IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and NGF were performed using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays for quantitative detection of human IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; (eBioscience, Vienna,
Austria) and NGF (Abcam, MA, USA). All factors were quantified using polyclonal antibodies
that recognized native human IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, or NGF and a series of plates containing wells
coated with predetermined amounts of recombinant human IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, or NGF.</p><p>Serum BDNF levels were analyzed with an R &#x00026; D system (Minneapolis, Minn., USA) kit and
serum TrkB levels were analyzed with a Sino Biological kit (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing,
China). First, the antibody was incubated overnight and washed 3 times. Next, the samples
and the standard were reacted with the detection antibody. Then, substrate solution and
streptavidin-HRP were added, the reaction was terminated with a stop solution, and the
results obtained by measuring the optical density at 450&#x02005;nm.</p><p>Serum CRP was analyzed with an automatic analyzer (AdipoGen, Seoul, Korea) using latex
cohesion turbidimetry with a CRP(II) X2 latex reagent.</p><p>For all data, the mean and standard deviation were calculated using SPSS for Windows ver.
14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to control for
differences between groups, test periods, physical characteristics, and biochemical blood
component changes caused by exercise, using Scheffe&#x02019;s method for the post hoc test.

on neurotrophic and inflammatory factors.</p><p>As described earlier, BDNF is mainly responsible for nerve survival, growth, maintenance,
learning, and memory. Patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease exhibit low levels of BDNF
expression in the hippocampus<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and low
serum BDNF<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, patients with
Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and Huntington&#x02019;s disease have low levels of hippocampal BDNF<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and patients with depression have low
levels of serum BDNF<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This experiment
revealed that the resting BDNF level at baseline before the 12 weeks of aerobic exercise was
significantly lower (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the OG than in the CG. This result is in agreement with
previous research<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which has reported low
levels of BDNF among people with obesity and T2DM. It also agrees with the findings of
previous research conducted on adults, which revealed that BDNF plays a very important role
in controlling energy homeostasis and weight<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and has an inverse relation with weight
and age<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is also was interesting to note that the TG and CG had similar resting BDNF levels,
i.e., the resting BDNF levels of the TG teenagers of normal weight were not greatly
depressed. This raises the question as to whether the resting BDNF levels of juveniles with
T2DM have a greater effect on body composition, such as weight, than the disease itself.</p><p>Another interesting point is that after 12 weeks of regular aerobic exercise, the resting
BDNF level of the OG increased to 19,617&#x02005;pg/mL, a level close to the adult normal range of
22,600&#x02005;pg/mL<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. This was a significant
increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) and it was only observed in the OG (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We suggest that there was no significant increase in the
resting BDNF level after the 12 weeks of exercise in the TG, because the exercise did not
result in significant changes in body composition (weight, BMI, body fat percentage).</p><p>TrkB is a BDNF receptor that is expressed abundantly and widely in the brain<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and NGF plays an important role in the
sustenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons as well as biological activities, including
cell growth<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Schulz et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic
ergometry exercise on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and reported no significant
difference in the NGF level of the exercise group. Bansi et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted 3 weeks of regular exercise (aquatic vs.
overland) for middle-aged patients with multiple sclerosis and also failed to significantly
alter resting NGF levels. While our present findings did not reveal a significant difference
in resting NGF levels in the OG, compared to the CG and TG, we did note an increase. A
previous study of 146 adults<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, also
reported the NGF levels of obese subjects were higher than those of normal weight subjects.
Although TrkB levels increased in the OG and TG following the 12 weeks of aerobic exercise,
there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, comparison of the
resting TrkB levels of the CG with OG and TG at baseline revealed that OG and TG had
significantly lower resting TrkB levels than CG, and we consider this proof of them having
decreased BDNF receptor levels, as TrkB is a BDNF receptor (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>One of the limitations of this experiment was that while there have been many studies of
neurotrophic factor BDNF, few human studies of NGF and TrkB have been conducted. This
renders comparative analysis difficult, and much more research concerning NGF and TrkB
levels will need to be conducted in the future.</p><p>High levels of inflammatory cytokines are observed in patients with obesity, T2DM, and MS,
and such high levels of inflammatory factors are an independent factor in the development of
CVD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, arteriosclerosis and
coronary artery disease are associated with increased levels of IL-6, CRP, and TNF-&#x003b1;<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, and higher IL-6 and CRP have been observed in metabolic disabilities
such as T2DM, MS, and obesity<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>IL-6, a typical inflammatory factor, is a multifunctional cytokine responsible for
pleiotropism in immunomodulation<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
was recently reported to be a myokine, involved in energy metabolism in skeletal muscle<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. CRP also serves as an indicator of
systemic inflammatory response. An increased CRP level in obese patients is explained by
IL-6 originating from adipose tissue, and CRP levels are significantly decreased by aerobic
exercise and diet<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Christiansen et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study of men and women
engaged in aerobic exercise lasting 60&#x02013;75 minutes per session, 3 sessions a week for 12
weeks. They noted that there were no significant reductions in IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, or MCP-1
without dieting or significant reductions in weight. Kohut et al.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> studied patients with metabolic disease who showed no
reduction in weight over the course of 10 months by comparing a group that did aerobic
exercise for 45 minutes per session, 3 sessions a week, with a resistance/flexibility
training group. They found that the aerobic exercise group showed significant reductions in
CRP, L-6, and IL-18. Additionally, a study of middle-aged men and women performing endurance
exercise, consisting of one 60-minute training session per week for 12 months, reported a
significant decrease in serum CRP levels following a reduction in BMI<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To date, reducing circulating inflammatory factors has been proposed to be associated with
weight reduction<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> and adipose tissue
reduction<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, but our 12 weeks of
exercise failed to result in a significant reduction in inflammatory factors (especially
IL-6) in the OG, despite a significant reduction in weight, body fat percentage, and BMI. We
believe that, compared to the 10&#x02013;12-month study periods of other experiments<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>
that saw reductions in IL-6 through regular training, the exercise period of this study was
too short to reduce resting IL-6 levels. Another interesting point is that this study
recorded very low levels of IL-6 (0.9&#x02013;1.4&#x02005;pg/mL) compared to the average resting IL-6 level
(3.4&#x02013;5.0&#x02005;pg/mL) reported by previous studies of adults (healthy people in their 30s and
middle-aged patients with T2DM) and the elderly over 64&#x02005;years of age<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the immune
and inflammatory systems progressively change with age<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>, perhaps the subjects&#x02019; youth may have been a factor influencing
their lower IL-6 levels, despite their obesity and T2DM. The resting IL-6 levels of the
teenagers were also close to the 1.1&#x02013;1.6&#x02005;pg/mL of young adults aged between 20 and 30&#x02005;years
with simple obesity<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous research related to exercise has reported significant reductions in inflammatory
factors (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, hs-CRP) following long-term training lasting 10&#x02013;12 months<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>
rather than a 12-week period<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. The only exception was an 8-week aerobic training and
diet restriction study of a group of children with obesity. That study reported a
significant reduction in inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, hs-CRP), and it argued that the
significant changes in body composition (body weight, BMI, body fat percentage), induced by
exercise and diet restriction, had a strong effect on the inflammatory factors<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We also observed slight changes in TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP levels after the 12 weeks of aerobic
exercise, but did not find significant differences, in agreement with previous studies<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taken together, our present results and
those of other studies<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup> indicate that exercise has limited or no effect on
inflammatory markers.</p><p>While many studies of exercise effects have been conducted using adults and the elderly,
comparisons with our results were limited by the lack of researches involving juveniles
between the ages of 13 and 17&#x02005;years, and differences in training period, exercise intensity,
exercise frequency, and sample size used in the other studies of BDNF and inflammatory
markers.</p><p>The juveniles with obesity and T2DM exhibited reduced levels of resting neurotrophic
factors (BDNF, TrkB) at baseline, but after the 12 weeks aerobic exercise, there was a
significant increase in the BDNF level of the OG. However, these findings are limited, and
the effects of regular exercise on neurotrophic factors and inflammatory factors in juvenile
obesity and T2DM were not conclusively proven. Future research will need to focus on related
areas of research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the
