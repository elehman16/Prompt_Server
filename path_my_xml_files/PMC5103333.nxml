However, despite these unprecedented gains, 250 million children younger than 5 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) cannot meet their developmental potential due to poverty, poor health and nutrition, and lack of necessary stimulation and care. Lesotho has high levels of poverty, HIV, and malnutrition, all of which affect child development outcomes. There is a unique opportunity to address these complex issues through the widespread network of informal preschools in rural villages in the country, which provide a setting for inclusive, integrated Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) and HIV and nutrition interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We are conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial in Mokhotlong district, Lesotho, to evaluate a newly developed community-based intervention program to integrate HIV-testing and treatment services, ECCD, and nutrition education for caregivers with children aged 1&#x02013;5 years living in rural villages. Caregivers and their children are randomly assigned by village to intervention or control condition. We select, train, and supervise community health workers recruited to implement the intervention, which consists of nine group-based sessions with caregivers and children over 12&#x000a0;weeks (eight weekly sessions, and a ninth top-up session 1&#x000a0;month later), followed by a locally hosted community health outreach day event. Group-based sessions focus on using early dialogic book-sharing to promote cognitive development and caregiver-child interaction, health-related messages, including motivation for HIV-testing and treatment uptake for young children, and locally appropriate nutrition education. All children aged 1&#x02013;5 years and their primary caregivers living in study villages are eligible for participation. Caregivers and their children will be interviewed and assessed at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and 12&#x000a0;months post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the potential of an integrated early childhood development intervention to prevent or mitigate developmental delays in children living in a context of extreme poverty and high HIV rates in rural Lesotho.

However, despite these unprecedented gains, 250 million children younger than 5 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) fail to meet their developmental potential because they are living in contexts of poverty, poor health and nutrition, and without necessary stimulation and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Infants and young children develop best when caring adults respond with warmth and consistency and when they are provided with opportunities for interaction and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, when caregivers are living in circumstances characterized by extreme poverty, poor nutrition and a high burden of disease, such as HIV/AIDS, their capacity to fulfill the caregiving role is compromised, placing the child at high risk for poor cognitive and socioemotional development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Lesotho is a country with high levels of poverty, where 40&#x000a0;% of the population lives below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day and 77&#x000a0;% of the population lives in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most of the country is mountainous, and many villages remain accessible only by foot or on horseback. It has one of the highest adult HIV prevalence rates globally, at 23&#x000a0;%, and is home to an estimated 36,000 children living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as well as large numbers of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Early diagnosis of HIV infection is essential to promote child survival and development, but geography and severe climate present challenges to HIV-testing and treatment of children. Difficult terrain and long periods of snow cover contribute to low rates of testing and long delays in obtaining infants&#x02019; test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and antiretroviral (ART) coverage among children aged 0&#x02013;14 years is only 25&#x000a0;%, the lowest in southern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In recent years, Lesotho has made significant progress in the rollout of HIV-testing and treatment for adults, but has not reached national testing treatment targets, and increasing testing rates and expanding treatment coverage remains a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The potential effect of the high HIV rate and poor treatment coverage on children in the country is enormous. In addition to the risk to their survival, children affected by HIV/AIDS are at serious risk of developmental delays. HIV affects child development both directly and indirectly; there is evidence of cognitive delays for children who are HIV-infected, and also for those exposed to HIV in utero but born uninfected, and for those whose parents are affected by HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition, due to the climate and mountainous terrain, and resulting poor food security, an estimated 13&#x000a0;% of children in the country are moderately or severely underweight, and 39&#x000a0;% have moderate or severe stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Delivering interventions in the early years has been shown to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], to reduce inequities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and to substantially improve long-term adult health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sustainable gains in child survival and development have been generated by social interventions and health care initiatives that seek to improve the physical and mental health of caregivers, support child nutrition, secure basic good-quality health services, and build culturally compatible linkages between service programs and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To date, however, maternal and child health intervention strategies have tended to address only one health risk at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the practice of combining health, nutrition, and Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) interventions for their additive impact has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is a unique opportunity to promote child development outcomes in Lesotho through the widespread network of informal preschools in rural villages in the country. Daycare centers, cr&#x000e8;ches, community-based childcare, or formal preschool services offer many advantages for communities affected by HIV/AIDS. ECCD centers can act as an entry point providing multiple health and social services, including facilitating access to HIV treatment and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>We are conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate an intervention called &#x0201c;Mphatlalatsane: Early Morning Star,&#x0201d; which integrates ECCD, HIV-testing and treatment services, and nutrition education, for caregivers with children aged 1&#x02013;5 years in informal preschool settings in rural communities near Mokhotlong, Lesotho.

Villages are very remote, with poor transport and road facilities, and severe weather conditions, especially in the winter months. The intervention is delivered in informal preschools in rural villages in the district. All children in the villages are included, regardless of whether or not they regularly attend the preschool. These informal preschools are run by local community members, often in their own homes, which are usually stone and mud houses without electricity or running water. Preschool staff have limited or no toys, books, or equipment, but are usually provided with support from the district Ministry of Education and Training in the form of monthly meetings and training workshops.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location of Mokhotlong district, Lesotho</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1658_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Neighborhood selection, matching and randomization</title><p>The selected clusters for the study were identified as villages where GROW had a resident community volunteer, and where there were informal preschool centers in operation. It was important to identify villages with an operational ECCD center, since the study makes use of these facilities to deliver the intervention to young children and their primary caregivers.</p><p>Prior to cluster randomization, all eligible villages were mapped in order to determine the approximate number of children aged 1&#x02013;5 years per village, the characteristics of the communities, the number of preschool centers, and the available government and nongovernmental services. Mapping (and subsequent data collection) in some villages requires transport by donkey due to inaccessibility by vehicle. Trained field-workers conducted the mapping exercise in two stages. During the primary mapping exercise, field-workers collected information at village level, preschool center level, and health care level for all villages. During the secondary mapping exercise, field-workers returned to the two largest, the two mid-size, and the two smallest villages to identify the number of children aged 1&#x02013;5 years in each household.</p><p>Based on the village mapping activity, 34 villages were matched into pairs based on various community, preschool and health service characteristics, and stratified by size and relative remoteness. In each pair, villages were then randomly assigned to the intervention group, where participants are allocated to the intervention or the control group using a free web-based randomization program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Randomization was overseen by an external statistician and the procedure followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The overall sample of villages was divided into two phases: phase 1 and phase 2, with phase 1 IC villages receiving the intervention first, followed by the roll-out of the intervention in phase 2 IC villages.</p><p>Researchers notified intervention and control village leadership, preschool staff, and community members about their allocation individually. All data collectors and data coders are blinded to group allocation in order to minimize assessment bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and study participants are asked not to reveal their condition to data collectors at any point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention is a group-based intervention which consists of three components: (1) &#x0201c;Book-sharing,&#x0201d; (2) &#x0201c;Health&#x0201d; (specific focus on HIV-testing and treatment), and (3) &#x0201c;Growth&#x0201d; (nutrition education) in addition to a Community Health Outreach Day at the end of the intervention period.</p><p>The ECCD component consists of caregiver training in sensitive &#x0201c;book-sharing&#x0201d; skills, designed to stimulates the child cognitively and encourage caregiver-child engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The benefits of dialogic book-sharing have been well-established in high-income countries and include language development, attention, literacy, and school readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In LMIC, there is limited evidence available, but a previous study in South Africa found that a book-sharing intervention for caregivers of 14&#x02013;16 month-old infants living in an impoverished periurban settlement proved effective in improving children&#x02019;s language development, sustained children&#x02019;s attention as well as socioemotional development, and led to improvements in carer-child interaction, increasing carers&#x02019; sensitivity to their infant&#x02019;s interests and cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this project, the book-sharing intervention program principles have been combined with a participatory, evidence-based approach to addressing issues around HIV-testing and nutrition education, based on local needs and resources.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Selecting intervention facilitators and community-based mentors</title><p>The intervention is delivered by trained and supervised community health workers, with an intervention facilitator and a community-based mentor in each team. The intervention facilitator delivers the book-sharing component of the intervention while the community-based mentor delivers the HIV and nutrition components. Intervention facilitators and community-based mentors were selected in a two-stage process. Firstly, 30 applicants were selected to attend an interview based on their experience and/or prior training in working with children and facilitation of group activities. Each potential candidate attended an interview with a panel of interviewers from GROW and Stellenbosch University. Of these, we selected 26 candidates to attend a 7-day training workshop. This workshop was used to help the panel to select the final team of one intervention coordinator, eight intervention facilitators, and eight mentors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Training</title><p>Training took place over several phases. First, we conducted the preselection training workshop, which covered basic training in book-sharing and facilitation skills. Next, candidates selected as intervention facilitators and community-based mentors attended a pilot intervention training workshop over 5&#x000a0;days. This training session covered informed consent procedures, referral mechanisms, the use of tablet devices for the intervention delivery, and troubleshooting for intervention sessions. Facilitators and mentors were primarily trained separately on their respective session content, but both attended selected book-sharing and health and nutrition training sessions in order to support their partners and become familiar with the integrated nature of intervention delivery. The training also included monitoring and evaluation procedures such as scheduling sessions, documenting attendance, making referrals, and completing feedback questionnaires after every session.</p><p>Each training workshop followed a similar structure and approach to participant training. Didactic sessions were followed by opportunities for practice. During practice sessions, the training facilitators offered frequent positive feedback and support. Trainers used tokens, goal-setting, and an emphasis on positive feedback to establish a warm and supportive group environment that encouraged staff members to fully participate and feel empowered in their roles as intervention facilitators and community-based mentors. It was important to model this approach to training participants as this is the same approach that they in turn are expected to incorporate in their delivery of the intervention sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Supervision</title><p>Intervention supervision takes place in the form of weekly group supervision meetings during the intervention delivery period to discuss challenges and successes from the past week. This includes difficult situations that may have arisen in the group setting, practical issues, and issues affecting fidelity such as maintaining good attendance levels. In addition, a supervisor conducts site visits on an ad hoc basis during the 8-week period, documents performance, and provides feedback. Each team is visited between three and four (every second week) times over the 8-week period. In addition, intervention teams are encouraged to report on a daily basis, via a Whatsapp group chat, on general progress, challenges, referrals, and any other concerns in the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pilot</title><p>The Medical Research Council framework recommends a feasibility and piloting phase after an intervention has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Because this is a newly developed integrated program, two short intervention pilots were conducted in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program, to assess logistical issues and to test the intervention content. The pilots were conducted over a period of 4&#x02013;5 weeks in nine preschools in Mokhotlong town. During this period GROW and Stellenbosch University, with technical support from Management Sciences for Health, piloted key components of the intervention program and some research procedures. After this pilot period, focus groups were conducted with participants about their experiences of the intervention, as well as with other local stakeholders/experts. The final intervention materials were then refined to reflect local contextual issues, such as geographic challenges and family composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention protocol</title><p>The intervention consists of group sessions with five to six caregivers and their children which last for 2 to 3&#x000a0;h, and are held weekly for eight consecutive weeks. Following the eighth session, after 1&#x000a0;month, a ninth &#x0201c;top up&#x0201d; session takes place, after which a community health outreach day is held in a location accessible to the village. The number of groups held in each village varies according to the size of the village. For 12&#x000a0;months thereafter, selected, appropriate books for young children are dropped off in intervention villages on a monthly basis to encourage groups to continue to meet regularly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Group sessions</title><p>The group intervention content is specified in a manual which is used to train intervention staff. The intervention consists of three components: (1) &#x0201c;Book-Sharing&#x0201d; (Early Childhood Care and Development), (2) &#x0201c;Health&#x0201d; (specific focus on HIV-testing and treatment), and (3) &#x0201c;Growth&#x0201d; (nutrition education).

</p><p>The intervention is hosted in local village preschools. The intervention facilitators and community-based mentors work together to deliver the sessions, each focusing on a different component of the intervention. Each intervention session consists of a group session, followed by short individual sessions. The sessions include group and individual activities and make use of presentations shown on a tablet computer as well as practical exercises. The aim is to convey didactic information, to model key skills, and to facilitate and encourage caregiver in dialogic book-sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is achieved using a group presentation together with video material. Following the presentation, each caregiver-child pair has a brief period of sharing a picture book together during which the facilitator makes suggestions and provides support. The Health and Growth components consist of key educational messages and facilitating the identification of available resources/services in the primary caregiver&#x02019;s environment to motivate positive practices. Community-based mentors conduct activities with caregivers, present visual aids, facilitate group discussions and practical demonstrations to convey important messages for nutrition and the importance of testing for HIV. They are responsible for making referrals and provide follow-up support to children who test positive for HIV during the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Community health outreach days</title><p>After the ninth intervention session, local organizations are mobilized to coordinate accessible community health events that aim to increase HIV-testing among families through promoting an overall focus on child health. They take place in several locations over a 4-week period and are targeted at both intervention and control villages. The events are structured in clusters of communities based on their geography. The community health outreach days provide a wide range of services which include nutrition assessments, vaccinations, HIV-testing and counseling, general health consultations, birth document registration, and delivery of information on child protection and community gardening. Project partners work with a number of local partners to run these events: Baylor College of Medicine Children&#x02019;s Foundation Lesotho, the Child and Gender Protection Unit, the Ministry of Health&#x02019;s District Health Management Team, the Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, the National Identity Civil Registry, and a local nongovernmental organization called Touching Tiny Lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Control condition</title><p>The control villages in the study do not receive the group-based integrated intervention, but they are invited to take part in community health outreach days that take place in an accessible venue near to their homes and provide access to a range of services, including HIV-testing and counseling and nutrition assessments.

The broader developmental focus of the SDG (&#x0201c;leave no one behind&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], combined with the thrive agenda of the Global Strategy will require a significant increase in research on integrated programming, beginning in the early years, that evaluates interventions taking place in remote rural areas where significant numbers of the world&#x02019;s population still live. The goal of the Mphatlalatsane study is to evaluate the impact of an integrated community-based, community-run early childhood care and development intervention that seeks to contribute to national efforts to improve the health and psychosocial wellbeing of vulnerable children aged 5&#x000a0;years and younger in Lesotho. This study provides a unique opportunity to link early child development and nutrition outcome data with HIV-related information for young children in order to improve our knowledge about the nature and extent of the relationship between HIV and child development, and the potential of an integrated early childhood development intervention to prevent or mitigate developmental delays in HIV-infected and -affected children.</p><p>The area in which the study is being implemented is a deeply rural site that poses significant geographic barriers. Increasingly, mobile health units are being deployed in Africa in response to deficiencies in health care infrastructure, particularly in remote rural areas in Africa in order to address the service and access gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], to serve the needs of remote communities. To date, mobile health units have been widely employed in the realm of HIV care and testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and tuberculosis (TB) testing and referral. However, in very remote areas (such as the Mokhotlong region of Lesotho) adverse weather conditions and impassable roads (during winter) the reach of mobile health units can be compromised. Our integration of mobile health units (health days) with home-based ECCD and nutrition services will, as well as improving the linkages with the primary health care facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], provide essential data on how to deliver comprehensive services to under-served or unserved populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission participant recruitment was continuing and 75&#x000a0;% complete.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ECCD</term><def><p>Early Childhood Care and Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMIC</term><def><p>Low- and middle income countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEPFAR</term><def><p>President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDG</term><def><p>Sustainable Development Goals</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MT is a lead investigator with the Centre of Excellence in Human Development, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and is supported by the National Research Foundation, South Africa.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The &#x0201c;Mphatlalatsane: Early Morning Star&#x0201d; project is funded by PEPFAR&#x02019;s OVC Special Initiative, United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Datasets will be deposited in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) in machine-readable format 3&#x000a0;years after the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study design and the writing of this paper.
