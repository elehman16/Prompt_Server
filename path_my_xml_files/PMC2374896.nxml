We have evaluated the immunogenicity, persistence of immune response, immune memory and safety of an investigational DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC conjugate vaccine given to infants in Northern Ghana.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In this phase II, double blind, randomized, controlled study, 280 infants were primed with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC or DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. At 12 months of age, children in each group received a challenge dose of serogroup A&#x0002b;C polysaccharides. Antibody responses were assessed pre, and one month-post dose 3 of the priming schedule and pre and 1 month after administration of the challenge dose. One month post-dose 3, 87.8&#x00025; and 88.2&#x00025; of subjects in the study group had bactericidal meningococcal serogroup A (SBA-MenA) and meningococcal serogroup C (SBA-MenC) antibody titres &#x02265;1&#x02236;8 respectively. Seroprotection/seropositivity rates to the 5 antigens administered in the routine EPI schedule were non-inferior in children in the study group compared to those in the control group. The percentages of subjects in the study group with persisting SBA-MenA titres &#x02265; 1&#x02236;8 or SBA-MenC titres &#x02265;1&#x02236;8 at the age of 12 months prior to challenge were significantly higher than in control group (47.7&#x00025; vs 25.7&#x00025; and 56.4&#x00025; vs 5.1&#x00025; respectively). The administration of 10 &#x003bc;g of serogroup A polysaccharide increased the SBA-MenA GMT by 14.0-fold in the DTPW-HBV/HibMenAC-group compared to a 3.8 fold increase in the control-group. Corresponding fold-increases in SBA-MenC titres following challenge with 10 &#x003bc;g of group C polysaccharide were 18.8 and 1.9 respectively. Reactogenicity following primary vaccination or the administration of the challenge dose was similar in both groups, except for swelling (Grade 3) after primary vaccination which was more frequent in children in the vaccine than in the control group (23.7&#x00025;; 95&#x00025;CI [19.6&#x02013;28.1] of doses vs 14.1&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; CI [10.9&#x02013;17.8] of doses). Fifty-nine SAEs (including 8 deaths), none of them related to vaccination, were reported during the entire study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Three dose primary vaccination with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC was non-inferior to DTPw-HBV/Hib for the 5 common antigens used in the routine EPI schedule and induced bactericidal antibodies against <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> of serogroups A and C in the majority of infants. Serogroup A and C bactericidal antibody levels had fallen below titres associated with protection in nearly half of the infants by the age of 12 months confirming that a booster dose is required at about that age. An enhanced memory response was shown after polysaccharide challenge. This vaccine could provide protection against 7 important childhood diseases (including meningococcal A and C) and be of particular value in countries of the African meningitis belt.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://controlledtrials.com/ISRCTN35754083">ISRCTN35754083</ext-link>

There is no vaccine available to protect against serogroup X meningococci. Polysaccharide vaccines, used mainly for reactive mass vaccination during epidemics, are poorly immunogenic in children under 2 years of age (except for serogroup A), induce short-lived protection (3&#x02013;5 years) in children, and have a limited ability to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and induce herd immunity <xref rid="pone.0002159-Enhanced1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

The sample size for the primary According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity comparisons was set at 280 enrolled subjects allowing for 60 drop-outs. A total of 220 evaluable subjects provided a study cumulative power to meet each criterion of co-primary endpoints individually (each individual power was at least 84&#x00025;, except for anti-PRP for which it was 79.8&#x00025;).</p><p>Data analysis was performed at GSK Biologicals using SAS software-Proc Plan (version 8.2) and StatXact (version 5.0). The primary immunogenicity analysis was performed on the initial ATP cohort, comprising all vaccinated subjects complying with the protocol and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component at one month post administration of vaccine dose 3. The analysis of persistence was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence, which comprised children vaccinated with the 3 primary vaccine doses and the polysaccharide challenge who had not received immunoglobulin or blood transfusion. The post-challenge ATP immunogenicity analysis was performed on children who complied with the protocol for the challenge part of the study and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen one month post the challenge dose. Immune responses were expressed as geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMC) for antibodies detected by ELISA, or as geometric mean titres (GMT) for antibodies detected by serum bactericidal activity (SBA). In an exploratory way, the non-overlapping of the 95&#x00025; CIs between the 2 groups was used as an indicator of a statistically significant difference. The primary objective was met if the differences between the groups were less than 10&#x00025; (lower limit [LL] of the 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] of difference between study population <italic>minus</italic> control more than &#x02212;10&#x00025;) in terms of seroprotection rate for D, T, HBV, and Hib antibodies, or if UL of the group ratio GMC was below 1.5 for pertussis antibodies, and if the lower limit of the 95&#x00025; CI for SBA titres of at least 1:8 was &#x0003e;80&#x00025; (for both serogroups A and C).</p><p>All 280 vaccinated subjects who received at least one primary vaccination dose of study vaccine (total vaccinated cohort) were included in the analysis of safety. The incidences of solicited symptoms, as well as of those graded 3 (i.e. preventing daily activity, or swelling &#x0003e;30mm, or rectal fever &#x0003e;40&#x000b0;C), within the 4-day follow-up period were tabulated over the whole primary vaccination course (i.e. per dose), with exact 95&#x00025; CIs. The incidence of unsolicited symptoms during the 31-day follow-up period after administration of each dose of vaccine was calculated using the standard terminology of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA&#x000ae;) primary system organ class and primary term. Reactogenicity and safety after the challenge dose of polysaccharide were assessed similarly. Only unsolicited symptoms and Serious Adverse Events are discussed in this paper. Serious adverse events were described according to the following study period: from enrolment up to one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination series, from one month after the third dose of vaccine up to the time of the challenge dose and for the period of one month after the challenge dose had been given.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>Two hundred and eighty of the 418 infants whose parents responded to an invitation to join the study were identified as eligible and were enrolled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002159-g001">Figure 1</xref>): 6 did not complete the study (4 in the study group due to SAEs and 1 subject in each study group who was lost to follow-up).

High levels of immunity to serogroup A exist in populations living in the &#x0201c;meningitis belt&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0002159-Amir1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002159-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Carriage of meningococci of serogroup A and C was reported to be low in Burkina Faso, <xref rid="pone.0002159-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002159-Yaro1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> although a study reported 17&#x00025; carriers in Nigeria <xref rid="pone.0002159-Blakebrough1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The high level of bactericidal antibodies in our study may be due to either cross-reacting antibodies or vaccination since a large segment of the population is routinely vaccinated with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Thus, the presence of bactericidal antibodies (SBA titre &#x02265;1&#x02236;8) in a substantial proportion of infants before vaccination (44&#x02013;48&#x00025; of infants had SBA-MenC, 25&#x02013;28&#x00025; had SBA-MenA titres at this level) is not surprising, probably reflecting the transfer of maternally derived antibody. The proportion of infants in the control vaccine group with titres above this level fell during the following months reflecting a natural decline in maternally acquired antibody. In contrast, bactericidal antibody titres persisted in infants who had received the study vaccine and at 12 months of age, approximately half of them still had SBA titres &#x02265;1&#x02236;8 for each serogroup. The higher prevalence of anti-PSA (78&#x00025;) and anti-PSC (75&#x00025;) maternal antibodies compared to bactericidal antibodies prior to vaccination suggest that not all meningococcal antibodies transferred by the mother to her infant are bactericidal. When mothers were asked whether they had been vaccinated against meningitis in the year preceding the start of the study, approximately one quarter of them remembered being vaccinated; the protective immune response to meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines in adults is known to last for at least 3 years <xref rid="pone.0002159-Greenwood3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002159-DeWals1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Vaccination against meningitis is undertaken repeatedly in Northern Ghana and this could explain the high background prevalence of anti-PSA and anti-PSC seropositivity in our study.</p><p>MenA and Men C bactericidal antibody titres were lower in Ghanaian infants than those obtained in a similar study undertaken in the Philippines where 97.7 and 99&#x00025; of vaccinated infants had SBA titres &#x02265;1&#x02236;8 for Men A and Men C respectively; GMTs were 316.7 (95&#x00025;CI [251.4&#x02013;398.9]) and 3132.6 (95&#x00025;CI [2496.9&#x02013;3930.1]) for serogroups A and C respectively <xref rid="pone.0002159-Gatchalian1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The present study was conducted in a tropical country but the cold-chain was closely monitored and there were no major deviations of the temperature at which the vaccines were kept (2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C). The immune response to the other antigens in the combined vaccine was as expected, so it is highly improbable that an undetected break in the cold-chain occurred. Another possibility that was considered was that the immune response of Ghanaian infants to the meningococcal conjugates might have been suppressed by high antibody concentrations in their mothers induced by natural exposure to meningococci or by vaccination. Therefore, the influence of infants' pre-vaccination antibody status (SBA-MenA, SBA-MenC, anti-PSA, anti-PSC) on the immune response to the new vaccine was studied. The response to the MenC component of the study vaccine was lower in infants seropositive for SBA-MenC or anti-PSC prior to vaccination, as has been found in the United Kingdom with the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine <xref rid="pone.0002159-Southern1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In contrast to MenC, pre-existing anti-MenA antibodies did not influence the immune response to the MenA component of the vaccine. Another possible reason for the lower immunogenicity seen in the present trial compared with the one undertaken the Philippines might be the very high level of pre-existing anti-TT antibodies found in the prevaccination samples of Ghanaian infants in the study vaccine and control groups (93&#x00025; and 97&#x00025; respectively) resulting from the fact that most women had been vaccinated against tetanus during pregnancy following the recommendation of the WHO <xref rid="pone.0002159-Immunization1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, a negative impact of pre-existing anti-TT antibodies on the MenAC response (the MenAC conjugate uses TT as a carrier) is unlikely as the anti-PRP response was higher in infants who received the study vaccine than in those who received the control vaccine, even though the Hib conjugate also uses a tetanus carrier. This effect was seen even though the quantity of PRP used in the study vaccine was 4 times less than in the control, probably as a result of a TT carrier effect as reported previously <xref rid="pone.0002159-Richmond2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002159-Kitchin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Other possible explanations for the lower immunogenicity of the MenA and MenC components of the candidate vaccine in Ghanaian infants are malnutrition and malaria. Cases of malnutrition were excluded at study entry and no serious episodes of malnutrition were reported during the primary vaccination phase of the study. Malaria can suppress the response to many vaccines including Hib conjugate vaccines and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines <xref rid="pone.0002159-Usen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002159-Williamson1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> but malaria is relatively uncommon in the first six months of life, even in areas of high transmission. Malaria was reported in about half of the study infants during the primary vaccination phase of this study but, in most cases, diagnosis was not confirmed by microscopy. Further research may be needed to determine if malaria influences the immune response to the meningococcal conjugate antigens.</p><p>Non-inferiority of the DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC vaccine compared to the control vaccine was demonstrated for the five antigens common to each vaccine. Although seroprotection for hepatitis B was in the lower range of that found in published studies, it is comparable to that induced by the control vaccine and remains at an acceptable level given that no hepatitis B vaccine was administered at birth and that similar levels of protection have been seen previously following immunization with a hepatitis B monovalent vaccine in other African countries using the same immunization schedule <xref rid="pone.0002159-Aspinall1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>The reactogenicity of DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC was similar to that of the control vaccine. The trend to more marked swelling at the injection site was without consequence and did not lead to any drop-outs. Three deaths reported in the study group within one month of primary vaccination were unrelated to the vaccine. These deaths, which occurred during the rainy season, when mortality is highest, are fewer than expected in a cohort of 280 children followed to the age of 7 months in a community with an infant mortality rate of 95.5/1000 <xref rid="pone.0002159-Nyarko1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. One infant abandoned the study after a malaria episode followed by epilepsy; there is now good evidence that malaria increases the risk of epilepsy <xref rid="pone.0002159-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Although most SAEs during the primary vaccination phase of the trial were in the study vaccine group (11 vs. 2), the pattern of SAEs was that of common infections in this community, such as malaria and acute respiratory infections, and none of the events were considered to be vaccine related. The occurrence of a higher incidence of SAEs in the study than in the control group was probably a result of chance as evidenced by a more extended safety follow-up that was done up to the end of the challenge phase which did not reveal a difference in the overall incidence of SAEs between the groups. Furthermore, in a large safety study including 1780 infants vaccinated with either the DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC or the DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccines in Asia, the incidence of SAEs was similar in both groups <xref rid="pone.0002159-Nyarko1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Nevertheless, the safety of the new vaccine will require further evaluation in Africa, especially as a similar increase in SAEs was seen in a previous study that evaluated another meningococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa, although this was also considered to be most likely to be a result of chance <xref rid="pone.0002159-Leach1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Because the age distribution of cases of meningococcal disease in Africa covers a broader range than Hib or pneumococcal infections in children, introduction of the new vaccine into the EPI program would, alone, have only a limited impact on the overall burden of meningococcal disease until vaccination had been continued for many years. Recent experience in the UK with a MenC conjugate suggests that immunization in infancy gives only short-term direct protection and that a booster dose is required to provide sustained immunity <xref rid="pone.0002159-Trotter1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Additional complementary vaccination strategies are needed in addition to infant immunization if a maximum effect is to be achieved. Vaccination of all children and young adults with a monovalent group A conjugate, or even better with a tetravalent ACWY conjugate, is a possible way of achieving this using infant immunization to maintain the pool of protected individuals.</p><p>In conclusion, the DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC vaccine is non-inferior to the control vaccine in inducing antibody titres that are associated with protection against 5 important childhood diseases in a single series of injections given during the routine vaccination EPI schedule. The vaccine induces bactericidal antibody titres which should provide protection against infection with group A and group C meningococci in infants in the &#x0201c;meningitis belt&#x0201d; during the first year of life. However, induction of more sustained protection will require booster immunization given routinely or perhaps through mass vaccination campaigns. Introduction of this combined conjugate vaccine into the routine immunization programme of countries within the meningitis belt could be an important option towards lowering the burden due to recurrent <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> epidemics in Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002159.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.80 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002159.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002159.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002159.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the infants and their families as well as the health care personnel that participated in this study and the local authorities in Navrongo.
