Surgical approaches such as transanal endoscopic microsurgery, which utilize small operative working spaces, and are necessarily single-port, are particularly demanding with standard instruments and have not been widely adopted. The aim of this study was to compare simultaneously surgical performance in single-port versus multiport approaches, and small versus large working spaces. <italic>Methods</italic>. Ten novice, 4 intermediate, and 1 expert surgeons were recruited from a university hospital. A preclinical randomized crossover study design was implemented, comparing performance under the following conditions: (1) multiport approach and large working space, (2) multiport approach and intermediate working space, (3) single-port approach and large working space, (4) single-port approach and intermediate working space, and (5) single-port approach and small working space. In each case, participants performed a peg transfer and pattern cutting tasks, and each task repetition was scored. <italic>Results</italic>. Intermediate and expert surgeons performed significantly better than novices in all conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). Performance in single-port surgery was significantly worse than multiport surgery (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). In multiport surgery, there was a nonsignificant trend toward worsened performance in the intermediate versus large working space. In single-port surgery, there was a converse trend; performances in the intermediate and small working spaces were significantly better than in the large working space. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Single-port approaches were significantly more technically challenging than multiport approaches, possibly reflecting loss of instrument triangulation. Surprisingly, in single-port approaches, in which triangulation was no longer a factor, performance in large working spaces was worse than in intermediate and small working spaces.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>minimally invasive surgery</kwd><kwd>endoscopy</kwd><kwd>laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>single-port surgery</kwd><kwd>single-incision laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>SILS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1553350615610650"><title>Introduction</title><p>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is arguably the greatest innovation in surgery of the past 30 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Although most surgeons can perform the majority of multiport adult laparoscopic surgery safely and effectively, the clinical penetration of MIS in other specialties has been variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350615610650">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1-1553350615610650" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Examples of Multiport Versus Single-Port Surgery in Large, Intermediate, and Small Working Spaces.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1553350615610650-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple Ports</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single Port</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large working space, 34&#x02009;225 cm<sup>3</sup> (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery box trainer)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adult laparoscopy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intermediate working space, 1620 cm<sup>3</sup> (Pediatric Laparoscopic Surgery box trainer)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pediatric laparoscopic surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pediatric single incision laparoscopic surgery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Small working space, 81 cm<sup>3</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transanal endoscopic microsurgery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transoral endoscopic microsurgery</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transcranial endoscopic microsurgery</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Single-port laparoscopic surgery has been suggested as a less invasive alternative to standard multiport laparoscopic surgery, but is more technically challenging, principally due to the difficulty triangulating standard instruments.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Pediatric laparoscopic surgery may also be more technically challenging than standard adult laparoscopic surgery because of the difficulty manipulating instruments within small operative working spaces.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Surgical approaches incorporating the smallest operative working spaces, and are necessarily single-port, such as transoral endoscopic microsurgery, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and transcranial endoscopic microsurgery, are particularly demanding<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and have not been widely adopted by their respective surgical communities.</p><p>To date, several studies have compared surgical performance in single-port versus multiport approaches,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but few have compared performance in small versus large working spaces,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and no previous studies have evaluated the influence of both variables simultaneously.

Moreover, we have compared simultaneously performance in single-port versus multiport approaches, and small versus large working spaces. In keeping with previous studies, we identified that single-port approaches are significantly more technically challenging than multiport approaches, irrespective of the level of experience of the surgeon, or the nature of the surgical task performed, reflecting loss of instrument triangulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Interestingly, the influence of working space on surgical performance was variable. In multiport approaches, there was a nonsignificant trend toward worsened performance in smaller working spaces, perhaps resulting from reduced triangulation, as the instrument ports were necessarily placed closer together. In singleport approaches, in which triangulation was no longer a factor, performance in large working spaces was, surprisingly, worse than in intermediate and small working spaces.</p><p>Several studies have previously compared the performance of surgeons when performing laparoscopic tasks through single-port versus multiport access. Cox et al randomized 40 medical students into 2 groups, using single-port and multiport access.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Both groups were trained in 4 basic laparoscopic drills (including peg transfer and pattern cutting), before being crossed over to the alternate approach. Participants in the single-port group took more time to reach proficiency (178.0 &#x000b1; 93.4 vs 119.1 &#x000b1; 69.7 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .058), with significantly greater repetitions (118.8 &#x000b1; 54.3 vs 77.6 &#x000b1; 42.6; <italic>P</italic> = .027). Santos et al<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Lewis et al<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> performed similar randomized crossover studies, confirming these findings in novice surgeons, and also suggesting that experience can mitigate, at least to some extent, the technical barriers associated with loss of triangulation in single-port surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Few studies have looked at the effect of working space on performance of laparoscopic surgery, though many surgeons have argued that operating within smaller working spaces such as the pediatric abdomen is inherently more technically challenging than standard laparoscopy.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Azzie et al developed and validated the PLS box trainer simulator used in the present study, and they found that the revised total PLS scores in their simulator were considerably worse than in the adult FLS trainer box.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our study also trended toward worsened performance in multiport approaches in the PLS trainer box, compared to the adult FLS trainer box. However, in contrast to the aforementioned multiport approaches, we found a trend toward <italic>improved</italic> performance in single-port approaches in smaller working spaces. We speculate this may be the result of instruments being more frequently lost outside the operative field when performing tasks through single-port approaches and large working spaces, particularly in the hands of novices. Nonetheless, no previous studies have previously assessed the impact of smaller working spaces in single-port approaches, and further investigation is merited to confirm and extend these findings.</p><sec id="section13-1553350615610650"><title>Limitations</title><p>It should be noted that this study has limitations. Intermediate and expert surgeons were combined for analysis due to lack of experts familiar with uncommon and difficult single-port approaches in the smallest operative working spaces. Nonetheless, the significant difference in performance between novices and intermediates-expert surgeons supports use of modified tasks and a custom box trainer.</p><p>The sizes of the tasks themselves, while appropriate in the small custom box and intermediate pediatric training box, may have been mismatched in the large adult FLS training box. While this does not in itself invalidate the findings of this study, it suggests that it is not the physical constraints of the operating working space per se but rather the size of the tasks themselves that may be particularly important in determining operative performance. This may, at least to some extent, explain the reason that performance in smaller working spaces was not significantly worse and, in single-port approaches, actually better than in larger working spaces, despite an abundance of anecdotal evidence to the contrary.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1553350615610650"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The generalizability of this study is likely to depend on several other factors including the experience of the surgeon with a particular approach, the instruments and endoscopes used, and the size and complexity of the surgical task performed. Nonetheless, the finding that instrument triangulation is perhaps the most critical determinant of surgical performance is likely to hold true, and has been corroborated by other groups comparing multiport and single-port approaches.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1553350615610650" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This insight supports the efforts of several groups to improve the performance of surgeons in single-port approaches through improved training and technology.
