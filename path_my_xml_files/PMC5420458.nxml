evidence based medicine curriculum in improving the knowledge of pediatric
residents at two institutions.
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty first and
second year pediatric residents at MassGeneral Hospital for Children and
MedStar Georgetown University Hospital participated in a crossover study. The evidence based medicine curriculum,
consisting of 4 ninety minute sessions grounded in adult learning theory
principles, was developed using the methodology described in the book &#x02018;Studying
a Study&#x02019;. A validated 20 question
evidence based medicine multiple choice test was administered on three separate
occasions to measure baseline knowledge, efficacy of the curriculum in improving
knowledge, and long term retention of that knowledge.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Post curriculum, the fall group&#x02019;s
scores improved 23% from baseline (M=10.3, SD=2.4) to (M=12.7, SD=3.0) students
(t<sub>(26)</sub>=-3.29, p=0.0018) while the spring group improved by 41%
(M=10.0, SD=2.8) to (M=14.1, SD=2.2) students (t<sub>(32)</sub>=-6.46,
p&#x0003c;0.0001).&#x000a0; When re-tested 4-6 months
later, the fall group&#x02019;s scores did not significantly decline from their
immediate post curriculum scores (M=12.7, SD=3.0) to (M=11.7, SD=3.0) students
(t<sub>(32)</sub> =1.33, p=0.190). There
was an association between number of sessions attended and increase in post
curriculum score (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(3, N=60) =11.75, p=0.0083).
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Findings
demonstrate our curriculum was effective in teaching evidence based medicine to
pediatric residents, and fostered long term retention of knowledge.&#x000a0; Based on these results, we believe this
curriculum could be implemented at any institution.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Graduate medical education</kwd><kwd>evidence based medicine</kwd><kwd>pediatric residents</kwd><kwd>USA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the concepts of evidence based medicine (EBM) with the ability to assess the medical literature is a necessary skill for all clinicians.&#x000a0; However, most residents have limited knowledge of the components of research methodology including study design, biostatistics, and result interpretation.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Any knowledge acquired appears to regress with advancement through training, possibly due to the instruction taking place during the undergraduate medical education years with limited reinforcement during residency.&#x000a0; Although many pediatric programs offer an EBM curriculum in some form, a survey of chief residents at North American residency programs found that 7% (n=153) felt confident in their ability to teach EBM, and only 20% (n=153) were able to evaluate EBM effectiveness.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Given the time constraints on didactic instruction during residency, it is difficult to introduce new curriculum.&#x000a0; Therefore, journal club is the most commonly used vehicle to teach EBM to residents, yet this rarely translates into effective EBM skills.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Basing curriculum on adult learning theory is critical<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> in engaging adult learners and fostering knowledge retention, but these principles are rarely applied in the context of these journal clubs.&#x000a0; Due to logistical issues with residents&#x02019; schedules, and lack of protected time for EBM curricula, few studies have been able to assess the effectiveness of EBM training.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>&#x000a0; Therefore, most studies assess trainee&#x02019;s knowledge immediately after a course or intervention but have not routinely measured knowledge retention months later.</p><p>Past research has shown that short courses which provide six hours of instruction are sufficient to improve pediatric residents&#x02019; EBM skills,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> &#x000a0;however, very little is known about either the generalizability or long term effectiveness of these courses.&#x000a0; Studies that have assessed EBM effectiveness have either looked at courses spanning several years of training,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or have only measured self-reported outcomes.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> None have been carried out at more than one institution.</p><p>Currently, it is unknown if a concise EBM course grounded in adult learning theory, could achieve long term effectiveness and be generalizable to other institutions.&#x000a0; The purpose of this study was to assess both the short and long term effectiveness of a novel EBM curriculum in improving the knowledge of pediatric residents at two institutions.</p><p>We hypothesized that pediatric residents&#x02019; current understanding of EBM is limited, and that our curriculum, grounded in adult learning theory, would improve pediatric residents&#x02019; understanding of study methodology, biostatistics and result interpretation, leading to long term retention and improved confidence in understanding these principles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The IRBs at each institution, MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) determined this study exempt from ethical approval as the research was conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involved normal educational practices and examined the effectiveness of instructional techniques.</p><p>Participants included first and second year residents at two pediatric residency programs, MGHfC and MGUH.

The instructors&#x02019; increased familiarity with the course and initial feedback from the residents may explain the greater improvement in test scores seen in the spring group.&#x000a0; Pre and post curriculum confidence scores did not vary between the fall and spring groups, suggesting that each group had a similar educational experience.</p><p>The strength of our study was the ability to demonstrate knowledge retention 4-6 months after completing the curriculum. Furthermore, simply participating in a pediatric residency did not teach these important skills, arguing against a maturation effect. We found a statistically significant dose response in our study; attending more sessions was associated with a greater improvement in post curriculum test score. When analyzing each institution separately, MGUH residents showed slightly more improvement in post intervention scores than MGHfC, which may be explained by a higher attendance rate. This highlights the importance of finding time in the residency schedule to allow full participation.&#x000a0; We demonstrated evening dinner sessions are feasible, and survey results showed that evening sessions did not negatively affect the residents&#x02019; perception of the course.</p><p>Residents at both institutions rated their experience favorably, felt more confident interpreting statistical tests post curriculum, and recommended that the course be repeated. This study suggests that a short four session course using a critical appraisal instrument can serve as the basis for an effective and rigorous EBM curriculum.&#x000a0; There was nothing inherent in the curriculum that would limit it to only pediatric residents. All examples and articles included in the curriculum can be changed to be specialty specific, and no prior knowledge is necessary to understand the material.&#x000a0; Therefore, this course could be used for all specialties regardless of level of training, or prior EBM experience.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>The residency programs at MGHfC and MGUH were different sizes and because of logistical issues first year residents were grouped with second year residents at only one institution.&#x000a0; Since all residents in the study were similar in background demographics and baseline EBM knowledge, it was appropriate to combine them.&#x000a0; The mixing of groups may actually improve the generalizability of our results and when analyzed separately, scores at each individual institution were similar. Finding protected time in the residents&#x02019; schedule was challenging.&#x000a0; Therefore, some residents could not attend all sessions, and the sessions did not occur at equally spaced intervals at the two institutions. Since this is likely to happen in actual practice, it gave us the opportunity to see if this curriculum would work in a real life situation. Although the content was identical, and every effort was made to deliver the material in a similar fashion, it is probable the residents received somewhat different instruction at each institution. However, MGHfC residents showed similar improvement to the MGUH residents despite only the MGUH instructor having previous epidemiological training. The primary outcome measure was administered three separate times and used the same questions, however, the order varied and residents were not given the answers until completion of the study.&#x000a0; Simply taking the test multiple times did not improve residents&#x02019; scores and no testing effect was seen.</p><p>While this study did not measure changes in behavior, residents were encouraged to use the MAARIE framework on their own and in the setting of existing journal clubs.&#x000a0; Future studies will determine if sustained use of the MAARIE framework will continue to improve pediatric residents&#x02019; knowledge and skills, and ultimately lead to applying EBM skills to patient care.</p><p>In the future we intend to offer this curriculum at the beginning of intern year, followed by regular journal clubs based on the MAARIE framework. We have shown this curriculum to be effective when led by faculty without EBM training, and plan to teach other faculty to deliver this course.&#x000a0; We will continue to study long term retention using the MAARIE framework in future journal clubs.&#x000a0;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Effective curricula need to be adult learning focused, promote self-directed learning, fill an educational gap, fit into a busy training schedule and be cost effective.
