We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of graded exercise delivered as guided self-help.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we recruited adult patients (18 years and older) who met the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome from two secondary-care clinics in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned to receive specialist medical care (SMC) alone (control group) or SMC with additional guided graded exercise self-help (GES). Block randomisation (randomly varying block sizes) was done at the level of the individual with a computer-generated sequence and was stratified by centre, depression score, and severity of physical disability. Patients and physiotherapists were necessarily unmasked from intervention assignment; the statistician was masked from intervention assignment. SMC was delivered by specialist doctors but was not standardised; GES consisted of a self-help booklet describing a six-step graded exercise programme that would take roughly 12 weeks to complete, and up to four guidance sessions with a physiotherapist over 8 weeks (maximum 90 min in total). Primary outcomes were fatigue (measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire) and physical function (assessed by the Short Form-36 physical function subscale); both were self-rated by patients at 12 weeks after randomisation and analysed in all randomised patients with outcome data at follow-up (ie, by modified intention to treat). We recorded adverse events, including serious adverse reactions to trial interventions. We used multiple linear regression analysis to compare SMC with GES, adjusting for baseline and stratification factors. This trial is registered at ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22975026.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between May 15, 2012, and Dec 24, 2014, we recruited 211 eligible patients, of whom 107 were assigned to the GES group and 104 to the control group. At 12 weeks, compared with the control group, mean fatigue score was 19&#x000b7;1 (SD 7&#x000b7;6) in the GES group and 22&#x000b7;9 (6&#x000b7;9) in the control group (adjusted difference &#x02212;4&#x000b7;2 points, 95% CI &#x02212;6&#x000b7;1 to &#x02212;2&#x000b7;3, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001; effect size 0&#x000b7;53) and mean physical function score was 55&#x000b7;7 (23&#x000b7;3) in the GES group and 50&#x000b7;8 (25&#x000b7;3) in the control group (adjusted difference 6&#x000b7;3 points, 1&#x000b7;8 to 10&#x000b7;8, p=0&#x000b7;006; 0&#x000b7;20). No serious adverse reactions were recorded and other safety measures did not differ between the groups, after allowing for missing data.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>GES is a safe intervention that might reduce fatigue and, to a lesser extent, physical disability for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

Block randomisation (randomly varying block sizes) was done at the level of the individual with a computer-generated sequence and was stratified by centre, depression score according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, &#x02264;10 or &#x02265;11),<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and severity of disability according to the Short-Form 36 physical function subscale (SF-36 PF, &#x02264;40 and &#x02265;45).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> After notification of intervention allocation, the trial manager informed the participant.

The trial manager was responsible for arranging remote randomisation and informing the participants and therapists of intervention allocation, and therefore could not be masked from intervention allocation. The trial statistician, Trial Steering Committee, and the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee were masked from intervention allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Procedures</title><p>Before randomisation, all patients had at least one SMC consultation, delivered by doctors with specialist experience in chronic fatigue syndrome. SMC could involve prescriptions or advice regarding medication, as indicated for symptoms or comorbid conditions such as insomnia, pain, or depressive illness. Although not routinely scheduled during the trial, further SMC sessions were available after randomisation for patients who required it, but it was not a standardised intervention.</p><p>In addition to SMC being available, participants in the GES group were given a copy of a self-help booklet<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> describing a six-step programme of graded exercise self-management. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/images/pdfs/getset/GET%20guide%20booklet%20version%201%2022062010.pdf" id="interrefs30">GES booklet</ext-link> was based on the approach of GET developed for the PACE trial<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and on NICE recommendations,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and was iteratively developed with pilot patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Participants were encouraged to use the six steps described in the booklet: stabilising a daily routine, starting regular stretching, deciding on a physical activity goal and choosing a type of activity with which to start, setting a physical activity baseline, increasing the duration of physical activity and finally the intensity.</p><p>The most commonly chosen exercise was walking. Importantly, if a participant found that their symptoms increased after an incremental change in their activity, they were advised to maintain their activity at the same level for longer than a week, until symptoms had settled, before considering another incremental increase.</p><p>In the first session, which lasted 30 min, a physiotherapist provided guidance on following the booklet and answered any questions from participants. This first session occurred within 5 working days of randomisation and was delivered face to face, by Skype, or by telephone. Up to three further appointments of 20 min each were offered over 8 weeks, and participants could choose to receive the guidance either by Skype or by telephone. Two experienced physiotherapists were trained to support the participants in using the booklet, but they were explicitly told not to provide therapy. During each session, they inquired about progress and answered any questions, with a focus on moving forward to the next step. They recognised achievements and provided feedback to participants on their efforts, with the aim of increasing motivation and self-efficacy. Mid-way through the guidance intervention, the physiotherapist discussed setbacks with the participant. A therapy leader trained the two physiotherapists until they were deemed competent and then provided regular individual supervision. The physiotherapists followed a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/images/pdfs/getset/GETSET%20therapists%20manual%20with%20appendices.pdf" id="interrefs40">manual</ext-link> when delivering the guidance, and all participant guidance sessions were audio-recorded for supervision, feedback, and monitoring of treatment integrity. If a participant could not be contacted by telephone or Skype, an email was sent to re-engage them.</p><p>Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after randomisation, roughly 4 weeks after GES guidance had ended. Participants were also followed up at 12 months after randomisation, and these results will be published in a separate paper. The trial manager undertook the baseline assessments either face to face in the clinic or via telephone or Skype. Follow-up questionnaires were sent by mail with freepost envelopes for return. If the follow-up questionnaires were not returned after reminders, the questionnaire was completed in the waiting room before the first clinic therapy appointment. All measures were self-rated by the participants.</p><p>The number of contacts with the physiotherapist during the trial, as well as the mode and duration of each contact, were recorded. At 12 weeks, participants were also asked in a questionnaire how satisfied they were with the help they had received during the study; the seven-point scale was condensed into four categories: dissatisfied (very or moderately dissatisfied), minimum (slightly dissatisfied, neither, or slightly satisfied), satisfied (moderately or very satisfied), and &#x0201c;did not receive help&#x0201d;. The physiotherapists rated participants on their health (with clinical global impression [CGI]), adherence to their GES programme on a five-point scale (completely, very well, moderately well, slightly, and not at all), and their acceptance of the therapy model (also completely, very well, moderately well, slightly, and not at all). Information was retrieved from NHS service computerised attendances to determine how many SMC sessions participants had received during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The two primary outcomes were fatigue&#x02014;measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> (CFQ; Likert scoring 0, 1, 2, and 3; range 0&#x02013;33; highest score is most fatigue)&#x02014;and physical function, measured by SF-36 PF (range 0&#x02013;100; highest score is best function) 12 weeks after randomisation.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These questionnaires are valid and reliable measures, and have been used in previous trials.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The original protocol had only one primary outcome measure, the SF-36 PF. However, when some eligible participants were found to have high SF-36 PF scores at randomisation (because of their illness affecting cognitive or social functions but not physical function), we decided to also include fatigue, using the CFQ, as a co-primary outcome. This decision was made mid-way through trial recruitment (on June 20, 2013, after recruitment of 99 [47%] patients), before any outcome data had been examined, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee, and the Trial Steering Committee.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>The main secondary outcome was self-rated CGI score to assess change from baseline in overall health (CGI-health) and in chronic fatigue syndrome (CGI-CFS).

Adverse events were considered serious if they involved death, hospital admission, increased severe and persistent disability, or self-harm, or when they were life-threatening or required an intervention to prevent one of these events. SMC clinicians and GES physiotherapists reported possible serious adverse events and reactions to the centre leader, and appropriate action was taken.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Two suitably qualified scrutineers who were masked from intervention allocation reviewed all such adverse events, independently from the trial team, to establish whether there were any further serious adverse events. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two scrutineers.

Serious deterioration in health was defined as any of the following outcomes: a decrease in SF-36 PF score of 10 points or more between baseline and 12 weeks;<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> scores of &#x0201c;much worse&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very much worse&#x0201d; on the participant-rated CGI-health score;<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> or active withdrawal from the intervention because of worsening.</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our original sample size calculation was based on use of the SF-36 PF as our primary outcome measure, but the significance level was reduced from 5% to 2&#x000b7;5% to accommodate two primary outcomes. In a previous trial of chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis in secondary care (n=641),<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> mean SF-36 PF scores were 37 (SD 15) at baseline and 48 (21) after 12 weeks of practitioner-led GET (ie, an 11-point increase).<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> On the basis of these findings<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and our estimate that GES would be less effective than therapist-delivered GET, our sample size calculations were based on the assumption that a mean difference of 8 (SD 18) points between study groups at 12 week follow-up would be a clinically meaningful difference on the SF-36 PF scale. Thus, assuming a significance level of &#x003b1;=2&#x000b7;5% and a power of 80%, we required a minimum of 98 participants in each group.

Based on results from previous trials<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we expected a roughly 10% loss to trial follow-up; therefore, we aimed to recruit 109 patients to each group (ie, a total of 218).

Hence, assuming a significance level of &#x003b1;=2&#x000b7;5% and a power of 80%, we required a total of 154 patients, which was within the 218 already planned.</p><p>We assessed data distribution of continuous measures, and normality of the data and regression residuals were explored. If the data were not normally distributed, they were transformed. Items with missing data on the primary and secondary outcome variables at baseline and follow-up were imputed with mean replacement (prorating) when less than 20% of item responses per scale were missing.</p><p>In the primary analysis, we compared results from both the SF-36 PF and the CFQ at 12 weeks between study groups, adjusted with multivariable linear regression analyses. All randomised participants with outcome data at follow-up (ie, the modified intention-to-treat population) were included in analyses, regardless of any departure from the allocated intervention. We adjusted models for study group, baseline measure of the outcome, and stratification factors (ie, study centre, depression score [high <italic>vs</italic> low], and baseline physical function [high <italic>vs</italic> low]). We estimated effect sizes using Cohen's <italic>d</italic>, calculated by the adjusted mean difference between the two groups divided by the pooled SD at follow-up.</p><p>In the secondary analysis, we used the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis to assess the differences between study groups in the number of participants who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement on the SF-36 PF (ie, an 8 point increase) and the CFQ (ie, a 3-point decrease). We dichotomised the outcome measures using their corresponding clinically useful criteria and assessed the association between study group and clinically meaningful change score using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. For the two CGI scales, we compared the proportions of participants reporting a positive change, minimal change, or negative change across study groups using ordinal logistic regression, adjusting for our stratification variables.</p><p>To do a strict intention-to-treat analysis when more than 20% of data from any questionnaire of any participant was missing for either the main outcomes or covariate variables, we imputed missing data using multiple imputations by chained equations. Since multiple imputations rely on the assumption that data are missing at random, we included the prorated baseline outcome measures, covariates, and auxiliary variables associated with the outcomes and their so-called missingness in our imputation model (ie, IPAQ and PHQ-13). Inclusion of auxiliary variables related to missingness has been found to produce more accurate estimates;<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> therefore, we included the following auxiliary variables in the model: ethnic origin (white <italic>vs</italic> other), education level, employment status, and national patient organisation membership.</p><p>Following recent guidelines,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> we also did a sensitivity analysis that took into account the partially nested design of the study to assess the potential effect of the so-called therapist effect on our results. We did a further sensitivity analysis to adjust for potential confounders, including sex, age, employment status, ethnic origin, education level, anxiety, baseline IPAQ, and stratification factors. We did additional sensitivity analyses in the per-protocol population to investigate the robustness of the conclusions of the primary analysis, following departures from the randomised intervention policies. We first excluded participants in the GES group who did not attend any of the four guided support sessions, and then excluded participants in the control group who reported using a GET self-help approach. We also did a subgroup analyses in patients meeting the CDC<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> or Oxford<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, using regression analyses as implemented in our primary intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis was done to assess whether results were consistent regardless of the definition criteria implemented. We assessed whether the effect in the GES group was moderated by baseline levels of depression or severity of physical function (eg, our stratification factors). These subgroup analyses were exploratory.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p>We used &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, or Fisher's exact test when appropriate, to describe differences in proportions of participant satisfaction between intervention groups and any differences in proportions with serious adverse events, serious adverse reactions to trial interventions, or serious deterioration (one or more <italic>vs</italic> none) between study groups. 97 patients from the GES group and 101 patients from the control group were included in the safety analysis.</p><p>Finally, we did regression analyses, adjusted for baseline scores and stratification factors, for several secondary outcomes to assess the effect of study group on overall health and physical functioning (ie, WSAS, HADS, PHQ-13, and IPAQ). Because of the ordinal nature of the IPAQ and CGI scales, we used ordinal regressions. Before conducting ordinal regressions, we checked for the proportional odds assumption using a Brent test. The two CGI scales met the assumption, but the IPAQ did not. Therefore, when analysing IPAQ results, we implemented a more flexible ordered logistic regression, which allows for partial proportional odds using the Stata command &#x0201c;gologit2&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> All statistical analyses were done with Stata version 13 and SPSS version 22.</p><p>This trial is registered at ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22975026.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funders and sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

The most common reason for exclusion at initial clinician screening was failure to meet the NICE criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (236 participants). 90 (24%) of 378 patients who were clinically eligible declined assessment or randomisation, although only 11 (3%) of these patients declined because they explicitly did not want GES. 104 patients were randomly allocated to the control group and 107 to the GES group.

Follow-up questionnaires were returned after a mean of 92 days (SD 31) from randomisation. On the SF-36 PF, we had one participant (in the GES group) with one item missing at baseline and five (one in GES group and four in control group) with one item missing at follow-up. For the CFQ, we had five participants (two in GES group and three in control group) with one or two items missing at baseline and three (two in GES group and one in control group) with one item missing at follow-up. By prorating values for these participants, our modified intention-to-treat population included 102 participants in the control group and 97 in the GES group. After adjusting for baseline scores and stratification factors, participants who received GES scored 4&#x000b7;2 points (95% CI 2&#x000b7;3&#x02013;6&#x000b7;1; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) lower on the CFQ scale and 6&#x000b7;3 points (1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;10&#x000b7;8; p=0&#x000b7;006) higher on the SF-36 PF scale than the control group at 12 week follow-up (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). The absolute effect sizes were 0&#x000b7;53 (0&#x000b7;24 to 0&#x000b7;81) for fatigue and 0&#x000b7;20 (&#x02013;0&#x000b7;08 to 0&#x000b7;48) for physical function. Twice as many participants in the GES group improved by more than 8 points on the SF-36 PF scale compared with the control group, and more participants in the GES group improved by at least 3 points on the CFQ compared with the control group (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). 33 (34%) of the 97 participants in the GES group improved by both at least 8 points on SF-36 PF and at least 3 points on the CFQ, compared with 14 (14%) of 102 in the control group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> 11&#x000b7;4; p=0&#x000b7;001).<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Primary outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="2" align="left"><bold>Fatigue (CFQ)</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="left"><bold>Physical function (SF-36 PF)</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th align="left">GES group</th><th align="left">Control group</th><th align="left">GES group</th><th align="left">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" align="left">Baseline</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">107</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">107</td><td align="left">104</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Mean score (SD)</td><td align="left">26&#x000b7;3 (4&#x000b7;8)</td><td align="left">26&#x000b7;0 (4&#x000b7;6)</td><td align="left">47&#x000b7;3 (22&#x000b7;2)</td><td align="left">50&#x000b7;1 (22&#x000b7;6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" align="left">12 weeks</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">97</td><td align="left">102</td><td align="left">97</td><td align="left">102</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Mean score (SD)</td><td align="left">19&#x000b7;1 (7&#x000b7;6)</td><td align="left">22&#x000b7;9 (6&#x000b7;9)</td><td align="left">55&#x000b7;7 (23&#x000b7;3)</td><td align="left">50&#x000b7;8 (25&#x000b7;3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Mean difference compared with control group (95% CI)<xref rid="tbl3fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="left">&#x02212;4&#x000b7;2 (&#x02212;6&#x000b7;1 to &#x02212;2&#x000b7;3)</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">6&#x000b7;3 (1&#x000b7;8 to 10&#x000b7;8)</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">p value</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;006</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Number improved from baseline<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left">62 (64%)</td><td align="left">45 (44%)</td><td align="left">44 (45%)</td><td align="left">22 (22%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">7&#x000b7;8</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">12&#x000b7;7</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">p value</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;005</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001</td><td align="left">..</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CFQ=Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire.

After adjustment for covariates, patients in the GES group who had worse baseline physical functioning (ie, low SF-36 PF score) had a higher mean score at follow-up (56&#x000b7;9, SE 3&#x000b7;3) than their counterparts in the control group (44&#x000b7;2, 3&#x000b7;3). Baseline physical function score also predicted the effect of the study group on both CGI-health score (odds ratio 0&#x000b7;1, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;02&#x02013;0&#x000b7;64; p=0&#x000b7;01) and CGI-CFS score (0&#x000b7;1, 0&#x000b7;02&#x02013;0&#x000b7;63; p=0&#x000b7;01). Participants in the GES group with poor baseline physical functioning were more likely to report improvement at follow-up (eight [20%] reported improvement in CGI-CFS and nine [23%] in CGI-health) whereas this was not observed in their counterparts in the control group (zero patients for both CGI-CFS and CGI-health). Physical functioning did not moderate the effect of study group on fatigue (CFQ) as an outcome (mean difference &#x02212;3.3, 95% CI &#x02212;7&#x000b7;3 to 0&#x000b7;7; p=0&#x000b7;1). Depression did not moderate the effect of study group on the main outcomes (SF36: &#x02212;7&#x000b7;1 [95% CI &#x02212;16&#x000b7;7 to 2&#x000b7;5], p=0&#x000b7;2; CFQ: &#x02212;3&#x000b7;3 [&#x02013;7&#x000b7;3 to 0&#x000b7;72], p=0&#x000b7;1,; CGI-health: 2&#x000b7;7 [0&#x000b7;5 to 14&#x000b7;3], p=0&#x000b7;2; and CGI-CFS: 1&#x000b7;9 [0&#x000b7;4 to 10&#x000b7;4], p=0&#x000b7;5).</p><p>Three participants in the GES group did not attend any of the four guidance sessions, and were excluded in the per-protocol analysis. Exclusion of these participants did not alter the results for SF-36 PF (mean difference 6&#x000b7;5, 95% CI 2&#x000b7;0 to 11&#x000b7;0; p=0&#x000b7;005) or CFS (&#x02013;4&#x000b7;1, &#x02212;6&#x000b7;0 to &#x02212;2&#x000b7;2; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). No patient in the control group reported using the GES guide at the 12 week follow-up.</p><p>Participants in the control group were no more likely to receive SMC sessions during the trial than those in the GES group. In the GES group, 28 (26%) of 107 patients attended one session, two (2%) attended two sessions, and none attended three sessions; in the control group, 28 (27%) of 104 patients attended one session, two (2%) attended two sessions, and two (2%) attended three sessions (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> 2&#x000b7;126; p=0&#x000b7;54).</p><p>Physiotherapist-rated data on adherence to GES were available for 104 (97%) participants offered GES; the remainder did not attend enough therapy sessions to be rated. The physiotherapists reported that 43 participants (42%) adhered to GES completely or very well, 31 (30%) moderately well, and 30 (29%) slightly or not at all.</p></sec><sec id="cesec110"><title>Discussion</title><p>When added to SMC, GES significantly improved fatigue and physical functioning compared with SMC alone, and our findings held for patients meeting different diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Significantly more participants exceeded predefined clinically meaningful changes for fatigue, physical functioning, and both after GES plus SMC than after SMC. In the GES group, a similar proportion of participants improved by a clinically meaningful amount on both primary outcomes (34%) and scored themselves in the high range of physical activity (IPAQ; 30%) at follow-up, which provides some support for these thresholds. The greatest improvements in physical functioning after GES occurred in those with more physical disability. The mean differences in outcome between study groups exceeded a clinically meaningful threshold for fatigue but not for physical functioning. Since 34% (33 of 97) of participants in the GES group and 14% (14 of 102) in the control group improved on both primary outcomes, five patients would need to be treated for one to benefit from GES. Using a higher threshold of improvement, 18% (17 of 97) rated their overall health as &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very much better&#x0201d; after GES. All but one secondary outcome (PHQ) showed similarly significant differences. Our sensitivity analyses supported the main findings, indicating that the results are robust. Of participants who remained in follow-up, most (85%) were satisfied with the support they had received with GES.</p><p>We were unable to compare two measures of the safety of the interventions because too few serious adverse events occurred, and no serious adverse reactions were reported in either study group. Significantly more participants were lost to follow-up in the GES group than in the control group; a sensitivity analysis, assuming participants who withdrew would report worsening, found no significant difference in worsening between study groups. Two participants actively withdrew from GES, but neither reported their withdrawal as being due to the intervention causing them harm. The safety outcomes in this trial were consistent with those of physiotherapist-delivered GET<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>&#x02014;namely, no differences between GES and the control interventions.</p><p>GETSET is the first trial of GES for chronic fatigue syndrome to be published, but results from other trials of self-help approaches based on cognitive behavioural interventions suggest that behaviour-based self-help approaches might be helpful.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In one of these studies,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> the difference in SF-36 PF between intervention groups (5&#x000b7;7 points) was similar to our finding (6&#x000b7;3 points), and results from another study<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> showed no difference in functioning but that minimal CBT-based self-management significantly decreased fatigue compared with patients placed on a waiting list. As expected, a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> of therapist-delivered, more intensive GET showed larger effects, with a 13&#x000b7;1 point difference in SF-36 PF at the end of the intervention compared with comparison interventions. In our trial, the difference in CFQ between groups (4&#x000b7;2 points) was at the upper limit of the 95% CI of the mean difference reported in the Cochrane review<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> of therapist-delivered GET (2&#x000b7;82 points, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;57&#x02013;4&#x000b7;07), whereas the difference in SF-36 PF (6&#x000b7;3 points) was lower than that in the Cochrane review (13&#x000b7;10 points, 1&#x000b7;98&#x02013;24&#x000b7;22).</p><p>To our knowledge, GETSET is the largest trial of self-help interventions for chronic fatigue syndrome, and the findings are strengthened by the small number of dropouts (12 [6%] of 211) from trial follow-up. We were able to offer GES sessions face to face and by telephone and Skype; remote guidance was popular with participants, mitigating the fatiguing effects of travel for the intervention. Primary outcomes were self-reported by participants, thus preventing observer bias. Adverse events were categorised by independent scrutineers, and the safety outcomes were self-rated. Our finding that GES was more useful in those with worse physical functioning is reassuring and has been reported previously,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but further exploration is necessary because it might be related to a ceiling effect in those with good physical functioning at baseline. This ceiling effect might also explain the relatively smaller difference in the effect size for physical function, which would reduce the overall difference between study groups.</p><p>Our trial has limitations. The results apply only to patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who are diagnosed in secondary care and referred for therapy. SMC was not standardised and we did not record its content. More participants were lost to follow-up in the GES group, although results of the sensitivity analysis were reassuring because serious deterioration was not different between the groups. We had only two physiotherapist clusters, and so estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficient might be inaccurate. 27 (25%) of 107 participants in the GES group received three or fewer sessions of guidance, which might reflect disengagement with the intervention; our qualitative study will address this. All outcomes were self-rated, which might lead to bias by expectation, although the effects of such self-rating are uncertain because of the mixed perception of GET.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> We did not measure any objective outcomes, such as actigraphy, which might have tested the validity of our self-rated measures of physical activity. The relative absence of intervention by diagnostic subgroup interactions might be related to the study not being powered to detect all interactions, including some that might have been clinically important. The clinical diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is not straightforward, but we believe that our subgroup findings of similar efficacy in those meeting the Oxford and CDC criteria provide confidence that our findings are generalisable. It is important to note that this trial was not designed to test causative factors in chronic fatigue syndrome, and the relative efficacy of a behavioural intervention does not imply that chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by psychological factors.</p><p>We suggest that these findings show that a guided self-help intervention, when added to SMC, is a moderately effective intervention for fatigue, but has less effect on physical functioning, for people with chronic fatigue syndrome waiting for clinic therapy. These findings need confirmation in other health-care settings and testing of delivery by other health-care professionals.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prins</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Meer</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Bleijenberg</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic fatigue syndrome</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>367</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>346</fpage><lpage>355</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16443043</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hotopf</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A systematic review describing the prognosis of chronic fatigue syndrome</article-title><source>Occup Med (Lond)</source><volume>55</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>20</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15699087</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Clinical Guideline [CG53]</collab></person-group><article-title>Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy): diagnosis and managementchronic fatigue syndrome.
