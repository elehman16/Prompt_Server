Standard postoperative routines after bypass surgery, including short-stretch bandaging of the operated legs, are compared to supportive stimulation of the venous pump by an impulsive compression foot pump. The postoperative edema of the leg is measured 10 cm below the patella and 8 cm proximal to the medial malleolus. Measurements are performed preoperatively, 1 and 4 days postoperatively and at discharge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The primary endpoint is reduction of leg edema by at least 50%. The secondary endpoint includes earlier mobilization in the pump group and decreased length of stay in hospital. Quality of life is evaluated through the European Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6 (VascuQol-6) questionnaires. The start of the study is February 1, 2018, and the end of the study is February 1, 2020. First results will be available April 2020.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities, the use of foot pumps has shown a reduction of edema and thrombosis in risk patients. Although important positive effects may be expected after vein bypass surgery, no reports have yet investigated the use of the device in vascular-operated patients and no analysis or meta Cochrane reviews are available in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Trial Registration"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03192982; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03192982 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6xMZJ06dw)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Critical leg ischemia</kwd><kwd>postoperative edema</kwd><kwd>Foot pump</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical leg ischemia (CLI) is a predominant cause of poor wound healing, leg amputation [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and has a significant, negative impact on quality of life [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In patients with CLI, the standard operative choice is an in situ bypass to the lower extremity to improve the patient's prognosis and quality of life. However, postoperative complications after an in situ bypass occur in 18% of patients, prolonging their hospitalization and convalescence. The main postoperative complication is edema. Measured 10 cm below the patella, edema is developed among approximately 6%-8% during the first day, increasing to 8%-10% at the fourth day (nonpublished). Postoperative edema can be prevented by early mobilization which stimulates the natural venous pump in the leg, but mobilization is often difficult in patients with CLI due to wound problems prior to surgery. In addition, CLI is associated with age and limited walking distance and coexists with other manifest diseases, which might also make mobilization difficult. Supportive stimulation of the venous pump by an impulsive compression foot pump may be an effective solution. Patient&#x02019;s stimulation of the venous plexus in the arch of the foot has shown to reduce leg edema and thrombosis risk in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery on the lower extremities [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in the literature, there is no description of treatment of vascular surgical patients treated with foot pump. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a foot pump is effective in reducing postoperative edema in patients undergoing an in situ bypass.</p><sec><title>Background and Rationale</title><p>In situ bypass to the lower extremity is the standard operation choice on patients with critical leg ischemia, accounting for approximately 18% of patients&#x02019; wound problems [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], prolonging their hospitalization time and convalescence. One of the reasons for wound problems is postoperative edemaThe edema is expected after open vascular reconstruction (in situ bypass surgery). Early mobilization can prevent development of the postoperative edema. Through mobilization, the patient stimulates the natural venous pump in the leg. However, patients are often hard to mobilize in an early stage due to the wound and age. Stimulation of the venous plexus in the arch of the foot has, in other categories of patients, shown to reduce postoperative edema of leg and thrombosis risk in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery on the lower extremities. The subjective quality of life is often impaired in relation to the above mentioned surgical treatment. Through a quicker recovery, the patient can rapidly regain mobility and walking capability.</p><p>There is no analysis or meta Cochrane reviews in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives will be as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To investigate whether compression therapy with foot pump reduces postoperative edema.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Through reducing edema, facilitate wound healing of the operation wounds, promote healing of ischemic ulcers, and decrease major amputation rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Shorten hospitalization.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase and improve the patient&#x02019;s subjective quality of life faster.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial design is a 1:1 randomized prospective study.

The oral information will be given by the research nurse and study physician through a phone call from a study room in the outpatient clinic at Department of Vascular Surgery, Lillebaelt Hospital, Denmark. The patient is then given the written information to take home for reading and can have an observer present at the hospital where the patient must submit a statement of participation in the study.

No reports describe vascular-operated patients, and there does not exist analyses or meta Cochrane reviews in this field. Postoperative edema of the leg increases the risk of other complications (operation wound complications, infections, hematoma and lymph excretion), prolongs the hospitalization, and decreases quality of life. This study can change the postoperative procedures of the patients operated for CLI and reduce the cost of the treatment, increasing the quality of life of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support of the project initiator, Hans Ravn, Chief MD, Department of Vascular Surgery, Hospital Lillebaelt, Denmark.
