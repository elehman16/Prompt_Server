The Committee of Ethics of the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences approved the study. On the first visit, we clarified the objectives of the study to the parents and then we obtained written informed consent from all parents.</p><p>Patients entering the study were otherwise healthy, with their first permanent molars unerupted and their second primary molars in need of bilateral pulp treatment. Their cooperation could be described as satisfactory, and their overall oral hygiene based on Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified criteria was good. We excluded uncooperative patients, those with deep-bite occlusion, and reverse bite (cross bite), as well as those with parafunctional habits from the study. Furthermore, we did not include cases where isolation could not be accomplished, either due to extended subgingival decay or lack of cooperation and if less than one-third of the total tooth could be salvaged due to the preparation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was determined based on data from a previous study.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] With a confidence level of 95% and a power of statistical test of 80%, 67 samples were considered for the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization and blindness</title><p>The principle investigator did the randomization process by using random numbers to determine whether the left or right lower molars would be treated with FRCs or steel crowns. This was done using the &#x0201c;Research Randomizer&#x0201d; application, whereby a random number between 1 and 67 was provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.randomizer.org">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>. Each case was assigned an opaque sealed envelope with a number in it. In case of an even number, the right and left molars were treated using steel crown and FRC, respectively. If the given number was an odd one, the reverse pattern was applied. The principle operator, patients, and assessor could not be blind due to the obvious appearance of the restorations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Interventions</title><p>In the final sample of 67 patients on the registry, second primary molars on both sides of the mandible underwent pulp therapy, subsequent to which final restorations were done using steel crowns or FRCs on a random basis. All restorations were performed by one operator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Fiber-reinforced crown</title><p>After removing existing carious lesions, a 1 mm shoulder finish line was done around the teeth using a shoulder bur #847-016 (Jota, Swiss). Then, the occlusal surface was reduced, leaving a gap of 1.5 mm with the opposing tooth. When reducing the proximal sides, a convergence angle of 6&#x000b0; was maintained when holding the tapered burr parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of teeth prepared for the fiber-reinforced composite crown.

A glass ionomer core with the dimensions of 6 mm &#x000d7; 7 mm was created with a clearance gap of 1.5 mm with the opposing teeth when the mandible was in centric occlusion. In all teeth, core walls were, at the end, comprised glass ionomer (2/3) and dental tissue (1/3). Teeth with destruction in excess of the above mentioned were excluded.</p><p>The impressions pertaining to the prepared sites were then made, applying putty and wash; in order for crown occlusion adjustment, alginate impression of the opposite jaw was also created. In the laboratory, the die undercuts were covered by a thin layer of wax, next a thin layer of separator (GC Gradia, GC corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was placed over the die, then a layer of flowable composite (FiltekZ350, 3M ESPE, USA) which is followed by fiberglass (Angelus, Londrina, PR, Brazil) smeared with resin in woven pattern was applied and light cured. The composite was placed over the die incrementally and polymerized by Steplight Unit (GC STEPLIGHT SL-I, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Finally, the restoration was put into light cure polymerization unit (GC Labolight LV-III, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for 5 min for better polymerization.</p><p>To enhance retention during placement, two horizontal grooves measuring 3 mm in length and 1 mm in depth were created on the buccal and lingual sides of the core using a tapered finishing bur #859 L (Jota, Swiss) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The core was cleansed and debris was removed by applying 37% phosphoric acid for 5 s. After complete rinsing and drying the tooth and the crown, the cementation was done using G-cem self-adhesive capsular cement (GC Corporation, Japan) under isolation. Light was then applied for 4 s for the initial setting, and after removing excess cement on the margins, the final curing was done with a high-intensity light emitting diode light curing unit (1100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 60 s (buccal, lingual, and occlusal surfaces were each cured for 20 s). Light curing was performed while applying pressure on the crown. After completing the curing, keeping intact isolation, there was a 5 min time for cement to reach its ultimate strength. This was followed by final finishing, polishing, and checking the occlusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Steel crowns</title><p>After pulp therapy and preparing the teeth as usual, SSCs (SSC 3M ESPE) were cemented using glass ionomer cement [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intraoral view of the teeth restored with the two types of crown</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-10-522-g002"/></fig><p>Dental health instructions were given and appointments were made at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after crown placement.

Conventional solutions have recommended SSCs; the chief demerit of which is their poor esthetic values. A number of other materials including composites and esthetic SSCs are in use, each with their own drawbacks. In this respect, FRC has been gaining popularity owing to its favorable features, as well as esthetic value. Hence, in this study, we used this material for posterior primary teeth restoration.</p><p>After 12 months, only seven FRCs were found unsuccessful, and the remaining crowns were in the optimum condition in terms of marginal integration. Of these seven unsuccessful crowns, only one crown broke and the others were decemented but intact, and if the patients referred earlier, it would have been possible for us to recement them. There was also neither sign of color change nor secondary caries after 12 months. Gingival health was assessed &#x0201c;acceptable&#x0201d; during the follow-up, with no statistically significant difference with the steel crown group.</p><p>The FRC mechanical features are profoundly influenced by the fiber type, alignments, preparation, and matrix.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] We opted for woven glass fibers smeared with resin. The woven pattern enabled the fibers to bear tension in various directions as they spread out, with resin adding to the strength of the FRC.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Fiber alignment in the matrix was carried out manually.</p><p>A key factor in the final outcome is to maintain marginal integration, which, in turn, depends on dental preparation, properties of the material used, cement type, crown preparation, and measurement precision.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We used resin cement and a convergence angle of 6&#x000b0;. We also used an explorer for measuring the gap on FRCs based on UHPHS criteria. There is still controversy regarding the impact of the axial convergence angle on the gaps between margins. Some studies reported that the gaps widened in cases of sharper convergence angles and so in most of the studies the researchers proposed an optimum of 6&#x000b0; to achieve the minimum gap.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Researchers have shown that resin cement can lead to an ideal marginal integration,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which, if unachieved, can cause destruction due to cement exposure in the oral cavity. In a 10-year study by Gaengler on 108 cases of composite restorations based on USPHS criteria, only thirty restorations sustained optimum marginal integration.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, Shiono reported 100% integration 87.5 months after applying the indirect composite,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] whereas Burke reported a success rate of 84% following a 2-year study on 100 composite-treated cases.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this study, optimum, marginal integration was observed in 94.2% of crowns after 12 months.</p><p>Another factor that was assessed in this study was marginal discoloration around FRCs. There was no marginal discoloration during the follow-up time. Monaca reported a 4% abutment gradual color change occurring over time in the 4-year study of 182 FRC bridges based on USPHS criteria.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Anya also mentioned no color change was observed in their 3-year follow-up of FRC anterior repairs.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In contrast, in a 2-year assessment by Can Say <italic>et al</italic>., a statistically significant disparity was noted in this respect.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] There are two points worthy of note here. First, our follow-up was relatively short; it was likely that longer assessment would reveal otherwise. Second, the above-mentioned research investigated composite repairs, whereas ours was on the FRC where additional curing and polishing were applied, this could lead to less discoloration.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>There was no recurrent caries attack during the 12-month follow-up in the FRC group, also gingival health was acceptable with no statistically significant difference with the steel crown group. This might be partly due to the inclusion criteria, in which the participants were judged to have good oral hygiene. Yet, fluoride emitting from G-cem can also play a role in preventing secondary decays. What corroborates our finding in this respect is the outcome achieved by Burke <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Mendon&#x000e7;a <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Prati <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Deliperi and Bardwell,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Santiago <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in their assessments of composite restorations followed for 24, 12, 36, 30, and 24 months, respectively. Guelmann <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Sharaf and Farsi,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Einwag,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Chao <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Durr <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] all implied that metal crowns do not adversely impact gingival health and the surrounding periodontium, needless to mention the undeniable effect of oral health in this respect. In our findings, there was no report of any statistically considerable disparity between the two types of crowns in this respect. As mentioned before, dental hygiene is highly influential in this final outcome.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] We managed to maintain almost equal conditions in our split-mouth study, which chiefly explains the results of our study.</p><p>The SSCs showed 100% durability compared to FRCs (89.7%) at the end of the 1-year assessment, which the difference was statistically significant. We opted for self-adhesive cement owing to the convenience in use, as well as its fluoride-emitting feature.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] According to past studies, self-adhesive cements were shown to have weaker bonds comparing to self-etch and etch and rinse-perhaps due to limited demineralization and infiltration capacity to the underlying dentin.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] This can also explain the reason why six of our participants failed to achieve proper outcomes (in cases of crown detachment).</p><p>The SSC has been highly regarded in pulp-treated primary molars owing to its durability and strength.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] It is particularly recommended in high-risk children with extensive anterior and posterior primary teeth lesions. In comparison, FRC is recommended in cases where there is a cosmetic concern on the part of parents, provided that oral health is maintained and the child remains cooperative during the procedure.</p><p>One chief limitation in our study was that cases of failure (crown detachment) returned too late; otherwise, the same crowns could have been recemented. Moreover, there was a high drop-out rate after 24 months (about 50%), and since the high dropout numbers could bias the results, we did not include the 24-month results in our analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The SSCs were substantially more durable than their counterpart the FRCs, whereas the two did not differ in their gingival status outcome. The latter were also shown to have excellent marginal integration with no color change or recurrent decays.
