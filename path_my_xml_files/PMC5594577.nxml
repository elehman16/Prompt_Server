Traditionally hysterectomies were performed by the abdominal route. Although it continues to be the most common approach worldwide, recently vaginal hysterectomies and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomies are gaining popularity and are now replacing abdominal hysterectomies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Vaginal hysterectomy, like any other surgery, has its own complications, like hemorrhage, intra-operative injury to bladder, ureter and bowel, post-operative febrile morbidity, urinary retention and urinary tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been a traditional practice to place a vaginal pack following vaginal surgery to prevent reactionary hemorrhage, which hinders normal urinary voiding. Hence to facilitate urinary drainage post-operatively, bladder is catheterized, but this is accompanied by an increased risk of urinary infection, inconvenience for the patients, higher costs and prolonged hospital stay. Therefore, judicious use of catheterization is important. The duration of catheter and vaginal pack has been reduced over the years but still there are no consensus on minimizing the complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">This study was performed with the intention to compare the complications and outcome when the vaginal pack and bladder catheter are removed 3&#x000a0;h postoperatively as against the standard practice of removing them after 24&#x000a0;h in an attempt to reduce complications and hospital stay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">The study was done in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in a tertiary teaching institute of South India from September 2008 to March 2010.This was a randomized controlled trial involving 2 groups of patients who underwent vaginal surgeries in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

All the operating surgeons were explained in detail about the study protocols and the steps of different types of surgeries to be followed. Informed written consent was taken from the patient before enrollment in the study. The study group comprised of 100 patients in whom the bladder catheter and vaginal pack were removed in 3&#x000a0;h and the control group comprised of 100 women in whom they were removed in 24&#x000a0;h.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par10">All women undergoing vaginal surgery namely Ward Mayo operation; Manchester repair; vaginal hysterectomy and amputation of cervix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par11">All women having pre-operative positive urine cultures; elevated renal parameters (Blood urea &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;mg/dl, serum creatinine &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;mg/dl); Comorbid illness-diabetes; Intra operative visceral injury; Kelly&#x02019;s stitch and consent not given by patient.</p><p id="Par12">On admission to the gynecology ward in the institute, detailed history was taken and clinical examination was done for all women planned to undergo vaginal surgery.

She is given an analgesic for pain relief, is encouraged to ambulate and is tried to void in the presence of running water and use of local heat for lower abdomen or over perineorrhaphy site. Inspite of these measures if she is unable to void, and if bladder is distended, re-catheterization is done. Fourteen (7%) subjects needed recatheterization among the total subjects. Ten percent in the study group and 4% in the control group were recatheterized subsequent to urinary retention, the difference not being statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.09). One patient in the study group was recatheterized for monitoring output though she did not have urinary retention because her output was very less post-operatively.</p><p id="Par36">Among all the subjects studied, 11(5.5%) had fever.

</p><p id="Par37">All women had post-operative urine culture done. When significant growth of organism was identified, urinary infection was diagnosed. The occurrence of urinary infection was high (26%). Both the study and the control groups had urinary infection in 26 women each. E.coli was the commonest organism isolated from urine (54%). Klebsiella and Acinetobacter were found in 11% and 8% respectively. Six percent of the women had polymicrobial infection, while the remaining patients showed other organisms.</p><p id="Par38">No vault infection was detected in either the study or control groups during the stay in the hospital. None of the women reported with vault infection subsequently.</p><p id="Par39">Additional benefits of early removal of the catheter and vaginal pack included early mobilisation and better confidence though these were not measured and analysed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">This study was performed to compare the outcome when the vaginal pack and the catheter were removed 3&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h after vaginal surgery. Traditional practice of keeping the catheter and pack for prolonged duration post operatively has changed with time, as it became evident that prolonging the duration did not have any additional benefit. Previously studies have been performed comparing catheter removal after 1&#x000a0;day and 3&#x000a0;days. There have also been studies in which one group had their urinary catheters removed immediately after surgery. But this had the disadvantage of difficulty in immediate ambulation and voiding due to the residual effect of regional anaesthesia. The effect of spinal opioids on the bladder lasts on an average for 250 to 300&#x000a0;min, which includes the surgery duration and post-operative time for recovery of bladder function. Considering this we have chosen to remove the catheter at 3&#x000a0;h post operatively allowing time for recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To overcome this difficulty, the catheter was removed 3&#x000a0;h after surgery in this study. Vaginal packing has not been studied by many workers.</p><p id="Par41">Glavind et al. reported vaginal bleeding in 2.9% of women in whom vaginal pack was removed after 24&#x000a0;h and no bleeding among the women in whom the pack was removed after 3&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In our study, one patient in the control group (24&#x000a0;h group) had bleeding and early removal of the pack did not result in more incidence of vaginal bleeding.</p><p id="Par42">Most of the studies compared removal of the catheter 24&#x000a0;h post operatively with no catheterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hakvoort et al. compared catheter removal in 24&#x000a0;h with removal after 5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, outcome was compared between 3&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h removal of the catheter.</p><p id="Par43">Retention rate was more in the prolonged catheterization group in studies by Summitt et al.

All the patients in their study underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy under general anaesthesia and it is difficult to explain such frequent need for recatheterization.

In this study, we tried to reduce vaginal pack and urinary catheter time. The study had well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria with well-defined study protocols. All the surgeon in the department followed the study protocol thus reducing the chances of bias. The limitations of the study are that it included several types of surgery (though the numbers were small), different surgeons operating, and use of general anaesthesia in some cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">Keeping the vaginal pack and indwelling catheter for a shorter period of 3&#x000a0;h did not result in increase in vaginal bleeding, retention of urine, febrile morbidity and urinary infection. Even though in our study prolonged catheterization was not associated with increased fever or urinary infection, in view of other studies reporting significant increase in urinary infection with prolonged catheterization, it may be prudent to remove the vaginal pack and catheter after 3&#x000a0;h giving allowance to the possible effect of anaesthesia on urinary function.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par5">Institutional research board</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the nursing staff and patients without whom this study would never be possible.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par49">No external source of funding.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par50">Not available as per the institution policy.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PR and SSR conceived the study.
