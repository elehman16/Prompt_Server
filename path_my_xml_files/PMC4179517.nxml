Therefore, interventional strategies that successfully reverse the metabolic abnormalities at this early stage of disease could have major benefits in preventing morbidity and mortality from diabetes. Adiponectin is a 244&#x02013;amino acid collagen-like protein that is expressed by adipocytes and regulates energy homeostasis and glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Adiponectin levels are reduced in insulin-resistant states, such as type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and are high in insulin-sensitive states, such as trained athletes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In animal models, adiponectin acts via specific receptors, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, in muscle and liver and enhances fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial function, and glucose uptake (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Transgenic animals with increased adiponectin expression are resistant to diabetes, while animals with low adiponectin expression are prone to diabetes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Similarly, epidemiologic studies in humans demonstrate that higher fasting levels of adiponectin are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-response relationship (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), the ability of lifestyle change or metformin to prevent the conversion of IGT to overt diabetes was related to the baseline adiponectin concentration, with success more likely to occur in subjects with higher baseline levels (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacologic interventions that enhance the secretion of adiponectin and/or adiponectin action may be beneficial in reversing the metabolic abnormalities of IGT and, therefore, be effective in preventing progression to type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b3; activator, markedly increases adiponectin levels (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and increases the expression of genes involved in adiponectin signaling (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The ACT NOW study demonstrated that treatment of IGT patients with pioglitazone markedly reduced the conversion rate of IGT to overt diabetes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In the current study, we explored the relationship between plasma adiponectin levels and changes in glucose tolerance status in the ACT NOW cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 602 individuals with IGT were followed for a mean of 2.4 years. The details of recruitment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, and patient characteristics have previously been published (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Texas Health Science Center. At baseline, all subjects received a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> after an overnight fast, and plasma samples were obtained every 15 min for 2 h for determination of glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and C-peptide concentrations. Participants were randomized to pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or placebo. One month after randomization, pioglitazone was increased to 45 mg/day. Baseline measurements were repeated at study end (2 years after recruitment of the last subject), at the time of drop out or loss to follow-up (last observation carried forward), or at time of conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Participants at four centers (<italic>n</italic> = 376) had a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) at baseline and at study end (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Measurements</title><p>Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase reaction, plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) (interassay and intra-assay coefficient of variation [CV] 7.1 and 5.1%, respectively), plasma C-peptide by radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Systems, Webster, TX) (interassay and intra-assay CV 4.3 and 2.4%), and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a DCA 2000 Analyzer (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Total plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol and HDL cholesterol were measured using a commercially available assay (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX). LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation. Plasma adiponectin, leptin, hsCRP, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and other inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemotactic factor-1) were measured using a Multiplex assay (Milliplex Human Adipokine Panel, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA).

The primary stimulus for insulin secretion is the increment in plasma glucose concentration, and insulin section (insulinogenic index) was calculated as the change in plasma insulin concentration (&#x02206;I) (AUC) divided by the change in plasma glucose concentration (&#x02206;G) (AUC) from 0 to 30 min and from 0 to 120 min (&#x00394;I/&#x00394;G). During the FSIVGTT, first-phase insulin secretion was calculated as the increment in plasma insulin (AUC) from 0 to 10 min. Insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) was determined from the FSIVGTT. S<sub>I</sub> during the OGTT was calculated from the Matsuda index (MI). &#x003b2;-Cell function was calculated as the insulin secretion/insulin resistance (disposition) index (&#x00394;I<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub>/&#x00394;G<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub> &#x000d7; MI) during OGTT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 19 (Chicago, IL).

Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between S<sub>I</sub> and plasma adiponectin concentration at baseline and the change in S<sub>I</sub> and the change in plasma adiponectin concentration after treatment. Study participants were categorized into tertiles of plasma adiponectin at baseline. The risk of development of diabetes based upon tertiles of adiponectin was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression. Comparison between the tertiles of adiponectin was performed using ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc testing when appropriate. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the baseline adiponectin concentration is an important predictor for future diabetes. In the DPP, both lifestyle (by 58%) and metformin (by 31%) significantly reduced the progression of IGT to diabetes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, a substantial percent of IGT individuals in both groups progressed despite treatment. Analysis of the plasma adiponectin levels in the DPP cohort (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) demonstrated a progressive increase in risk for progression of IGT to diabetes with both lifestyle and metformin treatment when the baseline adiponectin level was &#x0003c;11 &#x003bc;g/mL. This finding suggests that IGT patients with a low plasma adiponectin concentration are resistant to intervention with lifestyle and metformin. In contrast to the DPP study, we found no relationship between efficacy of treatment with pioglitazone (i.e., prevention of conversion of IGT to T2DM) and baseline adiponectin level. This finding implies that patients with a low adiponectin level have a pathophysiologic defect that, while unresponsive to lifestyle change or metformin treatment, is corrected by pioglitazone. Other medications currently available for diabetes treatment (i.e., glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) may or may not be effective in these IGT patients with low plasma adiponectin levels, and this question is worthy of future study.</p><p>Some comments are warranted about the failure to observe any correlation between baseline plasma adiponectin concentration and conversion to diabetes in the pioglitazone-treated group, whereas a significant correlation between these two variables was observed in the placebo group. This apparent discrepancy most likely is explained by multiple factors: <italic>1</italic>) uniformly reduced plasma adiponectin concentration at baseline, i.e., a very narrow range; <italic>2</italic>) the relatively small number of subjects, and <italic>3</italic>) most importantly, the institution of pioglitazone therapy that obliterated any potential relationship between the baseline plasma adiponectin concentration and final glucose tolerance status.</p><p>In the pioglitazone-treated group, we observed a strong correlation between the change in plasma adiponectin concentration and the improvement in final glucose tolerance status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We also observed a significant correlation between the reduction in glucose AUC and the increase in plasma adiponectin concentration in pioglitazone-treated subjects. Previous studies have shown that thiazolidinediones increase adiponectin gene expression and augment plasma adiponectin levels (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Several recent studies have shown that pioglitazone increases the plasma adiponectin concentration without increasing adiponectin gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in subjects with IGT (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and in cultured adipocytes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These results suggest that the peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b3;&#x02013;mediated increase in adiponectin secretion is due to enhanced translation/posttranscriptional modification. The current findings are consistent with these in vivo and in vitro observations. Whether pioglitazone interferes with the clearance of adiponectin remains unknown.</p><p>Of the core defects in T2DM (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), pioglitazone improved both the MI of S<sub>I</sub> and the insulin secretion/insulin resistance (disposition) index, which represents the gold standard for &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). With respect to improvement in these pathophysiologic abnormalities, the increment in plasma adiponectin concentration after pioglitazone therapy was strongly correlated with improvement in MI of S<sub>I</sub> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.469, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) and more modestly with improvement in indices of &#x003b2;-cell function: &#x00394;I<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub>/&#x00394;G<sub>0&#x02013;120</sub> &#x000d7; MI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.306, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) and &#x00394;I<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub>/&#x00394;G<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> &#x000d7; MI (<italic>r</italic> = 0.273, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-1745/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>). The increment in plasma adiponectin after pioglitazone also was correlated with the decrement in plasma glucose AUC during the OGTT (<italic>r</italic> = 0.238, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Although correlations do not prove causality, the strong relationship between improved glucose tolerance and increase in plasma adiponectin concentration suggests that, in part, pioglitazone exerts its beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis via an adiponectin-mediated insulin-sensitizing effect. This is consistent with in vitro and in vivo studies in rodents that have demonstrated that adiponectin enhances S<sub>I</sub> in muscle (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The effect of adiponectin on &#x003b2;-cell function has not previously been studied. In the current study, we observed a correlation, albeit weak, between the increment in plasma adiponectin concentration and the improvement in insulin secretion/insulin resistance index of &#x003b2;-cell function. Whether adiponectin exerts a direct effect to improve &#x003b2;-cell function or an indirect effect secondary to unloading of the &#x003b2;-cell remains to be determined. Lastly, in addition to its effect to increase plasma adiponectin levels, pioglitazone has multiple mechanisms via which it improves S<sub>I</sub> and &#x003b2;-cell function (rev. in <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which could contribute to the marked reduction in the conversion rate of IGT to T2DM (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results support previous observations that the baseline plasma adiponectin concentration is a strong predictor of future diabetes in subjects with IGT. The completely novel observation of the current study is that the increase in plasma adiponectin concentration after pioglitazone treatment correlates strongly with the prevention of T2DM and reversion to NGT in high-risk individuals with IGT. The potential success or failure of a specific medication or lifestyle intervention may be related to how effectively the therapy corrects the underlying pathophysiologic defect responsible for the low plasma adiponectin level.</p></sec>
