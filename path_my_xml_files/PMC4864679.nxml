Despite the therapy, no improvement in mortality and morbidity. Fresh frozen plasma [FFP] a source of serum cholinesterase act as bio-scavenger to neutralise organophosphate toxins to improve the patients out come.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The prospective study was conducted in 80 patients with acute OP poisoning. Patients with moderate to severe grade of OP poisoning with serum cholinesterase level &#x0003c;1000 IU/L were included in the study. Study group received atropine and oximes along with FFP given as 4 units first day, 3units on 2<sup>nd</sup> day, 2 units on 3<sup>rd</sup> day. Control group was given atropine and oximes only. Serum cholinesterase enzymes level, consumption of atropine per day, number of days on ventilator, length of ICU stay, and need for tracheostomy were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was a significant increase in the serum cholinesterase levels after FFP infusion in the study group in comparison to the control group. Mean duration of Intensive Care Unit [ICU] stay was 8.35&#x000b1;4.3 in the study group and 12.45&#x000b1;4.13 in the control group. 06 patients in the control group succumbed whereas there were no fatalities in the study group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Daily reducing dose of FFP therapy for 3 consecutive days has beneficial effect in acute OP poisoning by increasing serum cholinesterase enzymes in blood with reduction in total dose of atropine consumption per day. It also reduces the ICU stay with zero mortality in OP poisoning.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acetyl cholinesterase</kwd><kwd>atropine</kwd><kwd>fresh frozen plasma</kwd><kwd>organophosphate</kwd><kwd>oximes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Organophosphorus (OP) poisoning is a major public health problem with mortality range of 4&#x02013;30%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>OP toxicity is due to carbon, phosphorous acid derivatives that are well absorbed through the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.

Poisoning due to OP compound is classified as mild, moderate, and severe depending on signs and symptoms according to peradeniya organophosphorus poisoning scale.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Basic line of treatment for OP is atropine and oxime. The efficacy of atropine is clinically proven, but clinical experience with oxime is controversial. Along with these, many other drugs have been tried to improve the patients' outcome.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Benzodiazepines are favorable in OP poisoning and to control anxiety, restlessness, muscle fasciculation, and agitation along with atropine and oxime.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sodium bicarbonate IV infusion at the rate of 5 mEq/kg in 60 min followed by 5&#x02013;6 mEq/kg/day promotes moderate alkalinization (blood pH between 7.45 and 7.55) in OP poisoning, which is beneficial though not promising.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Magnesium sulfate is also tried for OP poisoning to improve the outcome of patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>OP pesticides are fat-soluble macromolecular substances and bind to the proteins easily. A recent study in China found that early and repeated hemoperfusion is more efficient than single hemoperfusion in treating organophosphate poisoning.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, the procedure is cumbersome and chance of infection occurs.</p><p>FFP, a bio-scavenger, is being suggested as a useful therapy for clearing of free organophosphates. FFP is produced by rapidly freezing the plasma removed from a whole-blood donation or collected by apheresis. This was performed within 8 h of blood donation. FFP was transfused on the basis of ABO-blood group compatibility. FFP stored in 4&#x000b0;C, cholinesterase enzyme stable for few weeks when dry and freeze, enzyme activity is for 2 years. Cholinesterase enzyme levels in FFP is 90 mg in 11 packs of FFP or every two bags of FFP increases serum cholinesterase by 461.7 &#x000b1; 142.1 IU/L, approximately.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Other uses of FFP are in case of multiple blood transfusion, congenital bleeding diathesis, and coagulation abnormality.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the enzyme serum cholinesterase present in FFP will sequester free OP compound present in blood and remove it from circulation, thus preventing toxic effect on neuromuscular junction. Exact requirement of FFP in OP patients is not clearly defined.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Direct measurement of serum cholinesterase activity provides a measure of the degree of toxicity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Study conducted by Yun <italic>et al</italic>. and Kavya <italic>et al</italic>. found elevated serum cholinesterase enzyme level in survived patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, we measured the serum cholinesterase enzyme level on day 1 of admission and on 4<sup>th</sup> day of treatment to see the percentage of increase in the enzyme level. Serum cholinesterase progressively increased from 35% to 65% from 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> day in the study group compared to the control group and this was statistically significant with <italic>P</italic> = 0.027 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="G2">Graph 2</xref>].</p><fig id="G2" position="float"><label>Graph 2</label><caption><p>Serum cholinesterase enzymes in two groups of patients studied on day 1 and day 4</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-268-g009"/></fig><p>Manu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that serial measurements of serum cholinesterase levels help predict the length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and prognosis of the patient following OP poisoning. The severity of poisoning directly correlates with serum cholinesterase level.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hence, progressive increase in the level of serum cholinesterase dictates better outcome with minimal complication in OP poisoning as observed in our study.</p><p>We transfused FFP as main source of serum cholinesterase given as daily reducing dose for 3 consecutive days to maintain high level of serum cholinesterase in blood so as to neutralize the toxin in the blood.
