Brachial plexus block has a long history existing till date, providing surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Bupivacaine is frequently used as the local anesthetic for brachial plexus anesthesia because it offers the advantage of providing a long duration of action and a favorable ratio of sensory to motor neural block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One of the first local anesthetic agents that emerged as a possible replacement for bupivacaine was ropivacaine.</p><p>Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic with a potentially improved safety profile when compared to bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>There has always been a search for adjuvant in regional nerve block with the drugs that prolong the duration of analgesia but with lesser adverse effects. The search for the ideal additive continues and leads us to try the novel &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agent dexmedetomidine and an opioid fentanyl.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine and fentanyl are two such adjuvant drugs that have been used in combination with bupivacaine or ropivacaine to enhance the analgesic efficacy of the drugs and that facilitate early achievement and prolongation of block. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of both the drugs,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] either independently or in combination with other adjuvants. There are limited or almost no studies comparing the use of ropivacaine with fentanyl to ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine. Considering the low side effect and excellent postoperative analgesic efficacy of two drugs, it is essential to carry out a comparative evaluation of two drugs for their adjuvant use with ropivacaine in supraclavicular block among patients undergoing upper limb orthopedic surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was carried out in the Department of Anesthesiology at a tertiary care medical college, with an aim to compare the efficacy of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine as adjuvants to ropivacaine for brachial plexus block among patient undergoing upper limb orthopedic surgeries.

The major consideration for an anesthetist while selecting a pharmacological option during regional anesthesia is not only to provide adequate and timely sensory and motor block to facilitate the surgical procedure but also to augment the postoperative analgesic efficacy of the drug being used. Safety of use, speedy and adequacy of block, and postoperative pain control thus decide the usefulness of a pharmacological option by an anesthetist. Emergence of ropivacaine over bupivacaine is one of the decisions guided by concerns regarding safety of drug use. No doubt, ropivacaine produces less cardiac as well as central nervous system toxic effects; however, it produces less motor block as compared to bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, addition of adjuvants is a decision guided by need to speed up block achievement, increase its efficiency by increasing the block level and blockade time and quality of postoperative recovery. For this purpose, a number of drugs are being tried and tested. In the present study, two such adjuvant options fentanyl and dexmedetomidine as adjuvants to ropivacaine with an aim to evaluate whether addition of these drugs increases the efficacy in terms of achievement of block, block quality, its subsidization, and side effects if any. Interestingly, while ropivacaine is claimed to be better than bupivacaine in terms of cardiotoxicity,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] still there is limited literature comparing the adjuvant use of drugs with ropivacaine.</p><p>The dose selection of drugs was based on the historic evidence regarding optimally used drugs that are reportedly safe to use. In the present study, we used 3 mg/kg of 0.75% ropivacaine which was supplemented with either 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl or 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine diluted with NS to make a total volume of 35 ml.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, achievement of motor block with Bromage score 2 was earliest in fentanyl group and latest in control group. Thus, use of adjuvants in all the groups showed an early block achievement. Median score of 2 was achieved by 20 min in fentanyl group as compared to 30 min in the other two groups. Mean onset of motor block was also shortest in fentanyl group followed by dexmedetomidine group and longest in control group. As far as the sustenance of motor block was concerned, it was sustained at a median score of 2 up to 360 min in fentanyl and dexmedetomidine groups as compared to 300 min in control group. Thus, mean duration of block was &#x0003e;6 h (369.4 &#x000b1; 36.9 min) in fentanyl group, followed by a little below 6 h in dexmedetomidine group (323.7 &#x000b1; 48.1) and &#x0003c;5 h (274.3 &#x000b1; 68.7 h) in control groups. Thus, with respect to motor block, addition of adjuvants not only speeds up the time for achievement of block but also helps retain it for a substantial time. Upper limbs are important functional organs that involve motion, a longer motor block helps restrict this function up to a substantial time during postoperative period and helps stabilize the operative procedure, while an early achievement of block helps initiate the operative procedure earlier.</p><p>With respect to sensory block too, median Grade II was achieved within 10 min in fentanyl group as compared to 15 min in dexmedetomidine and control groups. However, sustenance median Grade II was observed to be similar in both fentanyl and dexmedetomidine groups (up to 360 min), whereas in control group, this sustenance was observed only till 240 min. Mean onset time to achieve sensory block was 9.0 &#x000b1; 1.8 min in fentanyl group followed by 11.9 &#x000b1; 2.6 min in dexmedetomidine group as compared to 19.0 &#x000b1; 5.3 min in control group. Mean duration of sensory blockade in fentanyl group was 425.7 &#x000b1; 42.4 min followed by 378.3 &#x000b1; 59.6 min in dexmedetomidine and 300 &#x000b1; 54.4 min in control group.</p><p>The findings in the present study are in agreement with the observations in a number of studies too where addition of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine has been shown to prolong the motor block and sensory block duration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, contradictory views have been presented by some workers that have even questioned the usefulness of such addition. However, these contradictions are often caused by several confounders or are marred by the adequacy of sample. For example, a study by Fanelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed no significant difference in time taken to achieve readiness of surgery between ropivacaine alone or ropivacaine with fentanyl. However, this study had only 15 samples in each group and showed a high within-group variability in the achievement of blockade (5&#x02013;40 min). In the present study, this within-group variability was shorter (10&#x02013;30 min) and the sample size was three times larger (<italic>n</italic> = 45 in each group) than the study in question. The studies confounded by smaller sample size have failed to show a significant impact of adjuvant use on onset and duration of blocks.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Recent studies even with smaller sample size have shown a better efficacy of adjuvant use.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The studies with larger sample sizes have shown a positive and significant usefulness of adjuvants.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The present study had a sample size of 35 patients in each group which was relatively larger than the studies in question and hence has greater power to explain the variances and differentiate between groups.</p><p>In the present study, fentanyl was seen to act as a better adjuvant as compared to dexmedetomidine for achievement and duration of sensory and motor blockade. However, in some recent studies, dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce the onset time for motor and sensory block and increase the duration of sensory and motor blocks as compared to fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the present study, both the drugs showed excellent analgesic efficacy that was superior to the solitary use of ropivacaine. Between two test groups, fentanyl had a better pain control as compared to dexmedetomidine. Mean time taken for first analgesic need was 7.54 &#x000b1; 0.51 h in fentanyl group as compared to 5.43 &#x000b1; 0.78 h in dexmedetomidine and 4.03 &#x000b1; 0.75 h in control group. Ropivacaine itself has a better safety as compared to bupivacaine; however, it loses the analgesic efficacy in trade off for a better cardiac-friendly profile and it is the reason why adjuvants are used to enhance the analgesic effect to have a better postoperative control of pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Altogether, both the drugs did not produce any potential side effect to be recorded as an event and can be termed as safe drugs. Studies comparing adjuvant use of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl with other drugs and through other routes have mostly shown dexmedetomidine to be better both in terms of onset and duration of block as well as in terms of analgesic effect;[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] however, the present study did not show any superior efficacy of dexmedetomidine over fentanyl which as already discussed earlier might be attributed to the highly selective nature of dexmedetomidine, drug-interaction and configurational variances of brachial plexus anatomy. Unfortunately, there is no comparable study using the same design as used in the present study, and hence, empirical applicability of results obtained in the present study is to be validated. No doubt, addition of either of two drugs provided a beneficial effect and showed no side effects for either of them; hence, both the drugs can be recommended for use as adjuvants to ropivacaine for speeding up the block onset, prolonging the block duration, and having a better and sustained analgesic effect. Further studies to highlight the differences between two drugs are recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>On the basis of above observations, it can be concluded that 3 mg/kg of 0.75% ropivacaine with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl diluted with NS to make a total volume of 35 ml was the most efficacious regimen for brachial plexus block among patients undergoing upper limb orthopedic surgeries, although postoperative pain score was comparable for both the adjuvants, i.e., fentanyl and dexmedetomidine. Both the adjuvant combinations were safe to use and had hemodynamic stability similar to ropivacaine alone. Considering these observations, ropivacaine with fentanyl could be recommended as an anesthetic for choice for better block and postoperative analgesic characteristics.</p><sec
