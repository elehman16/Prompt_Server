Research tools are lifestyle and demographic information questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Both intervention and control groups were similar regarding their demographic information (P&#x0003e;0.001).

This is why rehabilitation is in the focus of many medical and nursing researches and considered as a necessity of nursing profession. Family-center empowerment model is an Iranian model whose main aim is to enforce the family system (patient and other family members) to promote health level.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>This model has been implemented and used in some studies (iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hemophilia, diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) to improve the quality of life of these chronic patients.

The effects of family-center empowerment model on the lifestyle of heart failure patients were evaluated in this study.</p><p>Generally, the results of this study revealed that heart failure patients showed more positive changes in their lifestyle after the educational intervention compared with before; that is, they have a better condition about their lifestyle toward 6 six dimension including nutrition, spiritual growth, stress management, physical activity, interpersonal communications, and health responsibility.</p><p>In other words, the results showed that the difference of all the above-mentioned dimensions was statistically significant before and after the intervention. Significant differences in all lifestyles dimensions were shown between the intervention and control groups. Additionally, paired T-test showed significant differences in all lifestyle dimensions of the group before and after the intervention. This could be a clear evidence for effectiveness of family-center rehabilitation model on the lifestyle of heart failure patients.</p><p>Regarding the findings of the present study, the important point is significant changes in the lifestyle of the intervention group compared with the control group. This change manifests itself in promoting lifestyle of the intervention group from weak to good. Before the intervention, the majority of patients had weak nutritional status, physical activity and stress management, but after that all of these factors promoted to a desirable and statistically significant level.</p><p>The results are in the same line with those of a research performed on the effect of family-centered habilitation model dimensions change (nutrition, physical activity and stress) and the differences were statistically significant.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The results of a fairly similar study revealed that patients who had participated in training class of nutrition with their wives or one of their family member had more weight loss compare to patients who participated without their wives or one of their family member.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These results confirm those of the present study, it is suggested that patients&#x02019; education with family involvement can be more effective. Also, the results of current study are consistent with the findings of a study on the effects of family-based diet for patients with cardiovascular risk factors.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, previous studies also consider the effectiveness of family-centered training to improve the patient&#x02019;s lifestyle.</p><p>Some researchers studied the effect of nutrition as the sole effective lifestyle dimension on cardiovascular patients. In the mentioned study, the differences of carbohydrate consumption, the percentage of fiber consumption present in fruit and vegetable, fruit consumption, whole cereal consumption and meat consumption were statistically significant between the intervention and control groups.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>In another research, the effects of family-center intervention on patient nutrition models after myocardial infarction were studied; they showed that the modification nutrition model was significantly better than in the intervention group compared to the control group.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Also, comparison of the impacts of family-based and individual-based training on body mass index decrease and lifestyle promotion was done in another study. The researcher concluded that after the intervention the mean body mass index decreased in both groups; besides, the mean of diary and fruit consumption and physical activities significantly increased.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> One of the most attractive investigations in the field of lifestyle is a research in which the first theme resulting from profound interviews with patients was the excavating and control of disease through successful lifestyle improvement.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> One of the inputs leading to this theme is that all participants believed that personal responsibility about health was an essential element of every program to successfully change the situation. This could be the key point of family-center rehabilitation model, because it is the patient that rehabilitates himself-but not the researcher. In all stages of the program, the researcher accompanies the patients and does his/her caring duties to make the desirable conditions available for them.</p><p>The results of another study showed that cardiovascular disease prevention can be effectively performed via lifestyle interventions in the United States. The results proved that not only giving up smoking, but also continuing physical activity, nourishment with a healthy diet, weight management and stress avoidance are important parts of cardiovascular disease prevention program, and vulnerable individuals should improve their lifestyle in addition to drug therapy.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Nowadays, researches on the patients&#x02019; lifestyle and its improvement strategies are becoming more and more important in nursing. In fact, lifestyle is a related concept to nursing field and is one of the nursing aims to be reached. Regarding the importance of the study and improvement in the heart failure patients&#x02019; lifestyle, this study was an attempt to improve the lifestyle of these patients using family-center rehabilitation model.</p><p>In this study, due to the age of the participants, there were some problems for their attendance in the verbal-physical session of the educational sessions; hence, it is recommended that further studies should be conducted in virtual classes and web-based meetings for this group of patients. In this way, we may reduce some of the problems in this regard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>This research was performed regarding the abundance of heart failure cases, the extent of its effects on the patient&#x02019;s life, and the importance of lifestyle in controlling and even preventing this disease. It is necessary for the nurses to keep looking for better ways to improve the patients&#x02019; lifestyle. This study revealed the effect of family-center rehabilitation model on the lifestyle of these patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that this model is applicable for modification and improvement of heart failure disease patients&#x02019; lifestyle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGEMENT</sc></title><p>The present article was extracted from the thesis written by Khadijeh Rahimi and financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences grants NoCT-9378-7058.
