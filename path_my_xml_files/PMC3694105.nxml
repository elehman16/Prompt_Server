Cocoa is a rich source of polyphenols, but its role in DNA methylation is still unknown. The objective was to assess the effect of cocoa consumption on DNA methylation and to determine whether the enzymes involved in the DNA methylation process participate in the mechanisms by which cocoa exerts these effects in humans. The global DNA methylation levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated in 214 volunteers who were pre-hypertensive, stage-1 hypertensive or hypercholesterolemic. The volunteers were divided into two groups: 110 subjects who consumed cocoa (6 g/d) for two weeks and 104 control subjects. In addition, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six subjects were treated with a cocoa extract to analyze the mRNA levels of the DNA methyltransferases (<italic>DNMTs</italic>), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<italic>MTHFR</italic>), and methionine synthase reductase (<italic>MTRR</italic>) genes. Cocoa consumption significantly reduced the DNA methylation levels (2.991&#x000b1;0.366 vs. 3.909&#x000b1;0.380, p&#x0003c;0.001). Additionally, we found an association between the cocoa effects on DNA methylation and three polymorphisms located in the <italic>MTHFR</italic>, <italic>MTRR</italic>, and <italic>DNMT3B</italic> genes. Furthermore, in PBMCs, the cocoa extract significantly lowered the mRNA levels of the <italic>DNMTs</italic>, <italic>MTHFR</italic>, and <italic>MTRR</italic>. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the consumption of cocoa decreases the global DNA methylation of peripheral leukocytes in humans with cardiovascular risk factors. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with PBMCs suggest that cocoa may exert this effect partially via the down-regulation of <italic>DNMTs</italic>, <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic>, which are key genes involved in this epigenetic process.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

DNA methylation occurs primarily at the 5&#x02032; position of the cytosine residues within cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and involves the addition of a methyl group to form 5-methylcytosine (5mC) <xref rid="pone.0065744-Link1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This epigenetic process is catalyzed by specific DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). There are three main DNMTs. DNMT1 is the major maintenance enzyme that preserves existing methylation patterns following DNA replication; DNMT3a and DNMT3b, in contrast, are primarily responsible for the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation patterns <xref rid="pone.0065744-Link1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Other enzymes, such as the folate metabolizing enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), also play an important role in DNA methylation by influencing the bioavailability of methyl groups <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Results from various studies have suggested that alterations in DNA methylation are causally involved in the development of several human diseases, including cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0065744-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Stenvinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that global DNA methylation levels of peripheral lymphocytes are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and also with cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, atherosclerosis and cholesterol levels <xref rid="pone.0065744-Stenvinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In fact, recent data have pointed to the potential for using global DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood leukocytes as a suitable biomarker for CVD risk <xref rid="pone.0065744-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>An interesting and important feature of epigenetics and its role in disease development is the fact that epigenetic marks are potentially reversible and can be modified by diet and environment factors <xref rid="pone.0065744-Link1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Duthie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Polyphenols constitute one of the largest and most ubiquitous group of phytochemicals present in fruits, vegetables, and other dietary botanicals, and they are consumed in significant amounts in the human diet <xref rid="pone.0065744-Link1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Several studies performed in cells have demonstrated that these bioactive food components exhibit cancer inhibition activities by affecting epigenetic signaling pathways, including DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0065744-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>For instance, it has been shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, and the soybean isoflavone genistein can reverse DNA hypermethylation and increase the expression of various methylated-silenced tumor suppressor (TS) genes, such as methylguanine methyltransferase, <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, human MutL Homolog 1 and retinoic acid receptor &#x003b2;, in different human cancer cells lines <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition to EGCG and genistein, other dietary polyphenolic compounds, such as catechin, epicatechin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and curcumin, have been shown to have similar effects on DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nevertheless, the evidence for a modulating effect of dietary polyphenols on DNA methylation <italic>in vivo</italic> is less convincing <xref rid="pone.0065744-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065744-MoreyKinney1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Cocoa is a rich source of polyphenols and is a significant contributor to the total dietary intake of these compounds in humans <xref rid="pone.0065744-PrezJimnez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Rimbach1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the effect of cocoa on DNA methylation has not been addressed previously. Our hypothesis is that cocoa polyphenols reduces global DNA methylation and that this reduction is mediated via the regulation of key genes involved in this epigenetic process.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of cocoa on DNA methylation and to determine whether the enzymes involved in the DNA methylation process participate in the mechanisms by which cocoa exerts these effects in humans. To do so, we studied the effect of cocoa consumption on the global 5mC levels of peripheral leukocyte DNA in a population with cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, to identify the possible mechanism by which cocoa consumption influences DNA methylation, we investigated whether genetic variants of the enzymes involved in the provision of methyl groups (MTHFR and MTRR) and of the enzymes that catalyze the transfer of these methyl groups to DNA (DNMTs) affect the relationship between cocoa consumption and DNA methylation. Furthermore, we also evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> the effect of a cocoa polyphenol extract treatment on the mRNA expression levels of these five genes related to the DNA methylation pathway (<italic>DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, MTHFR and MTRR</italic>) using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocols for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065744.s002">Checklist S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065744.s003">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065744.s004">Protocol S2</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>The population sample for the present study was selected from earlier studies <xref rid="pone.0065744-Sol1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Sol2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

The mobile phase was 50 mM ammonium orthophosphate, pH 4.1, which was prepared by dissolving 50 mmol of diammonium orthophosphate in 50 mM orthophosphoric acid with a subsequent adjustment of the pH to 4.14. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, with a 20 &#x000b5;l injection volume, and the sample detection was set to 275 nm (UV).</p><p>For each sample, at least two separate aliquots of DNA were digested and chromatographed. All DNA samples were analyzed in duplicate, and we eliminated samples for which the difference in the 5mC content between duplicate samples was greater than 0.3%.</p><p>The area of each peak was used for the quantitative analysis. The sample concentrations were calculated from the curves using a linear regression, and the level of 5mC in the DNA samples was then expressed as a percentage of the level of dC, which was calculated using the following equation: %5mC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;[5mC/(dC+5mC)]&#x000d7;100.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Polymorphisms analysis</title><p>The analyzed SNPs were selected using two criteria.

To our knowledge, this report is the first describing an epigenetic effect of cocoa that might be relevant for human health.</p><p>Unlike the genome, the epigenome is highly variable between cells and is dynamic and plastic in response to cellular stress and environmental cues. The role of the epigenome, specifically, the methylome has been increasingly highlighted and has been implicated in many cellular and developmental processes such as embryonic reprogramming, cellular differentiation, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, genomic stability, and complex diseases such as cancer <xref rid="pone.0065744-Hammoud1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In this sense, the association between some cancer types and global DNA hypomethylation is well known <xref rid="pone.0065744-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, studies have demonstrated that changes in the epigenome are not only common in cancer, but they are also involved in the pathogenesis of other diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, results from various studies suggest that alterations in global DNA methylation of peripheral leukocytes are associated with the development of CVD <xref rid="pone.0065744-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Stenvinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The population used in our study consists of subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated LDL cholesterol and BP levels and low HDL cholesterol levels. In this sense, it has been shown an association between global DNA methylation in peripheral leukocytes and cardiovascular risk factors, including a positive association with total and LDL cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0065744-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, fasting glucose levels <xref rid="pone.0065744-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, hypertension <xref rid="pone.0065744-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0065744-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0065744-Stenvinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and a negative association with HDL cholesterol levels <xref rid="pone.0065744-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These risk factors are also associated with other important human diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Thus, the consumption of food components that can modify these alterations, such as cocoa, may be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of diseases related to altered epigenetic mechanisms and an increase in the global peripheral DNA methylation levels, such as cardiovascular disease. However, more studies are needed to determine functional consequences of increased global DNA methylation levels in peripheral leukocytes for the development of human diseases.</p><p>Moreover, our results indicate that the effect of cocoa consumption on the global DNA methylation status of peripheral leukocytes depends on some genetic variants. Concretely, within the treated population in our study, the subjects with the MTRR A66G polymorphism and men with the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism had higher levels of global peripheral leukocyte DNA methylation compared with those without the MTRR or MTHFR polymorphisms. MTHFR and MTRR play central roles in the biotransformation of folate to form S-adenosylmethionine, the universal methyl donor in cells <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Additionally, several studies have shown that these two polymorphisms are associated with reduced enzyme activity <xref rid="pone.0065744-Weisberg1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Olteanu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, which may influence the pool of methyl-donor molecules and, therefore, DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0065744-deVogel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Friso1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our results suggest that cocoa consumption produces a more potent effect on the reduction of DNA methylation levels in humans with normal activities of MTHFR and MTRR enzymes. We also observed an association between cocoa consumption and the DNMT3B A38946G polymorphism on global peripheral leukocyte DNA methylation in men. This polymorphism is located in an intronic region of the <italic>DNMT3B</italic> gene and has never been studied previously. The results of our study suggest that this polymorphism may have a functional effect.</p><p>In the second part of the study, we tested the hypothesis that cocoa could decrease the global peripheral leukocyte DNA methylation via the regulation of key genes involved in this epigenetic process. Therefore, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments by treating PBMCs from subjects with a cocoa extract with its naturally occurring combination of polyphenols. In our study, low concentrations of polyphenols were sufficient to obtain a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of the <italic>DNMTs</italic>, <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic> genes. Interestingly, the reduction in gene expression was observed with each of the three main DNMTs analyzed, which is consistent with other reports that have shown that several dietary polyphenols, such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, EGCG, catechin, epicatechin and genistein, are inhibitors of all three DNMTs <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Majid1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Because the three DNMTs have been shown to exhibit some level of both maintenance and <italic>de novo</italic> methylation <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0065744-Pradhan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, our results in PBMCs suggest that the hypomethylation effect of cocoa could be produced, in part, through the down-regulation of these genes.</p><p>In our study, the ability of cocoa extract to decrease mRNA expression was correlated with its ability to decrease global DNA methylation in PBMCs, although the differences were not statistically significant. These findings reinforce our hypothesis and are compatible with the results observed in several studies in which the capacity of polyphenolic compounds to inhibit DNMTs was associated with alterations in DNA methylation <italic>in vitro</italic>. For instance, EGCG from green tea is known to lower DNMT activity, leading to decreased DNA methylation of several known TS genes, such as <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, retinoic acid receptor &#x003b2;, and methylguanine methyltransferase, in human oesophageal, prostate, breast, and oral cancer cells lines <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition to EGCG, other common dietary polyphenolic compounds, including catechin and epicatechin <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, genistein from soybeans <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Majid1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid from coffee <xref rid="pone.0065744-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and curcumin from curry <xref rid="pone.0065744-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, have also been shown to be demethylating agents, inhibiting the DNA methylation catalyzed by DNMTs of several TS genes or of the global genomic DNA <xref rid="pone.0065744-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> in different human cancer cells lines. Similarly, studies of a green tee polyphenol extract <xref rid="pone.0065744-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and apple polyphenols <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fini1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> have provided analogous results. Moreover, in our study, the cocoa treatment of PBMCs also reduced the mRNA levels of the genes that encode the enzymes MTHFR and MTRR, which play an important role in the DNA methylation process <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, confirming the effect of cocoa extract on DNA methylation.</p><p>Of particular importance is the fact that the <italic>in vitro</italic> results of this study corroborated the results obtained in the population study. Thus, whereas previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that polyphenolic compounds have epigenetic effects that modulate DNA methylation, the data are weaker in animal studies. For instance, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that genistein induces DNA demethylation, but three animal studies have observed increased DNA methylation following the treatment <xref rid="pone.0065744-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065744-GuerreroBosagna1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In another study, feeding a composite of green tea polyphenols in drinking water to wild-type or transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice did not change either the global- or gene-specific DNA methylation status <xref rid="pone.0065744-MoreyKinney1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In our study, the cocoa dose consumed by the individuals (6 g/d) was consistent with the average human cocoa intake in countries with low consumption such as Spain <xref rid="pone.0065744-BuitragoLopez1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065744-Ried1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Additionally, the effective concentration of the cocoa extract for DNA methylation and mRNA expression modification was 50 mg/L. These concentrations are lower than those used in many other studies in cells lines, where the effective concentrations of polyphenolic compounds are higher than the plasma and tissue levels of these compounds generally observed after ingestion <xref rid="pone.0065744-Fang3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Moreover, it is also important to consider the fact that the biological activity of dietary polyphenols largely depends on the bioavailability of these substances. In this study, we have used a cocoa extract containing catechin, epicatechin, and dimeric and trimeric procyanidins as the major polyphenolic components. The bioavailability of cocoa polyphenols has been measured in several studies in humans, and monomeric flavonoids (catechin and epicatechin), dimeric and trimeric procyanidins have been detected in human plasma after cocoa consumption <xref rid="pone.0065744-Rimbach1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report to show that cocoa consumption has an effect on the global DNA methylation of peripheral leukocytes in humans with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Furthermore, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in PBMCs demonstrate that a cocoa extract has the ability to inhibit the expression levels of genes that are highly related to the DNA methylation process (<italic>DNMTs</italic>, <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic>). Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to evaluate the beneficial effects of global peripheral DNA methylation reduction by cocoa consumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0065744.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
