Although CHB may be treated with interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) antivirals, emergence of resistance due to prolonged NA therapy or incomplete suppression of HBV still remains an important concern[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several studies have suggested that the use of response-guided add-on therapy is associated with a higher rate of virologic response and reduced antiviral resistance as compared to sequential monotherapy[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Early virologic response has been used as a guide to predict better outcomes and to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As previously reported[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the roadmap concept uses early virologic response at week 24 to individualize ongoing management of CHB patients. Patients with a complete response at week 24 can remain on their initial therapy, whereas treatment modification that may include the addition of a second drug is done for those with an inadequate virologic response. This strategy is relevant mainly in patients receiving NA with a low genetic barrier to resistance (clevudine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, telbivudine)[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients treated with telbivudine, a response-guided treatment optimization strategy with telbivudine based on the roadmap concept has been demonstrated to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with a suboptimal antiviral response[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study, OPTIMA, was to assess the efficacy and safety of telbivudine and tenofovir regimens, when administered using the roadmap concept, in HBeAg-negative patients with CHB. This was the first study that compared efficacy of the 2 regimens in a prospective manner. The safety of the combination of telbivudine and tenofovir, for which limited data are currently available, was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and conduct</title><p>OPTIMA was a prospective, randomised, 2-arm, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01379508) that enrolled patients between February 2011 and October 2012 in 8 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Russia, Spain and Turkey). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating centre, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrolment.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomised <italic>via</italic> an interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio to either telbivudine arm (600 mg/d) or tenofovir arm (300 mg/d) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Randomisation was stratified by the screening HBV DNA level (&#x0003c; 7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL or &#x02265; 7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level [&#x0003c; 3 &#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN) or &#x02265; 3 &#x000d7; ULN].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design. HBV: Hepatitis B virus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WJH-8-1402-g001"/></fig><p>This study used the response-guided add-on strategy (roadmap concept). For patients with HBV DNA &#x02265; 300 copies/mL (&#x02265; 51 IU/mL) at week 24, tenofovir was added to telbivudine by week 26 in the telbivudine arm, and telbivudine was added to tenofovir by week 26 in the tenofovir arm. For patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL at week 24, telbivudine and tenofovir monotherapies in the respective arms were continued. Patients who developed virologic breakthrough (VB) while on monotherapy received add-on therapy. However, patients who developed VB after week 24 while on combination therapy were discontinued from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were male or female &#x02265; 18 years of age, with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for &#x02265; 6 mo, HBeAg-negative with positive hepatitis B e antibody, available liver histology report within 12 mo before screening compatible with CHB (patients without evaluable liver histology were eligible if they had clinical evidence of compensated liver cirrhosis or non-invasive methods that support the diagnosis of moderate to severe liver inflammation and/or fibrosis), serum HBV DNA &#x0003e; 2000 IU/mL, and serum ALT level &#x0003e; 1 &#x000d7; ULN and &#x0003c; 10 &#x000d7; ULN at the screening visit. Patients with ALT &#x02264; 1 &#x000d7; ULN at screening were eligible if they had at least moderate liver inflammation or fibrosis, clinical evidence of compensated cirrhosis, or ALT level &#x0003e; 1 &#x000d7; ULN within the last 6 mo.</p><p>Main exclusion criteria included co-infection with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus or human immunodeficiency virus; hepatic decompensation; liver disease other than CHB; any nucleos(t)ide or interferon/immunomodulator treatment in the previous 6 mo; chronic renal insufficiency or serum creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 50 mL/min; history of myopathy, myositis, or persistent muscle weakness; pregnant or nursing (lactating) women; or history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin).</p><p>Patients were allowed to recieve an additional 52 wk of treatment in the extension period (<italic>i.e</italic>., up to 156 wk) if they had HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL at both weeks 92 and 104, and serum creatinine clearance &#x02265; 50 mL/min at two consecutive visits including week 104.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy and safety analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of patients achieving HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL (51 IU/mL) at week 52. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the rates of patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL at weeks 104 and 156, and HBV DNA &#x0003c; 169 copies/mL (29 IU/mL) (lower limit of detection) at weeks 24, 52, 104 and 156; change from baseline in HBV DNA; ALT normalisation at weeks 52, 104 and 156; HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion; VB; and emergence of resistance. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed for secondary efficacy endpoints by baseline HBV DNA (<italic>i.e</italic>., &#x0003c; 7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL or &#x02265; 7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL).</p><p>VB was defined as an increase of HBV DNA by at least 1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL (or 1 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL) above nadir on 2 consecutive visits, or at the last on-treatment visit in patients who did not have a primary non-response. Emergence of resistance was assessed as the rate of confirmed treatment-emergent genotypic resistance and was assessed at the time of confirmed VB and at week 24 in patients with viral load &#x02265; 300 copies/mL, it was calculated cumulatively at weeks 52, 104 and 156.</p><p>HBV DNA detection and quantification were performed at a central laboratory using the COBAS TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, United States).</p><p>Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and graded laboratory abnormalities. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease formula was recorded. AEs of special interest (muscle and renal function related events) were also reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the primary efficacy analysis, study treatments were compared for non-inferiority.</p><p>Based on the assumptions of 96% and 97% HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL at week 52 in the telbivudine arm and the tenofovir arm, respectively, and an approximately 10% dropout rate, it was estimated that 120 randomised patients per arm would provide 87% power for the non-inferiority testing on the primary analysis. Non-inferiority in efficacy of telbivudine arm to tenofovir arm was to be claimed if the lower limit of the 2-sided confidence interval (CI) for the difference was above the pre-determined non-inferiority margin (-10%).</p><p>A weighted Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, adjusting for randomisation strata [HBV DNA (&#x0003c; or &#x02265; 7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) and ALT (&#x0003c; or &#x02265; 3 &#x000d7; ULN) levels], was used to assess comparative therapeutic response rates.</p><p>For continuous variables, summary statistics of absolute value and of change from baseline, including mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum were used. For dichotomous endpoints, statistical summaries included count and percentage of patients with a positive response (response rate) and also 95%CI for the response rate.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline assessment of serum HBV DNA. The roadmap ITT (rITT) population consisted of all patients who did not discontinue before week 24 and did not deviate from the protocol defined rules of receiving add-on at week 24 (<italic>i.e</italic>., patients who received the add-on therapy at week 24 if they had HBV DNA &#x02265; 300 copies/mL, or did not receive the add-on at week 24 if they had HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL). The modified ITT (mITT) population consisted of all patients in the ITT population who were eligible and enrolled in the extension period beyond week 104. The per-protocol population consisted of all patients in the ITT population who had no major protocol deviations.</p><p>All efficacy observations on or after censoring date were treated as missing. A patient&#x02019;s censoring date was the date of the first occurrence of: One day after the last dose of the study drug, the start of first prohibited CHB-related medication, pregnancy, or a specific major protocol deviation. To assess the robustness of the results due to missing data, the analysis of primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints were performed based on the rITT and ITT analysis populations. The mITT population was used only for the week 156 analysis.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint (week 52) analysis was performed on the rITT population. The analyses presented include: (1) assessments within the &#x000b1; 7 d protocol-prespecified visit window around the scheduled week 52 date; (2) missing data at week 52 treated as failure; (3) missing data imputed using the earliest available assessment within the 28 d window starting from the scheduled week 52 date; and (4) missing data imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF).</p><p>Secondary efficacy parameters including HBV DNA, ALT normalisation, HBsAg loss, and HBsAg seroconversion were analysed using two imputation methods for missing data: (1) missing data treated as failure; and (2) missing data imputed using the earliest available assessment within the 28 d window starting from the scheduled visit for weeks 52 (except HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL), 104 and 156. VB and eGFR were analysed using the LOCF imputation method for missing data. Treatment-emergent genotypic resistance was analysed using cumulative imputation method for missing data. Missing eGFR assessments were imputed using the LOCF method.</p><p>Analyses of endpoints using LOCF imputation at weeks 104 and 156 are presented for the rITT and mITT populations, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Study patients</title><p>A total of 241 patients (121 in the telbivudine arm and 120 in the tenofovir arm) were randomised in this study. A total of 22 (18.2%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 13 (10.8%) patients in the tenofovir arm discontinued prematurely from the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation in the telbivudine arm were consent withdrawal (<italic>n</italic> = 7), lost to follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and administrative reasons (<italic>n</italic> = 4). In the tenofovir arm, the most common reasons for discontinuation were AEs (<italic>n</italic> = 5), consent withdrawal (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and lost to follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p><p>Major protocol deviations were reported in 11 (9.1%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 8 (6.7%) patients in the tenofovir arm. The most commonly reported major deviations were patients on monotherapy with confirmed VB not starting add-on therapy within 2 wk of laboratory confirmation of VB (<italic>n</italic> = 9), patients with a positive HBeAg result (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and patients not completing 3 wk of treatment before the third visit (<italic>n</italic> = 4).</p><p>The safety population comprised 120 patients in each of the 2 treatment arms. One patient in the telbivudine arm was excluded from the safety population as this patient did not receive any study treatment. Of the 241 randomized patients, 235 patients were included in the ITT population, with 117 (96.7%) in the telbivudine arm and 118 (98.3%) in the tenofovir arm. Six patients were excluded from the ITT population (4 patients in the telbivudine arm due to no post-baseline HBV DNA assessments, non-compliance with the study conduct, or no study treatment received; and 2 patients in the tenofovir arm because of no post-baseline HBV DNA assessments and viral resistance at baseline). A total of 113 (93.4%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 117 (97.5%) patients in the tenofovir arm comprised the rITT population. Five patients (4 in the telbivudine arm and 1 in the tenofovir arm) that were included in the ITT population were excluded from the rITT population because they discontinued before week 24 and were not eligible for or enrolled into the roadmap concept period (weeks 24 to 104).</p><p>The per-protocol population consisted of 107 (88.4%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 111 (92.5%) patients in the tenofovir arm. A total of 17 patients (10 in the telbivudine arm and 7 in the tenofovir arm) were included in the ITT and rITT populations but were excluded from the per-protocol population because of major protocol deviations. The mITT population consisted of 79 (65.3%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 89 (74.2%) patients in the tenofovir arm.</p><p>Treatment arms were balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, with no clinically meaningful differences between the telbivudine and tenofovir arms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

headache, HCC, hepatic cirrhosis, cholestatic jaundice, and breast cancer for tenofovir], which were assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study drugs. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The proportion of patients reporting at least 1 AE, regardless of study drug relationship, was similar for telbivudine and tenofovir arms. The overall incidence of AEs suspected to be related to study drug was somewhat higher in the telbivudine arm compared with the tenofovir arm. The most frequent (&#x02265; 2%) drug-related AEs reported in both arms are described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. Increased blood CPK levels [31 (25.8%) patients], myalgia [8 (6.7%) patients, and nausea 8 (6.7%) patients] were the drug-related AEs that were observed more frequently in the telbivudine arm compared with the tenofovir arm [16 (13.3%), 0, and 2 (1.7%) patients, respectively]. AEs of special interest were observed in 46 (38.3%) patients in the telbivudine arm and 27 (22.5%) patients in the tenofovir arm. These included elevated blood CPK and myalgia as the most commonly reported AEs in the telbivudine arm, and elevated blood CPK and ALT as the most commonly reported AEs in the tenofovir arm. Myalgia suspected to be drug related was reported in the telbivudine arm.

In clinical practice, attaining optimal efficacy with a low emergence of drug resistance remains an important goal[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The roadmap concept utilizing add-on therapy for patients who do not achieve HBV DNA &#x0003c; 300 copies/mL at week 24 (in particular for agents with lower barriers to resistance) has been identified as a strategy to achieve this goal. This study was the first prospective, randomised clinical trial using the roadmap concept in HBeAg-negative CHB patients comparing efficacy and safety of telbivudine with tenofovir. As previously reported[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], early detection of virologic response may be a useful guide to individualize CHB treatment. This study confirmed that monitoring virologic response at week 24 is a strong predictor of the treatment response by week 104[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data were consistent with an earlier study comparing telbivudine with lamivudine[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In the real-world setting, use of the roadmap concept may offer several advantages such as early identification of patients with suboptimal responses to initiate an appropriate change in therapy[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and to provide clinicians with options for individualized treatment decisions[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although emergence of resistance had been identified as an issue for HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with telbivudine monotherapy[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the data from our study suggest that the risk for resistance is lower if telbivudine is administered using the roadmap concept, as compared to the GLOBE trial showing higher rates of resistance[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, despite a somewhat higher percentage of patients requiring add-on therapy in the telbivudine arm, the overall efficacy profile of the 2 roadmap approach arms was comparable, as assessed by the percentages of patients achieving HBV DNA levels &#x0003c; 300 or &#x0003c; 169 copies/mL, and ALT normalisation at weeks 52, 104 and 156. Moreover, telbivudine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in serum HBsAg levels from baseline while no change was reported in quantitative HBsAg during therapy with tenofovir.</p><p>Overall, both treatments based on the roadmap concept were well tolerated over the 156 wk treatment period in HBeAg-negative patients. Although myalgia and elevated blood CPK levels were reported in a higher number of patients in the telbivudine arm, the rates were consistent with the findings reported earlier in the literature[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is recommended that serum CPK levels should be monitored closely during treatment with telbivudine[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Renal safety issues with oral NAs have been well-documented[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Particularly, adefovir is considered to have high potential for nephrotoxicity and tenofovir has been associated with this risk[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, telbivudine was associated with improvement in eGFR from baseline to week 156 compared to the increasing deterioration over time with tenofovir. The finding of improvement in eGFR with telbivudine treatment was consistent with that reported in previous studies where telbivudine significantly improved while adefovir and lamivudine worsened renal function[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CHB patients with impaired renal function at baseline have also shown an eGFR improvement after 1 year[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 2 years of treatment with telbivudine[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similar results for telbivudine have also been reported in patients with cirrhosis, patients with compensated cirrhosis, or patients with no cirrhosis[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings imply that telbivudine may offer benefit in patients with known or at risk of renal impairment. Although telbivudine improves renal function, the mechanism of this renal protective effect remains to be determined[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The main limitations of the study are related to its design (open-label) and the relatively small sample size.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was the first prospective, randomised, comparative study of telbivudine-roadmap <italic>vs</italic> tenofovir-roadmap concept in HBeAg-negative patients with CHB. Both treatments based on the roadmap concept were effective over the 156 wk treatment period. Moreover, telbivudine showed an improvement in eGFR from baseline while a deterioriaton was observed with tenofovir; this could be an important consideration for long term therapy in CHB patients especially in those with a high risk for renal impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge the work of the OPTIMA investigators and participating institutions located in various countries.
