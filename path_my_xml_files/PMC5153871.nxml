There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce children&#x02019;s SHS exposure, and so the aim of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention to help parents and carers (caregivers) to reduce their children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS at home.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A novel multi-component intervention to support caregivers to reduce their children&#x02019;s SHS exposure at home was tested in a two-phase feasibility study. The 12-week intensive intervention delivered in the home consisted of three components: behavioural support, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for temporary abstinence and feedback on levels of SHS exposure in the form of children&#x02019;s salivary cotinine (phase 1) or home air quality (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) (phase 2). Participants were caregivers who smoked inside their homes and had at least one child under the age of 5&#x000a0;years living with them the majority of the time. Mixed-methods were used to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention as well as processes, particularly around recruitment and retention, for an exploratory efficacy trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twelve caregivers completed the study, all received personalised feedback on SHS exposure and behavioural support to help them to make their homes smoke-free and the majority at least tried NRT. Saliva cotinine results were variable in phase 1, and therefore, measures of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were used for feedback in phase 2. Behavioural support was well received with personalised feedback reported as being the key motivator for initiating and maintaining behaviour change.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recruiting disadvantaged caregivers was labour intensive, but once recruited, this novel intervention was both feasible and acceptable in supporting caregivers to reduce their children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS at home. It is appropriate to test the efficacy of this novel intervention in an exploratory randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This is not applicable for the current study; however, a registered exploratory randomised controlled trial linked to this manuscript is currently ongoing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN81701383">ISRCTN81701383</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40814-016-0094-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Secondhand smoke</kwd><kwd>Smoke-free homes</kwd><kwd>Complex intervention</kwd><kwd>PM<sub>2.5</sub></kwd><kwd>Feasibility study</kwd><kwd>Acceptability</kwd><kwd>Mixed-methods</kwd><kwd>Recruitment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Globally, 40&#x000a0;% of children under 14&#x000a0;years are exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS), and of the 600,000 annual deaths linked to exposure, 28&#x000a0;% occur in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS takes place predominantly in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and is largely attributed to parental smoking in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Whilst exposure in England has declined recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], 39&#x000a0;% of children who live with smokers are still regularly exposed to SHS at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS has been causally linked with a number of childhood morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and it has been estimated to result in an additional 300,000 UK general practice consultations and 9500 hospital admissions annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The most effective way to reduce children&#x02019;s SHS exposure is for their caregivers (parents and other carers) to quit smoking. However, when caregivers continue to smoke, the next best option is for them to make their homes smoke-free. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] of 57 interventions and a further meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] of 30 studies aimed at reducing children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS found mixed evidence for effectiveness which was insufficient to recommend any one particular intervention strategy. There is a need for more high quality, robust studies with objective validation of children&#x02019;s SHS exposure. Interventions based on behaviour change theories and involving intensive and sustained contact with smoking caregivers are reported to show the most promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, a recent smoke-free homes (SFH) intervention study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] has shown that providing personalised feedback on children&#x02019;s SHS exposure as part of a motivational interview may have an effect on improving home air quality and thus reducing children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home.</p><p>Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions as a guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we combined the findings from our previous research which explored ways to support families to initiate and maintain a SFH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with current evidence on what may be effective components of SFH interventions, for example: intensive and sustained counselling constructed around sound behaviour change theory which focusses on changing participant attitudes and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and developed a novel multi-component intervention to help reduce children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home. The intervention, which aims to support caregivers to reduce children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home, combines intensive behavioural support, personalised feedback on household SHS levels and the offer of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), licensed for temporary abstinence, as a substitute for smoking in the home. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this novel intervention using a phased, iterative approach, to refine the individual components and their delivery in preparation for an exploratory controlled efficacy trial. The specific objectives of this study were to (a) assess participant recruitment and retention rates and (b) explore the acceptability and feasibility of the behavioural support, nicotine replacement therapy, and personalised feedback components of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec131"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Phase 1 procedure</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design, setting and recruitment</title><p>A two-phase process was employed with refinement of intervention components as necessary between phases. Phase 1 ran from September 2011 to February 2012. Participants were recruited via Sure Start Children Centres (CCs) in Nottingham City, England, which are free to join and offer free or subsidised activities and support for low-income parents with children under 5&#x000a0;years. We chose to recruit via CCs as the smoking rates amongst caregivers accessing CCs are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. At the time of the study, there were 16 CCs in Nottingham City; 11 of these gave us permission to recruit and we randomly selected five to recruit from. The five CCs which declined to participate in the research reported that this was due to competing priorities with service delivery or concerns that we would not see sufficient families who met the study inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria required that participants smoked inside their home, were the primary caregiver of at least one child under the age of 5&#x000a0;years who lived with them, were not pregnant or breastfeeding, had a fixed address for the intervention duration, were not currently trying to quit smoking, were over the age of 18&#x000a0;years, had good spoken English and gave written informed consent to participate. At the end of the study, participants who had completed the whole study protocol were offered a &#x000a3;50 retail voucher to compensate for time given to participation. Other smoking adults living in the same house as the primary caregiver and able to be present at appointments were also invited to receive the intervention. Ethical permission was gained from the University of Nottingham Medical School Ethics Committee (ref: E/03/2011).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)</title><p>Caregivers received a 12-week home-based intervention which aimed to support them to reduce their children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home and comprised of:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Diagrammatic representation of the two phases of the feasibility study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2016_94_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

In contrast, other participants reported problems such as side effects resulting in them not using the products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Acceptability and feasibility of nicotine replacement therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2016_94_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

The collection of urine samples was problematic with some children unable to provide a sufficient sample volume during the visit and this could be distressing for caregivers and their child. All 24 saliva samples were successfully collected and analysed. The average saliva cotinine for the six participants at each time point is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

The participants reported, as part of the interviews, that collecting saliva from children was acceptable and non-intrusive. However, although the collection of saliva for cotinine analysis from young children was acceptable, the results were variable, not consistent with corresponding urine cotinine results, and often did not reflect the home smoking behaviour changes self-reported by participants. Receiving feedback on saliva cotinine was emotive for a number of participants, with some reporting that high cotinine levels were distressing. However, such results appeared to prompt several participants to make changes to their home smoking behaviours (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Average saliva cotinine results</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2016_94_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

The review led to the intervention being slightly modified for phase 2 to help further improve acceptability and feasibility and continue to inform the development of an exploratory efficacy trial. The length of the intervention remained 12&#x000a0;weeks; however, the timing of the visits throughout the 12&#x000a0;weeks was changed (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), increasing the frequency of the visits and helping to maximise support in the early weeks. To further support caregivers proactive telephone support from the SFH advisor was introduced in the second and fifth weeks. We introduced the opportunity to sample different types of NRT during the second visit to help ensure that participants were prescribed the most suitable product/s to support them to make their home smoke-free between visits.</p><p>Urine sample collection was removed from the protocol for phase 2 given the lack of acceptability and feasibility of this as an outcome measure. Although saliva sample collection was feasible and acceptable, the variability in results led the research team to explore alternative personalised feedback options for phase 2. Saliva samples were still collected at four time points (baseline and weeks 3, 7 and 12), but the results were not fed back to participants unless requested at the end of the intervention period (12&#x000a0;weeks). Building on the findings from the REFRESH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which showed that it was feasible and acceptable to use home air quality data (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in SFH interventions, personalised feedback was given to participants using PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Home air quality data were collected at three time points (weeks 1, 7 and 12). Data were collected for 48&#x000a0;h prior to the intervention visit, and findings were uploaded immediately (with the exception of week 1 when data were collected at the previous baseline visit) at the end of this collection period to a laptop during the home visit and personalised graphical feedback on home air quality provided to caregivers using Microsoft Excel (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> for an example) during the visit.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>An example of a home air quality (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) feedback graph</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2016_94_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>

Compared to phase 1, behavioural support appeared to be viewed as a slightly less important component of the overall intervention, although in the interviews the participants described similar, positive experiences aligned with the results from phase 1. The participants were also positive about the inclusion of additional, proactive telephone support, which provided further support around creating and maintaining a SFH aligned with behavioural support delivered during the face-to-face sessions and was important during the early stages and served to reassure them that support was available and that they were not alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Acceptability and feasibility of nicotine replacement therapy</title><p>At baseline, three caregivers said that they planned to take up the offer of NRT, two were unsure and one was contraindicated (due to breast feeding) and so was unable to accept the offer.

At week 12, four out of six participants ranked the personalised feedback as the most effective and important component of the intervention. Monitoring of home air quality was generally feasible and accepted, with only a minority of participants expressing concerns about the noise made by the monitor. The participants felt that they were able to understand the results and they appreciated the personal, visual and &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; nature of the graphical and numerical feedback. Similar to the saliva cotinine feedback, at first, the air monitor results caused some participants to express &#x02018;shock&#x02019; at the levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> detected in their home (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The participants remarked that smoking in a different room to where the air quality monitor was positioned still had a negative impact on the air quality readings and that it often took several hours after smoking for the PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels to fall below the WHO 24&#x000a0;h safe average of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m/m<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As a result, the caregivers were motivated to create a SFH and reduce the levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> that the air quality monitor detected in the home throughout the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has demonstrated that this novel intervention was feasible and acceptable to disadvantaged families to help them to reduce their children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS at home.</p><p>Qualitative findings highlighted that personalised feedback of children&#x02019;s levels of SHS appeared to motivate behavioural change and that home air quality feedback was the more reliable and acceptable method for doing this.</p><p>All participants appreciated the behavioural support component of the intervention with some showing particular appreciation for the non-judgemental manner in which it was delivered. The literature suggests that increasing the intensity of home-based interventions can increase their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The intervention was made more intensive in phase 2 by adding proactive telephone support and increasing the frequency of home visits in the earlier stages of the intervention. It is possible that the intensive nature of the intervention and the regular, personalised behavioural support encouraged strong relationships to be built and therefore contributed to the good retention of study participants. The changes to the structure of the intervention for phase 2 were also made to try and aid the transition to independence for participants by making visits less frequent towards the end of the intervention attempting to encourage participants to maintain changes on their own.</p><p>All participants not contraindicated accepted the initial offer of NRT for temporary abstinence but some expressed negative views mainly around the side effects, such as taste, which have been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, other participants suggested that they may go on to use NRT for a quit attempt in the future, possibly as a result of their positive experience of using NRT to temporarily abstain from smoking in the home and so it is important that NRT is included as part of the intervention in an exploratory efficacy trial.</p><p>Providing feedback via children&#x02019;s cotinine whilst acceptable and feasible (for saliva) proved to be problematic. Results were variable, often not consistent with corresponding urine cotinine results, and did not reflect the home smoking behaviour changes self-reported by the participants. Ultimately, this variability had a detrimental effect on caregivers&#x02019; motivations to maintain any changes to home smoking behaviours. A further limitation of cotinine feedback is that it does not relate exclusively to SHS exposure in the index household as levels can be impacted by SHS exposures from other environments (such as if the child spends considerable time in a grandparent&#x02019;s home where smoking was unrestricted). This issue limits the effectiveness of saliva cotinine feedback as an outcome measure for SFH interventions and as a motivator for sustainable behaviour change.</p><p>In an attempt to overcome the issues with cotinine, home air quality data (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were used to provide personalised feedback in phase 2. The graphical presentation of results was well received and understood, supporting findings from previous research which shows that smoking caregivers are able to understand complex data presented to them in this manner and that this type of feedback is acceptable and motivating to caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It appears that the use of longitudinal air quality data helped to motivate caregivers to initiate and maintain changes to their home smoking behaviours. By providing feedback on three occasions over the 12-week intervention period, the participants were able to see the positive effects that their behavioural changes had on home air quality. There were however some potential issues with using home air quality, for example, monitors were placed in one specific location within a household and we were therefore unable to accurately indicate air quality levels in other areas of the house, although this location was identified as the place where the child spent the most amount of time during the day. It is also possible that participating families could change their smoking behaviour inside the house for the period of time that the monitor was present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] although the participants reported that they often forgot that the monitor was there and so it is unlikely that this would have significantly influence the results. Finally, it is important to highlight that whilst we have used the term SHS exposure throughout this manuscript, PM<sub>2.5</sub> is a proxy measure of personal exposure and an indirect measure of SHS that is not specific to cigarette smoking as results can be influenced by any airborne particles &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in size.</p><p>The findings from the current study help to build on the results of the REFRESH intervention feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], although REFRESH did not offer caregivers NRT, only provided home air quality feedback on two occasions (compared to three in the current study) and the intervention period was significantly shorter (4 vs. 12&#x000a0;weeks). The REFRESH results showed a statistically significant decrease in maximum PM<sub>2.5</sub> between weeks 2 and 4 within the intervention group but no significant difference between the intervention and comparator arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since the evidence base suggests that intensive and sustained contact is more likely to be successful in helping smoking caregivers to make changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we might expect our intervention to be more effective. This is supported by the feasibility data which showed an average decrease of 49&#x000a0;% between baseline and week 12 in average PM<sub>2.5</sub> and a 74&#x000a0;% reduction in the maximum PM<sub>2.5</sub>.</p><p>Recruitment proved labour intensive with a total of 65 Sure Start Children&#x02019;s Centre sessions being attended in order to recruit 14 participants. Only a small minority (7&#x000a0;%) of the caregivers approached met the inclusion criteria during the initial recruitment discussion about the study. This is lower than we had anticipated given the relatively high smoking rates of caregivers accessing CCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and that 39&#x000a0;% of children living with smokers in England are reportedly exposed to SHS at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, it may reflect the nature of recruitment in CCs (sometimes in a public environment where the discussion could be overheard) and the potential stigma attached to smoking in the home with young children. The caregivers may therefore have been smoking at home but not willing to share this information with the CC staff and/or research team and thus would be deemed ineligible. In addition, we know that rules about smoking at home are often fluid and that whilst caregivers may initially state that they always smoke outside, it is only with further exploration of home smoking rules that it becomes apparent that caregivers sometimes smoke inside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To try and overcome this in the explanatory RCT, a number of additional recruitment strategies will be employed (including, for example, via health visitor mail shots, outreach services, advertising, the local stop smoking SFHs service) and more care taken to ensure that recruitment discussions are conducted more privately where possible. Having said this, nearly half of eligible participants took part in the study and 12 of the 14 participating families completed the intervention. This suggests that a proportion of smoking caregivers are interested in making changes to their home smoking behaviours and that the home setting, length and delivery of the intervention were acceptable to them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Accessing disadvantaged smoking caregivers was labour intensive but once recruited, the caregivers found this novel intervention both feasible and acceptable in supporting them to protect their children from SHS exposure at home. Non-judgemental support and encouragement over time, supplemented with personalised home air quality feedback, are key to motivating caregivers to initiate and maintain changes to their home smoking behaviours. The intervention tested in phase 2 of this feasibility study did not require further changes following detailed evaluation and is now being tested for efficacy and cost-effectiveness in an exploratory RCT.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional file</title><p>
