At Week 12, 73 subjects on ABC/3TC+EFV switched to EFV/FTC/TDF. The switch was well tolerated and no subject experienced viral rebound. Median baseline fasting total cholesterol was 6.32mmol/L. 12 weeks following switch, the difference in the means (LSM) between treatment groups (EFV/FTC/TDF minus ABC/3TC+EFV) in total cholesterol change from baseline was -0.74mmol/l (95% CI &#x02212;1.00, &#x02212;0.47, p &#x0003c; 0.001). The median change from baseline in total cholesterol following switch in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm was -0.86mmol/l (p &#x0003c; 0.001) compared with +0.01mmol/l (p = 0.45) in the continuation arm at Week 12. Significant (p &#x0003c; 0.001) differences between treatment groups following switch were seen for all lipid fractions from baseline to Week 12: LDL cholesterol (&#x02212;0.47 mmol/L [&#x02212;0.70, &#x02212;0.25]), HDL cholesterol (&#x02212;0.15 mmol/L [&#x02212;0.21, &#x02212;0.08]), triglycerides (&#x02212;0.43 mmol/L [-0.75, -0.11]), and non HDL cholesterol (&#x02212;0.56 mmol/L [&#x02212;0.80, &#x02212;0.31]). In the extension phase, similar declines in total cholesterol were observed with a median change from Week 12 to Week 24 of &#x02212;0.73mmol/L (p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Switching from ABC/3TC+EFV to EFV/FTC/TDF in persons with hypercholesterolemia maintains virological control and significantly improves key lipid parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

Adverse events or fear of adverse events remain a key cause of regimen modification, interruption or discontinuation [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Comparative clinical data indicate that ABC/3TC is associated with greater increases in total cholesterol and other lipid fractions relative to TDF/FTC-based regimens [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Switch data indicate that when replacing a thymidine analogue in persons with lipoatrophy, similar limb fat recovery is observed with ABC or TDF but only TDF leads to declines in lipids [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Replacement of zidovudine (AZT)/3TC with TDF/FTC also leads to significant declines in proatherogenic lipids [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Healthy volunteer data indicate TDF has a small lipid lowering effect, reducing total cholesterol by 8% over 2 weeks and does not trigger insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>HIV infection per se appears to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and viral suppression may reduce risk of cardiovascular events [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lipid elevation is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Some cohort data have reported an association between current or recent abacavir use and coronary heart disease (CHD) but not stroke risk [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A similar association was not observed with TDF [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Differences exist between subjects in randomized trials, who are typically younger, initiating treatment and with few CV risk factors hence fewer events to analyse, compared with the mix of treatment experience, older subjects and more MI events in cohorts. Thus the risk of MI may not be substantially affected by NRTI choice in low risk populations but may exist in older subjects with established MI risk or atheroma.</p><p>We sought to investigate the relative benefits on lipids of switching from a virologically successful 2 pill regimen of ABC/3TC +EFV to the single tablet regimen of EFV/FTC/TDF versus continuing with ABC/3TC + EFV for 12 weeks in hyperlipidemic individuals, defined as screening cholesterol of &#x02265; 5.2 mmol/L (200mg/dL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial, along with three protocol amendments&#x02019; summary of changes, and the supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116297.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>.

The members of the Committee present gave a favourable ethical opinion of the research on the basis described in the application form, protocol and supporting documentation. The approving EC liaised with the local RECs to obtain the outcome of site specific assessments for each of the participating sites. All sites were approved to participate in the study. Patients provided written informed consent prior to study entry. The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p><p>This phase IV, open-label, multi-centre, randomized, 12-week trial, with a further 12 week extension phase compared the continuation of ABC/3TC+EFV with switching to the single tablet of EFV/FTC/TDF, in hyperlipidemic subjects on successful antiretroviral therapy. 180 subjects were planned to be enrolled into the study however, recruitment into the study was slower than anticipated, likely in part due to the data becoming available regarding cardiovascular risks with abacavir treatment [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Five study sites were added in an attempt to increase recruitment, taking the number of UK HIV treatment centres involved in the study to 17, but after 1 year of recruitment (March 2008 &#x02014;March 2009) recruitment was stopped with 159 subjects enrolled.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in fasting total cholesterol at Week 12. This was assessed at 12 weeks post switch to EFV/FTC/TDF in each arm. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in HDL, LDL and triglycerides, calculated Framingham risk, clinical and laboratory safety parameters, HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count, patient reported adherence, treatment satisfaction, preference and regimen intrusiveness using validated questionnaires [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] at both Week 12 and 24.</p><p>Eligible HIV-1 infected subjects were aged <italic>&#x0003e;</italic>18 years, had been stable on ABC/3TC plus EFV therapy for &#x02265;6 months with no known resistance to any of the study medications.

Subjects receiving lipid lowering therapy were required to be stable for &#x02265; 3 months prior to screening and were expected to remain on a stable dose and frequency throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential and heterosexual men were required to use an effective method of contraception throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks afterwards. Exclusion criteria included pregnant or lactating females, prior history of significant renal disease or bone disease, creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 60 mL/min, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003e; 5 &#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN), and previous FTC, TDF or adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Subjects with active infections, malignancies (except Kaposi Sarcoma or basal cell carcinoma) and resistance to any of the study drugs were also excluded.</p><p>The randomization sequence was generated by the lead statistician at Gilead Sciences Inc (Foster City, US) using SAS software version 8.2 and was centralized in block size 4 with no stratification. The centralized randomization list was kept and securely managed, using password protection, by the Clinical Operations team at Gilead Sciences Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). The Investigator at each site completed a Randomization Request Form (RRF) for each subject after protocol eligibility criteria were met and the completed form was faxed to Gilead UK. The subject was randomized according to the randomization schedule and the RRF faxed back to the site with details of the treatment allocation for the subject.</p><p>Eligible subjects currently receiving ABC/3TC+EFV were randomized 1:1 to

<bold>Efficacy.</bold> A modified ITT (MITT) analysis set was used for analyses of fasting lipid parameters. It included subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug and excluded subjects unsuitable for analysis (defined as fasting baseline total cholesterol &#x0003c; 4.2 mmol/L or a non-fasting sample at baseline); subjects were grouped by treatment assigned. The ITT analysis set (subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and grouped by treatment assigned) was used for analyses of HIV&#x02011;1 RNA, CD4, and other endpoints. No imputation was used for missing data unless otherwise specified.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the change in fasting total cholesterol from baseline to Week 12, in the immediate switch arm, and the change from Week 12 to Week 24, in the delayed switch arm. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on the MITT analysis set and used last post-baseline observation carried forward (Missing = LOCF) methodology. Changes from baseline were analyzed within each treatment group using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and differences between groups were analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Confidence intervals (CIs, 95%) for the differences in changes between groups were constructed based on normal approximation. A secondary analysis of the primary endpoint was based on observed data (i.e., no imputation for missing). Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint using LOCF methodology in the MITT analysis excluding data for subjects who started or modified lipid&#x02011;lowering therapy during the study, and using observed data in the treated analysis set. Other fasting lipid parameters were analyzed in a similar manner to the primary endpoint. Percent of subjects by NCEP thresholds were compared between treatment groups using Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) row mean score test. The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV&#x02011;1 RNA &#x0003c; 50 and &#x0003c; 400 copies/mL at Week 12, were compared between groups using Fisher exact test. During the study there was a report of an increased frequency of detectable plasma viral load (HIV&#x02011;1 RNA) above 50 copies/mL using the COBAS Ampliprep Taqman HIV&#x02011;1 test (as employed in this study), compared to the ultrasensitive Ampliprep Amplicor Monitor HIV&#x02011;1 test [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As recruitment into the study had already been completed when this was discovered, and any detectable viral loads were managed by the sites at the time, the assay was not changed. These important data were communicated to all sites for their information, and the proportion of subjects with HIV&#x02011;1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 copies/mL was added to the analysis plan as a secondary endpoint. CD4 and CD8 cell counts, absolute values and change from baseline were summarized by visit. Following a protocol amendment CD4 and CD8 percentages were also added to the analysis plan as secondary endpoints. Differences between EFV/FTC/TDF and ABC/3TC+EFV groups in change from baseline were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test at Week 12.</p><p>
<bold>Safety.</bold> All safety analyses were based on the treated analysis set and were summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group according to the study drug received. Data collected up to the date of last dose of study drug plus 30 days were included in safety analyses.</p><p>
<bold>Outcomes Research.</bold> The observed values and changes from baseline at Week 12 in the 10&#x02011;year risk for CHD outcomes were summarized by treatment group using the treated analysis set. The change from baseline was tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test within treatment group and was compared between EFV/FTC/TDF and ABC/3TC+EFV groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test at Week 12. Other outcomes research endpoints were summarized; changes from baseline were summarized and differences between EFV/FTC/TDF and ABC/3TC+EFV groups were performed using appropriate statistical tests.</p><p>
<bold>Sample size.</bold> Based on previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], a mean difference between the two groups of 0.5 mmol/L was expected. A sample size of 180 (90 per group) was expected to provide approximately 85% power to detect a mean difference of 0.5 mmol/L between the two groups in change from baseline to Week 12 in fasting total cholesterol using a two&#x02011;sided Student t&#x02011;test, assuming that the pooled standard deviation for this difference is estimated to be about 1.1 mmol/L. The number of subjects randomized into the study was lower than planned (159 subjects versus 180 subjects planned). The number of subjects treated in the study (n = 157) provided approximately 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.5mmol/L.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003a"><title>Demographics and Subject Disposition</title><p>Of the 177 subjects that were screened for the study, 159 subjects were randomized. 18 subjects were excluded from randomization due to; not meeting the inclusion criteria (15 subjects), declining to participate (one subject) and logistical reasons (two subjects).</p><p>Two subjects who were randomized but who did not receive study drug were excluded from all analysis sets, both subjects were in the delayed switch group.

As might be expected in this virologically stable study population, there were no significant differences between groups in satisfaction with the ability of the regimen to control HIV, or with general satisfaction of the regimen.</p></sec><sec id="sec003h"><title>Perceived Ease of Regimen for Condition (PERC)</title><p>Subjects perceived the single tablet regimen to be easier to follow than the 2 pill regimen, as assessed using the PERC survey. In the All EFV/FTC/TDF group (subjects from both the immediate and delayed switch groups) the proportion of subjects who considered their regimen very easy to take increased from 78.9% at baseline to 90.1% 12 weeks after switching (p = 0.004). However, the difference between the immediate switch and delayed switch groups at Week 12 did not achieve statistical significance (very easy: 90.5% EFV/FTC/TDF vs. 80.3% ABC/3TC+EFV, p = 0.10).</p></sec><sec id="sec003i"><title>Preference of Medicine</title><p>Subjects in the All EFV/FTC/TDF group generally preferred the single tablet regimen. Following switch, 54.5% of subjects considered EFV/FTC/TDF to be much better than their previous regimen and 14.3% of subjects considered EFV/FTC/TDF to be slightly better than their previous regimen (p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="sec003j"><title>HAART Intrusiveness Scale</title><p>Subjects in the All EFV/FTC/TDF group perceived diminished regimen intrusiveness following switch with a statistically significant reduction (improvement) in overall m&#x02011;HIS index score from baseline to Week 12 (median (IQR) change 0.0 (&#x02212;0.2, 0.0), p &#x0003c; 0.001). The difference between the immediate switch and delayed switch groups at study Week 12 was statistically significant (median (IQR) changes were 0.0 (&#x02212;0.1, 0.0) and 0.0 (0.0, 0.1), respectively, (p = 0.037)).</p></sec><sec id="sec003k"><title>Adverse Events</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) considered related to study drug by the investigator were reported for 30.3% of subjects following switch to EFV/FTC/TDF (46 subjects (25 immediate switch through to study Week 24, 21 delayed switch from study Week 12 to 24)) and for 3.8% of subjects (3 subjects) while subjects continued on ABC/3TC+EFV (baseline to study Week 12). After switching to EFV/FTC/TDF, the most frequently reported AEs considered related to study drug were abnormal dreams (12 subjects (7 immediate switch, 5 delayed switch)) and fatigue (8 subjects (2 immediate switch, 6 delayed switch)). Five subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs following switch (3 immediate switch, 2 delayed switch) and 1 subject while continuing ABC/3TC+EFV. There were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to study drug reported for either arm. No AE considered related to study drug was reported for more than 1 subject while on ABC/3TC+EFV. No cardiovascular events were observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec003l"><title>Renal Function</title><p>Renal function was assessed by performing urinalysis and calculating creatinine clearance at every visit throughout the study. Estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) methods respectively, and there were no meaningful or significant changes seen in either arm during the study.</p><p>Treatment-emergent proteinuria was reported for 11 subjects (all Grade 1) in the immediate switch group through 24 weeks and for 11 subjects (Grade 1 for 7 subjects and Grade 2 for 4 subjects) in the delayed switch group while on ABC/3TC+EFV through 12 weeks. After switching to EFV/FTC/TDF, treatment-emergent proteinuria was reported for 12 subjects (all Grade 1) in the delayed switch group. There were no clinically relevant changes in median values for urine protein/creatinine ratio within treatment groups, and no clinically relevant differences between randomized treatment groups. No AEs were reported in relation to urine protein abnormalities. No subjects discontinued the study due to renal adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prevention and management of drug-related adverse events and maintenance of adherence remain key challenges to the success of long-term antiretroviral therapy. This study documents several benefits of switching from ABC/3TC+EFV to the single tablet regimen of EFV/FTC/TDF in persons with dyslipidemia. These advantages include significant declines in pro-atherogenic lipids and improved perception of their treatment regimen. These benefits are gained without loss of virological control and have a low risk of introducing new unexpected adverse experiences.</p><p>Prospective studies in initial therapy [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and switch from thymidine analogue [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggest TDF based regimens have more limited impact on lipids than other NRTIs and may have a small lipid lowering effect. In healthy volunteers total and non-HDL cholesterol are reduced by two weeks with TDF and no impact on glucose disposal is observed [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The mechanism by which TDF reduces cholesterol has not been investigated. Changes observed in cholesterol in this study are similar to those reported with less potent statin agents [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and led to a trend of fewer subjects being in NCEP treatment ranges.</p><p>While renal dysfunction has been reported in individuals receiving tenofovir DF [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], no differences in changes in renal function were observed. These findings are consistent with prospective randomized controlled studies in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve individuals [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The subject preference of the single tablet regimen and the lower perceived intrusiveness of a regimen that involved the same dosing interval and only one less pill is consistent with previous switch studies that have demonstrated similar benefits in switching from twice to once daily therapies with these and other validated tools [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These data provide support for the development of once-daily single tablet regimens as tools that may support long term patient adherence and treatment persistency.</p><p>The study has some limitations, predominately that it is of a short term nature and did not include detailed assessments of other clinical and biomarkers of CV risk other than lipids. Changes in lipids observed with therapy switching may not have the same benefits on CV risk as lipid reductions with statin agents due to the pleiotropic effects of these agents [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and there have been studies that do not support the association between abacavir (ABC) exposure and increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among HIV-infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0116297.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116297.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In summary, switching from ABC/3TC+EFV to the single tablet regimen of EFV/FTC/TDF leads to statistically significant declines in total cholesterol and other proatherogenic lipid fractions and improved patient preference. Regimen switch to EFV/FTC/TDF can be safely achieved without a significant risk of loss of virologic control or introduction of new unexpected adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec005"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116297.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116297.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116297.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116297.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116297.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol Amendment 1&#x02014;summary of changes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116297.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116297.s004"><label>S3 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol Amendment 2&#x02014;summary of changes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116297.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116297.s005"><label>S4 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol Amendment 3&#x02014;summary of changes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116297.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Rocket I Study Group, UK</title><p>Dr J Ainsworth, A Waters North Middlesex Hospital, London</p><p>Dr J Anderson, L Morumba Homerton University Hospital, London</p><p>Dr G Brook, M Chikohora Central Middlesex Hospital, London</p><p>Dr P Hay, A Adebiyi, M Cockerill, M Ndoro St. Georges Hospital, London</p><p>Prof M Johnson, A Carroll, F Turner Royal Free Hospital, London</p><p>Dr G Moyle, C Fletcher, J Osorio Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London</p><p>Dr C Orkin, J Hand, C Desouza Barts and The Royal London Hospital</p><p>Dr M Fisher, N Perry, T Maher, A Bray Brighton &#x00026; Sussex University Hospital</p><p>Dr A de Burgh Thomas, M Bunting, L Jones Gloucester Royal Hospital, Gloucester</p><p>Dr D White, J Groves Birmingham Heartlands Hospital</p><p>Prof J Ross, L Brown, K Hood Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham</p><p>Dr J Dhar, S Johnson Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester</p><p>Dr E Morgan, R Hewart Royal Bolton Hospital, Bolton</p><p>Dr E Ong, J Wotherspoon Newcastle General Hospital, London</p><p>Dr E Wilkins, E Stockwell, A Robertson North Manchester General Hospital </p><p>Dr C Leen, S Morris, L Ellis Western General Hospital, Edinburgh</p><p>Dr R Maw, S McKernan Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast</p><p>Dr D C Herath (Medical Monitor) Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge</p><p>J Ewan (Project Manager) Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge</p><p>M (Hui) Wang, R Ebrahimi (Statistician) Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0116297.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
