Initial studies were performed using a single electrode radiofrequency catheter, but recent advances in catheter design have allowed the development of multi-electrode systems that can deliver lesions with a pre-determined pattern. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> multi-electrode system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>We conducted the first-in-human, prospective, multi-centre, non-randomized study in 46 patients (67% male, mean age 60 years, and mean baseline office blood pressure 176/96 mmHg) with drug-resistant hypertension.

Safety measures included all adverse events with a focus on the renal artery and other vascular complications and changes in renal function. Renal artery denervation, using the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> system significantly reduced the office blood pressure from baseline to 1, 3, and 6 months by &#x02212;28/10, &#x02212;27/10 and &#x02212;26/10 mmHg, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

The primary safety objective was all adverse events (AEs) during the study. The primary efficacy objective was the reduction of office BP compared with baseline at 6 months. Study patients will continue follow-up at 12, 18, and 24 months post-denervation procedure. The study was designed with an enrolment target of 60 patients to achieve a minimum of 30 subjects eligible for the renal denervation procedure. The study was approved by each institution's Research Ethics Committee and is registered with Clinical Trials Registry (Registration No. NCT01438229).

After administering conscious sedation as described and local anaesthesia, using fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French guiding catheter sheath [e.g. Cordis Vista Brite Tip Guiding Catheter (New Jersey, USA) with renal double curve 1 or another appropriate guiding catheter sheath] was inserted to engage each main renal artery sequentially. Nitroglycerine was injected directly into the renal artery if needed. I.v. heparin was administered as per an institutional protocol (&#x0223c;3000&#x02013;7000 U) although ACT monitoring was not mandated in the protocol. Images of the left and right main renal arteries were recorded using non-ionic contrast and the diameter and length of each of the main renal arteries measured. Patients with small (&#x0003c;4 mm in diameter or &#x0003c;20 mm in length), multiple main, or highly tortuous renal arteries were excluded and did not undergo renal denervation. These patients were followed for safety events and asked to return for a follow-up visit at 6 months. An appropriate basket size was subsequently chosen (small basket 4.0&#x02013;5.5 mm diameter/large basket 5.5&#x02013;8.0 mm diameter) and the renal denervation catheter was inserted such that the catheter's tip is proximal to the bifurcation of one of the main renal arteries. The basket on the catheter was then opened with the impedance of each electrode on the basket monitored.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>EnligHTN renal denervation system</title><p>The St Jude Medical EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> renal denervation system used in this study consists of the following main components: the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Ablation Catheter and EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Generator (Model 1500 T11.5 with Software 3.011).</p><p>The EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Ablation Catheter (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) was designed with an expandable electrode basket with four Platinum&#x02013;Iridium (Pt&#x02013;Ir) ablation electrodes. The electrodes deliver low-level RF energy to the renal arterial wall. The distal segment of the ablation catheter is deflectable to assist in proper basket positioning. The expandable feature of the basket and the deflectable distal catheter section establish good apposition between the ablation electrodes and the target ablation sites in the renal artery. Each electrode has a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature at the ablation site.</p><p>The EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> RF Ablation Generator delivers RF energy to the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Renal Artery Ablation Catheter using a proprietary algorithm. Each electrode on the ablation catheter has a corresponding display channel on the generator. The generator channels facilitate control and monitoring of the ablation process. It consists of four independent channels, which simultaneously monitor the temperature of each of the four ablation electrodes and adjusts the magnitude of the RF output power within the programmed maximum magnitude (6 W per electrode) to achieve and maintain the desired temperature (75&#x000b0;C) at each ablation site. The generator has built-in safety features, which include a self-test at power-up and automatic RF power shut-off if the measured tissue impedance is &#x0003c;50 Ohm or exceeds 400 Ohm or the temperature exceeds the setting by &#x0003e;5&#x000b0;C for &#x0003e;3 s or exceeds 80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Renal artery ablation</title><p>There were two sizes of the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Ablation Catheter available for use in the study. The small size basket is designed for renal artery diameters between 4 and 6 mm, and the large size basket is designed for renal artery diameters between 5.5 and 8 mm. After renal artery engagement and completion of a renal angiogram, the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Ablation Catheter was inserted into the renal artery with the tip of the catheter positioned proximal to the bifurcation and the corresponding images recorded. The basket on the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Ablation Catheter was then opened with the impedance of each electrode on the basket monitored. Renal artery denervation was commenced and performed sequentially by all four electrodes with the impedance, temperature, and RF energy delivery monitored. If further ablations were desired, the basket was collapsed and pulled back a sufficient distance (&#x0223c;1 cm) to avoid lesion overlap. The basket was rotated &#x0223c;45&#x000b0; and then expanded. Placement was confirmed under fluoroscopy and the ablation procedure was repeated. A minimum of four to maximum of eight ablation sites were performed in each main renal artery, with each ablation lasting 90 s per electrode. In general, eight ablations were attempted per renal artery to achieve circumferential ablation. Only one patient received four ablations per artery with similar BP reductions as the entire cohort. Images of the renal artery were taken using non-ionic contrast and checked for signs of renal artery irregularities (i.e. vasospasm, stenosis, or dissection). The renal artery ablation procedure was then repeated for the other renal artery, and the catheter was withdrawn. Finally, the sheath was removed and haemostasis achieved according to each centre's standard of care. Procedural data were recorded for each patient, including procedure duration and number of ablations delivered.</p></sec><sec id="s2c5"><title>Post-procedure and pre-discharge</title><p>Upon completion of the renal denervation procedure, the patient was moved to a recovery area, and vital signs were monitored continuously.

Renal artery imaging by computed tomography (CT) and duplex ultrasound was completed at the 6-month follow-up visit. Renal artery evaluation during the 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits was performed if clinically indicated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary efficacy objective was reduction of office BP from baseline to 6 months, which was measured according to guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C19">19</xref></sup> at baseline, pre-discharge, 1-, 3-, and 6-month post-procedure. Additional efficacy data collection included changes in anti-hypertensive medication, home BP monitoring, and 24-h ambulatory BP. The primary safety objective was the rate of AEs. Other data collection included blood analysis [complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, serum creatinine concentration, eGFR (using the modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula) and serum cystatin C], urine analysis (albumin-to-creatinine ratio), 12-lead ECG, and renal artery evaluation (using duplex ultrasonography and/or CT scan).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study oversight</title><p>Various independent committees or labs provided study oversight for this trial.

Monitoring and data analysis of the study was performed by St Jude Medical. The corresponding author and Steering Committee members had full access to the study data.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The minimum enrolment target for this study was 30 patients. No statistical calculation of the sample size was undertaken, as this study was a first-in-human study to evaluate safety and efficacy. All continuous parameters were summarized using mean, standard deviation, and range. Normality of data was verified with the use of box plots and the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov normality test. For normally distributed data, comparisons of primary and secondary outcomes between time points were analysed using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Correlations between variables were performed using Pearson's correlation co-efficients. In cases where the data were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyse the data. All categorical parameters were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (by SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was achieved if a two-sided test obtained a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The study enrolment was conducted from October 2011 to March 2012. A total of 62 patients were consented for enrolment. Sixteen patients were excluded due to exclusion criteria during the screening process. One of the 16 patients was excluded from the study due to multiple renal arteries found on the screening renal angiogram. The procedure was discontinued per protocol (i.e. renal ablation not performed), and the patient was followed until 6-month post-procedure. Refer to <italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHT197F1">1</xref></italic> for further details of the excluded patients.</p><p>In total, 46 patients completed baseline evaluation and underwent the renal denervation procedure. Forty large baskets (71%) and sixteen small baskets (29%) EnligHTN catheters were used in total. Forty EnligHTN catheters of the same size were used for both the right and left renal arteries in patients (26 large and 14 small), and thus sixteen catheters of varying sizes were used in the remaining patients. More than one EnligHTN catheter of course may have been used per case independent of size. Forty four of the 46 (96%) met all the inclusion and no exclusion criteria. There was one patient who did not meet the inclusion criterion for office systolic BP of &#x0003e;160 mm Hg, and a patient who did not have the baseline BP assessment completed per protocol. However, because these patients underwent the procedure, they are included in the analysis (the treated cohort). Baseline demographic, clinical condition, and medication data for the 46 patients are shown in <italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHT197TB2">2</xref></italic>. The procedure was generally performed with conscious sedation at the operators' discretion. This was not mandated in the protocol. It included, but was not limited to the combination of i.v. midazolam and fentanyl, titrated as appropriate. Most patients experienced back pain during the denervation procedure, which was generally well controlled with sedation and analgesia. Characteristics of the pain response were not captured in detail. The median procedure time (from initiation to completion of RF energy delivery) was 34.0 min and the mean (&#x000b1;SD) number of ablations delivered was 7.7 (&#x000b1;0.8) for the right and 7.4 (&#x000b1;1.4) for the left renal arteries.

Events include hypotension, progression of pre-existing renal artery stenosis, and a progression of hypertensive renal disease with an increase in serum creatinine.</p><p>Renal artery evaluation was conducted on all patients by CT imaging at 6 months. No patients developed a new haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. Two patients with pre-existing renal artery stenosis at baseline experienced asymptomatic progression of their renal artery stenosis at 6 months. One was adjudicated as serious (&#x0003e;50% occlusion in artery diameter) and one was non-serious. Neither patient has required clinical intervention at 6 months and their renal function parameters (eGFR, serum creatinine, and cystatin C values) remain stable.</p><p>Renal function was evaluated by repeated measurements of eGFR, serum creatinine and cystatin C from baseline through 6 months of follow-up. No patient experienced a reduction in eGFR &#x0003e;50%, a two-fold increase in serum creatinine, or progressed to end-stage renal disease.

To further evaluate changes in renal function, a more meaningful assessment of eGFR with a clinically relevant cut-off of &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> was also undertaken. At baseline, three patients had an eGFR level of &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. One of these patient's eGFR remained &#x0003c;60, while the other two improved to 60 or greater at 6 months.

A significant reduction in office and ambulatory BP was demonstrated at all follow-up time points through 6 months. No serious peri-procedural vascular events occurred and renal function remained within expected range for a hypertensive population following the procedure and up to 6-month post-renal denervation.</p><p>The EnligHTN I data set is the most complete of those published in the area of renal denervation with all patients remaining enrolled and followed through 6 months (no deaths, lost to follow-up, or exits for any reason). Only one visit was missed resulting in a 99.3% overall follow-up visit compliance rate. The overall reductions in office BP seen in the current study are comparable with those reported in two previous studies where single electrode RF catheters were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C16">16</xref></sup> Of interest, reductions in BP were recorded earlier in the current study (&#x02212;28/10 by 1 month), whereas previous studies found that while BP was reduced at 1 month, a comparable reduction was not seen until 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C16">16</xref></sup> Arguably, the more rapid response seen in the current study may reflect more complete renal denervation acutely due to the use of a multi-electrode RF catheter system compared with a single electrode system. This variance may simply reflect the limited sample sizes being addressed. The reduction in office systolic BP was greater than the reduction in 24 h ABPM and is similar to the difference in the two measures as seen in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C16">16</xref></sup> One may argue this biases the endpoint however office systolic BP is the gold standard for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with HTN, therefore, the reduction in office systolic BP is clinically meaningful.</p><p>We found a reduction in HR over 6 months, which is consistent with previously published data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C21">21</xref></sup> and consistent with a reduction in sympathetic activity. We also identified baseline HR as a predictor of reduction in office systolic BP, and change in HR over 6 months was correlated with office systolic BP reduction. Although this seems intuitive and consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in sympathetic activity also drives the reduction in systolic BP, this is different to a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C21">21</xref></sup> Some reasons for this difference include the way heart rate was measured (in office HR assessment from the BP monitor vs. electrocardiogram), and the degree of baseline sympathetic activity as evidenced by the baseline HR (71 vs. 66 b.p.m.). Clearly, larger observational data sets will assist in clarifying such relationships.</p><p>The laboratory measures indicative of renal function vary slightly over time; however, there is no abrupt change in eGFR or serum creatinine immediately following the procedure. In addition, the cystatin C values improved over time, as did the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios, which suggest an improvement in renal function using these indices. Although changes in eGFR and serum creatinine reach statistical significance at 6 months, a shift of &#x0003c;6% is not considered clinically relevant, particularly in a population with normal renal function. These changes can be attributed to a number of reasons such as small sample size, excessive diuretic dosage including aldosterone antagonists, natural variability and progression over time, or contrast administration for the 6-month protocol specified CT angiogram. The protocol required a vascular image with contrast at 6 months, but it did not specify the timing in relation to renal function evaluation. It is possible that blood samples were collected after contrast administration when usually a small transient rise in serum creatinine may be noted. Nevertheless, renal function will be followed at 12 and 24 months and further assessment will be made. It is important to note that the total number of patients with an eGFR &#x0003c;60 was no different at baseline and 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p><p>Additional studies with larger sample sizes and a randomized concurrent control group would be beneficial in further assessing benefits and risks of renal denervation therapy. A randomized trial comparing outcomes between single electrode and multi-electrode RF systems for renal denervation would allow more direct comparison of potential advantages/disadvantages of the two systems, in particular whether earlier reduction in BP is achieved with the use of a multi-electrode RF catheter. Current guidelines around clinical appropriateness and future directions with regard renal denervation have been very recently published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT197C22">22</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, renal artery sympathetic denervation was performed safely in patients with drug-resistant HTN, using the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> multi-electrode catheter, and resulted in a rapid and significant reduction in office BP as well as ambulatory BP that was sustained through 6 months. Thus, the EnligHTN<sup>&#x02122;</sup> multi-electrode system delivers a promising therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant HTN.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by St. Jude Medical Inc, St Paul, Minneapolis, USA.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest</bold>: S.G.W. received modest Research Grant and honoraria from St Jude Medical and Medtronic, Inc.
