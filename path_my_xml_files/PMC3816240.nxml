Therefore, it is important for patients with breast cancer and survivors to maintain optimal health and minimise the deleterious effects of cancer and its treatment such as fatigue, stress, anxiety or obesity.</p><p>Weight gain in adulthood,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> overweight, obesity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> as well as lack of physical activity (PA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> and alcohol consumption are risk factors commonly associated with risk of breast cancer (mainly in postmenopause for overweight and obesity).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> After a diagnosis of breast cancer, obesity appears to double the risk of recurrence and death in these patients, regardless of the state of menopause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Weight gain after diagnosis is also recognised as a risk factor for increased risk of recurrence and mortality and increases the risk of comorbidities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> In contrast, PA performed appropriately could improve many prognostic factors as well as survival in women after breast cancer. Several large cohort studies of women with breast cancer have shown an average reduction of 45% mortality associated with moderate exercise compared to a sedentary lifestyle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12 R13 R14">10&#x02013;14</xref> Randomised control trials have also shown that PA improves fitness, quality of life, self-esteem and treatment adherence and reduces fatigue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Thus, maintaining an optimal weight through a balanced diet combined with regular PA appears to be effective protective behaviour against breast cancer as well as comorbidity or mortality after a diagnosis of breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>Observational cohorts of patients with breast cancer conducted in France have shown that currently almost half of the French patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> and that nearly half of them gain weight within 1&#x02005;year after chemotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Patients treated for breast cancer practice less physical exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity than the healthy population for a similar energy expenditure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Indeed, reduced PA is a factor that is most likely implicated in weight gain among women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for localised breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20 R21">19&#x02013;21</xref> Given the poor prognosis associated with overweight, weight gain and insufficient PA, supportive care including PA and dietetic care is necessary in patients with breast cancer.</p><p>Despite the encouraging results of mainly North American studies on the impact of PA after breast cancer, no intervention studies of PA were conducted until recently in France.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Therefore, our aim was to transpose the international evidence to the French population and context, given the major cultural differences concerning food, the practice of PA and other lifestyle-related factors between the French and the North American populations. In this article, we have described the design of the randomised controlled trial Programme pour une Alimentation Saine et une Activit&#x000e9; Physique Adapt&#x000e9;e pour les patientes atteintes d'un cancer du Sein (PASAPAS, meaning &#x02018;Programme for healthy eating and adapted PA for patients with breast cancer&#x02019; in English). This study aims at evaluating the feasibility in human, material and financial terms of implementing an individualised programme of dietary counselling and adapted PA (APA) in a French population of women being treated for breast cancer. The APA intervention programme was tailored to prevent the risk of overweight, obesity or weight gain and to maintain and/or increase the patients&#x02019; PA level.</p><p>The main objective of the PASAPAS study is to evaluate, in a cohort of adult patients with a first localised (ie, non-metastatic) breast cancer, the feasibility of implementing an APA intervention for 6&#x02005;months, in addition to a dietary management, concomitant with the prescription of a first line of adjuvant chemotherapy (which lasts between 12 and 18&#x02005;weeks according to the protocol). The secondary objectives are to: (1) assess the acceptability of the intervention and randomisation and the recruiting capabilities; (2) assess the patients&#x02019; adherence to the intervention programme and analyse the reasons for non-adherence; (3) verify the adequacy between the procedures of the intervention programme (APA and dietetic), as well as the data collection and management, and the constraints of implementing the study in real conditions; (4) describe the patients&#x02019; satisfaction with the dietetic and APA programmes; (5) perform a health economics analysis; (6) describe the baseline state and evolution of a number of variables (PA level and profile, dietary intake, anthropometrics, body composition, lipid profiles, quality of life, body satisfaction/self-perception, self-esteem, depression, anxiety); (7) finally, as part of a joint biological study, describe the metabolomic profiles, lipidomic profiles, as well as the expression of endocrine factors and adipokines linked to breast cancer at initial diagnosis (ie, comparing between tumour and circulating blood before surgery in a cross-sectional study) and metabolic changes during the interventions (longitudinal study).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The PASAPAS study is an interventional, controlled, randomised, single-centre, open-label, parallel-group study with two arms: an intervention (or &#x02018;APA&#x02019;) group where patients are invited to a 6-month exercise programme in supervised groups in addition to the usual and personalised dietetic care; a control group receiving the usual dietetic care and PA national guidelines.

Moreover, dietary management is offered to each participant; in case of acceptance, dietetic consultations are offered on the patient's request for the duration of the intervention (6&#x02005;months).</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>APA intervention</title><p>Women randomised to the intervention arm are offered, in addition to dietary management (see Dietetic intervention section), an opportunity to participate in group sessions of APA over a period of 6&#x02005;months, including: (1) 2 sessions/week throughout the duration of chemotherapy (four to six 3-week courses depending on the protocol, ie, for 12&#x02013;18&#x02005;weeks), except during the first week of each course as a recovery from exercise and to take into account fatigue and other side effects related to chemotherapy; (2) 3 sessions/week after cessation of chemotherapy, until the end of the 6-month intervention (ie, for 8&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks). For the duration of chemotherapy, the APA programme includes one session of Nordic walking outdoors and one session of aerobic fitness indoors (combining cardiovascular workouts such as step, muscle strengthening and stretching or relaxation) per week. After chemotherapy, the APA programme includes two sessions of Nordic walking and one session of aerobic fitness per week.</p><p>The group sessions of a maximum of eight patients are supervised by an APA professional. Exercises consist of aerobics of moderate intensity (4&#x02013;6 Metabolic Equivalents of Task, METs) adapted according to the initial PA profile of each participant. The APA programme is an individualised exercise according to comorbidities and defined by the PA level (jointly defined by the PA profile or time spent in PAs of different intensities and by aerobic capacity) and the body composition status. Each session comprises a warm-up of 10&#x02005;min, a core period (20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min for aerobic fitness exercise or 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;min for Nordic walking) and a cool-down period of 10&#x02005;min. The progressive increase in workload is conducted by an increased frequency (from two sessions early in the programme to three sessions at the end of the programme), then the actual duration and lastly (after the end of chemotherapy) the intensity depending on the patient's desire and capacity. In all cases, the intensity of activity remains less than 80% of the age-adjusted maximal heart rate (equal to 220&#x02014;age expressed in years).</p><p>Attending the group sessions is required to determine the compliance of each participant with the APA programme, but participants are free to practice more exercise individually or attend additional group sessions. In case a participant cannot attend a group session (for medical or personal reasons or due to exceptional circumstances such as holidays), she must replace it during the same week with an individual session of another aerobic exercise (eg, Nordic walking, free swimming, hiking, biking), which is planned in advance with the APA professional; this intends to avoid a decrease in physical fitness. To verify attendance in the programme, exercise is recorded in a notebook and the number of steps is recorded by a pedometer given to participants.</p><p>If side effects occur during 3-week cycles of chemotherapy, patients may be prescribed a weekly chemotherapy (mainly paclitaxel). The APA programme remains the same for these patients, meaning they have no session during each weekly chemotherapy cycle and resume APA at the end of chemotherapy, but they can attend group sessions if they wish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Data collection and evaluations</title><p>As part of this study, patients of both arms are followed over a total duration of 12&#x02005;months (ie, for the 6-month dietetic and APA intervention programme and a 6-month follow-up after the intervention).

This single centre feasibility study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an APA programme and test the study process prior to a multicentre full-scale randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of an APA programme during breast cancer treatment on survival-related outcomes. Inclusions in the PASAPAS study started in June 2011 and the study will be closed in June 2014.</p><p>The optimal management for an improved PA level of a healthy individual appears to be at least three sessions/week, 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min each and of moderate intensity, allowing a sufficient dose of exercise. The intensity and type of exercise included in the APA programme for patients with breast cancer were based on literature evidence that recommends moderate-intensity exercise that combines aerobic and resistance exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> Therefore, sessions of aerobic and resistance exercise of at least 4 MET intensity, such as Nordic walking and aerobic fitness, were planned two to three times a week to permit a progressive increase in exercise frequency. An interval of at least 48&#x02005;h between sessions allows a complete recovery and the sessions are close enough to promote metabolic responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> The APA programme is individualised in terms of intensity (above 4 METs) and duration of the sessions according to the initial PA level, anthropometrics, body composition and comorbidities. APA sessions are supervised by trained APA professionals (similar to exercise physiologists).</p><p>The APA programme was designed to be feasible for patients with breast cancer undergoing treatment and to obtain a metabolic response to exercise. The APA programme aims: (1) to prevent physical deconditioning (ie, to preserve the initial PA level or improve it if it is insufficient or below recommendations); (2) to avoid weight gain, which is common during or after breast cancer treatment; (3) to improve the quality of life; (4) and to reduce fatigue. Improvements are expected in terms of body composition (maintenance or increase in lean mass, no increase or decrease in body fat), cardiorespiratory capacity, balance and flexibility. PA has been shown to be safe in patients with cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></p><p>The strengths of the study include, first, the PA intervention that is personalised and supervised by trained professionals. Group sessions provide support to patients with cancer for being physically active and following an exercise programme. Moreover, meeting other patients with cancer with similar health conditions and creating social links or friendship are reinforcement techniques for successfully modifying lifestyle habits such as PA or sedentary behaviours. Second, the timing of the APA intervention during adjuvant treatment makes the study original. Most PA interventions in patients with cancer are performed after treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51 R52 R53">51&#x02013;53</xref> and are not necessarily randomised.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> However, growing evidence shows the necessity to maintain or start PA as soon as possible after a cancer diagnosis and avoid loss of physical fitness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> Third, the 6-month programme is relatively long compared to other programmes published in the literature and may help patients sustain in a regular practice of PA. Fourth, a biological substudy will provide insight into the mechanisms involved in cancer and during an exercise intervention. In spite of the small size of this feasibility study, biological results will raise mechanistic hypotheses for a future large-scale randomised controlled trial. Fifth, a medicoeconomic evaluation is original and will guide the institution in integrating PA in the care of patients with cancer. Finally, the 6-month programme is relatively long compared to other programmes published in the literature and may help patients sustain in a regular practice of PA.</p><p>The authors also recognise the limitations of the study. The small sample size does not provide statistical power to test the efficacy of the APA intervention in modifying prognosis factors, but it is sufficient for the primary goal of the study to test the feasibility of implementing the programme. Feasibility studies are often of very small size indeed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref> Because the APA programme is supervised and performed locally, the target population is limited to patients living in the close area of the clinic. Recruitment in the study is strongly limited for this reason.</p><p>Given the large and growing population affected by breast cancer worldwide and the important benefit of PA on breast cancer survival identified in observational studies, it is now necessary to study the impact of PA on disease-free survival and overall survival in a multicenter randomised study design. However, studying overall survival might be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve given the relatively good prognosis of breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref> and the growing efforts of national nutrition and PA prevention programmes. Therefore, a valid intermediate survival endpoint might be necessary, which might be related to body composition or a composite endpoint based on biological mechanisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e309" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003855.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr V&#x000e9;ronique Chaj&#x000e8;s, Pr Marie-Paule Vasson, Dr Ruth Rimokh, Pr Jo&#x000eb;lle Goudable and Dr B&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;dicte Elena-Herrmann for their contribution during the development of the biological study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PB conceived the idea for the study.
