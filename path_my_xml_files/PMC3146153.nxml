Propofol is unique in having property to suppress airway reflexes better than any other agent. Therefore study was undertaken to evaluate clinically acceptable intubating conditions with different doses of propofol without muscle relaxants.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>90 ASA grade I and II patients posted for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia divided randomly into group I (propofol 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>); group II (2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>); groupIII (3mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Premedication with inj.Glycopyrollate, inj.Ranitidine, Inj.Ondensetron; inj.Midazolam and inj.fentanyl was done. After waiting for 5 minutes, induction dose of propofol was given followed by inj.lignocaine 90 seconds prior to intubation. Intubating conditions were assessed and hemodynamic changes were recorded at various levels.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Ideal intubating conditions were obtained in 96.7%of patients in group II (2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol) and 100% in group III (3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol). We found that clinically acceptable intubating conditions can be achieved with 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol without significant hemodynamic changes and 100% success can be obtained with 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Ideal intubating conditions without muscle relaxants can be achieved with propofol 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> and lignocaine 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> without significant hemodynamic changes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Propofol</kwd><kwd>intubation without muscle relaxants</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Keaveny JP and Knell PJ were amongst the first workers to propose the concept of intubation with only propofol without muscle relaxants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> This was the begining for the thought of elimination of muscle relaxants for intubation. In 1988, Mckeating K, Bali IM, Dundee JW compared thiopentone (4&#x00026;5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and propofol (2.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) to asses suppression of airway reflexes and found propofol to be better hypnotic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Stevens JB, Vesoco V, Harris K found that etomidate with alfentanil and propofol with alfentanil produce comparable intubating conditions, better than thiopentone with alfentanil. They also found that addition of lignocaine improves condition for intubation with attenuation of intub-ation response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Saarnivaara L, Klemola VM could achieve 89% success in intubation with 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol with 30&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> alfentanil without muscle relaxants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Mulholand D, Carlisle RJT compared tracheal intubation with 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol with and without 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> lignocaine without any opioids and muscle relaxants. They found that dose of 2.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol is sufficient to intubate the trachea without muscle relaxants and addition of ligocaine 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> attenuates the stress response to intubation well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>We in our study have compared different doses of propofol with lignocaine and fentanyl to obtain clinically acceptable intubating conditions without using muscle rela-xants. Attenuation of pressor response and haemodynamic changes were also observed during the study.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>90 ASA class I and II patients who were posted for abdominal, orthopaedic, gynecological, ENT surgeries requiring general anesthesia were chosen for study and divided randomly into 3 groups.</p><p>Group I received 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol, Group II 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol and group III received 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol.</p><p>Criterion for choosing the patients include age between 20 to 65 years, ASA class I or II and MPC grade I or II. Patients with history of hypertension, asthma and previously documented difficult intubation were excluded from the study.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p><p>On the OT table each patient was attached to ECG monitor, Pulse-oximeter and NIBP. All the patients were cannulated with 18G cannula and 10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> of ringer lactate solution was given 10 minutes before induction.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with inj.Glycopyrollate 5&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>, Inj.

Fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>one after the other as slow i.v bolus in the same order.</p><p>After giving inj. Fentanyl patients were watched for apnea, oxygen saturation and given 100% oxygen by mask.</p><p>As fentanyl takes 5-7 minutes for its plasma concentration to equilibrate with that of brain concentration, we waited for 5 minutes after giving inj.fentanyl after which inj. propofol either 2mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> or 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in precalculated amount, chosen randomly (based on computer generated randomization) and grouped accordingly was given slowly intravenously over 10 seconds followed by inj. Lignocaine 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> as i.v bolus.</p><p>The order of giving Propofol and lignocaine was planned such a way that laryngoscopy and intubation was done at 7 minutes after giving Fentanyl.</p><p>Patients were watched for apnea, oxygen saturation and ventilated bag mask with 100% oxygen.</p><p>90 seconds after completion of propofol injection, laryngoscopy and intubation was performed.

Thus 66.70% patients had clinically acceptable intubating conditions (excellent + good) However 33.30% patients could not be intubated and had to be given muscle relaxants to achieve it.

Thus 96.70% patients had clinically acceptable intubating conditions and only 3.30 % of patients could not be intubated and were given muscle relaxants for achieving it (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The result obtained by us are significantly better than Leitaut T et al who found clinically acceptable intubating conditions in only 35% of patients with propofol 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (like us) and Fentanyl 3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> (higher than us).

They intubated the patients 90 seconds after Fentanyl whereas we intubated after 7 mins of Fentanyl injection.</p><p>Attenuation of pressor response and hemodynamic changes were also assessed. For this we took the blood pressure recordings after premedication (midazolam and fentanyl) as the baseline blood pressure for comparison between different propofol groups.</p><p>We found that in all the three groups after premedication there was a fall in MAP compared to baseline level which is not significant.</p><p>When compared between the three groups there was no significant difference in the fall of MAP with 2, 2.5, 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Graph 4</xref>) and none of the patients had to be treated for hypotension.</p><p>Similar results of fall in MAP not requiring active management have been reported by Stevens J et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>; and Davidson JAH et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>During Laryngoscopy and intubation there was significant increase in Heart rate in all the three groups but when compared between gr I, II and III there was no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Graph 3</xref>).</p><p>However during Laryngoscopy and Intubation there was a significant rise in MAP in Gr. I. The rise was significant not only from the baseline level but also from the level at preoxygenation. 5 min after Larygoscopy and Intubation the MAP returned almost to the baseline level. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Graph 4</xref>).</p><p>In gr. II and III during laryngoscopy and intubation there was rise in MAP but it remained below the baseline level and remained same 5 min after intubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Graph 4</xref>).</p><p>There was significant difference in response to larygoscopy and intubation between group I and group II and III. There was good attenuation of response to laryngoscopy and intubation in 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol group along with 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Lignocaine and 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> fentanyl. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Graph 4</xref>)</p><p>Thus in conclusion, ideal intubating conditions for intubation without using muscle relaxants are possible with 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol with 2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> fentanyl and 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> lignocaine and the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation gets attenuated well.</p><table-wrap id="T2"
