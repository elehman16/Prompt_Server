Mechanical ventilation through endotracheal tube even for a short time could cause lung tissue damage and surfactant inactivation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It has been shown that early use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) after birth could decrease the need for mechanical ventilation without any significant increase in the complications of the disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Considering the beneficial effects of early surfactant administration and possibility of treatment failure by the application of CPAP alone, combined use of both surfactant and CPAP in the treatment of RDS has been developed in some clinical trials. Results of these studies have indicated that use of the method called intubation, surfactant, extubation (INSURE) significantly reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, this method also requires positive pressure ventilation for at least a short time after intratracheal administration of surfactant. So the researchers have been looking for other methods of the drug administration without the need for endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] These methods include nebulizing surfactant,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] administration through laryngeal mask airway[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or intrapartum pharyngeal instillation of the drug before infant begins to breathe.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A number of researchers modified the INSURE method and developed a new one. In this method, surfactant was administered via a thin intratracheal catheter during spontaneous breathing with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). The method was experienced for the first time by Kribs <italic>et al</italic>. in Germany.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A number of studies on the effectiveness and advantages of this method over the standard method of endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration is limited.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Most of these studies have retrospective or prospective observational design.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There are only three clinical trials conducted in this field to date; results of two studies have been published.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In mentioned studies the new method have been compared either with method in which neonates was intubated, received surfactant and then mechanically ventilated[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or with method of continuing nCPAP and administering surfactant via endotracheal tube, only when respiratory distress was progressed and infants needed to receive mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In some of these studies, the primary outcomes were only feasibility and safety of the new method.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this study, we compared two methods of surfactant administration in the early phases of RDS: Via either an endotracheal tube by INSURE method or a thin intratracheal catheter while the infants spontaneously breathe on nCPAP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>From December 2012 to May 2013, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in two Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) in Shahid Beheshti Maternity Hospital and Al-Zahra General Hospital, two teaching tertiary hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University; the registration number was 392176. Inborn infants with gestational age &#x02264;34 weeks and birthweight 1000&#x02013;1800 g in whom signs of RDS were appeared within the 1<sup>st</sup> h of life and surfactant was required after 30 min treatment with nCPAP (based on the predefined criteria as indicated below) were included. Infants with a history of chorioamnionitis in mother, Apgar score of 4 or less at 5 min after birth, life-threatening congenital anomalies and those who need endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for stabilization at birth or need mechanical ventilation for more than a few minutes after surfactant administration were excluded from the study. Based on data extracted from the mentioned previous studies, if <italic>d</italic> was considered equal to 0.4, 34 infants were needed for enrollment to achieve 80% power and an &#x003b1; of 0.05. We enrolled a total of 38 infants in this study. Informed consent was obtained from the parents as soon as the first sign of respiratory distress was observed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Interventions</title><p>Infants were treated with nCPAP on a pressure of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O as early symptoms of RDS were appeared. CPAP was administered by Neopuff infant resuscitator (Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) via an oral mask in the delivery room and continued using bubble CPAP (Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) via binasal prongs in the NICU. A 6F orogastric tube was inserted into the stomach in all infants. SpO<sub>2</sub>(arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation measured by pulse oximetry) and heart rate were continuously monitored. For infants with birth weight &#x0003c; 1250 g intravenous aminophylline was administered with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg and continued with a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg every 8 h.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Thirty minutes after application of nCPAP in the NICU, if the required fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>) for maintaining SpO<sub>2</sub> in the range of 87-92% was more than 30% or the infant had moderate to severe respiratory distress (Silverman-Andersen score &#x0003e; 4), curosurf (Chiesi Farmaceutisi SPA, Parma, Italy) was administrated with a dose of 200 mg/kg. Using cards provided in consecutively numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes that were opened just after making the decision of surfactant administration, infants were randomly allocated to one of two groups to receive surfactant via an endotracheal tube (ET group) or via a thin catheter inserted in trachea (CATH group). A level 2 resident in perinatal-neonatal subspecialty program who did not perform randomization and didn't involve in outcome measurements was administered all doses of the drug. Before administration of surfactant, infants took intravenous atropine in a dose of 0.025 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In ET group surfactant was administered via a 2.5F or 3F endotracheal tube inserted into the trachea and fixed after vocal cord guide was aligned with vocal cords. The infant was temporarily separated from the CPAP. After bolus injection of the drug into the trachea, positive pressure ventilation was applied using neopuff and continued for at least 1 min or until SpO<sub>2</sub> was reached to 87% or more. The endotracheal tube was then removed, and the infant was switched back to nCPAP on the previous pressure. The FIO<sub>2</sub> was decreased at a rate of 5% every 1-2 min as long as SpO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at the above desired level. In CATH group, surfactant was administrated via a 4F end hole feeding tube (thin catheter) with one orifice at the tip. The catheter was marked 1.5 cm above the tip with a permanent marker. The catheter was connected to the syringe contained surfactant and filled with the drug. It was then clamped with a Magill forceps in an angle of 120&#x000b0;. The head of the infant was positioned as for tracheal intubation. Using laryngoscope in one hand and the forceps in another hand, the catheter was inserted into the trachea so far as the marker was aligned at the level of vocal cords. It was fixed with two fingers, and the laryngoscope was removed. Then, the surfactant was injected into the trachea over 1&#x02013;3 min. At the end of the procedure, to insure that the drug was not accidentally injected into the stomach, the orogastric tube was aspirated. During the procedure, the nCPAP was continuously applied. After surfactant administration, FIO<sub>2</sub> was decreased gradually as described in ET group.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In both studied groups, the procedure was discontinued in following conditions: Heart rate drop below 100 beats/min, SpO<sub>2</sub> decrease to &#x0003c; 80% and severe cough or chocking. It was restarted after stabilization with positive pressure ventilation (via endotracheal tube and oral mask in ET group and 2, respectively).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Arterial blood gas analysis was performed as indicated by the clinical condition of the studied preterm infants.</p><p>Twelve hours after the first dose of surfactant, if FIO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265; 30% was still required to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> at 87% and more, the second dose of the drug would be administered in an amount of 100 mg/kg using the same method of administration. Infants in whom the above criteria were still met 12 h after the second dose took the drug in a similar amount for the third time.

The duration of oxygen requirement, however was significantly lower with the drug instillation via a thin intratracheal catheter. The results of studies evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and safety of surfactant administration via thin intratracheal catheter have shown decrease in: Need for mechanical ventilation within 1&#x02013;3 days of birth[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and its duration,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] duration of oxygen therapy,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] rate of oxygen requirement at discharge or 28 days of birth[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and rate of CLD and mortality.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Compared with enrolled infants in our study, all infants in some of these studies[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a number of them in others have lower gestational age and/or birth weight.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In most of these studies, one group of infants has received surfactant via thin intratracheal catheter based on defined criteria while treating with nCPAP and compared with another group, which has been intubated and mechanically ventilated with the same criteria.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Factors such as early application of mechanical ventilation in control group and the lower infants' gestational age and birth weight which increases the risk of complications of this intervention could explain the significant differences in above mentioned short- and long-term outcomes between the two groups. In the group of infants who took surfactant via a thin intratracheal catheter, the drug was administered earlier and thus more frequent than the other group. As the surfactant has an important role in the improvement of infants' pulmonary outcome, it may be a strong reason for decreased rate of complications in this group. In one of their studies, Kribs <italic>et al</italic>. reported that although infants who received surfactant via a thin intratracheal catheter had lower gestational age and birth weight than those treated with standard care, the rate of mechanical ventilation, CLD and the combined outcome of mortality or need for oxygen at discharge was lower among them. They suggested that the improved outcomes may be due to the surfactant itself not a new intervention.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Based on the results of their similar study, Kribs <italic>et al</italic>. explained that outcome improvement in the group took surfactant via thin intratracheal catheter may be due to early and prophylactic use of the drug rather than the new method of its administration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In some of these studies use of caffeine or theophylline was significantly higher in group in whom surfactant was administered by a new method (via a thin intratracheal catheter). It could have an important role in the improvement of pulmonary function and decrease in need for mechanical ventilation and rate of CLD.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Notably, the majority of studies in this field had observational design[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with some limitations including that they were not randomized and in some of them the indications and conditions of surfactant administration were not definitively determined.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In our study, the rate of effort for insertion of a thin catheter into the trachea was lower than that for endotracheal intubation, although the difference was not statistically significant. It means that the feasibility of this new method is at least the same as of the standard method. In addition, the number of infants who developed adverse events during surfactant administration via thin intratracheal catheter was significantly lower. In our center, it is for the first time that insertion of a thin catheter into the trachea for surfactant administration is examined, whereas there have been enough experience for the drug administration by endotracheal intubation for many years. With increasing experience, it seems that the number of infants who develop adverse events during surfactant administration using the new method and the rate of effort for insertion of a thin catheter into the trachea would be decreased significantly. In conclusion, the results of our study showed that during management of preterm infants with RDS who need surfactant while treating on nCPAP, surfactant administration via a thin intratrachal catheter have similar feasibility, efficacy and safety as its administration via an endotracheal tube. This study did not include infants with birth weight &#x0003c;1000 g. To compare the feasibility and efficacy of a new method in this group of neonates as the most immature infants at the highest risk for adverse outcomes, similar randomized controlled trials with larger sample size is recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors contributed the idea of research, design of study, data analysis and manuscript
