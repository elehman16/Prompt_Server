<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Marked ethnic disparities exist in asthma outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and ethnically delineated barriers to participation in trials concerning asthma interventions have been identified. These include a residual stigma attached to the asthmatic label, anxieties related to understanding the implications of participation, worries about the effects of trial medications, as well as cost and time concerns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Suggested solutions include provision of incentives, use of multilingual trial literature, employment of personal approaches and addressing researchers&#x02019; reluctance to invite participation from the full cultural and linguistic spectrum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6">4&#x02013;6</xref></p><p>Currently, there is poor understanding of the perspective of ethnic minority parents involved in paediatric clinical trials. Previous work has explored the role of parents as responsible decision makers coreliant on the researchers and research governance procedures for guidance and protection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Significant elements include parents&#x02019; poor comprehension of the trial process,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> the parental emotional turmoil related to paediatric illness and confusion born of the blurring of ethical boundaries between clinical and research practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11">9&#x02013;11</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Parent study</title><p>The current study is embedded within a randomised controlled trial (the parent study) of the genetic determinants of the efficacy of intermittent montelukast in preschool wheeze (PSW) and provides an opportunity to investigate the perspectives of the parents of trial participants. It was hypothesised that a genetically determined subgroup of patients (with higher urinary inflammatory mediators) would respond better to montelukast (have reduced unscheduled medical attendance) than their peers.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Qualitative study</title><p>PSW is a common, but poorly understood, disease of early childhood equally prevalent in UK children of South Asian and European origin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The ethnically diverse setting of the recruiting institution permits the principal aim of this study which was to compare attitudes and experiences of participating families across ethnic groups, including a significant number of participants of South Asian (Bangladeshi) origin. A secondary aim arises from the fact that both positive and negative public perceptions of pharmacogenetics exist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> A recent focus group study involving diverse ethnic minority participants in biobank research found generally positive attitudes, with participation driven by perceptions of personal or collective benefit, despite limited understanding of genetics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>

For hospital attendees, recruitment occurred immediately prior to or shortly after discharge from hospital. Families received a trial information pack and subsequently discussed the study with the research team. Written and real-time verbal Bengali translation was available as required. Amenable parents then gave written informed consent (to paediatrician, research nurse or both) after which a mouth swab (for leukotriene-pathway genes) and urine sample (for leukotriene levels) were collected. Parents agreed to administer a 10-day course of oral medication (randomly allocated to montelukast or placebo) at the onset of a cold or wheezing symptoms, and to complete a daily diary record for the same period. They also received progress calls from the clinical research team at regular intervals and were encouraged to phone if they had any queries or concerns. Children were followed up for 1&#x02005;year and the need for unscheduled respiratory medical attendance assessed. The qualitative study (QS) was based at the East London host centre of this multicentre trial and involved an audio-recorded semistructured interview with parents of enrolled children.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>All participants in the trial and the qualitative substudy received written information about the study at recruitment. One hundred and thirty-nine parents gave formal written consent for their child to be enrolled in the trial and 85 of these parents gave written consent to a qualitative interview at the same time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750TB2">table 2</xref>). The initial plan was to sample purposefully from the 85 consenting parents, aiming for maximum variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> in terms of ethnicity, gender and other variables and then theoretically, according to iterative analysis of initial interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data generation</title><p>Individual interviews were considered the most appropriate method for data collection as this ensured confidentiality. A semistructured interview guide (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750BX1">box 1</xref>) for the interviews was developed following a literature review and discussions between VM and CS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>

Each interview took place in the parent's home and lasted 25&#x02013;60&#x02005;min. Preschool children were present in many instances. Interviews were conducted in English except one interview which required the assistance of a Bengali interpreter.

Most households reported at least one working parent, but the numbers engaged in full time, part time or shift work were unclear due to guarded responses.</p><p>Parents of children in all groups reported anxiety related to their helplessness during wheezing attacks, often driven by the first hospital presentation. Major fears were of the potential for death or major long-term disability. These concerns drove a preoccupation with monitoring their child's health, together with anxiety about the potential progression of a cold to a wheeze with the attendant hospital visit, investigations and treatment. These fears were important drivers for trial participation, with hopes that participation might contribute to improved treatment for wheeze. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750BX2">Box 2</xref> shows interview extracts relevant to this theme.

Four of 20 Bangladeshi parents (but no others) believed there would be no side effects, reporting that this was what the trial researcher had told them. Even parents with a well-informed understanding of the trial process said they would consider withdrawing their child if they believed the medication was not having a beneficial effect. Three (one from each ethnic group) had already decided to discontinue because their child did not like the medication or because it did not appear to be effective, or because of perceived adverse effects. Three more (2/10 UK, 1/12 other) said they would consider dropping out for similar reasons if they believed that their child had been allocated the placebo drug, or if the medication seemed ineffective or harmful, indicating that subject recruitment and retention is driven strongly by the perceived likelihood of personal benefit.

This caused anxiety in many parents, regardless of ethnicity, motivating them to find an effective treatment. However, some parents found it difficult to distinguish between clinical treatment and research despite receiving information about the trial processes, including randomisation and the use of a placebo.</p><p>A second reason for enrolment was the reassurance parents received that they would retain control, regarding not only whether to remain in the study but also whether and when they gave their child the study medicine.</p><p>Third, most parents had confidence in the research team and preferred face-to-face meetings with the clinical trial researchers to reliance on written PILs. They could ask questions directly of the research team and found the prescribed and formalised information sheets too long. While none said that they had received too much information about the trial, few had read beyond the first few pages. It appears that verbal delivery of trial information was more important than study literature. Bangladeshi families demonstrated poor familiarity with essential trial concepts at interview (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750TB4">table 4</xref>); however, it is unclear whether this reflects poor initial understanding or poor information retention. All parents report being satisfied with the information received at recruitment; however, although similar numbers of white and Bangladeshi parents claim to have read the PIL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750TB4">table 4</xref>), the information density of the PIL may have prevented complete reading (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750BX5">box 5</xref>), or re-reading when details had faded from memory. The disproportionate effect on Bangladeshi families may relate to the large number of non-responders to the query regarding educational attainment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002750TB3">table 3</xref>), where non-response may indicate a low educational level. Despite this poor information level, Bangladeshi parents were overrepresented in the parent study, reflecting a desire to participate that was likely influenced by researcher rapport (box 3 and 5) and a Bengali-speaking team member, a linguistic benefit that was lost in the translated PIL due to low literacy. Hence, parents gave informed consent, but lacked a <italic>useful</italic> written record of the details to which they had agreed.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013002750TB4" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Information and consent</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bangladeshi</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">White UK</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other*</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Satisfied with initial information</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (100%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (100%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (100%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">42/42 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Personally read PIL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/20 (55%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/10 (60%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/12 (33%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21/42 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Had PIL read to them</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/20 (25%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/10 (40%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/12 (50%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15/42 (36%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Understanding of randomisation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/20 (25%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/10 (70%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/12 (25%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14/42 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Awareness that DNA sample taken</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/20 (30%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/10 (90%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/12 (75%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24/42 (57%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>PIL, patient information leaflet.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The study found a lack of curiosity about research processes and practices among all ethnic groups.

This reluctance was perhaps related to concerns about coping with an interview conducted in English or with the aid of an interpreter. Future qualitative studies of this sort may be able to overcome this reluctance by employing a research worker fluent in the first language of potential respondents.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparison with the existing literature</title><p>This study reinforces the existing qualitative literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>

Modern ethics committees demand highly detailed PILs which may perversely reduce the quality of the consent decision by discouraging thorough reading and reducing assimilation of information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> This observation is supported by the current findings. As a matter for debate, we suggest the introduction of a supplementary and abbreviated PIL with a checklist of fundamental concepts to be covered during the informed consent process (this would include the division between researcher and clinician roles). This document should be signed and a copy kept by both researcher and the study participant. The counter argument is that an abbreviated PIL would not fully inform parents; however, such a document (used alongside a detailed consent discussion) would add structure to and emphasise the importance of the discussion and also serve as a palatable aide-memoire for participants. The full PIL could be retained as a detailed reference document for parents. Approaches such as this may improve the quality and success of the consent process across the ethno-social spectrum and their investigation should be an avenue for future study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e188" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002750.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> VM carried out the interviews, analysed data and wrote the initial draft of the paper.
