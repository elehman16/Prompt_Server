Hypertension affects approximately one billion individuals worldwide, and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In Korea, hypertension affects more than 30% of people over the age of 30 and up to 65% of people over 65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Current interventions for hypertension include sodium restriction, pharmacological management, and lifestyle modifications, such as stress management and exercise. However, in clinical practice, hypertension can be difficult to control, due to poor adherence to prescribed interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lifestyle interventions are difficult to achieve and maintain, and antihypertensive medications present risks of side effects.</p><p>Qigong is a common healing technique in Oriental medicine and has been used clinically for preventing and curing disease, as well as for improving and maintaining overall health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been claimed that qigong can foster health and healing by promoting the smooth flow of qi throughout the body so that the body can heal itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Qigong includes two concepts: qi, the vital energy of the body, and gong, the training or cultivation of qi. Medical qigong is divided into internal and external components. Internal qigong consists of exercises, including breathing, meditation, focus of intention and rhythmical movements, while external qigong is performed by a trained practitioner in order to deliver qi energy to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is generally accepted that internal qigong is the more beneficial aspect for the promotion of good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Qigong has been found to have effects on various conditions, such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Qigong has also been studied as an alternative therapy for controlling blood pressure. Previous such research has concluded that patients with essential hypertension practicing qigong for less than 1 year had improved blood pressure (BP) control compared with non-treated controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, well-designed rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to the effects of qigong on BP control are still scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although most qigong trials have targeted essential hypertension, the stages of hypertension exhibited by study subjects were diverse, and some studies did not describe each patient's exact blood pressure. In addition, there has been no trial assessing the effects of qigong on pre-hypertension. To assess the effects of qigong for pre- and mild hypertension through a high-quality RCT, a pilot study to evaluate qigong should be conducted.</p><p>The aims of this pilot study are the following: (1) to evaluate the effects of internal qigong on blood pressure, health status and hormone levels in patients with pre- or mild hypertension and (2) to test the methods and calculate a sample size for future randomized trials to investigate further the clinical value of qigong in controlling hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a 2-parallel group, randomized controlled trial to compare qigong with no treatment for pre- and mild hypertension on the following outcomes: blood pressure, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), clinical symptoms and hormone levels.

The participants will visit the clinic and take 3 qigong classes per week for 8 weeks. Each qigong class lasts 30 minutes, including a warm-up (5 min) and a cool-down (5 min) portion. In addition, the subjects will be asked to practice qigong at home for 30 min more than 2 times a week for the duration of the study.

Blood pressure will be taken at every visit. The subjects will be fitted with a BP cuff on the right arm and allowed to sit quietly for 5 minutes. A trained research nurse will measure the blood pressure carefully with the subject in the seated position 3 times after resting for at least 10 min in a temperature-controlled room. Three measurements will be carried out at 5-min intervals. The mean of these 3 measurements will be used in the data analysis.</p><p>Subjects will be instructed to wear loose and comfortable clothing. The investigators will refrain from wearing laboratory coats during all sessions, as the use of such apparel has been associated with increased BP in some patients (white-coat hypertension).</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary</title><p>Subjects will be asked to complete two questionnaires, specifically, the MOS Short Form 36-item (SF-36) (Korean version) and the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP2). These surveys were selected based on the aims of the trial and on their clinical relevance and feasibility. The SF-36 is a widely used, reliable, valid and responsive measure of outcome health survey. The SF-36 consists of eight scales: physical function, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, mental health, role-emotional, social function, and vitality.</p><p>The MYMOP is a patient-generated outcome questionnaire, which is problem-specific but includes general well-being. MYMOP aims to measure the outcomes that the patient considers to be most important. MYMOP is applicable to all patients who present with symptoms; these symptoms can be physical, emotional or social [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Heart rate will be assessed on every visit, and questionnaires will be administered at weeks 0, 4 and 8. Changes in norepinephrine, cortisol, renin, angiotensin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides will be examined through blood tests at weeks 0 and 8. Blood samples will be taken in the morning after an overnight fast to achieve standard conditions with respect to dietary intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Four weeks after completion of the 8 weeks of qigong exercise, blood pressure, heart rate, and the SF-36 and MYMOP2 questionnaires will be evaluated. The follow-up assessment is designed to evaluate the long-term effect of qigong exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Collected data will be recorded on standardized forms. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for dependent and independent variables. This analysis will include summary statistics of demographic information and outcome measures.</p><p>The primary analysis of the data will be undertaken using the principle of intent-to-treat (ITT). Our ITT analysis will include all participants, including those who are not fully compliant and those missing outcome data. We will evaluate the effectiveness of qigong exercise and no treatment on blood pressure at 8 weeks using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects in the qigong and the non-treated group will be compared upon admission using a 2-sample t-test (continuous data) and chi-square analysis (normal data). Nonparametric methods will be used when assumptions of normality are violated. To control for baseline differences between groups, variables that are significantly different at baseline will serve as covariates in the analyses. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Software will include the Access and SAS version 9.1 programs. The alpha level will be set at &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>Adverse events will be reported to the data and safety monitoring board. Adverse events will be recorded when participants present with complaints at any time and will be based on the questioning of participants. Serious adverse events will be recorded as required by the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline E2A. We will submit the results of the trial for publication in an appropriate journal irrespective of outcome. We will report the trial in accordance with the CONSORT statements.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary end point for this study is the change in patient blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks post-therapy. Eight-week changes in hormone levels and health status, as measured by SF-36 and MYMOP2, are secondary end points. The primary comparison is between participants randomly assigned to qigong exercises versus no intervention. Subgroup analyses for age, gender and baseline BP will be conducted by including each classification.</p><p>Many qigong researchers consider that the qigong effects on the human body are systemic without targeting one particular element, such as BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, we will use the MYMOP 2 and the SF-36 questionnaires, which can measure the quality of life, health status and the severity of subjective symptoms, as outcomes for this study.</p><p>The standard mercury sphygmomanometer is the most common device used to measure blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The accuracy of automatic blood pressure measurement is still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; therefore, the mercury sphygmomanometer is considered to be the 'gold standard' for measuring blood pressure. To avoid the white-coat effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the CRC will not wear a white coat during this clinical study.</p><p>This study will be the first randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of qigong exercises for the treatment of pre- and mild hypertension. The main focus of this trial is to investigate the role of qigong in reducing the blood pressure of patients with pre- or mild hypertension. This trial will contribute information needed to begin answering important clinical questions regarding the effects of qigong in lowering the blood pressure of patients with pre- and mild hypertension. Although the trial is not sufficiently powered to determine the effectiveness of qigong on hypertension, we will compare the effect size between groups in order to form larger-scale trials in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JEP conceived of the project, led the design, and wrote the first draft of this manuscript.
