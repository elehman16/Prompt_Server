Heart rate (bpm) and capillary oxygen saturation (%) were recorded continuously. Depending on the availability of equipment, blood pressure was measured either invasively and continuously or non-invasively and intermittently (every 15 min). Data were collected over a period of 7 h from 11 pm to 6 am.</p><p>For comparability, we chose the intravenous route for flunitrazepam since propofol can only be administered parenterally. The drugs were injected after a period of 2 min at rest. Propofol (20 mg/ml) was administered continuously with 2 mg/kg/h over a period of 7 h time. Flunitrazepam was given as a bolus dose over 2 min with 0.015 mg/kg. Drug administration was started at 11 pm propofol infusion was stopped at 6 am.

The high and low filters were set to 70 Hz and 0.25 Hz. The notch filter was set to 50 Hz. Four electrodes (BIS-Sensor XP Quatro, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, USA) were placed on the forehead according to the recommendations of Aspect Medical Systems, three of them on the frontal scalp (electrode one center position 1 cm above the nose, electrode four above the eyebrow) and one on the temporal scalp (electrode three between the eye and hairline).

Patients were asked to give information on the point of time of falling asleep, the duration of sleep, the number and duration of awakenings and the length of time spent awake. Furthermore, sleep quality, quality of falling asleep, regeneration and refreshment after sleep had to be assessed. The evaluation was done by using school grade-like numbers between one and five.

To compare BIS values the overall median of every patient was computed and comparisons between the groups were performed. Five second-values were displayed time dependently for every patient and in summary for both groups.

By using the BIS monitor alone it was not possible to identify rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Given that BIS values of light sleep and REM sleep are in the same range they had to be outlined. To minimize artificial variability of the BIS the data were concentrated to the 2-min median. BIS values &#x02264;74 corresponded to slow wave sleep (called sleep stage A), BIS values of 75-89 to light sleep and REM sleep (called sleep stage B) and BIS values &#x02265;90 to the awake state (called sleep stage C). Due to the missing data of the row EEG further fragmentation to the different non-REM (NREM) stages was not possible. Correlation analysis was performed with the Spearman Rho correlation.

Although propofol favors slow-wave sleep[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] its benefit for sleep quality in ICU has not been clearly proven.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Thus, the current study design has been selected to evaluate the effect of diurnal sedation with propofol regarding night sleep in ICU in comparison with long-acting benzodiazepines as standard of care. Propofol was administered with 2 mg/kg/h that is considerably less than used for maintaining general anesthesia (6-10 mg/kg/h) and patients were continuously monitored for vital signs. As there were no severe complications related to propofol the dose can be regarded as safe in the intensive care setting.</p><p>The possible differences of general sleep quality, sleep duration and sleep structure between both groups were assessed by using a standardized sleep diary and the BIS. Since sleep laboratory conditions are too complex to be realized on an ICU and do not reflect the real ICU environment the BIS was selected as an instrument for measuring cerebral activity. The influence on patients&#x02019; behavior is negligible, technical requirements are low and values can be interpreted easily. The BIS was already evaluated for interpreting naturally occurring sleep.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The used standardized sleep diary[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] clearly depicted an advantage in sleep quality for patients treated with propofol. The frequency of awakenings (sleep diary) was significantly lower in the Pg. The improved sleep quality observed under propofol compared to flunitrazepam was not realized by increasing sleep duration. More likely these changes were generated by influencing sleep structure and neurohumoral functions. Sleep quality improved under propofol with a decreasing number and duration of awakenings (sleep diary and BIS) and after administration of flunitrazepam with increasing sleep duration (sleep diary).</p><p>The BIS median was significantly lower under propofol (Pg 74.05, Fg 78.7 [<italic>P</italic> = 0.016]). The reaction of the BIS within the 1<sup>st</sup> h was characterized by the different mode of administration. BIS dropped immediately after flunitrazepam administration (median 5.75/min). BIS decreased slowly within the 1<sup>st</sup> h after the start of propofol injection (median 0.87/min). These differences were not reflected in the patients&#x02019; assessments. Both groups assessed their quality of falling asleep similarly (median 2). This is probably the result of patients&#x02019; comparison with often experienced naturally occurring quality of falling asleep at home without medical intervention. Thus, both drugs are assessed as inducing a good quality of falling asleep despite different BIS reactions.</p><p>After the 1<sup>st</sup> h of the study period median BIS values were significantly lower for propofol. Nevertheless, for every individual very different BIS development and a distinct variability was observed which was not typical for pure &#x0201c;sedation-curves&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. After classification of BIS values to sleep stages[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] patients spent a longer time in slow-wave sleep (NREM stages 3 and 4) under propofol administration. BIS values had to be allocated predominantly to light sleep/REM sleep after application of flunitrazepam. These findings equate to the already known changes in sleep structure after benzodiazepines[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and under Propofol.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus it could be hypothesized that sleep in Pg was dominated by slow-wave sleep and in Fg by light sleep. Naturally, occurring sleep is also characterized by awakenings. Similar to the results of the sleep diary analysis of BIS data revealed a reduced frequency of awakenings in Pg that also correlated well with sleep quality.</p><p>However, results of BIS analysis should be interpreted carefully. Haenggi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and other study groups revealed that the BIS reaction to different sedation depths depends on the hypnotics used and shows vast variability.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>All in all, administration of propofol resulted in decreased BIS values and possibly in a lower frequency of awakenings and arousals as well as an increase in deep sleep compared to sleep after flunitrazepam injection.</p><p>Besides different pharmacokinetics of the drugs used in this study some additional limitations have to be mentioned. The overall effect of internal and external influences such as noise, light or the placebo-effect could not be definitively detected. Further studies using polysomnography and a control group (placebo) should be carried out to clarify possible differences in sleep architecture and awakenings in correlation with sleep quality under sedation with the known drugs. In addition, registrations of disruptive factors have to be correlated to awakenings to rule out environmental factors. Several studies demonstrated that awakenings on ICU could partly be explained by ambient noise.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, Propofol improved the overall quality of night sleep in ICU patients who were not analgo-sedated or mechanically ventilated compared with flunitrazepam. The observed differences were more likely realized by sleep structural changes than by increasing sleep duration. We found that propofol possibly led to a decreased frequency of awakening and deeper sleep stages. Sleep quality correlated well with the frequency of awakenings in Pg and with sleep duration in Fg. The differences could not be clearly elucidated due to limitations of BIS for assessment of sleep.</p><p>These study results should not lead to an uncritical use of propofol for artificial sleep induction as these results refer to a post-operative care population that cannot be extrapolated to ICU patients in general. Furthermore, hypnotics are known, although not observed in this trial, to cause several harmful side-effects which must be avoided. The risk for potential consequences like bronchial aspiration or cardiovascular events is not well-investigated. However, propofol can be an option for ICU-patients who are threatened by complications of sleep deprivation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was supported by departmental funds</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name><name><surname>Gazendam</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Levan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pack</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwab</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Abnormal sleep/wake cycles and the effect of environmental noise on sleep disruption in the intensive care unit</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>163</volume><fpage>451</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11179121</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gabor</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanly</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sleep disruption in the intensive care unit</article-title><source>Curr Opin Crit Care</source><year>2001</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11373507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ozt&#x000fc;rk</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelin</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Karadeniz</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaynak</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cakar</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000f6;z&#x000fc;kirmizi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of 48 hours sleep deprivation on human immune profile</article-title><source>Sleep Res Online</source><year>1999</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>107</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11382891</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonnet</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Kryger</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dement</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sleep deprivation</article-title><source>Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine</source><year>1994</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.B.
