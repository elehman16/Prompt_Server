Thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) is currently used frequently by doctors and radiologists in order to categorize thoracolumbar fractures to devise an appropriate therapeutic strategy.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Based on previous evidences, the current system of categorization has an appropriate level of reliability and validity to classify thoracolumbar fractures and take appropriate therapeutic measures against them.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The following 4 parameters are used to categorize thoracolumbar fractures: morphology, neurological status, spinal cord/conus medullaris injury, and posterior ligamentous complex. Morphology is used to determine type of fracture, while other factors are utilized to diagnose existence of fracture and its level. Based on each patient's conditions and the diagnostic measures taken, a score will be given to each item and the overall score is used to determine the proper therapeutic method for each patient. The maximum score in this classification is 10 and the following measures are defined for each score: nonoperative treatments for scores &#x02264; 3, operation for scores &#x02265;5, and operative or nonoperative treatments for a score of 4.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Open fixation, internal fixation, and spondylosis as operative treatments help correct deformity, early mobilization, reduce reliability to aid devices and prevent spinal column malalignment or delayed neurological damages.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Nonoperative treatment does not suffer from the side effects of this therapeutic procedure as there are no operative interventions.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>One of the problems with this categorization is the therapeutic measure needed to deal with patients with a score of 4. Although there are many researching pointing to the fact that both operative and nonoperative treatments of patients with thoracolumbar fractures have similar clinical consequences,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> some researches show that the consequences of patients with thoracolumbar fractures undergoing operative or nonoperative treatments are different in terms of certain clinical responses.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Siebenga et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> issued a report indicating that contrary to other clinical parameters, the frequency of post-treatment kyphosis in nonoperative group was significantly more than what was observed in operative group. The results of the research conducted by Denis<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> showed that contrary to operative treatment, return to work and neurological complications were significantly more among those patients with thoracolumbar fractures undergoing nonoperative treatment. Although TLICS is an acceptable criteria for taking therapeutic measures against patients suffering from thoracolumbar fractures,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> some researchers believe that it is necessary to conduct further research to compare patients&#x02019; outcome in both operative and nonoperative treatments so that the classification criteria may be improved and the most appropriate clinical measure can be taken against them.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Considering these explanations and shortage of proper researches on thoracolumbar fractures, the present research seeks to compare the operative and nonoperative methods.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The present research seeks to compare the outcomes of operative or nonoperative treatments in patients suffering from moderate thoracolumbar fractures with a score of 4 in TLICS categorization.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

The research was conducted in the neurosurgery ward of Vali Asr Hospital of Arak. A single randomized method based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria was defined to select patients. The patients suspected of thoracolumbar complications were initially examined through a detailed representation and clinical examination. Using standard imaging (including lateral graphy and AP focused on the area suspected of fracture and CT scan and MRI), thoracolumbar fractures were confirmed in these patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Utilizing TLICS categorization criteria, the patients were classified for proper therapeutic measures and, finally, only those patients who had gained a score of 4 in TLICS took part in the research. Having selected the patients and obtained their informed consent for participation in the research, the initial clinical and demographic information checklist was completed for each patient.</p><p>The following information was recorded in the checklist: age (years), gender, type of fracture (according to TLICS), neurological status (according to TLICS), spinal cord injury status (according to TLICS), posterior ligament injury status (according to TLICS), the number of fractured vertebra, and visual analog scale (VAS).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The patients were then randomly divided into 2 groups with the first group including 25 patients undergoing operative treatment and the second group including 25 people undergoing nonoperative treatments. Nonoperative treatment included resting in the bed for at least 5 days (depending upon the pain and the unstable level of fracture), standard physiotherapy, using brace and prohibition from heavy physical activities.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> It is noteworthy to mention that the quality and quantity of nonoperative treatments were determined with respect to neurosurgeon's idea and each patient's status. Considering the type of fracture and each patient's status, the proper operative treatment was chosen. The patients of both groups were matched in terms of trauma mechanism (accidents and falling from heights). Following the treatment, all patients were followed for 1 year. The following criteria were kept in mind while studying patients&#x02019; outcomes and following them: the length of hospitalization, length of absenteeism, returning to work prior to trauma, VAS criteria completion (this criteria was checked at the beginning of hospitalization and once every 3 months for 1 year, radiography (once every 3 months for 1 year), and VAS to measure pain levels (back pain in this case). This scale consists of a 10&#x0200a;cm ruler ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 presenting no pain and 10 indicating intolerable pain. The patients are asked to mark their pain level in this scale. The distance from 0 to the mark made on the ruler represents pain scale.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Types of outcome measures</title><p>Local sagittal angles (LSA) and regional sagittal angles (RSA) were measured to study Kyphosis deformity in the radiographies made from patients. LSA represents the angle between the upper and lower endplate of fractured vertebra. RSA shows the angle between the upper endplate of the vertebra above the fractured vertebra and the lower endplate of the vertebra under the fractured vertebra.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>It was the responsibility of the surgeon in charge of executing the research to diagnose fracture, select patients and prescribe operative treatment and nonoperative therapeutic recommendations and complete the checklist of patient's demographic and clinical information before and after operation.

This is a double blind, randomized clinical trial conducted on 50 patients suffering from thoracolumbar fracture with a score of 4 according to TLICS categorization. The patients were purely randomly divided into the operative and nonoperative treatment groups. No significant difference was observed among the patients with thoracolumbar fracture in terms of age between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;.05). The average age in both groups was 48 to 49 years old. A significant difference was observed among the patients with thoracolumbar fracture in terms of average pain score in the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th month following the operation between the 2 therapeutic groups and lower levels of pain score were reported in operative treatment group for all periods.

Of the whole 45 researches, 9 dealt with nonoperative treatment, 20 dealt with both operative and nonoperative treatments, and 16 dealt with operative treatment of patients. According to the results of clinical outcomes in patients with consecutive thoracolumbar fractures and without any neurological complications, no difference is seen between the group undergoing operative treatment and the other one undergoing nonoperative treatment. As most studies were conducted on patients without any neurological complications, it was impossible to compare operative and nonoperative treatments in patients suffering from neurological complications. According to the results achieved in this research, operative treatment was much better than its nonoperative counterpart. This difference can be attributed to the method of execution. Bakhsheshian et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> conducted a review research and studied each method separately, but the present research was a clinical trial where 2 methods were compared with one another. Gnanenthiran et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> carried out a meta-analysis to compare operative and nonoperative methods to treat consecutive thoracolumbar fractures. The following 5 characters were used as keywords to search for papers in PubMed and EMBASE: lumbar fractures, thoracic fractures, operative, and nonoperative. In the end, some 4 studies including 2 clinical trials were selected for further analysis. According to these studies, 79 patients in 2 groups (41 in operative treatment group and 38 in nonoperative treatment group) were examined. According to the results, there is no significant difference in terms of the frequency of patients who returned to work after trauma and treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.76). The rate of return to work was 70% for those undergoing operation, while this rate was 67% for nonoperative treatment group. Although the frequency of Kyphosis deformity in operative treatment group was significantly less than what was observed in nonoperative treatment group, the complications and costs in operative treatment group was significantly more than nonoperative group. Kyphosis degree also exhibited no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of pain (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.71).<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Less pain, earlier return to work, and less RSA angle were the advantages of operative method observed in this research. Different sample sizes may explain the difference between these 2 researches. The guideline used in nonoperative group was also different from the present research as physiotherapy is used in nonoperative method while there was no physiotherapy in the current research.</p><p>Siebenga et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> conducted a research on treating trauma-caused thoracolumbar fracture by comparing operative and nonoperative treatments with one another.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> As many as 34 patients were randomly divided into operative (18 patients) and nonoperative (16 patients) groups with due observation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients were studied for 4 years and their demographic factors, fracture categories, radiological assessments, and outcome of performance were studied. Of 34 patients, 32 completed the research. According to the final results, Kyphotic deformity in operative groups was significantly more than nonoperative group, although outcome parameters of patients such as returning to the previous job was significantly more in operative group. Higher pain scores were reported in operative group than its nonoperative counterpart. They declared that patients with thoracolumbar fractures who have no neurological complication can use nonoperative treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> However, the results achieved in our research found less pain, shorter period of return to work, and smaller RSA angle in operative treatment group. This difference is probably attributed to the relatively longer follow-up period in Siebenga et al's research<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and the greater sample size in each group in our research. Denis et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> conducted a research in order to compare operative and nonoperative treatments in patients with consecutive thoracolumbar fractures without neurological complications. 52 patients took part in this research. According to the results, all patients in operative group returned to their job after treatment, while 25% of nonoperative treatment did not. According to their results, 17% of the patients in nonoperative group got afflicted with neurological problems which were significantly more than operative group. Operative method yields better results. The results of that research are in line with the results achieved here.</p><p>In conclusion, lower levels of pain score were reported in operative treatment group. A significant difference was observed among the patients with thoracolumbar fracture in both therapeutic groups in terms of RSA angle in all times studied. The RSA angle among patients undergoing operative treatment was smaller. The average length of returning to work in operative treatment group was shorter than what was observed in nonoperative group. Less pain, shorter length of returning to work, and a smaller RSA angle were observed in operative therapeutic group. This method is recommended for patients without any neurological defects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: LSA = local sagittal angles, RSA = regional sagittal angles, <italic>TLICS =</italic> thoracolumbar injury classification and severity, VAS = vertebra and visual analog scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Author contributions: All authors took part in all stages of the study, from design to writing and editing the manuscript.
