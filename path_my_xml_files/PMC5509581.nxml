balance and fall risk in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-one subjects with
stroke were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups: the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group
(n=15) and the Treadmill group (n=16). The Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group performed conventional
physical therapy program with Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training for 30 minutes, five times a
week, for 8 weeks, while the Treadmill group conducted conventional physical therapy
programs and treadmill gait training for 30 minutes, five times a week, for 8 weeks.
[Results] After intervention, both groups showed a significant improvement in balance. A
significant greater balance improvement was found in the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group compared
to the Treadmill group. Also, a significant reduction in risk of fall was seen in both
group but this reduction was not significantly different between the two groups.
[Conclusion] Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training may be used to improve balance and reduce fall
risk in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>Fall risk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Survivors of stroke present with approximately twice the risk of falling than do
age-matched, healthy subjects<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Up to 76%
of survivors of a stroke have experienced at least one fall after being discharged from the
hospital, with approximately 55% of those falls resulting in injuries requiring medical
attention<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls are relatively common
among hospitalized patients and are a primary problem during stroke rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Previous reports have indicated that falls occur in approximately 23% to 50% of stroke
patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to previous reports, balance is a chief factor in preventing falls and balance
training has been reported to have positive effects in reducing falls in the elderly or
stroke patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, physical and
occupational therapists have used various methods to improve balance function in stroke
patients, such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), the Bobath concept,
robot-assisted device training, under water exercise training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and virtual reality training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that only resistance training or special
exercise can improve gait ability; however, these methods are not effective in improving
balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, specialized and expensive equipment or additional
therapists with training must be constantly available for patients who require improvements
to their balance ability.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that vestibular exercise, as a new stroke rehabilitation
method, can improve balance ability and prevent falls<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since traditional exercises can be mundane to chronic stroke
patients, this exercise can be a good therapeutic motivation. Previous research has shown
that specialized vestibular exercise is effective in decreasing neglect symptom as well as
improving activity of daily living (ADL) abilities and balance ability in stroke patients
experiencing right hemiparesis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has been used to improve physical condition, sensory
system, and balance ability in elderly people in Europe and it is used as a form of stroke
and post-operation rehabilitation in Germany and other countries<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> company provides several types of
equipment that can be used to train balance and gait in younger and elderly people. Among
them, the Stabilize-T can be trained to improve balance. The Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> exercise
provides vestibular training to people who use the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tools. Furthermore,
vestibular sensory integration exercise is effective for improving balance ability in
cerebral palsy patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently,
there are no studies on the effects of the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> exercise on the balance
ability and fall risk of stroke patients.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> exercise on
balance ability and fall risk in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-one patients with hemiparetic stroke were recruited from a rehabilitation hospital
located in the Incheon province of South Korea. We enrolled subjects who were diagnosed with
first onset of unilateral hemisphere stroke more than 6 months previously, could walk for
more than 30 seconds (regardless of using an assistive device), and had a mini-mental state
examination Korean version (MMSE-K) score greater than 24. After the subjects were informed
about the study, they agreed to participate and signed consent forms. 31 stroke patients
were randomly assigned into the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group (n=15) and the Treadmill group
(n=16) under blinded-condition. All experimental procedures were approved by a Gachon
University review board.</p><p>The Stabilize T (Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) provides patients with balance problems and forces
them to exert effort to return to a stabilized position. Stabilizer T is a piece of
equipment that trains an individual to improve sensory control of their posture and movement
as well as reaction and stabilization of their loco-motor system. Through the movement
limiter, the area of movement and the speed of swaying can be adjusted individually. The
Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-Stabilizer is most appropriate in patients with neurological
deficiencies and in senior citizens who are undergoing training to improve balance and
steadiness as well as fall prevention. The platform can either be mounted on springs
(three-dimensional effect) or suspended from ropes (two-dimensional effect)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise methods: 1. Subjects were asked
to look straight ahead while standing with knee slightly bent. They were then asked to close
their eyes for 15 seconds, subsequently open their eyes for 10 seconds, then maintain their
balance for 30 seconds. 2. Subjects were asked to look straight ahead while standing with
knee slightly bent. They were then asked to open their arms and slowly rotate neck to the
left, center, right for 30 seconds each, and maintain their balance for 30 seconds. 3.
Subjects were asked to look straight ahead while standing with knee slightly bent. They were
then asked to open their arms and extend their neck for 10 seconds. Subjects were asked to
repeat the neck extension 3 times and afterward they maintain their balance for 30 seconds.
The number one is the easiest difficulty level and the three is the hardest. We applied one
of these methods to the patients considering of their ability. These exercise methods were
provided by the Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> company.</p><p>The Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group underwent a conventional physical therapy program plus
Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training while the Treadmill group underwent treadmill gait training
and conventional physical therapy programs. The Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tools (stabilizer T) were
used in this study. Both groups underwent exercise for 30 minutes, 5 times a week for 8
weeks.</p><p>A Biodex Balance system (BBS, Biodex Medical System, Inc., USA) was used to measure balance
ability and fall risk. This machine is designed to assess postural balance function on a
static or dynamic surface. The BBS consisted of a circular platform that was free to move in
the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes simultaneously, while being able to control
the degree of movement on the platform within 12 levels. The BBS device interfaces with
dedicated software (Biodex, Version 1.08, Biodex, Inc.), thereby allowing it to measure the
degree of tilt in each axis and provides an average sway score. Eight springs located
underneath the outer edge of the platform provided resistance to movement (stability level
of the platform). The resistance levels ranged from 8 (most stable) to 1 (least stable)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects stood on the BBS surface on their both legs and stared at the display all time
trials. Test was performed for 20 seconds without brace or shoes, and the changes of center
of gravity were measured using coordination in the platform&#x02019;s grid. Three trials were
conducted for each trial for 20 seconds, which was followed by a 10&#x02005;min break. This was
repeated three times. From these repetitions, we calculated and averaged the mean value.</p><p>And, we measured fall risk in subjects while they stood on an unstable platform as it
moved. BBS permits obtain the fall risk index using with standard software configuration.
The platform was moved for five seconds over six levels of increasing instability. Once
reaching level 2, each level continued for 20 seconds, which was followed by a 10 minute
break. This was repeated three times. We calculated the mean value of these repetitions.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training on each variable, pre-treatment
and post-treatment scores were statistically compared using paired t-tests. In all analyses,
p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Common and clinical characteristics of the subjects (N=31)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treadmill group (n=16)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion side</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion type</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.6 &#x000b1; 17.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.4 &#x000b1; 12.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.5 &#x000b1; 5.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.8 &#x000b1; 6.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.5 &#x000b1; 9.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.1 &#x000b1; 10.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> shows a list of the general characteristics of subjects.

In doing so, we found that balance ability and fall risk significantly improved compared
with those in the Treadmill group. According to a previous study, Lee et al. reported that,
after applying Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training to patients who experienced stroke greater than
six months previously, static balance and dynamic balance, which were measured using BBS and
Time Up to Go (TUG), significantly improved. They showed that Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> training
was effective in improving balance ability; however, they did not compare the outcomes in
stroke patients to those in the Treadmill group. This study used an objective measuring
machine to compare BBS and Time Up to Go (TUG) test.</p><p>Jung et al. separated 20 stroke patients into an experimental group and control group and
provided treadmill training to the control group and vestibular stimulation training to the
experimental group<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In doing so, they
showed that the BBS, which was determined using the biodex balance evaluation system, and
the TUG test were significantly improved in the experimental group compared with the control
group, with the exception of the static gait index.</p><p>An Bogaerts reported that the 1&#x02005;year whole-body vibration exercise was effective in
improving balance control ability in elderly people between 60 to 80&#x02005;years of age<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, Hiroshige K et al. found that
the whole-body vibration exercise was more effective in balance control ability in older
people<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The stabilizer T that was used in this study allowed subjects to participate in postural
maintenance training. Furthermore, eye open-close, neck rotation forward, and backward
bending motion are the methods of training used by Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> to stimulate the
vestibular system so that training using Stabilize T improved balance ability and decreased
fall risk.</p><p>The current study assessed the effectiveness of training using Pedalo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on
balance and fall risk in stroke patients. However, there are also some limitations to this
study. The subjects were of a different gender, age, height, and weight, and each subject
did not have the same level of balance ability; however, the same Stabilize T and method
were used for all subjects. For this reason, some subjects had trouble in training using
this method, which should be addressed in future studies.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors in this study declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Engstad</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Higher incidence of falls in long-term stroke survivors
