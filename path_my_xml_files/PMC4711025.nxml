There is conflicting evidence that the combined application of both interventions is better than either LLINs or IRS used alone. This trial aims to investigate whether the combination of LLINs (PermaNet 2.0, Vestergaard Frandsen, Lausanne, Switzerland) with IRS using propoxur will enhance the protective benefits and cost-effectiveness of the interventions against malaria and its effect on mosquito behavior, as compared to each intervention alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This 2 x 2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial is being carried out in the Adami Tullu district in south-central Ethiopia for about 116&#x000a0;weeks from September 2014 to December 2016. The trial is based on four arms: LLINs + IRS, LLINs alone, IRS alone and control. Villages (or clusters) will be the unit of randomization. The sample size includes 44 clusters per arm, with each cluster comprised of approximately 35 households (about 175 people). Prior to intervention, all households in the LLINs + IRS and LLINs alone arms will be provided with LLINs free of charge. Households in the LLINs + IRS and IRS alone arms will be sprayed with carbamate propoxur once a year just before the main malaria transmission season throughout the investigation. The primary outcome of this trial will be a malaria incidence based on the results of the rapid diagnostic tests in patients with a fever or history of fever attending health posts by passive case detection. Community-based surveys will be conducted each year to assess anemia among children 5&#x02013;59 months old. In addition, community-based malaria prevalence surveys will be conducted each year on a representative sample of households during the main transmission season. The cost-effectiveness of the interventions and entomological studies will be simultaneously conducted. Analysis will be based on an intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial aims to provide evidence on the combined use of LLINs and IRS for malaria prevention by answering the following research questions: Can the combined use of LLINs and IRS significantly reduce the incidence of malaria compared with the use of either LLINs or IRS alone? And is the reduced incidence justifiable compared to the added costs? Will the combined use of LLINs and IRS reduce vector density, infection, longevity and the entomological inoculation rate? These data are crucial in order to maximize the impact of vector control interventions on the morbidity and mortality of malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?dar=true&#x00026;tNo=PACTR201411000882128">PACTR201411000882128</ext-link> (8 September 2014).&#x000a0;</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cluster randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Incidence</kwd><kwd>Indoor residual spraying</kwd><kwd>Long-lasting insecticidal nets</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Prevention and control</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Despite remarkable achievements in the fight against malaria over the last decade, there is still an unacceptably high level of malaria burden worldwide. In 2013, there were an estimated 198 million cases and 584,000 deaths, of which 80&#x000a0;% of the cases and 90&#x000a0;% of the deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the universal coverage of the population at risk with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and targeted indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] for the control and ultimate elimination of malaria. In addition, IRS has been recommended to be scaled-up for malaria control across the different malaria endemicities including high transmission settings in SSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This has brought a significant shift from past practices in which IRS was limited for the prevention and control of malaria epidemics, particularly in unstable and seasonal malaria settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Both LLINs and IRS have been shown to be effective in reducing malaria transmission when applied independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, both interventions are widely applied for malaria prevention in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Of the 45 countries in Africa with ongoing malaria transmission, 38 adopted both the WHO&#x02019;s policy of universal coverage with LLINs to populations at risk and IRS with insecticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In an effort to accelerate the control and ultimate elimination of malaria, IRS in combination with LLINs has also been deployed in the same geographical areas in 31 African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The available evidence suggests that the joint intervention of the LLINs and IRS should be scaled up and that the combined effect of these interventions should be further evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite an increasing interest in the simultaneous use of both interventions, there are currently no clear guidelines on how these interventions should be combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. At the same time, there is also a paucity of evidence as to whether their combined use is more effective in reducing the incidence of malaria than using either intervention alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is poorly understood how the interventions interact to improve malaria control. A few non-randomized observational studies and mathematical modelling exercises suggest a modest effectiveness, or conflicting results, when combining interventions for malaria reduction compared to either intervention alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Evidence on the effect of the combined use of LLINs and IRS from community-based field trials is conflicting. Consequently, it is difficult to draw any conclusions on whether the combination of IRS and LLINs is beneficial against malaria compared to one of the interventions alone. A recent review indicated that only one of the four published randomized controlled trials showed additional protection against fighting malaria when the use of LLINs was combined with IRS, compared to either method alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A multi-intervention trial in Benin showed no significant reduction in clinical malaria in children under 5&#x000a0;years of age from houses sprayed with bendiocarb in combination with LLINs, compared to children in houses with LLINs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, in The Gambia a combination of IRS using dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and universal coverage of LLINs showed no added protection against malaria among children of 6&#x000a0;months to 14&#x000a0;years compared to the universal coverage of LLINs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. By contrast, a recent cluster randomized controlled trial in Tanzania, where the usage of LLINs was less than 50&#x000a0;%, reported some evidence of added protection against malaria infection in children 6&#x000a0;months to 14&#x000a0;years from the combining of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and IRS with bendiocarb compared to ITNs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lines and Kleinschmidt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] recently discussed the design issues in conducting studies involving the combination of malaria vector control interventions and recommended further evidence from well-designed trials.</p><p>Good evidence on the effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of malaria interventions will provide important information for decision-making in policy formulation, the revision of existing policy and/or the selection of optimal packages of interventions. Since the cost of both LLINs and IRS is greater than the cost of either intervention alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], it is important to estimate and evaluate whether the potential extra protection gained by combining both interventions represents good value compared with the added costs. This is particularly important in countries in SSA, where a scarcity of resources is the main impediment to malaria control. A recent review of the evidence of the costs and consequences of large-scale vector control for malaria concluded that both LLINs and IRS are highly cost-effective vector control strategies even though the former method has been identified as more cost-effective than the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Malaria is a major public health problem in Ethiopia with approximately 65&#x000a0;% of its 90 million population living in areas at risk of malaria infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Mainly due to altitudinal and climatic features in most parts of the country, malaria transmission is seasonal and epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The most important malarial parasites in the country are <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (60&#x000a0;%) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (40&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> is considered the main malaria vector in the country, with <italic>An. pharoensis</italic> being a secondary vector.</p><p>The National Strategic Plan for malaria prevention and control in Ethiopia aims at scaling up and sustaining both LLINs and IRS interventions in malaria endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. LLINs and IRS are applied either separately or in combination, and during the period from 2005&#x02013;2011, more than 43 million LLINs were freely distributed to all households in malarious areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS), conducted in 2007 and 2011, revealed that 65&#x000a0;% and 55&#x000a0;% of surveyed households had at least one LLIN, respectively, whereas the reported use by children under 5&#x000a0;years of age, during the night prior to the survey, within households with at least one net ranged from 60&#x000a0;% in 2007 to 65&#x000a0;% in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In Ethiopia, the increased resistance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine necessitated a change as the first-line antimalarial drug for the treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Consequently, artemether-lumefantrine (AL, Coartem&#x000ae;, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) has been used as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection since 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Several studies have shown that AL remains highly efficacious against the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria and with no report of adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Several studies from Ethiopia have shown a high insecticide resistance in malaria mosquitoes, especially in relation to DDT, malathion, permethrin and deltamethrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. DDT was the primary insecticide of choice for IRS in the country for a long time until it was replaced by deltamethrin in 2009. Unfortunately, resistance to deltamethrin was reported to be very high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As a result, the National Malaria Control Program has adopted the use of bendiocarb and propoxur insecticides belonging to the carbamate family since 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Currently, bendiocarb and propoxur are the primary insecticides of choice for IRS in Ethiopia. Bendiocarb and propoxur are carbamate insecticides evaluated and approved by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme, both of which have the potential to control pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to investigate the effect of combining LLINs and IRS with propoxur for the incidence of clinical malaria and the cost-effectiveness of the interventions against malaria and their effect on mosquito behavior, as compared to each intervention alone. The overall aim is to provide information for national and global policy-makers in their pursuit of improving malaria control by evaluating resource demands and the combined effect of both interventions on malaria. This protocol discusses the rationale for the choice of the interventions and describes the designs and methodological approaches being used to determine the effect of each intervention, in addition to evaluating the effect of the interventions.</p><p>A 2 x 2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial was chosen to exploit the robustness of this design to help ascertain the efficacy of the combined interventions compared to either interventions alone and the standard routine practice. This protocol was developed according to the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement extension for cluster randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The scientific value of the inclusion of the control group in this trial was also extensively debated, as it was believed that this arm allows a more reliable comparison between the groups: LLINs + IRS versus LLINs alone or control, LLINs + IRS versus IRS alone and LLINs alone versus IRS alone or control. This is the most robust design in regard to cluster randomized trials to help ascertain the efficacy of the interventions. This study design is also believed to make the results more generalizable and applicable in resource-constrained countries.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of this intervention study is to determine whether the combined use of LLINs and IRS with propoxur provides additional protection against malaria (<italic>P. falciparum</italic> and/or <italic>P. vivax</italic>) among all age groups in the study area compared to LLINs or IRS alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>In the same study population, the secondary objectives of the trial are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Estimate the costs of LLINs + IRS, LLINs or IRS alone compared to the current routine practice, and to evaluate the incremental costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assess whether LLINs + IRS reduce entomological parameters, i.e., human biting rates, mosquito resting density, longevity, sporozoite rates, and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) inside houses compared with LLINs or IRS alone</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine whether LLINs + IRS improves the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and reduces anemia among children under 5&#x000a0;years of age compared with children in LLINs or IRS alone</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study is being carried out in the Adami Tullu part of the Adami Tullu-Jiddo-Kombolcha <italic>woreda</italic> (hereafter referred to as the Adami Tullu district) in the East Shewa Zone of the Oromia Regional State in Ethiopia. The <italic>woreda</italic> (or district) is a local administrative unit in the country, followed by <italic>kebeles</italic> (the lowest government administrative unit, which is further divided into <italic>gares</italic>, or villages). The capital of the district, Zeway (or Batu), has a latitude and longitude of 7&#x000b0;56&#x02032;N 38&#x000b0;42&#x02032;E with an elevation of 1640&#x000a0;m above sea level.

The main ethnic group is the Oromo, and the predominant religion is Islam. The majority of the population live in rural areas in houses made with mud or cement walls and thatched or iron roofs. Local residents primarily depend on farming, livestock rearing, and to a lesser extent on fishing in Lake Zeway for their subsistence. In 2014, there were one public and one non-governmental organization hospital, nine public health centers and 43 health posts in the district.

Each <italic>kebele</italic> is intended to have at least one health post staffed by two health extension workers (HEWs) reporting to the health center.</p><p>Malaria is a leading health problem in the district. Transmission is seasonal and unstable, with several recorded epidemics of varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The main malaria transmission season occurs between September and December each year following the heavy rainfall between July and August, whereas the smaller peak occurs during May and June each year following small rains during March and April.

While the study is done in Ethiopia, randomization was done in Bergen in Norway. This was done to prevent selection bias by concealing the allocation sequence from the field researchers assigning villages to the four intervention groups until the moment of assignment. Thus, a researcher not involved in the study randomly allocated a random number from a random number table that was used as the seed for the computer-generated list of villages using SPSS software. The random selection of households for the entomological sampling was done in a similar way.</p><p>Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding of the study participants will not be possible, while observer bias will be reduced wherever possible. Microscopists shall read blood films blinded to the identity and intervention status of the subjects. By using standard light traps and exit traps, we shall reduce the mosquito collector bias. Moreover, the entomologists in our research group will examine the trap catches, which are different from the trap collectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)</title><p>The LLINs distributed for this trial were PermaNet 2.0 rectangular, 100 denier, light blue, family size (160&#x000a0;cm width x 180&#x000a0;cm length x 150&#x000a0;cm height) purchased in June 2014 from the Vestergaard Frandsen Group SA (Vestergaard Frandsen, Lausanne, Switzerland). The PermaNet 2.0 net is a factory-treated mosquito net manufactured with deltamethrin, which is expected to retain its biological efficacy for a minimum of 20 standard WHO washes or approximately 3&#x000a0;years under field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>MalTrials</italic> project bought a total of 10,000 PermaNet 2.0 LLINs for this trial. The nets were imported and arrived in the study site on 16 September 2014, and distributed to study households from 1 to 5 October 2014. All households in the LLINs + IRS and LLINs alone arms received new LLINs free of charge at the beginning of the intervention regardless of the previous ownership, with householders maintaining their existing nets at the time of distribution. The number of new LLINs distributed to each household was based on the household size recommended by the national malaria guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], i.e., one net for a family of 1&#x02013;2, two nets for a family of 3&#x02013;5, three nets for a family of 6&#x02013;7 and four nets for a family of 8 or more people.</p><p>In advance of the LLINs distribution, all village residents were made aware of the distribution of the nets through house-to-house visits, village leaders and community elders. The net distribution was done in the center of the village based on a pre-determined registration list of households in each village by the <italic>MalTrials</italic> project personnel in collaboration with the district and village health workers. Households who did not receive the nets during the distribution schedule were identified and received their nets later.

A 6-day training on spraying operation will also be given for locally recruited spray men and supervisors. The spraying teams will be organized by squads of four spray personnel and a porter, and supervised by a squad leader. The DHO malaria focal persons and HEWs will be used to organize, follow-up, and supervise the daily activity of spray teams, and a spray equipment and personnel protective clothing will be obtained from the DHO.</p><p>Approximately 12 houses will be sprayed by each spray operator per day using an 8-liter Hudson X-pert (HD Hudson Manufacturing Company, Chicago, IL, USA). Prior to spraying, a community sensitization will be performed to inform residents in regard to the safety, purpose and time of spraying. On the day of the IRS operation, all targeted households will be informed about the schedule, purpose and requirements of the spraying. The householders will be requested to prepare and vacate the house before spraying, and household items such as water, food and cooking utensils will be removed from the house. Household members will be allowed to enter the sprayed house after 30&#x000a0;minutes, and be requested to clean the floor and bury or burn the dirt. The householders will also be requested not to wash, paint or re-plaster the sprayed walls until at least the end of the main transmission season.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary health outcome measure is malaria incidence determined by the detection of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> or <italic>P. vivax</italic> by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in patients with a fever or having a history of fever within the previous 48&#x000a0;hours upon arrival at health posts by passive case detection (PCD).

Using a baseline malaria incidence rate of 7.85 per 10,000 person-weeks and the coefficient of variation between clusters within each group,&#x000a0;we used <italic>k</italic> = 0.27 in the sample size estimation (<italic>MalTrials</italic> unpublished pilot data). Thirty-five households (approximately 175 people) per cluster will be followed up for 116&#x000a0;weeks, with 44 clusters achieving a 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a 25&#x000a0;% reduction in the malaria incidence rate in the LLINs + IRS arm compared to LLINs alone or the IRS only arm, using a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level. We plan to follow approximately 1540 households with an estimated 7800 people in each arm of the trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Overall, the trial will cover over 31,000 people from approximately 6100 households. The proposed sample size is also assumed to suffice in terms of having the power to detect a mean reduction between the study arms of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/ml Hb concentration in children under 5&#x000a0;years of age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>The sample size calculated for malaria incidence is also assumed to suffice for the economic evaluation of the cost of interventions.

In a West African study with a 90&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% significance level, it was advised to sample eight houses from each of 15 clusters of the study arms, but the mosquito density was lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. A total of 16 villages (four per arm) will be randomly selected for entomological study, in which indoor host-seeking mosquitoes will be collected by CDC light traps from four houses per arm, indoor resting mosquitoes from 16 houses per arm using pyrethrum spray collection and outdoor resting mosquitoes from four artificial pit shelters per arm of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Each household will receive a specific identification (ID) number tagged onto a colored metal plate placed on the upper front door of the house. Each inhabitant in the household will also receive a unique personal, three-digit ID number (village number/household number/person number). The latitude and longitude of each household will be recorded using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) device. The GPS data will be downloaded to a computer for the creation of maps of the study villages and for a spatial analysis of epidemiological, entomological and economic data. Guidelines for the data collections will be developed during the pilot studies. All questionnaires and forms will be initially prepared in English and translated into a local language for data collection.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Epidemiological data collections</title><p>PCD of malaria cases at the health posts will be carried out throughout the trial using RDTs, and thin and thick blood smears for microscopic examination. We will recruit 24 data collectors (two data collectors per <italic>kebele</italic>) for a weekly household visit, 14 nurses (one nurse per <italic>kebele</italic>) for malaria diagnosis and treatment at the health posts and three field supervisors. Data collectors will be trained on questionnaire specifics, interviewing techniques and household visits. They will visit households weekly to help identify residents with fever, or a history of fever in the last 48&#x000a0;hours, to refer to the health posts and track information on LLINs&#x02019; use by household members during the night before the survey.</p><p>The research team and supervisors will make regular field visits for quality control of the work done at health posts. Each field supervisor will be responsible for 59 clusters, and will meet with data collectors and health workers at the health posts at least once a week. During these visits supervisors will check patient registration books, malaria surveillance forms and the availability of antimalarial commodities, and collect completed forms and blood slides and bring them back to the project&#x02019;s office. Throughout the study period, all health posts that participate in the trial will be provided with multispecies and mixed infection-detecting RDTs, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chloroquine obtained from the Oromia Regional Health Bureau (ORHB). The RDT that will be provided is the CareStart&#x000ae; Malaria <italic>Pf/Pv</italic> combo test (Access Bio, Inc., Somerset, NJ, USA), which is individually packaged with an alcohol swab, lancet, capillary tube, buffer and test device.</p><p>Through weekly household visits, study participants with a fever or having a history of fever within the past 48&#x000a0;hours, will be encouraged to present to the health posts. Residents will be advised to visit the health posts whenever they develop a fever. They will be asked to show a household card whenever visiting a health post. For individuals without a household card, health workers will use other information that allows them to locate the household and its number. Individuals who are found to be positive for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> by RDT will be given AL twice a day for 3&#x000a0;days based on body weight according to national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. AL is a fixed dose combination of 20&#x000a0;mg artemether plus 120&#x000a0;mg of lumefantrine. <italic>P. vivax</italic> positive individuals will be treated with chloroquine, 25&#x000a0;mg/kg for 3&#x000a0;days (10&#x000a0;mg base per kg on days 1 and 2, and 5&#x000a0;mg base per kg on day 3). Treatment of other conditions will be done in accordance with the national guidelines or a referral to higher level health facilities. Patients with severe illness at the time of visit (from malaria or other causes) will be referred to the nearest health facility. Any person from the study villages treated for malaria at a health center or hospital will also be included in the study.</p><p>Thin films of blood slides will be fixed with methanol for 30&#x000a0;seconds. Both thin and thick films will be stained with 3&#x000a0;% Giemsa for 20&#x02013;30 minutes by experienced laboratory technicians in accordance with the standard malaria laboratory procedures. A thick blood smear will be declared negative with a minimum of 100 high power fields by microscopic examination, while the thin film will be examined to identify the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species for positive slides. A second reading for all positive and negative slides will be performed by an experienced laboratory technologist and any discordant results will be resolved by a third reader. All blood slide readers will be blinded to the different arms of the trial and to the diagnosis of preceding readers.</p><p>At the end of the main malaria transmission season each year, the Hb concentration will be assessed in children 6&#x02013;59 months old for assessing the prevalence of anemia using a portable photometer (HaemoCue&#x000ae;, &#x000c5;ngelholm, Sweden) in the field. Through house-to-house visits, a single finger-prick sample will be taken from each child, and children&#x02019;s height and weight will also be measured. A Hb cut-off point of less than 11.0&#x000a0;g/dl will be used to decide whether a child has anemia, and will be further classified into mild, moderate and severe anemia.</p><p>Community-based malaria prevalence surveys will be conducted on a representative sample of households from each arm of the trial during the main transmission season (September to November) each year among all age groups. All household members will be eligible to be included in the study. Allowing for ineligible households, absence on the day of the survey and refusals at the household and individual level, approximately 5500 individuals from 1100 households will be estimated to be included in the study. This would provide an average 275 households from each arm of the trial to be included in the study. The households will be randomly selected from the total list of households in all arms of the trial. The heads of the households or their representatives will be interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Voluntary individuals will be tested for malaria parasites using RDTs.

The main cost outcome measure will be the total costs of interventions, including all resources used to deliver the interventions and recurrent costs such as personnel, supplies and materials, the operation and maintenance of buildings, utilities and communication costs, in addition to capital costs such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles. The costing of the intervention will be done from the provider&#x02019;s perspective using a standard malaria costing tool developed by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The economic evaluation of health outcomes will be evaluated by the number of malaria cases averted and DALYs gained as a result of the interventions using incidence data. The number of deaths averted due to the interventions will be calculated based on the case fatality rates of malaria.</p><p>Economic evaluation, cost-effectiveness/utility analysis, presenting cost per malaria case prevented and costs per DALY averted will all be employed. The DALYs will incorporate both morbidity estimates from malaria episodes and anemia among children. We will develop a Markov life cycle model to account for the recurrent nature of malaria disease, with a varying amount of risk for repeated episodes during different seasons of the year. The cost of illness study will be conducted in the same district from non-trial villages to account for saved disease treatment costs. Epidemiological and effectiveness parameters will be based on the findings of this research project, while the clinical course of the diseases will be based on a review of the best available literature. Standard DALY weights will be utilized. Moreover, this trial will incorporate an evaluation of the distributional impact of the interventions using inequality analysis techniques and a decomposition of the inequality into various socioeconomic factors using an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA). In the ECEA, we will estimate the benefit of the interventions across different levels of income group in terms of the number of deaths prevented, the net financial risk protection provided, the out-of-pocket expenditure averted and the number of poverty cases prevented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Entomological data collections</title><p>The results of trials from countries where <italic>An. gambiae</italic> s.s. is the dominant vector might not be fully applicable in countries such as Ethiopia, where <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> is the main vector. The latter vector is less affected by mosquito nets, and is more exophilic and less anthropophilic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Estimating the human biting rate (HBR) of mosquitoes is important for a risk assessment of malaria transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps, used in many studies, are only a proxy measure to estimate HBR. Human landing catches (HLC) are a more direct way to estimate HBR, and are often considered the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].

Since HLC cannot be used for community-wide mosquito collections due to ethical and logistical drawbacks, CDC light trap collections will be calibrated with HLC locally in order to estimate an operational conversion factor for calculating the HBR and EIRs. Mosquito collections will be carried out during the malaria transmission season following interventions.</p><p>The CDC light traps, pyrethrum spray sheet catches and artificial pit shelters will be employed to collect mosquitoes and assess their biting behavior, indoor and outdoor resting densities. Houses will be randomly selected from a computer-generated list and the person will be blinded to the arms and houses. For CDC light traps and pyrethrum spray catches, the number of houses will be four and 16 from each arm, respectively, while four pit shelters in each arm will be constructed. Mosquitoes will be collected weekly from August to November each year, and will be identified to species using a morphological key [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

Permission through official letters was obtained from various administrative levels. Study communities were sensitized prior to randomization through meetings and discussions with community leaders, <italic>kebeles</italic> and village leaders and community elders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Information and informed consent</title><p>Verbal informed consent to participate in the study was obtained beforehand from the study participants and from parents/guardians for children under 18&#x000a0;years of age using the local <italic>Afan</italic> Oromo language. Information sheets were provided to inform about the purpose of the study, and the participants were informed that involvement in the study was voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time regardless of reason. At each data collection, the verbal consent of the study participants and verbal assent from the parents/guardians for children were obtained using the local language. Assurance was also given that a refusal to participate in this study would not affect their access to services at the health posts in the study villages in the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Adverse events and malaria treatment</title><p>We do not anticipate any physical harm or risks to the participants. Blood samples for RDTs, microscopic examination of slides and Hb measurements will be collected using aseptically disposable lancets. A finger-prick for blood sample collection may result in mild pain and bruising at the site where blood is obtained, but will not cause any further harm. The collection of blood samples from finger-pricks is part of the routine procedures in the diagnosis of malaria by health workers. Malaria treatment will be provided according to the national guidelines using AL and chloroquine, which are the first-line antimalarial treatments for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. All study participants visiting health posts will be examined and treated for malaria free of charge, while the mass distribution of LLINs and IRS spraying will be carried out by the <italic>MalTrials</italic> project for free in collaboration with the DHO. Mosquito collectors will be trained to collect mosquitoes as soon the mosquitoes land and before they bite. To help minimize risk, data collectors will be provided with an appropriate prophylactic drug (Malarone) before the collections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Confidentiality of information</title><p>To the best of our ability, all information from the study households and participants will be held in confidence and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the confidentiality of information both during and after data collection. Access to information will be limited to data collectors, including health workers and their supervisors at sites of collection, data entry clerks and to the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial oversight</title><p>There is no need for a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) for this trial since all interventions, blood sample collection and treatments are part of routine malaria control in Ethiopia and will be undertaken in collaboration with the health workers at the health posts and the DHO. We do not foresee any adverse effects from the interventions, so we do not intend to apply any stopping rules for this trial. No participant in the control group will be impeded from obtaining mosquito nets from other sources, and malaria incidence in the control villages will be monitored throughout the study for possible case build-up or an outbreak of malaria. If the control villages encounter any malaria outbreaks, an intervention will be taken by the <italic>MalTrials</italic> project and the DHO in accordance with the national guidelines regardless of the trial.</p><p>Deltamethrin-treated LLINs and propoxur IRS are WHO recommended and meet the specifications of the WHO&#x02019;s Pesticide Evaluation Scheme, and our interventions will follow the WHO and national recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The hazard which may be associated with this trial is that the insecticides used for the IRS could leak into the environment. Empty sachets, cartons, plastic bags, used gloves, pricking needles and other contaminated materials will be handled properly until they are finally burned. Lastly, all needle safety procedures will be in line with WHO standard.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Timelines of activities</title><p>The trial is being carried out for a period of approximately 116&#x000a0;weeks from September 2014 to December 2016, with Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> showing details of the timetable of activities.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Timetable of activities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Activity by year and month</th><th>J</th><th>F</th><th>M</th><th>A</th><th>M</th><th>J</th><th>J</th><th>A</th><th>S</th><th>O</th><th>N</th><th>D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2013</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Ethical approval</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Development of data collection tools</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Census and mapping</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Epidemiological pilot study</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Entomological pilot study</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Selection of clusters</td><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Randomization of study clusters</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Procurement of LLINs</td><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Procurement of insecticide</td><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Household numbering and tagging</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Baseline data collection</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;LLINs distribution</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Protocol registration</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;IRS spraying</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;LLINs distribution</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;PCD and weekly household visit</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Entomological surveys</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Cost data collection</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Anemia survey</td><td>x</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Malaria prevalence survey</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;PCD and weekly household visit</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Entomology lab assays and field surveys</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Cost data collection</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;IRS spraying and LLINs&#x02019;

It is well-accepted that decisions regarding malaria interventions should be based on robust evidence of the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Since the rollout of both interventions requires considerable resources, there is an urgent need to evaluate additional protective benefits and the cost-effectiveness of the combination of the interventions. This study aims to measure whether IRS in combination with LLINs increases protection against malaria incidence compared to the use of LLINs alone, IRS alone or current routine practices. The intervention will consist of four &#x0201c;arms&#x0201d;: LLINs + IRS, LLINs alone, IRS alone and control (routine practice).</p><p>The main outcome of the trial will be the assessment of the incidence of malaria using PCD at health posts. Our sample size is relatively large compared to other trials, e.g., a study in the Gambia used 35 clusters of 110 children in each of two arms to detect a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in the incidence of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Our preliminary sample size calculations based on malaria incidence rates in southern Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] showed that we might need to include 10 clusters per arm with approximately 50 households (250 persons) per cluster. However, a Cochrane review advocates large-sized clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Conducting research to evaluate the impact of community interventions raises a number of practical issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both LLINs and IRS interventions are implemented by the project, and we anticipate that the coverage of the interventions will be very high despite issues of net use and the re-plastering of sprayed walls of the houses. We understand that the recent relatively low incidence of malaria in the area will have an impact on the proper and consistent use of LLINs by the community, which may challenge an active participation by the community. We will monitor LLINs ownership and use by household members on a weekly basis, and we will also assess the magnitude of the re-plastering rates of houses and teach the community about its consequences on malaria.</p><p>Some of the strengths of our study are that we have carried out extensive pilot studies before starting the trial. This enabled us to estimate the variance in malaria incidence among the villages and thus the sample size. In the previous published trials, the IRS insecticide was bendiocarb which has a relatively short residual duration on the walls, or DDT, against which the insecticide resistance has become widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The current trial evaluates the added protection of propoxur, which has a relatively longer duration on walls compared to DDT. In addition, we also determined that the anopheline vectors in the study area are susceptible to propoxur. One of the limitations of this trial is that the communities will not be masked or blinded to the intervention. This would create a bias towards an increased effect of the combined intervention compared with other arms of the trial. This trial will not use a buffer zone between clusters of the different interventions as it will be carried out in rural areas with scattered households. As a result, the proximity of the clusters may influence the results. However, this applies to only some of the selected villages that are close to each other. As the positions of all households are recorded, we shall also try to adjust for possible close proximity of the villages during analysis.</p><p>The community in the &#x0201c;routine practice&#x0201d; with a weekly follow-up is in a better position than the community in the &#x0201c;routine practice&#x0201d; without any follow-up. Therefore, we decided to allow the trial with all four arms and emphasized that every participant will have access to weekly visits by the <italic>MalTrials</italic> project field personnel, early diagnosis and state of the art treatment for malaria. Adami Tullu was one of the 19 IRS targeted districts of the President&#x02019;s Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) between 2008 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. However, since 2014 the PMI has shifted its target areas to other districts in the Oromia Region. However, we will continuously monitor all groups including the control arm of the study if unforeseen malaria epidemics should arise.</p><p>This study is proposed at a time of significant need within the countries of SSA on how to effectively use IRS and LLINs interventions for malaria control and elimination. Consequently, the study is well-timed to assess whether the combination of LLINs and IRS could contribute towards the elimination of malaria. The trial addresses how to promote the uptake of research findings into public health programs by enhancing the knowledge base on interventions that will improve the effectiveness and coverage of anti-malaria interventions.</p><p>This study is expected to generate important evidence to inform the malaria control programs and the public regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two major vector control interventions. The costs of our intervention is similar to that of the existing malaria control program so that they can be easily accepted by the MOH. We anticipate that the findings of this study will be used for an effective planning and implementation of vector control interventions.</p><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of the submission of this manuscript, ethical approval has been obtained and the trial had completed a pilot study, baseline data collection and randomization, and is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AL</term><def><p>artemether-lumefantrine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>Center for Disease Prevention and Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DALYs</term><def><p>Disability-adjusted Life Years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DDT</term><def><p>dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHO</term><def><p>District Health Office</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p>Data Safety and Monitoring Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECEA</term><def><p>extended cost-effectiveness analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EIR</term><def><p>entomological inoculation rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>generalized estimating equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPS</term><def><p>Global Positioning System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p>hemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBI</term><def><p>Human Blood Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBR</term><def><p>human biting rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEW</term><def><p>health extension worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HLC</term><def><p>human landing catches</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>intra-cluster correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p>identification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRS</term><def><p>indoor residual spraying</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITNs</term><def><p>insecticide-treated nets</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLINs</term><def><p>long-lasting insecticidal nets</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOH</term><def><p>Ministry of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORHB</term><def><p>Oromia Regional Health Bureau</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCD</term><def><p>passive case detection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMI</term><def><p>President&#x02019;s Malaria Initiative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RDT</term><def><p>rapid diagnostic test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical Package for Social Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSA</term><def><p>sub-Saharan Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WP</term><def><p>water-dispersible powder</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WD, MB, BL and EL conceptualized the idea and drafted the initial protocol.
