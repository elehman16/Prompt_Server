However, ID delays or impairs children&#x02019;s mental and physical development, potentially leading to long-term adverse effect on human health. In China, the prevalence of ID was estimated to be 40% in children aged between 7 months and 7 years old based on a large epidemiologic investigation carried out from 2000 to 2001[<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There have been many efforts to fight ID and anemia over the past two decades, but in spite of these efforts the conditions are still common [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>ID tends to be aggravated by the insufficient intake of iron from daily diet [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The concentration of iron in human milk is relatively independent of maternal intake, therefore, older infants are mostly dependent on complementary foods to meet iron intake requirements [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, traditional feeding practices, including reliance on cereals and plant-based diets, cannot complement the requirement gap for iron in human milk [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Iron fortification food introduced to infants as a daily complementary food can be an effective strategy to increase iron stores and prevent ID [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a recent study reported that iron fortification was ineffective to improve iron status and anemia, while it is shown to be associated with increased gut inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Alternative to the plant-based complementary foods, meat is an excellent source of bioavailable iron, which may improve iron shortage in the diets of older infants and young children. However, randomized trials examining the effects of meat intake on iron status in infants are few [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], especially those initiated in 6-month-old infants [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, our objectives were to determine 1) the efficacy of complementary foods including iron-fortified cereal and meat, in improvement of iron status; 2) the effect of different complementary food choices on intestinal and systemic inflammation in a poor rural area setting. Our hypothesis was that the consumption of iron-fortified cereal or intake of meat would improve the biochemical iron status of healthy infants and young children.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a cross-sectional sub-sample nested within a larger intervention trial in which the effect of meat was evaluated as the primary complementary food on linear growth between 6&#x02013;18 months of age compared with equi-caloric quantities of rice cereal or of micronutrient-fortified rice cereal as controls [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>This cluster-randomized, non-masked, controlled efficacy trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167458.s001">S1 File</xref>) was conducted from March 2009 to December 2011 in a poor rural area, Xichou County located in Yunnan province of China [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the study region, various types of plant-based gruels made from cereal grains or starchy roots and tubers are common early complementary foods offered to infants. Xichou County has an average elevation of 1400 meters above sea level. The study included 60 villages (clustered) in 9 districts in Xichou County.</p><p>The specially trained community doctors in each of the small communities within each village were in charge of the intervention to participants. These doctors were also responsible for assessing compliance and morbidity. They reported to and collected fresh supply of intervention foods each week from the village hospitals, where weekly supplies of fresh frozen pork and cereal supplements from the Xichou Maternal and Child Health Service were distributed. The participants were seen by the assessment team at the nearest hospital at baseline and at 3-month intervals. In addition to anthropometric data, morbidity and dietary data were reported. The larger trial in which this study was nested was registered at clinical trials.gov as NCT00726102.</p><p>Eligibility criteria for infants included healthy singleton infants between 3&#x02013;5 months of age, born between 37 to 42 weeks gestational age, with birth weight &#x0003e;2 000 g, with no metabolic or physical problems, lack of acute or chronic illness, and being exclusively breastfed.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention meat of choice was selected as fresh pork in this population. Fresh certified-safe lean pork was purchased weekly, minced and accurately weighed into daily 50g aliquots containing 1 mg Fe in individual plastic bags, which were stored frozen until transported weekly to the district hospitals serving the meat villages. The community doctors serving the meat villages collected the required number of 50g aliquots of meat weekly from the district hospital. The meat was stored frozen by the community doctors in their own facilities and 50g servings were distributed every 2<sup>nd</sup> day to the participants&#x02019; homes. Meat was cooked by parents and fed to the infant. Participants in the meat group (MG) were encouraged to consume 50g meat (calories: 80 kcal) each day. If the days&#x02019; supply of cooked meat was not completely consumed in one serving, the mothers kept the remainder for a maximum of 2 h and fed again to their infants.</p><p>The quantity of cereal including fortified or local cereal is designed to be equi-caloric to the daily supply of pork. Commercial infant rice cereals (Nestle, fortified with iron, zinc and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) were bought. The chemical form of Fe and Zn in fortified cereal was ferrous fumarate and zinc sulfate. Participants in fortified cereal group (FG) were encouraged to consume 20g fortified rice cereal (calories: 80 kcal) each day. The iron content in the fortified rice cereal of 20g was 1.10 mg. Local rice cereal was made from a mixture of glutinous rice flour, white granulated sugar and honey. Participants in local cereal group (LG) were encouraged to consume 20g local rice cereal (calories: 80 kcal) each day. The iron content in the local rice cereal of 20g was 0.04mg. Supplies of these control foods were provided weekly to the six hospitals serving all participating villages, from where they were also collected and distributed by the participating community doctors weekly.</p><p>Consumption data for any of the intervention were checked and recorded by the community doctors at each visit, i.e. every 2<sup>nd</sup> day for the meat participants and weekly for the cereal participants.

One-way ANCOVA was used to test the effect of group on primary biochemical iron indexes and inflammatory markers (after log transformations for serum ferritin, Hs-CRP, &#x003b1;1-Acid glycoprotein, transferrin receptor, and fecal calprotectin) and age was controlled as a covariate. Other continuous variables including LAZ, WAZ and WLZ at 6 and 18 months were also tested using One-way ANCOVA and sex, birth weight of toddlers, mother&#x02019;s pre-pregnancy BMI were adjusted as confounders. LSD multiple comparison was used for post hoc analysis if the model was significant. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables.

Therefore, iron-fortified cereal is likely an effective strategy to improve the iron stores in toddlers.</p><p>A previous study reported even 1 mg of inorganic iron per day given in a wheat product increased the amount of hemoglobin in young children [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, in our study no intervention effect was observed on hemoglobin levels, which was similar with two other studies [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast to the high rate of iron deficiency, the relatively lower rate of iron deficiency anemia in this population may contribute to the result. More supplemental iron was stored in the body due to iron depletion rather than be used for hemoglobin synthesis.</p><p>As is well known, serum ferritin concentrations are influenced by inflammation. Generally, CRP concentrations were measured to adjust for the influence of inflammation on serum ferritin [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis supported that measures of both AGP and CRP were needed to estimate the full effect of inflammation and could be used to correct ferritin concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, both Hs-CRP and AGP concentrations were tested in our study and further AGP concentration&#x0003e;1.2g/L or Hs-CRP concentration&#x0003e;3mg/L was considered as systemic inflammation referring to a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In poor areas, infants and young children are easily accessible to the pathogens especially enteric pathogens that were attributable to unhygienic living conditions. Although there was no clinically evident illness in the current study population in Xichou County, the rate of systemic inflammation in the sub-samples was 23.66%, as high as the rate in a population of sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that the toddlers in FG had the higher percentage of systemic inflammation. The iron fortificant in cereal was non-heme iron with low absorption. The unabsorbed iron fortificant passed into the colon and was potentially available for the gut microbiota. Abundant lactobacilli and other commensal bacteria in the colon provide an important barrier effect against colonization and invasion by pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, Iron fortification favored the growth of enterobacteria over lactobacilli due to their differing in iron requirements, and the protective barrier may have been weakened [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A previous study found that the unbalance of gut microbiota induced by iron fortification was not associated with clear clinical diseases while increased the concentrations of fecal calprotectin, a more specific and sensitive marker for gut inflammation than other systemic inflammatory markers [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our sub-sample, the concentration of fecal calprotectin was measured only in 107 stool samples because of budgetary restrictions, and the result that no significant difference was found in levels of fecal calprotectin among three groups was likely to be associated with the small sample size. Nevertheless, the increased rate of systemic inflammation in toddlers of fortified cereal group indicated the potential adverse effect of iron fortification.</p><p>Increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is often seen in children with systemic inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines may act individually or in combination to influence child growth through systemic effects and/or a local effect at the level of the growth plate of long bones [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167458.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, it had been recognized by several studies implemented in poor areas that the subclinical, asymptomatic infections resulted in stunting in children independent of nutrition factor [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167458.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In another convenience sub-sample of the study population in Xichou County, the significant negative regression between LAZ at 6 months and fecal calprotectin levels suggested that gut inflammatory factors had a role in growth faltering [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a result, a larger decrease of LAZ between 6&#x02013;18 months of age observed in fortified cereal group indicated that asymptomatic systemic inflammation induced by iron fortification through favoring the growth of enteric pathogens may have impaired the growth of children.</p><p>Meat contains heme iron that is well absorbed and, unlike nonheme iron, its absorption is little affected by dietary factors. However, a randomized control efficacy trial found 2 oz beef supplementation per day was an ineffective strategy for improving the suboptimal iron status in 12-20-mo-old children, but slightly increased the serum ferritin concentration [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our study, pork was used in the meat group, as pork is the most widely used and affordable to every household in China. Nevertheless, pork only contained half as much iron as that in equivalent beef. Similarly, our data indicated that meat intervention did not appear to have an effect on either the rates of ID and IDA or iron stores (serum ferritin and body iron) in a post hoc analysis.</p><p>Meat is an excellent resource of nutrients including fats, proteins, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and zinc besides iron which were beneficial to child growth [<xref rid="pone.0167458.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the sub-sample, a smaller decrease of LAZ from 6 to 18 months in meat group was observed. About 11 grams of protein provided by 50 grams of lean pork may have positive effect on the growth of children. Therefore, though the benefit of supplementing the plant-based complementary foods with meat was insufficient to improve the iron status in this poor rural population, consuming meat-based complementary foods may be effective to reduce the decrease of LAZ.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are some limitations in the present study. First, the iron indexes and inflammatory markers were not detected at baseline considering ethical issues, so we did not obtain the data of the changes in the above indexes from 6 to 18 months. Second, the comparison result of fecal calprotectin concentration among three groups was somewhat limited by the small sample size and the method of convenience sampling. Third, the study is a sub-sample nested within a cluster randomized trial. Higher sampling error may exist. Last, there may be some unmeasured confounders which probably had some influence on the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although iron-fortified cereal strategy is likely to improve the iron status in toddlers, it should be implemented with caution in poor and unhygienic areas with high-risk exposure to pathogens because asymptomatic systemic inflammation induced by iron fortification through favoring the growth of enteric pathogens may have adverse effects on the growth of children. There is no evidence that the meat intervention is sufficient to improve the iron status in this poor rural population, but consuming meat-based complementary foods may be effective to reduce the decrease of LAZ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167458.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167458.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167458.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Third Version Nutrition Monitoring of Young Children.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167458.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167458.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Iron.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167458.s003.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff in Xichou County Maternal and Nutrition Services for their generous and high quality support in enrolling the community doctors, training the hospital directors, for purchase of fresh pork and for a senior role in data collection.
