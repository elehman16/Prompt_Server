contraction and passive straight leg raising techniques on muscle activity, fatigue, and
range of motion of the hip joint after the induction of delayed onset muscle soreness in
the hamstring muscle. [Subjects] Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a hold
relax-agonist contraction group and a passive straight leg raising group. [Methods]
Subjects in the experimental group underwent hold relax-agonist contraction at the
hamstring muscle, while subjects in the control group underwent passive straight leg
raising at the hamstring muscle. [Results] Subjects in the hold relax-agonist contraction
group showed a significant increase in hamstring muscle activity and hip joint angle and a
significant decrease in muscle fatigue. In the passive straight leg raising group, the hip
joint angle increased significantly after the intervention. In the hold relax-agonist
contraction group, hamstring muscle activity increased significantly and muscle fatigue
decreased significantly. [Conclusion] We conclude that the hold relax-agonist contraction
technique may be beneficial for improving muscle activation and decreasing muscle
fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Delayed onset muscle soreness</kwd><kwd>Hold relax-agonist contraction</kwd><kwd>Passive straight leg raising</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) resulting from exercise is triggered by selective and
minute damage to the fast twitch fibers due to sudden eccentric high-intensity exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. High-intensity exercise exhausts energy
sources including glycogen within the muscles, causes muscle tension, and prevents the
discharge of side products of energy metabolic processes such as lactic acid<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lactic acid accumulation causes pain in the
joints and muscles of certain areas, a sense of tenderness, local edema and stiffness,
restricted range of motion and decreased muscle strength, lack of endurance, and decreased
muscle coordination<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hamstring
muscle, which is very important in adjusting the human body&#x02019;s movement during gait, is one
of the most commonly damaged areas. When the hamstring muscle flexibility increases, muscle
pain after exercise decreases and muscle coordination improves. Therefore, maintaining
normal muscle length through regular stretching exercises after precisely evaluating
hamstring muscle flexibility in advance not only prevents muscle shortening but also reduces
the risk of hamstring muscle injury and may enhance physical activity.</p><p>Physical therapy activities to increase hamstring muscle length include the passive
straight leg raising (PSLR) and hold relax-agonist contraction (HR-AC) proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation techniques. HR-AC is a positive contraction technique that may
efficiently lengthen the muscles with a combination of reciprocal agonist and antagonist
inhibition and autogenic protagonist inhibition<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. PSLR, which was first described by Frost in 1881, is currently one
of the most representative neurological tests for the lower limbs. Used as a passive
contraction technique, it can stretch the hamstring muscle simultaneously with the sciatic
nerve<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was conducted to
verify the effects of the HR-AC and PSLR techniques on muscle activity, muscle fatigue, and
range of motion of the hip joint after DOMS induction to the hamstring muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty healthy people without an orthopedic history provided informed consent prior to
participating in this study. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committee of Eulji University Hospital. The subjects were randomly assigned to the
HR-AC group (n = 30; 12 males, 18 females) and the PSLR group (n = 30; 15 men, 15 women) via
a computerized random number generator to determine group allocation. Subject age, height,
and weight were 20.2 &#x000b1; 1.4&#x02005;years, 169.7 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;cm, and 59.8 &#x000b1; 10.2&#x02005;kg in the HR-AC group and
21.3 &#x000b1; 1.2&#x02005;years, 171.8 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x02005;cm, and 62.2 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;kg in the PSLR group, respectively. To
induce DOMS in the hamstring muscle, subjects in both experimental groups walked downhill on
a 10&#x000b0; declined treadmill at a speed of 4&#x02005;km/h for 30 minutes<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After DOMS induction, the HR-AC and PSLR techniques were applied to each experimental
group. For the HR-AC technique, the subjects lay supine and relaxed with a straight posture
on the treatment table. The investigator passively stretched the hamstrings until the
subject first reported a mild stretching sensation and held that position for 7 seconds.
Next, the subject maximally isometrically contracted the hamstrings for 7 seconds by
attempting to push the leg back toward the table against the resistance created by the
investigator. After the contraction, the subject relaxed for 5 seconds<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the PSLR technique, subjects lay supine in a straight
posture on the treatment table and relaxed. With the knees extended and the hip joint bent
as much as possible within its range, the hip joints were increasingly bent until the
hamstring muscle was stretched with light, tolerable pain and held there for 30 seconds<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. After the passive stretching, the subject
relaxed for 5 seconds. All stretching was performed on the dominant lower extremity and the
sequence was repeated 20 times in both groups.</p><p>Electromyography equipment (MP150; Biopac Inc, USA) was used to measure hamstring muscle
activity and fatigue. While in a prone position, the subjects flexed the knees to contract
the hamstring muscle. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was derived using
average electromyography signal volume for 3 seconds excluding the first and last seconds
during the 5-second muscle contraction<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
lactic acid analyzer (Accutrend; RDGH, Germany) was used to measure the lactic acid level in
the blood, which was collected from the capillaries of the tip of the second finger using a
capillary tube and analyzed. A goniometer was used to measure the hip joint angle while the
subjects maintained extension of the knee joints and flexed them to a maximal degree. The
measured areas were based on the midline between the greater trochanter and the trunk and
the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean and
SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention, differences in the general
characteristics of the experimental and control groups were compared using independent
t-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Comparisons of variables before and after training within
each group were made using paired sample t-tests. Comparisons of pre- and post-test
differences in variables between the experimental and control groups were performed using
the independent t-test. Intergroup effect sizes were calculated using the Cohen<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> d coefficient. An effect size &#x0003c; 0.2
reflects a negligible mean difference; 0.2&#x02212;0.5, a small difference; 0.5&#x02212;0.8, a moderate mean
difference; and &#x0003e; 0.8, a large difference. Statistical analysis was performed at a 95%
confidence level, and p values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The HR-AC group showed significant increases in hamstring muscle activation and hip joint
angle as well as significantly decreased muscle fatigue compared to the pre-intervention
results (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, the PSLR group showed significant increments in the
angle of the hip joint compared to the pre-intervention results (p &#x0003c; 0.05). A significant
difference in the post-training increase in hamstring activation and a significant decrease
in muscle fatigue was observed between the HR-AC group and the PSLR group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In
addition, the effect size for gains in the HR-AC group and PSLR group was very strong for
muscle activity (effect size = 1.13) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

range of motion when HR-AC and PSLR were applied separately after DOMS induction in the
hamstring muscle in healthy subjects. Our results showed that the HR-AC technique more
effectively increased muscle activity and decreased muscle fatigue than the PSLR technique.
In a previous study comparing HR-AC and PSLR techniques with athletes as the subjects, no
significant difference was found between the two methods. In another study applying nerve
mobilization, the HR-AC technique, and the PSLR technique to 100 healthy adults for 8 weeks,
PSLR was reported the most effective<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Handle et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that use of the
HR-AC technique resulted in greater enhancements of hamstring muscle activity and
flexibility than that with the PSLR. During HR-AC, isometric contraction triggers autogenic
inhibition that inhibits &#x003b1;-motor neurons of contracted muscles and synergists in
interneurons and activates antagonists by transmitting tendon tension by I b afferent nerve
fibers to the anterior horn of the spinal cord. During AC, concentric contraction causes
reciprocal inhibition that activates the &#x003b1;-motor neurons of contracted muscles and
synergists and inhibits antagonists<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decoster et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, who introduced diverse stretching techniques in a
literature review, reported that it was difficult to determine the most effective stretching
technique. The results of the current and previous studies differed because of differences
in the number of times stretching techniques were applied, experimental periods, subjects,
and measurement timing. Therefore, in the clinical field, subjects&#x02019; personal characteristics
should be considered in the selection and application of an appropriate stretching
technique.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the subjects were healthy people;
therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results. Second, the short-term effects during
the early period were measured according to each technique and continuous effects were not
analyzed. Third, the force applied to the hamstring was not quantified when each stretching
technique was applied by a physical therapist. Future research should include the
establishment of a standardized method for the selection of an appropriate stretching
technique according to individual subjects by complementing the above-mentioned
problems.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Roig Pull</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ranson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Eccentric muscle actions: implications for injury
