Examinations and samplings were performed at Pediatric Dentistry Department, Dental School of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences from May to September 2010. Volunteers with a history of systemic antibiotic or topical fluoride treatments within 4 weeks prior to first saliva sampling day were not included in the study. Pregnant women, smokers and regular Xylitol chewing gum users (because xylitol inhibits <italic>SM</italic> growth and might be a confounder factor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> and probiotics consumers were not eligible. Healthy subjects without compromised oral health, untreated active carious lesions and signs of gingivitis or periodontal disease were included.</p><p>In this double-blind controlled trial study (registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials code: IRCT201009144745N1), bacterial counts were performed three times; before randomization, before intervention and after it (two weeks). Subjects were randomized into two intervention and control blocks (one stratum). The other stratum was subjects&#x02019; <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count. For each subject both <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and lactobacillus count was performed three times. The first <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count was utilized for stratifying subjects into 5 scores from 0 cfu/ml to &#x02265; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml as randomization unit to have equal numbers of subjects in each block per score (randomization ratio 1:1). Subjects in each score received codes 1 or 2 according to odd or even random figures respectively. Then by balloting those who received code 1 allocated in control block and code 2 in probiotic block. The procedure was carried out by one who was not aware about the study. Each participant as well as both probiotic and conventional cheese plastic containers were given codes. Both cheese types were weighted and given to subjects into sealed up coded containers with similar shape. Neither the practitioner who enrolled participants nor subjects were aware about codes. The staffs who were involved in intervention, microbiologic analyses, and data entry and analyses were not aware about participants and containers&#x02019; codes too. The investigation comprised 2 consecutive parts of 1 and 2 week periods. The second <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>lactobacillus</italic> count (immediately before intervention) was performed following a one week run-in period. During this period, subjects were asked not to consume any type of cheese in any way. Within a 2-week intervention, subjects were instructed to intake 50 g white cheese containing either probiotic <italic>L. casei</italic>
<italic>LAF-TI-L26</italic> (1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> Cfu /g) (DSM Rosell-Lallemand, Eveleigh, Australia) or white cheese without probiotic strain twice daily with breakfast and dinner meals (they were prohibited from consumption extra cheese other than they were given). Both cheese types were produced by same dairy plant. At first, it was designed that subjects consume cheese samples at university catering centers with similar breakfast ingredients; however, due to needing daily transportation to university, the design was changed providing cheese samples every other day at their home or work and taking a written report form about complete cheese consumption. They were supervised by phone too. The third saliva sample counts were conducted at the day after the fortnight intervention. Throughout all three weeks of experiment, subjects were under close supervision to brush their teeth with similar brand of fluoride tooth paste containing 0.321% sodium fluoride (Crest Procter &#x00026; Gamble, Ohio, United States of America) only twice daily and one hour after breakfast and dinner. Subjects were asked not to use probiotic or Xylitol containing products, systemic antibiotic and topical fluoride during this period.

This result was against what was expected based on the in vitro study that showed highly adhesion rate of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> to enamel surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Reducing saliva agglutinin gp340 and peroxidase concentrations and decreasing numbers of attached <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> by altering pellicle composition are two suggested mechanisms that probiotic strains including L. casei affected oral microflora. These ways of action could interpret <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count reduction but not change in <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> count. Furthermore, some individuals might have inherent trait of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> uninstallation due to missing <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> retention sites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> These people might act as a confounder when results are being compared. To be confident about <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> count changes, the data of subjects with 0 score in all three steps of saliva sample Lactobacilli counts were excluded (3 in probiotic block and 5 in conventional cheese block and 8 in total). The statistical analyses still did not show significant change in both groups in <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> counts. Oral microbial pattern in adequate numbers of subjects with 0 <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> count in comparison with individuals showing positive counts of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> might lead us to remarkable results. Variations in study design, dosage, and ways of administration, age of participants and strains of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> make comparison of this study with other researches complicated. It is not possible to absolutely determine the results of probiotic studies on oral health. However, in majority of probiotic <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> using dairy products vehicles more encouraging outcomes were found.

<italic>L. rhamnosus LB21</italic> and fluoride reduced dental caries in preschool children. A cross over randomized control trial of 2 weeks placebo or yoghurt containing probiotic <italic>L. reuteri</italic> caused significant reduction counts of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> in young adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> During the &#x0201c;post treatment period&#x0201d; of 3 weeks consumption of probiotic cheese containing <italic>L. rhamnosus GG</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> LC 705, significant reduction of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> was seen comparing to subjects receiving conventional cheese as placebo but salivary <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count did not change immediately after 3-week intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In our study, probiotic group solely caused a reduction in <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> population while intergroup comparing test did not show expected results. Cheese per se was beneficial in reducing salivary Streptococcus mutans counts although this decrease was not significant. This finding was in agreement with other researches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></p><p>The synergism between caries reducing effect of cheese and oral health promoting role of probiotics could help individuals with higher levels of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> to promote their oral health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Although significant results were not seen between placebo and trial groups, the encouraging observation in <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> levels reduction in probiotic block reinforced the value of further researches. Particularly, long-term effects of probiotic cheese on incipient caries development (as a known role of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> in dental caries etiology) would be valuable. The residual effects following withdrawal of these products should also be taken into account. It should be noted that the present study comprised healthy adults without active dental caries. Due to possibility of not completely matured children's oral flora and the fact that they affect more easily compared to adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and ethical limitations, it was decided not to include children at this step.
