Chronic kisspeptin administration causes profound tachyphylaxis in male monkeys and in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The pharmacological effects of chronic kisspeptin exposure in healthy women with normal menstrual cycles have not been studied previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim:</title><p>Our aim was to determine the effects of follicular-phase kisspeptin-54 treatment on menstrual cyclicity in healthy women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective, single-blinded, 1-way crossover study. Healthy women received twice-daily sc injections of kisspeptin (6.4 nmol/kg) or 0.9% saline during menstrual days 7&#x02013;14 (n = 5 per treatment arm). Serial assessments of basal reproductive hormones, ultrasound parameters, LH pulsatility, and acute sensitivity to GnRH and kisspeptin-54 injection were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Menstrual cyclicity persisted in all women after follicular-phase kisspeptin-54 treatment. Chronic exposure to kisspeptin-54 did not abolish acute stimulation of LH after injection of kisspeptin-54 or GnRH. In addition, kisspeptin-54 treatment was associated with a shorter mean length of the menstrual cycle (mean length of menstrual cycle was 28.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 days with saline vs 26.8 &#x000b1; 3.1 days with kisspeptin, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01), earlier onset of highest recorded serum LH (mean menstrual day of highest LH was 15.2 &#x000b1; 1.3 with saline vs 13.0 &#x000b1; 1.9 with kisspeptin, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05), and earlier onset of the luteal phase (mean menstrual day of progesterone increase was 18.0 &#x000b1; 2.1 with saline vs 15.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 with kisspeptin, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our data suggest that 1 week of exogenous kisspeptin-54 does not abolish menstrual cyclicity in healthy women. Further work is needed to determine whether kisspeptin could be used to treat certain anovulatory disorders.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The kisspeptins are a group of arginine-phenylalanine (RF) amide peptides encoded by the <italic>KISS1</italic> gene and are endogenous ligands for the kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>KISS1</italic> and <italic>KISS1R</italic> are expressed predominantly in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and placenta (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Kisspeptin signaling exerts powerful effects on the mammalian reproductive system. Mice and humans lacking kisspeptin or the kisspeptin receptor fail to undergo puberty and are infertile (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

However, twice-daily sc administration of kisspeptin-54 to women with HA causes profound tachyphylaxis within 24 hours of commencing treatment (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, continuous iv infusion of kisspeptin-10 to monkeys is associated with tachyphylaxis within 3 hours of commencing administration (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It has therefore been assumed that chronic treatment with kisspeptin-54 in healthy women may have limited therapeutic potential as a stimulator of human reproductive activity because tachyphylaxis has been observed after chronic administration in primates and women with HA. However, this hypothesis had not been tested previously.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine whether chronic exogenous kisspeptin was sufficient to alter menstrual cyclicity, using the exact dose previously demonstrated to cause tachyphylaxis within 24 hours in women with HA (6.4 nmol/kg) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

Volunteers were instructed to prepare and perform injections in the morning after breakfast (unless attending for a study in which case it was done by the volunteer at time 0 of the study) and in the evening before bed. The volume of the saline or kisspeptin injections was identical. Subjects were instructed to refrigerate vials stored at home. Before commencing study visits, injection sites were inspected, and numbers of returned vials, insulin syringes, and saline or kisspeptin vials were counted to monitor compliance.

During each scan, the following parameters were measured: endometrial thickness (in millimeters), mean ovarian volume (in cubic centimeters), mean follicle number, and maximum diameter of largest follicle in each ovary (in millimeters). Ovulation was defined as a rise in serum progesterone &#x0003e;10 nmol/L together with suggestive radiological features (visualization of a dominant follicle with subsequent appearance of a preovulatory follicle and/or corpus luteum).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Investigators performing the clinical studies were blinded to results until all subjects had completed the study protocol.

We and other investigators have recently demonstrated that exogenous kisspeptin acutely stimulates gonadotropin secretion in women (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the pharmacological effects of chronic kisspeptin exposure in healthy women with regular menstrual cycles have not been studied previously. Chronic kisspeptin administration causes profound tachyphylaxis in male monkeys and in women in functional HA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We present novel data suggesting that menstrual cyclicity persists in healthy women after twice-daily kisspeptin-54 treatment during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.</p><p>In the current study, kisspeptin treatment was associated with an advanced timing of the serum progesterone increase and onset of menstrual bleeding by approximately 2 days when compared with saline. Animal studies demonstrate that kisspeptin stimulates gonadotropin secretion in a GnRH-dependent manner because its action is abolished by GnRH antagonist (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Exogenous GnRH is sufficient to trigger ovulation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). More studies with daily follicle morphology assessment and daily serum LH measurement would be required to confirm our findings. However, our study data raise the possibility that kisspeptin-54 administration may advance the onset of ovulation in healthy women by stimulating endogenous hypothalamic GnRH secretion. In addition to stimulating GnRH, kisspeptin itself is implicated in generation of the LH surge needed for ovulation. In rodents, a subpopulation of hypothalamic anteroventral periventricular nucleus kisspeptin neurons are implicated in generating the LH surge needed for ovulation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and are positively rather than negatively regulated by estradiol (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Central administration of a monoclonal antibody to kisspeptin is sufficient to block ovulation in rats (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, administration of kisspeptin-10 has been shown to stimulate ovulation in the musk shrew (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), rat (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and sheep (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Humans have no anatomical equivalent of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus. Nevertheless, it is possible that exogenous kisspeptin-54 may have advanced the onset of the luteal phase in our female subjects by increasing kisspeptin signaling in a subpopulation of hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons that stimulate the LH surge. Several lines of evidence suggest that in humans, unlike in lower species, a change in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH rather than an actual GnRH surge is responsible for the LH surge (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). It is therefore possible that kisspeptin-54 advances ovulation in women by increasing the prevailing levels of estradiol, which are needed to trigger the LH surge at a pituitary level.</p><p>Chronic kisspeptin administration has also been implicated as a potential novel therapy for inhibiting reproductive hormone secretion in contraception or the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancer; our data suggest that kisspeptin-54 may have limited therapeutic potential in this regard, at least in women at the dose of kisspeptin tested. However, our observation that kisspeptin may advance the menstrual cycle raises the possibility that women with certain forms of infertility could be treated with kisspeptin. A recent study suggests that kisspeptin is sufficient to restore ovulation in a mouse model of anovulatory hyperprolactinemia (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). More studies are required to determine whether kisspeptin-54 treatment could be used to stimulate ovulation in women with anovulatory reproductive disorders other than HA.</p><p>Traditional ovulatory drugs such as clomiphene citrate have low pregnancy rates (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Although efficacious, in vitro fertilization confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Kisspeptin acts by stimulating endogenous, rather than pharmacological, levels of reproductive hormone secretion. Kisspeptin might therefore offer a fertility treatment with lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when compared with in vitro fertilization.</p><p>Comparison of our data with other clinical studies of kisspeptin administration is complicated by the investigation of its 2 peptide forms (kisspeptin-54 and -10) and sexual dimorphism of the effects of kisspeptin-10; iv bolus administration consistently stimulates LH men (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), but women are much less sensitive to the effects of kisspeptin-10 during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle when compared with the preovulatory phase (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Although kisspeptin-54 stimulates LH in both sexes, its effects have never been compared directly between men and women (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Consistent with our findings in healthy women, George et al (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) recently observed that a 22.5-hour iv infusion of the shorter form of kisspeptin, kisspeptin-10, stimulates LH secretion without apparent tachyphylaxis in healthy men. However, in contrast to the current findings, twice-daily kisspeptin-54 treatment has been shown to rapidly cause tachyphylaxis in women with HA. Women with HA are acutely 4-fold more sensitive to the effects of kisspeptin-54 when compared with healthy women in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. A higher dose of kisspeptin-54 may therefore be necessary to achieve tachyphylaxis in healthy female volunteers (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Nevertheless, our data suggest that menstrual cyclicity persists in healthy women using the currently tested regimen of follicular-phase kisspeptin-54 treatment. Preliminary data have emerged suggesting that chronic administration of a kisspeptin analog causes tachyphylaxis in healthy men (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether tachyphlyaxis to kisspeptin-54 is also sexually dimorphic or dependent on the dose and precise form of kisspeptin receptor agonist administered.</p><p>It is interesting to note that although iv bolus injection of the shorter kisspeptin fragment, kisspeptin-10, acutely stimulates LH secretion within an hour of administration, we observed that sc injection of kisspeptin-54 acutely stimulated peak LH secretion 3 to 4 hours after administration despite a rapid elevation of kisspeptin IR within minutes of administration. On the first injection day, the increase in serum LH 1 hour after kisspeptin-54 injection was 3-fold lower when compared with the peak increase in serum LH after kisspeptin-54 injection. Furthermore, on the fourth and final injection days, there was negligible stimulation of LH secretion 1 hour after kisspeptin-54 injection; however, serum LH later increased to peak levels 3 to 4 hours after kisspeptin injection. By comparison, Chan et al (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) observed that kisspeptin-10 stimulated peak LH secretion within an hour of commencing administration in healthy men. It is possible that these data suggest differences between the biological actions of kisspeptin-10 and -54. For instance, one might speculate that kisspeptin-10 stimulates a readily releasable pool of GnRH stored within nerve terminals of the median eminence (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), whereas kisspeptin-54 might act more proximally in the GnRH neuron to stimulate de novo GnRH synthesis. Alternatively, it is possible kisspeptin-54 might require breakdown into a smaller kisspeptin fragment before becoming biologically active. However, liquid chromatography has only identified kisspeptin-54 in the human circulation acutely after kisspeptin-54 administration (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to appraise the evidence that exogenous kisspeptin stimulates basal and pulsatile GnRH secretion. Although kisspeptin stimulates rat pituitary gonadotropin secretion in vitro (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), animal studies using GnRH antagonists support the view that exogenous kisspeptin stimulates basal LH secretion through a GnRH-dependent mechanism (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), which is possibly mediated through GnRH nerve terminals at the median eminence (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, it is less clear whether exogenous kisspeptin stimulates endogenous GnRH pulsatility. Sustained exposure to exogenous kisspeptin-10 or -54 stimulates pulsatile LH secretion for several hours in healthy men (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and patients with inactivating mutations of the neurokinin B signaling pathway (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, because these studies merely measure LH pulsatility, it is not possible to exclude that effects reflect increasing circulating estrogen and pituitary responsiveness to unchanged, endogenous GnRH pulsatility. Chan and colleagues (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) recently demonstrated that iv bolus kisspeptin-10 increased the time to the next endogenous LH pulse in healthy men; this may represent the only current data suggesting that exogenous kisspeptin can directly modulate endogenous GnRH pulsatility in humans (by increasing the latency period to the next LH/GnRH pulse).</p><p>It is important to recognize that the current study is based on observations within a small number of subjects so may have insufficient statistical power to reveal subtle effects of kisspeptin-54 administration on menstrual cyclicity or LH pulsatility. Furthermore, the gonadotropin response to kisspeptin treatment is known to alter with the phase of the menstrual cycle in healthy women (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A larger study is needed to confirm our findings and determine what factors influence the variability in the response of subjects to kisspeptin treatment. It is possible that chronic kisspeptin-54 treatment might have effects that last beyond the treatment period. For this reason, we designed a 1-way crossover protocol in which subjects self-administered saline during the first month followed by kisspeptin-54 during the second month. It therefore remains possible that an order effect might have contributed to our results. However, it is noteworthy that LH pulse secretory mass was marginally lower at the start of the second month when compared with LH pulse secretory mass at the start of the first month (when greater stress levels would be expected). Furthermore, subjects had the same menstrual cycle length before commencing the study when compared with menstrual cycle length during saline administration. We also recognize that although estradiol measurements were compared with placebo-controlled values, the automated platform assay used to analyze serum estradiol can cross-react with other steroids.</p><p>Mean peak levels of LH during the menstrual cycle were lower during kisspeptin treatment when compared with saline treatment. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that kisspeptin-54 did not acutely stimulate significant LH secretion during the final day of twice-daily kisspeptin-54 treatment. We therefore cannot exclude that kisspeptin-54 treatment caused partial tachyphylaxis in healthy female volunteers. Alternatively, the short baseline sampling period involving just 2 blood samples may have reduced our power to detect stimulation of LH after kisspeptin-54 injection on day 14. LH levels were highly variable during menstrual day 14, which may have been caused by some but not all subjects experiencing an LH surge and by the potential effect of kisspeptin-54 to advance the onset of the LH surge in subjects.</p><p>It is noteworthy that all subjects had peak progesterone levels &#x02265;21 mmol/L after kisspeptin-54 treatment, which is highly suggestive of ovulation. Furthermore, a corpus luteum was observed in all 5 subjects during the month of kisspeptin-54 treatment (Supplemental Table 2). Our data therefore suggest that all 5 subjects had ovulatory cycles during kisspeptin treatment. More studies are required to determine whether menstrual cycles during kisspeptin therapy have subtle physiological differences when compared with natural menstrual cycles and to determine whether anovulation is observed at a different frequency during kisspeptin treatment when compared with placebo treatment.</p><p>In summary, our data have important pharmacological implications; menstrual cyclicity persists in healthy women during a treatment regime of kisspeptin-54 previously demonstrated to cause tachyphylaxis in women with HA. Furthermore, kisspeptin-54 treatment is associated with an advanced timing of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when compared with placebo. More studies are required to determine whether kisspeptin-54 therapy could have potential to treat patients with anovulatory reproductive disorders.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
