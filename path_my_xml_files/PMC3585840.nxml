A strategy for directly modulating sympathetic nerve function is to reduce the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) via inhibition of dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (D&#x003b2;H).</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of etamicastat (BIA 5&#x02013;453), a new D&#x003b2;H inhibitor, following repeated dosing.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in healthy young male volunteers. Participants received once-daily doses of placebo or etamicastat 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 600 mg, for 10 days.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Etamicastat underwent N-acetylation to its metabolite BIA 5&#x02013;961. Etamicastat and BIA 5&#x02013;961 maximum concentrations were achieved at 1&#x02013;3 and 2&#x02013;4 hours, respectively, after dosing. Elimination half-lives ranged from 18.1 to 25.7 hours for etamicastat and 6.7 to 22.5 hours for BIA 5&#x02013;961. Both etamicastat and BIA 5-961 followed linear pharmacokinetics. The extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat and BIA 5&#x02013;961 increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, and steady-state plasma concentrations were attained up to 9 days of dosing. Etamicastat accumulated in plasma following repeated administration. The mean observed accumulation ratio was 1.3&#x02013;1.9 for etamicastat and 1.3&#x02013;1.6 for BIA 5&#x02013;961. Approximately 40%of the etamicastat dose was recovered in urine in the form of parent compound and BIA 5&#x02013;961. There was a high variability in pharmacokinetic parameters, attributable to different N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) phenotype. Urinary excretion of norepinephrine decreased following repeated administration of etamicastat. Etamicastat was generally well tolerated. There was no serious adverse event or clinically significant abnormality in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECG parameters.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Etamicastat was well tolerated. Etamicastat undergoes N-acetylation, which is markedly influenced by NAT2 phenotype. NAT2 genotyping could be a step toward personalized medicine for etamicastat.</p><p><bold>Trial Registration:</bold> EudraCT No. 2007-004142-33</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is a common finding in congestive heart failure and hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Adrenoceptor antagonists can be used to inhibit such sympathetic activation, but a proportion of patients do not tolerate the immediate hemodynamic impact, particularly in heart failure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] An alternative strategy is to inhibit dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (D&#x003b2;H; EC 1.14.17.1), a mono-oxygenase that catalyses the conversion of dopamine into norepinephrine (noradrenaline) in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Gradual sympathetic modulation by D&#x003b2;H inhibitors as opposed to abrupt inhibition observed with &#x003b2;-adrenoceptor blockers (&#x003b2;-blockers) could decrease the hemodynamic negative impact.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Furthermore, inhibition of D&#x003b2;H also increases dopamine release,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which can improve renal function by causing renal vasodilatation and inducing diuresis and natriuresis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p><p>Several D&#x003b2;H inhibitors have been thus far reported;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] however, both first- and second-generation D&#x003b2;H inhibitors were found to have low potency, poor D&#x003b2;H selectivity, and relevant toxic effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Nepicastat (RS-25560-197),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] a third-generation D&#x003b2;H inhibitor, was found to have much greater potency and to be devoid of some of the problems associated with first- and second-generation inhibitors.

The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice (ICH) guidelines. An Independent Ethics Committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes [CCP] Ouest VI, Brest, France) reviewed and approved the study protocol and the subject information. Written informed consent was obtained for each subject prior to enrolment in the study.

Subjects were then discharged from the research facility and instructed to return for a follow-up visit 4&#x02013;7 days later. At admission, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory safety tests were updated. Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate measurements and computerized 12-lead ECG recordings were obtained at frequent intervals during admission.

The investigator was responsible for providing the interpretation of all ECGs. The results included heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval, with comments on normality or abnormality. Two corrections of the QT interval were investigated: Fridericia&#x02019;s correction (QTcF) and Bazett&#x02019;s correction (QTcB). The primary method of correction was QTcF. A manual reading of the digital ECGs was conducted to assess prolongation of QT/QTc intervals.</p><p>All clinical AEs were monitored throughout the entire study period.

The detection was carried out electrochemically with a glassy carbon electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and an amperometric detector (Intro-Antec Leyden for norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine, and Gilson 141 for homovanillic acid); the detector cell was operated at 0.75 V. The lower limits of detection of norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine, and homovanillic acid were 22, 19, 37, and 500 ng/L, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Determination of Subjects NAT1 and NAT2 Genotypes</title><p>The <italic>NAT1</italic> and <italic>NAT2</italic> genes were genotyped for all subjects participating in the current study.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of etamicastat in healthy male adults following repeated administration. The study followed a standard design commonly used in studies with identical purposes. Etamicastat administered orally at doses up to 600 mg once daily for 10 days appeared to be well tolerated. All AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. Most subjects (83%) in the 600 mg etamicastat group reported diarrhea as an AE. Diarrhea has also been reported at high etamicastat doses in preclinical studies. D&#x003b2;H gene variants that cause low plasma D&#x003b2;H have also been associated with an increased propensity to report diarrhea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] The data show that a marked decrease of D&#x003b2;H activity can predispose to the occurrence of diarrhea. A papular rash of plausible infectious origin occurred in three subjects under treatment with etamicastat 200 mg. There were no serious AEs or clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECG parameters.</p><p>Consistent with the results from a previous study in which etamicastat single doses of 2&#x02013;1200 mg were administered to young healthy subjects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] etamicastat was shown to be metabolized to its N-acetylated metabolite BIA 5-961 following single and repeated administration of 25&#x02013;600 mg once-daily doses. C<sub>max</sub> of etamicastat and BIA 5-961 were achieved at 1&#x02013;3 hours and 2&#x02013;4 hours after dosing, respectively. Thereafter, etamicastat plasma concentrations declined with a mean apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> of 9&#x02013;15 hours following the first dose and 18&#x02013;26 hours following the last dose. Estimated t<sub>1/2</sub> values for BIA 5-961 were slightly shorter than those of the parent drug. Both etamicastat and BIA 5-961 followed approximate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied. The extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner following single and repeated administration. Etamicastat accumulated in plasma following repeated administration. The mean R<sub>O</sub> was 1.3&#x02013;1.9 for etamicastat and 1.3&#x02013;1.6 for BIA 5-961. The identical accumulation ratio of BIA 5-961 is consistent with the slightly shorter t<sub>1/2</sub> of BIA 5-961 compared with that of etamicastat. Steady-state etamicastat and BIA 5-961 plasma concentrations were reached up to 9 days of etamicastat repeated administration.</p><p>Approximately 45% of the etamicastat dose was recovered in urine collected up to 24 hours post-dose in the form of parent drug and N-acetylated metabolite. These data are consistent with those from a study aiming to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of etamicastat and metabolites following an oral dose of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labeled etamicastat (BIAL unpublished observation). Eleven days after administration, approximately 95% of the administered radioactivity had been excreted, two-thirds in urine and one-third in feces. Biotransformation of etamicastat occurred mainly via N-acetylation, forming BIA 5-961, the major metabolite. However, glucuronidation, oxidation, oxidative deamination, and de-sulfation were also involved.</p><p>Renal clearance of etamicastat from plasma following repeated oral administration of etamicastat was 11.9&#x02013;16.0 L/h, which is higher than the glomerular filtration rate (7.6 L/h).</p><p>N-Acetylation is the major metabolic pathway for etamicastat. Humans express two functional NAT isoforms, NAT1 and NAT2. NAT1 has broad tissue distribution whereas NAT2 is more restricted, with higher levels of expression in the liver and red blood cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] NAT exhibits different substrate specificities. Human NAT1 and NAT2 loci are highly polymorphic, with more than 25 alleles identified in each locus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] Within this polymorphic population, different phenotypes have been identified for both forms, NAT1 and NAT2. As an important metabolizing enzyme in humans, the polymorphism of human NAT expression, especially NAT2, raises concerns about drug-drug interactions during clinical use. In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (BIAL unpublished observation), etamicastat N-acetylation in cytosolic fraction showed a good correlation with sulfamethazine NAT activity, a selective substrate to NAT2, but not with <italic>p</italic>-aminosalicylic acid, a selective substrate to NAT1, suggesting that etamicastat N-acetylation is predominantly driven by NAT2. These data are consistent with the results from the current study and those of a previous single-dose study in healthy subjects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which showed no apparent major influence of NAT1 phenotype on etamicastat pharmacokinetics. However, the contribution of NAT1 to etamicastat metabolism should not be completely excluded, since NAT2 is expressed predominantly in liver whereas NAT1 is expressed ubiquitously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</p><p>As demonstrated in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>, the extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat differed markedly between NAT2 poor and rapid acetylators. The extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat in NAT2 poor acetylators was 1.5&#x02013;6.7 times higher than that observed in rapid acetylators and, inversely, NAT2 rapid acetylators showed a 1.5- to 3.5-fold increase in systemic exposure to the N-acetylated metabolite, confirming the involvement of NAT2 in the biotransformation of etamicastat into BIA 5-961. The magnitude of the effect of NAT2 phenotype on etamicastat pharmacokinetics is a strong argument for genotyping participants in further clinical trials with etamicastat. Effective clinical translation would establish etamicastat pharmacogenomics as a step toward personalized medicine for etamicastat.</p><p>Similar to a previous single-dose study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] the distribution of fast and slow NAT2 acetylators was not equal in all dose groups in the current study, and differences in the proportion of NAT2 fast/slow acetylators complicated the interpretation of the results (i.e. the dose-proportionality assessment) and were a cause of variability. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, stratification according to NAT2 phenotype could be considered in future studies with etamicastat.</p><p>D&#x003b2;H catalyzes the conversion of dopamine into norepinephrine. Consistently with the claimed D&#x003b2;H inhibitory effect by etamicastat, urinary excretion of norepinephrine decreased following repeated administration of etamicastat. For doses of etamicastat 100 mg and above, the decrease in norepinephrine urinary excretion was 32&#x02013;36%. It should be taken into account, however, that the reported effect may be underestimated, since day 1 values do not correspond to a true baseline because they might have been influenced by the effect of the first dose of etamicastat. No relevant change from day 1 to day 10 was found in the other urinary catecholamines in the different dose groups.</p><p>A statistically significant decrease was found in supine DBP following repeated administration of etamicastat 100 mg and 200 mg. Although consistent with the claimed pharmacologic effect, this effect, however, should be interpreted with caution because no clear dose-response relationship was observed and the number of subjects in each dose group is small.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, etamicastat was well tolerated and was shown to be metabolized to the N-acetylated metabolite BIA 5-961, following single and multiple doses of etamicastat 25&#x02013;600 mg. Etamicastat and its metabolite followed linear pharmacokinetics, and steady-state plasma concentrations were attained up to 9 days of dosing. Etamicastat pharmacokinetics are markedly affected by the NAT2 phenotype, and NAT2 genotyping could be a step toward personalized medicine for etamicastat. Consistently with the expected pharmacologic effect, urinary excretion of norepinephrine decreased following repeated administration of etamicastat.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the subjects who participated in the study.</p><p>This trial was sponsored by BIAL (Portela and Co, S.A., S.
