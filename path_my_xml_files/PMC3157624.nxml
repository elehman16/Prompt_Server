The most widely used EC drug is levonorgestrel (LNG), taken orally in repeated doses (0.75 mg &#x000d7; 2) or as a single dose (1.5 mg) within 72 h of sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C16">Trussell <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). LNG EC is more effective and has fewer side effects than the Yuzpe regimen, which contains both estrogen and progestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C2">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that LNG acts by inhibiting or postponing ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C3">Gemzell-Danielsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C5">Leung <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C9">No&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Higher doses of LNG taken after ovulation, or LNG administered by the vaginal route, have no effect on endometrial development or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C3">Gemzell-Danielsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C7">Meng <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C10">Palomino <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the use of LNG has increased and it is now available for women seeking EC without a doctor's prescription in nearly 50 countries, including China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C12">Pittrof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C16">Trussell <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, extensive debate on overreliance on LNG as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug still occurs in many other countries, which is a barrier to switching the prescription status of LNG in these countries. As a result, prospective, multi-center, open-label clinical trials of LNG as an OTC drug are necessary to provide evidence to inform the discussion.</p><p>The LNG emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) was approved as an OTC drug by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in 1998 and has been widely available in China since that time. An enteric-coated LNG-ECP (E-LNG-ECP) is an improved formulation that both dissolves and is absorbed in the intestine rather than in the stomach so as to reduce the adverse events of nausea and vomiting. A pharmacokinetics study of E-LNG-ECP showed it to be bioequivalent with the previous, uncoated tablet with the use of the liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry method, although the time to peak value in blood plasma was significantly longer than that for the previous tablet (T<sub>max</sub>: 3.4 versus 1.8 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C20">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We conducted a Phase IV clinical trial in Chinese women to provide data on the efficacy and safety of the E-LNG-ECP as an OTC drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted in five family-planning clinics (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changsha, Changchun and Wuhan) in China from August 2009 to October 2010. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The study was performed in full compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice of China.</p><p>Subjects were healthy women who sought ECP to avoid unwanted pregnancy. According to drug law and regulations in China, the minimum number of enrolled women subjects required in a Phase IV clinical trial of contraceptives is 2000. Given the high loss of follow-up in clinical trials of OTC drugs (20%), we planned to include 2400 women. Inclusion criteria were the following: 15&#x02013;49 years old, regular menstrual cycle of 21&#x02013;35 days, a usually menstrual period duration of 3&#x02013;7 days and seeking EC within 72 h of unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure. Subjects were excluded if they had a contraindication to LNG, chronic disease with prolonged medication, a known or suspected pregnancy or if they were current or recent users of hormonal methods of contraception. All participants signed informed consent forms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Drug</title><p>The enteric-coated tablet contained 1.5 mg LNG (Nevenol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Regenex Pharmaceutical Corporation, Guangzhou, China). Participants were told to take one tablet orally within 72 h of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participants filled in a registration form to provide basic information when they came to pharmacies to purchase emergency contraceptives. Throughout the study, participants were asked to keep a daily diary to record the time of sexual intercourse and administration of E-LNG-ECP, adverse effects, vaginal bleeding, concomitant medication and contraceptive use. A follow-up interview (either by telephone or in a clinic) was carried out within 3 days of the administration of E-LNG-ECP, with the content mainly focusing on adverse events. The second follow-up was 5&#x02013;7 days after expected menses. If menses had occurred, the follow-up study ended. Women with negative pregnancy tests without menses on the expected date were contacted every 2 weeks, and periodic pregnancy testing was undertaken until menses resumed. Positive urinary pregnancy tests were confirmed by measurement of serum &#x003b2;-hCG and later by ultrasonography. The outcome of the pregnancies was obtained by further follow-ups.</p><p>The primary efficacy end-point was the rate of pregnancy in women who took E-LNG-ECP within 72 h of unprotected intercourse. The rate of side effects in women who received E-LNG-ECP within 72 h of unprotected intercourse was analyzed as a safety measurement. Serious side effects were defined in accordance with the female harmonization guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C6">Liao, 2004</xref>) and reported to the research center immediately by investigators<italic>.</italic> The principal investigator reviewed every pregnancy (enrolment and follow-up serum hCG concentrations, ultrasound dating, menstrual cycle and coital data) to establish whether conception clearly occurred before E-LNG-ECP was given or well after treatment (at least 10 days after treatment). Pregnancies that met these criteria were deemed to be incompatible with treatment failure. The efficacy of contraception (the fraction of expected pregnancies prevented) was estimated using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C17">Trussell <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the subjects who had taken ECPs in the past rated E-LNG-ECP versus other ECPs on a scale ranging from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The perceived advantages and disadvantages of E-LNG-ECP were also investigated in the follow-up interviews of participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Demographics, the efficacy of contraception and the frequency of adverse events in the observed cycle were described for the intention-to-treat population. The data were imputed and verified in two databases by two analyzers independently. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.0 (Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2566 subjects were enrolled in the study, 45 of whom were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility requirements (these 45 subjects were given E-LNG-ECP and there were no pregnancies). A total of 2521 were therefore eligible and treated with E-LNG-ECP; these women were all contacted for the first follow-up interview and were therefore included in the safety analysis. Of these, 2445 finished the study and were included in the efficacy analysis, while 76 women (with characteristics similar to the others) [3.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4&#x02013;3.8] were lost to follow-up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DER181F1">1</xref>, trial profile).

Among 1962 women who used contraception, the methods reported were: condoms (66.3%), ECPs (8.45%), oral contraceptive pills (1.55%), intrauterine device (0.28%), fertility awareness methods (0.6%) and spermicides (0.16%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>LNG was approved as an OTC emergency contraceptive drug by SFDA in 1998 in China and is mainly sold by community pharmacies, which provides convenient access for women. According to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of SFDA, the current study was a Phase IV clinical trial of a new tablet, E-LNG-ECP. A total of 2566 women who were seeking ECPs from community pharmacies in five cities were enrolled to assess the contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of E-LNG-ECP. This was the first large-sample post-marketing study of an emergency contraceptive as an OTC drug in China.</p><p>With both the LNG and Yuzpe regimens, the earlier the treatment begins the more effective it is. In a World Health Organization (WHO) large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of these methods, delaying the first dose by 12 h increased the odds of pregnancy by almost 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C11">Piaggio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In our study, the contraceptive efficacy of E-LNG-ECP was 95.3%, and the failure rate was 0.2%, significantly lower than failure rates in the RCTs of LNG conducted by WHO and other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C4">Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C14">Task Force on Post-ovulatory Methods of Fertility Regulation,1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C11">Piaggio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C19">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C1">Arowojolu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C18">von Hertzen H <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C8">Ngai <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/der181/DC1">Supplementary data, <italic>Table SI</italic></ext-link>) In our study, 82.7% of participants took the drug during the first 24 h after unprotected intercourse, while only 42&#x02013;46% did so in the WHO RCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C18">von Hertzen H <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Another study showed that the failure rates of ECPs during the first 24 h, 24&#x02013;48 h and 48&#x02013;72 h were 0.4, 1.2 and 2.7%, respectively (WHO, 1998). The superior efficacy of E-LNG-ECP found in this study might partially be related to the short interval between unprotected intercourse and taking the drug, and this short interval is good evidence of the easy accessibility of LNG ECP as an OTC drug. Subjects' knowledge about ECP was also helpful in reducing the time required to obtain the ECP. It should be pointed out that the failure rates of ECPs might vary in different studies because of differences in characteristics among populations (such as age, reasons for requesting EC, the time between coitus and drug administration).</p><p>In our study, only 165 women (7.1%) reported a side effect, and 13 women reported more than one side effect. The presence of side effects is lower than in previous studies, except for a similar incidence of menstrual bleeding disturbances. One of the highlights in the present study is the significantly lower rate of nausea and vomiting compared with that in clinical trials conducted in different reports (WHO, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C1">Arowojolu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C18">von Hertzen H <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Decreased nausea and vomiting are probably primarily related to the enteric-coated tablet, which avoids irritation of the stomach. No pregnancy was observed among subjects who vomited, but very few vomited, precluding further investigation. Also, we could not differentiate method failure from subject failure. The main reason women chose E-LNG-ECP was that they thought it could have fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, the incidence of side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, may also depend on psychological factors. If women know that the drug is a new and improved preparation, they may feel more reassured and be less apprehensive, which might decrease the incidence of nausea and vomiting.</p><p>The influence of LNG on menstruation was previously found to depend on when LNG was taken in the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C13">Raymond <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). Taking the drug during the first 3 weeks of one's cycle shortened the menstrual cycle and duration of menses, and this effect increased when it was taken even earlier in the 3-week period. In contrast, taking the LNG EC after ovulation had little influence on menstrual cycle length or duration of menses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DER181C15">Tirelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In our study, nearly 80% of participants did not experience any menstrual change during the first cycle after treatment, while 20.1% experienced a change in timing of onset of the next menses of &#x0003e;7 days. The duration and volume of menses were not affected.</p><p>The E-LNG-ECP was found to be acceptable by women in our study. Advantages described by participants included few side effects, satisfactory efficacy and ease of use, while disadvantages included gastrointestinal side effects (nausea), menstrual disturbance and high cost. An estimated 19% to 22% of women were not using any contraceptive method after ECP treatment, while another 7.5% were relying on ECPs, which are not as effective as any ongoing method of contraception.</p><p>The present study also investigated the accessibility of ECPs: 99.6% of participants who had used ECPs in the past had obtained them from community pharmacies rather than clinics. Moreover, participants' knowledge about EC mainly came from community pharmacies (75.4%), and only a small proportion of participants received counseling from clinicians (9.6%). The community pharmacy was not only a place for dispensing EC pills but also an important source of information about using the ECP correctly.</p><p>In summary, this study suggested that an LNG enteric-coated tablet was safe and effective for use as an OTC EC drug. The E-LNG-ECP remarkably reduced the gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. E-LNG-ECP should be available as an OTC drug in community pharmacies, while instructions on using ECPs that are dispensed by pharmacists or healthcare practitioners should be strengthened, particularly the importance of timing. Our findings provide convincing evidence for the safety, efficacy and accessibility of ECPs in an OTC setting; however, an RCT should be performed to compare results with the standard LNG treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/der181/DC1">Supplementary data are available at http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Authors' roles</title><p>L.C. supervised the whole study procedure, including conception, design and completion.
