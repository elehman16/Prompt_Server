Circulatory response to laryngeal and tracheal stimulation was known since 1940 (Reid and Brace).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The principle mechanism behind hypertension and tachycardia is an exaggerated sympathetic action due to increased catecholamine release.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This rise in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure is usually transient, variable and unpredictable, which may not be of much significance in healthy individuals but can be hazardous in those with hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, coronary artery disease or cerebro-vascular disease. Laryngoscopic response in such individuals can precipitate coronary insufficiency, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, left ventricular failure and cerebro-vascular hemorrhage.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods are in vogue to counter this hemodynamic response. Alpha-2 agonists have recently gained significance in attenuating the laryngo-sympathetic response.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dexmedetomidine, the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine (4,[5]-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-ethyl]) imidazole is a highly specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist. In recent studies, dexmedetomidine was shown to have clinically significant effects on anesthetic requirement and hemodynamic responses induced by anesthesia and surgery in patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Since tachycardia appears to be associated more frequently with myocardial ischemia than does hypertension,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] interesting approach towards attenuating cardiac responses to laryngeal stimulation is the use of &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonists. Among the &#x003b2;-adrenergic antagonists, esmolol (methyl 3-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropyl amino) propoxy-phenyl] propionate hydrochloride) is an effective option because it is ultra-short acting and can be administered intravenously. Dexmedetomidine is a recently introduced centrally acting alpha-2 agonist. Esmolol is a time tested effective &#x003b2;-blocker. Both of them have a good potential in reducing blood pressure and HR. Thus, we sought to compare the efficacy of both these drugs in countering the increased sympathetic response secondary to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. The modality of hemodynamic measurements and the parameters of comparison between the groups are the two essential zones distinguishing our study from several other similar studies done in the past.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval from Institutional Ethics Committee was obtained before starting the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients enrolled in the study. The duration of this prospective randomized double-blind study was 1-year. Patients in the age group of 20-40 years scheduled for general anesthesia from January 2012 to December 2012 were included in the study. Only the patients posted for major surgeries such as neuro-surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, long duration surgeries or surgeries with anticipated major fluid shifts were included in the study. They required invasive arterial line for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Patients with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, thyroid abnormalities and those on treatment with beta blockers were excluded from the study. Patients with an anticipated difficult airway and those in whom tracheal intubation took more than 30 s were also excluded from the study. Patients were randomly segregated into two groups using a computer generated randomization program. Patients in Group-D received dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg body weight in 20 ml normal saline over 5 min before induction. Patients in Group-E received esmolol 0.5 mg/kg body weight in 20 ml normal saline over 5 min before induction. After shifting the patient into the operating room, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, pulse oxymeter and electro cardiogram were connected, and an intravenous (IV) line was secured with 18-guage canula. Injection midazolam 1 mg was given IV as premedication. Arterial line was secured in the radial artery after giving local anesthesia and base line hemodynamics were recorded. Patient was preoxygenated for 5 min during when the study drug was also administered as IV infusion. The study drug was loaded in 20 ml syringe by an anesthetist who was blinded to the study, coded and handed over to another anesthetist who was blinded to the drug present in the syringe for administration. After 5 min of infusion and pre-oxygenation, anesthesia was induced with pentathol sodium 5 mg/kg body weight and succinylcholine 2 mg/kg body weight in a rapid sequence, followed by tracheal intubation by a reasonably experienced anesthetist. Subsequently fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg body weight were administered IV and the anesthesia was maintained on sevoflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide gas mixture. Invasive systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were recorded before giving the study drug, before induction of anesthesia, before tracheal intubation, immediately after tracheal intubation, at every 5 s within the 1<sup>st</sup> min and at 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min and 15 min after tracheal intubation. Simultaneously, NIBP was also measured for baseline, before induction, 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min and 15 min postintubation readings of SBP, DBP and MAP. The data was tabulated and analyzed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used to analyze the data.

The difference in the percentage change of MAP from the baseline at 10<sup>th</sup> s after intubation between the two groups was used to calculate the power of the study. Power of the study with 30 as size in each sample is 91%. So the sample size was adequate. The demographic profile was comparable in two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The percentage change of SBP (invasive), from the baseline was observed to be low in the dexmedetomidine group than in esmolol group at all-time points. But the difference was statistically significant only at 7 times points [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Similar trend was observed in the percentage change of invasive DBP and MAP. Statistically, significant difference was found between the two groups at 8 times points in DBP [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] and 11 times points in MAP [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Difference between the two groups was very rarely significant when the noninvasive SBP, DBP and MAP [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>] were analyzed though the percentage change from the baseline appeared to below in the dexmedetomidine group numerically. On the contrary, the percentage change of HR from the baseline was observed to be less in the dexmedetomidine group than in esmolol group, and the difference was statistically significant at almost all the time points of measurement [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Invasive SBP variation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Invasive DBP variation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Invasive mean arterial blood pressure variation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g004"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>NIBP variation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g005"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Variation in HR</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-383-g006"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many factors influence the cardiovascular changes associated with laryngoscopy and intubation. Age, drugs, type and duration of procedures, depth of anesthesia, hypoxia, hypercarbia etc., influence the pressor response. HR changes decrease with increasing age. Young patients show more extreme changes. Marked fluctuations in hemodynamic responses are often seen in geriatric patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, we selected the optimal age range of 20-40 years. Patients on antihypertensive drugs may exhibit a decrease in the pressor response. We excluded the patients on antihypertensive medications from our study.</p><p>A variable combination of drugs used for premedication, induction, relaxation and maintenance of anesthesia can influence the sympathetic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Midazolam decreases the blood pressure and increases the HR.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Glycopyrrolate premedication can moderately increase the HR.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Fentanyl is also a known modifier of laryngoscopic response. So we avoided these drugs before induction and intubation to see the exact effect of study drugs on larynogoscopic and intubation response. Thiopentone was selected for induction since it still continues to be the most popular agent for induction. In normovolemic patients, thiopentone 5 mg/kg can transiently decrease 10-20 mm Hg of blood pressure and increase the HR by 15-20 beats/min.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There is an increase in catecholamine levels, both noradernaline and adrenaline.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Succinylcholine has negative inotropic and chronotropic effect. It acts on the muscarinic receptors of sinoatrial node. A marked nor-adrenergic response was noted when intubation was performed under succinylcholine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The most significant factor during laryngoscopy influencing cardiovascular responses was found to be the duration of laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A linear increase in HR and MAP during the first 45 s was observed. Further prolongation had little effect. As the duration of laryngoscopy is normally &#x0003c;30 s, the results of studies in which it takes longer than this have less clinical relevance. The force applied during laryngoscopy has only minor effect.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, the duration of laryngoscopy and intubation was limited to 20 s.</p><p>A substantial amount of clinical research was done so far evaluating the efficacy of dexmedetomidine[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in attenuating pressor response to laryngoscopy. In those studies NIBP monitoring was used to measure the hemodynamic parameters at different time points. Studies were also there employing invasive monitoring for hemodynamic measurements in evaluating the role of dexmedetomidine in countering the pressor response.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Esmolol was also evaluated alone[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as in comparison with other pharmacological agents[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] regarding its role in attenuating laryngoscopic and intubation response. In most of the above previous clinical trials, the parameters of comparison were blood pressure and HR at different points of time before and after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. The mean SBP, DBP, MAP and HR were compared at similar points of time between the groups. But technically the most appropriate factor of clinical relevance in a laryngoscopic response is the fluctuation of hemodynamic parameters from the baseline than the absolute value. Thus in our study we principally compared the percentage change in all the four hemodynamic parameters from the baseline at similar points of time before and after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Another difference in the methodology of our study is employing invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring along with conventional NIBP monitoring. It usually takes an average of 40 s to measure blood pressure in oscillometry through NIBP monitoring. However, hemodynamic fluctuations occur continuously during and after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Thus with NIBP, recording the hemodynamic variations before 40 s is not possible. The differences in the results were very evident in our study.</p><p>When compared between dexmedetomidine and esmolol, statistically significant difference was observed in percentage change of invasive SBP at 7 times points in &#x0003c;1 min, but no statistically significant difference was found in percentage change in noninvasive SBP which was measured at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 min after intubation. Similar trend is also observed in DBP where a statistically significant difference was observed at 8 times points when measured invasively, but the difference was only at 1 time point, that is, at 3<sup>rd</sup> min when measured noninvasively. MAP also has the same trend showing a difference at 11 times points when measured invasively and at only 1 time point when measured noninvasively. The common point observed here is that the fluctuations in blood pressure are more within 1 min after intubation that could be traced only with the help of invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Statistically significant difference was observed in percentage change in HR at 11 times points in &#x0003c;1 min and at 1, 3, 5 and 10<sup>th</sup> min after tracheal intubation emphasizing the superiority of dexmedetomidine over esmolol in blunting the laryngo-tracheal response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that the dexmedetomidine is superior to esmolol in attenuating the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Brace</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Irritation of respiratory tract and its reflex effect on heart rate</article-title><source>Surg Gynaec Obstet</source><year>1940</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>157</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kovac</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Controlling the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>1996</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>63</fpage><lpage>79</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8695083</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dalton</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Guiney</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Myocardial ischemia from tachycardia and hypertension in coronary heart disease-patients undergoing anesthesia</article-title><source>Annual Meeting</source><year>1972</year><publisher-loc>Boston</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Society of Anesthesiologists</publisher-name><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>2</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kulka</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Tryba</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zenz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dose-response effects of intravenous clonidine on stress response during induction of anesthesia in coronary artery bypass graft patients</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1995</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>263</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7818111</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jaakola</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Salonen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheinin</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The analgesic action of dexmedetomidine &#x02013;
