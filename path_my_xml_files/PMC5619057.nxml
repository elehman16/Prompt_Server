to allow effective treatment. Criteria for diagnosis of preclinical AD suggested
by the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association include the use of molecular and structural
biomarkers. Preclinical diagnosis will enable testing of new drugs and forms of
treatment toward achieving successful preventive treatment. But what are the
advantages for the individual? To know that someone who is cognitively normal is
probably going to develop AD&#x02019;s dementia when there is no effective preventive
treatment is definitely not good news. A research method whereby volunteers are
assigned to receive treatment or placebo without knowing whether they are in the
control or at-risk arm of a trial would overcome this potential problem. If
these new criteria are used wisely they may represent a relevant milestone in
the search for a definitive treatment for AD.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><p>O diagn&#x000f3;stico da doen&#x000e7;a de Alzheimer (DA) quando j&#x000e1; existe

disease (AD) in the last 40 years, but effective treatments are not yet available.</p><p>The current diagnosis of AD is based on the criteria of the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke-Alzheimer Disease and Related
Disorder Association, which were published by McKhann and colleagues in 1984,<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> or on the criteria of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association
(1994).<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> According to these
criteria, the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease should be made only when dementia is
present, which is characterized by decline of memory and of at least one other cognitive
domain. To be characterized as dementia, this cognitive decline must be sufficiently
severe to interfere with social or professional activities of the individual.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The diagnosis of AD when there is dementia (or major neurocognitive disorder, a new
designation for dementia that may be included in the DSM-V)<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> may be too late to allow effective treatment of the
disease. The 1990s saw a growing interest in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a
condition where there is high risk for developing the dementia of AD.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> One of the main reasons for this
interest was that it could represent a time window when preventive therapies could be
more effective to avoid or delay the emergence of dementia. However, even MCI may
represent a relatively advanced stage of disease in the central nervous system, as is
revealed by structural neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and by the
failure of clinical trials designed to postpone the conversion of MCI to the dementia of
AD.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Suggestions of new
criteria for the diagnosis of AD have been proposed, incorporating biomarkers and
neuroimaging findings.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><sec><title>Preclinical AD</title><p>Some evidence indicates the neuropathological changes of AD begin years before the
appearance of any neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cognitively normal elderly individuals,
without complaints or objective evidence of cognitive decline, may have
neuropathological changes in the brain consistent with the diagnosis of AD,
indicating that there is a preclinical stage of the disease.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Criteria for diagnosis of preclinical AD were suggested by a workgroup sponsored by
the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association and recently presented at the International Conference
on AD and Related Disorders (ICAD) in Hawaii. A preliminary version was then
submitted to the community for appraisal.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>These criteria hold that preclinical diagnosis of AD is possible with the use of
biomarkers, which are able to, directly or indirectly, identify the presence of
neuropathological changes of AD.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Biomarkers</title><p>The main pathophysiological hypothesis for AD assumes that A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>
initiates a process called the amyloid cascade.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although the exact mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, the
toxic effects of oligomeric forms of this peptide and its deposition as protofibrils
and fibrils in the brain to form the amyloid plaques is followed by synaptic
dysfunction and the appearance of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing
hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Two types of biomarkers can be identified at this
stage when there are still no clinical or macroscopic changes of the disease. The
first evaluates the concentrations of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> and tau protein (or
phospho-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Low CSF-concentration of
A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>, associated with high CSF-concentration of tau protein,
has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AD. The second method is
based on a radioactive tracer injected into the blood stream that crosses the blood
brain barrier and binds to fibrillar forms of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>. The amount and
location of this radioactive tracer can be assessed with positron emission
tomography (PET). These two biomarkers have been called <italic>molecular</italic>
biomarkers of AD. With disease progression, characteristic hypometabolism in the
temporal-parietal pattern may be seen with fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET, and
later, brain atrophy can be identified with MRI. At this stage of preclinical AD,
cognition may be entirely normal or only very subtle signs of cognitive decline may
be present.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Advantages of preclinical diagnosis</title><p>Although these markers are not ideal, albeit due to their complexity or cost, or to
the fact that their sensitivity and specificity for predicting the actual risk of
developing MCI or AD are not yet well established, they may be extremely useful for
identifying asymptomatic individuals at high risk of AD and for allowing the search
for new drugs or other methods such as vaccines or genetic manipulations that might
slow or prevent progress of AD.</p><p>There are numerous examples in Medicine where advances in methods for early diagnosis
have changed the evolution of diseases. The first examples that spring to mind are
the early diagnosis of cancer or the treatment of hypertension or hyperlipidemia for
preventing myocardial infarction or stroke. Yet there is an example which more
closely resembles AD because it is also related to a cause of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>A historical perspective</title><p>Up until the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, neurosyphilis was the most frequent cause
of dementia. The discovery of the etiologic agent of syphilis in 1905 and of the
complement fixation reaction for diagnosis of syphilis in 1906 were very important
for the extraordinary reduction of the frequency of neurosyphilis that occurred
after only a few short decades.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>The complement fixation reaction for the diagnosis of syphilis or Wassermann&#x02019;s
reaction was the first biomarker that allowed evaluation of the results of different
types of treatments. From the arsenicals introduced by Paul Ehrlich, to the malaria
therapy described by Julius Wagner-Jauregg, and finally the penicillin discovered by
Alexander Fleming, to name only three Nobel Laureates, the existence of biomarkers
was key to following up the efficacy of the treatments.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> For neurosyphilis, besides the Wassermann&#x02019;s
reaction in blood and CSF, there were also other biomarkers in CSF allowing
diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis and monitoring of the outcome of treatments
that were able to prevent the onset of dementia and other neurological
disorders.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> It took less
than 40 years from the discovery of the first biomarker, the Wassermann&#x02019;s reaction,
to achieve the successful treatment of neurosyphilis.</p><p>It should be noted that to be truly effective, the treatment of neurosyphilis needs
to be carried out in the asymptomatic phase, as treatment in later stages when
dementia is already present can stabilize the clinical picture, and usually
precludes full recovery from the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This observation reinforces the
notion that for AD also, treatment probably has to be carried out before the
appearance of the clinical manifestations.</p><p>These historical facts strengthen the value of the preclinical diagnosis of AD. It is
highly probable that with biomarkers it will be possible to test new drugs and new
forms of treatments to achieve successful preventive treatment in the years to come.
Aging without AD will be one of the most important triumphs of the medical sciences,
and will probably cause deep changes in human society.</p></sec><sec><title>The individual at risk</title><p>However, there is an aspect that deserves particular concern on this point: What
about the advantages and disadvantages of the preclinical diagnosis for the
individual? To know that someone without cognitive impairment is going to develop
the dementia of AD when there is no current available treatment is definitely not
good news. We are faced with a dilemma: to test new treatments for this condition
and thereby reach a cure or delay the onset of dementia is very important for
humankind. However, being aware of one&#x02019;s preclinical diagnosis of AD is not very
useful for an individual who is cognitively normal, and may even have a
destabilizing effect. Clearly, biomarkers are undoubtedly relevant for confirming
diagnosis in cases where cognitive decline is already present.</p><p>Borrowing from history again, it is well known that there are conditions where the
preclinical diagnosis is possible, but does not represent any clear advantage. To
remain in the field of dementia, the best example is perhaps Huntington&#x02019;s disease.
In this autosomal dominant disease, it is possible to ascertain whether the
individual has inherited the mutation by doing a genetic test. The accuracy of the
genetic test is almost 100% in predicting if the individual is going to develop the
clinical disease or not. As an effective treatment is not yet available, the
decision to be submitted to the genetic test is very fraught with problems.
Accordingly, the Huntington&#x02019;s Disease Society of America states, &#x0201c;the decision
whether to test or not is intensely personal and there is no &#x02018;right&#x02019; answer.&#x0201d;
<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The situation is even more difficult in AD, because the accuracy of the preclinical
diagnosis is not known and is lower than in Huntington&#x02019;s disease. It should be
pointed out that in the preliminary version of the Criteria for Preclinical
Diagnosis of AD suggested by the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association it is clearly stated that
&#x0201c;these are not intended to serve as diagnostic criteria for clinical
purposes&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>A possible approach</title><p>To be able to test for new treatments of individuals at risk without unnecessarily
discovering an unexpected risk for which there is no available treatment may be
possible by using a research method where volunteers in their fifties or sixties are
included to receive treatment or placebo without knowing whether they are in the
control or at-risk arm of the trial. Naturally, any individual is entitled to be
informed of their risk status, but only after the limitations of the diagnostic
tests as well as the absence of effective treatment, have been made clear.</p><p>If these new criteria are adopted wisely they may represent a relevant milestone in
the search for the definitive treatment of AD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Disclosure: The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McKhann</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Drachman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Folstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: report of the
