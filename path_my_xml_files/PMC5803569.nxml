Patients are generally conscious and have basic normal brainpower, but some patients will appear to have cognitive impairment in the course of disease. Clinical studies show that duration of schizophrenia is generally persistent and recurring; some patients may even have exacerbated or worsened conditions, but some patients will eventually decline and have mental disability, which seriously disrupts normal order of life of patients and their families and reduces their quality of life [<xref rid="j_med-2017-0070_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
