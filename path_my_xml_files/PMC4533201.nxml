We further found that ageing and active smoking had an individual significant influence on IS. Finally, our data suggest that major CV risk factors do not significantly affect the beneficial effect of mechanical PostC on IS.</p><p>Several small clinical trials have shown that applying ischaemic PostC at the time of reperfusion significantly reduced the cardiac enzyme release by up to 40%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> IS reduction by PostC persists at 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a recent meta-analysis of 10 randomised trials including 560 patients, Zhou <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> confirmed the significant reduction of IS by PostC. This is also concordant with a recent review by Heusch.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Very few studies have assessed the interaction of traditional CV risk factors and demographic characteristics on PostC effect in humans. Only one recent meta-analysis of 10 randomised clinical PostC trials in patients with STEMI<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> assessed the interaction of traditional CV risk factors with ischaemic PostC. In this meta-analysis, Zhou <italic>et al</italic> showed that only gender, age and use of direct stenting had a significant interaction with PostC. The effect of PostC was more pronounced among young and male patients, and among those in whom direct stenting techniques were used. Our results on individual patient data do not confirm this significant interaction with age and gender. Furthermore, we could not assess the effect of direct stenting due to our trials protocol design where direct stenting was the only revascularisation technique applied. These differences can be explained by differences in study populations, sample size and type of analysis. Zhou <italic>et al</italic> included various study populations and different PostC protocols in their analysis. Also, their analyses were not performed on raw data from these different studies. In comparison, our analysis presents results with a single PostC protocol as well as a complete analysis over all available raw data.</p><p>In our analysis, older age was associated with a significant reduction in IS without causing a concomitant reduction of ischaemic PostC. This might be related to a higher frequency of coronary multivessel disease and collateral blood flow in older patients. The effect of age on myocardial response to ischaemia and reperfusion is complex. Experimental studies show that older cardiomyocytes have a decreased tolerance to stress associated with decreased mitochondrial and contractile function and an increased susceptibility to apoptosis and necrosis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In our study, active smokers had signficantly larger infarcts compared to non-smokers. Smoking contributes to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease by several mechanisms including endothelial disturbance, changes in &#x0fb01;brin formation and turnover, altered blood rheology, changes in lipids and lipoproteins and reduced availability of antioxidants. Some ischaemia-reperfusion experimental studies have reported an increase in myocardial IS after tobacco exposure in rats.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In humans, Robinson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> also showed that smokers had higher peak cardiac enzyme concentrations following an acute coronary syndrome. The effect of cigarette smoking on the cardioprotective pathways remains poorly explored. However, we did not observe any impact of smoking on the protective effect of ischaemic preconditioning (PC).</p><p>Another finding of our study is that traditional CV risk factors did not seem to have a significant influence on the protective effect of PostC. The interference of different traditional factors on PostC effect was suggested by several experimental studies. These studies had controversial findings in different ischaemia-reperfusion experimental settings. Iliodromitis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that hypercholesterolaemia significantly hampered IS reduction by ischaemic PostC, while Donato <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> did not find any significant confounding effect. Similarly, ischaemic PostC did not significantly reduce IS in spontaneously hypertensive rats,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> but was protective in rats with pressure overload-induced LV hypertrophy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This underscores the limits of experimental models in trying to reproduce the full picture of acute ischaemic syndromes in humans. It also shows the differences that might be related to differences in species.</p><p>Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for CV morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction in the literature. However, this higher mortality rate cannot be explained by differences in IS, determined either by biomarkers release<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> or by MRI.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The complexity of this subject has recently been emphasised with studies showing that an increase in IS is associated with hyperglycaemia on admission and its significant association with adverse outcomes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Experimental studies have suggested that diabetes and hyperglycaemia may have a direct detrimental effect on ischaemic myocardium and alter endothelial microvascular function. High glucose levels and diabetes are associated with increases in reactive oxygen species generation and induce impaired myocardial oxygen consumption. In experimental models, diabetes was associated with a significant loss of the ischaemic PostC cardioprotective effect.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, there are very little clinical data on this specific subject<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the interaction remains to be further explored in human patients. Our study did not show any significant interaction between diabetes and ischaemic PostC.</p><p>Ischaemic PostC in patients with STEMI represents a new therapeutic strategy to decrease IS and improve clinical outcome in patients with STEMI. However, the level of evidence and the technical requirements of mechanical PostC limit its applicability to all patients with STEMI. A significant number of patients cannot benefit from this intervention which relies on a primary PCI strategy. Mechanical PostC is also difficult to combine with recent technical modifications such as thrombus aspiration. The clinical bene&#x0fb01;ts of PostC techniques have yet to be demonstrated in large clinical trials. Trials with clinical end points are underway (eg, Cyclosporine and Prognosis in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients (CIRCUS), ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01502774A) and will bring important findings on the place of PostC strategies in patients with STEMI. Of note, comorbidities and traditional CV risk factors might not necessarily have a similar influence on pharmacological than on ischaemic PostC.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study limitations</title><p>First, the sample size was small and was constituted by pooling populations of four different clinical trials realised within our multicentre network at different time points. The limited size of our study sample, as well as a posteriori statistical analysis, limits our power to discriminate any effect that could exist from one of the CV risk factors studied.</p><p>We had full access to all clinical databases from these trials and all these clinical trials shared the same PostC protocol and same exclusion and inclusion criteria. We tested the heterogeneity between the different studies by comparing population baseline characteristics between each study and we did not find any significant difference. During the different inclusion periods from July 2004 to October 2010, significant changes in international guidelines and therapeutic management of patients with STEMI occurred, and could have induced a potential bias of confounding factors.</p><p>Finally, we found a significant difference for the AAR measure between the PostC and control groups in the pooled population. This difference, however, is in favour of the control group, the ACS being significantly greater in the PC group. In all previous trials, there was a consistent trend of the ACS being larger in the PC group, although not reaching significance. The pooling of the individual data from each one of these trials and the addition of the control group from the Piot <italic>et al</italic> trial made this difference significant. However, we do not think this affects the results and conclusions presented in our manuscript.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we confirmed the significant IS reduction effect by mechanical PostC in patients with STEMI. The cardioprotective effect of mechanical PostC is not influenced by traditional CV risk factors that are prevalent in patients with STEMI.

They will also provide further data on the relationship between patient's characteristics and PostC techniques efficiency.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors contributed to refinement of the study protocol and approved the final manuscript and patients recruitment.&#x000a0;CG, TB-A and SP were responsible for design, analysis and interpretation of data.&#x000a0;SP, NM and MO was involved in proof writing and MO is the guarantor.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This project was supported by a research grant from the Hospices Civils de Lyon and from the ministry of health.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Patient consent:</bold> Obtained.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boersma</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Maas</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Deckers</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
