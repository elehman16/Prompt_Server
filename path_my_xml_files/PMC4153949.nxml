Few studies have addressed the efficacy of increasing the length of the pancreatico-biliary limb.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here, we present a prospective randomized study of 187 consecutive laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass operations operated over 2&#x000a0;years (2004&#x02013;2005) in Iceland. The patients were operated with a gastric bypass with either a 2-m biliopancreatic (BP)-limb and a 60-cm alimentary (A)-limb (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;93) or with a 150-cm A-limb and a 60-cm BP-limb (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;94).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Preoperative median BMI was 44.1 (38&#x02013;70), median age 35.5 (17&#x02013;74) years, and 85&#x000a0;% of the patients were female. Follow-up rate after 5&#x000a0;years was 85&#x000a0;%. Eighteen months following surgery, the weight loss was significantly higher in the BP-limb group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and this difference remained 7&#x000a0;years after surgery. Weight regain occurred in both groups, and 7&#x000a0;years after surgery, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) was 78.4&#x000a0;% in the BP-limb group compared to 67.1&#x000a0;% in the A-limb group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Most patients (78&#x000a0;%) needed supplementation adjustment (iron, vitamin D and calcium) during the study period, significantly more often in the BP-limb group compared to the A-limb group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

The operation results in excess weight loss (EWL) of 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% after 1 to 2&#x000a0;years with high resolution of co-morbidities, but some patients regain significant weight, especially super obese patients. In order to improve results and to find the appropriate balance between benefits and side effects and metabolic sequels, studies with different limb lengths have been performed.</p><p>Many studies have been performed with variable lengths of the Roux limb (alimentary (A)-limb), ranging from 45 to 250&#x000a0;cm; they show no or marginal difference in the effect on weight loss. Four of them are randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but most are retrospective comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most of these studies are of small volume and not showing data beyond 5&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Many authors have demonstrated that weight loss after bariatric surgery and resolution of co-morbidities are strongly associated with a short common channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but the shorter the common channel, the more malabsorption and metabolic problems can be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, it should also be noted that no reference can be made to the effect of the ratio of the Roux to the biliopancreatic (BP)-limbs on weight loss and co-morbidity resolution outcomes as there is no available literature that has investigated this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, long-term weight loss data (&#x0003e;5&#x000a0;years) are not available from randomized controlled trials and are extremely limited in studies of other design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, most authors believe that this ratio is unlikely to have any significant impact on outcome compared to the ratio of the Roux/BP to the common channel length.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the RYGBP with a 200-cm BP-limb (long BP) to a more commonly performed RYGBP with a 150-cm long alimentary limb (150-cm A-limb) and a 60-cm BP-limb (long A) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The long-term effects on weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities, gastro-intestinal symptoms, metabolic parameters and complications were examined.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic drawing of the operation with 150-cm A-limb or 200-cm BP-limb</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11695_2014_1245_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Prior to this study, our standard laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with gastric pouch approximately 40&#x000a0;ml, biliopancreatic limb (BP-limb) of 200&#x000a0;cm and alimentary limb (A-limb) of 50&#x000a0;cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. With this procedure, we had a problem with a high incidence of marginal ulcers (16.6&#x000a0;% of patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Six (comment 1, reviewer 2) months before the study starts, we changed our procedure to a RYGBP with a gastric pouch of approximately 15&#x000a0;ml, BP-limb of 200&#x000a0;cm and A-limb of 60&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>Between January 2004 and December 2005, all 187 morbidly obese patients who underwent primary RYGBP at our institution were included in the study. The same surgical team (HG, BGL) performed all operations. The patient selection criteria were BMI <underline>&#x0003e;</underline> 40 or BMI <underline>&#x0003e;</underline> 35 with associated co-morbidity due to obesity (European Guidelines). Prior to surgery, patients participated in a multidisciplinary outpatients&#x02019; preparation program, as described in detail earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and contracted to follow our follow-up program. A protocol was designed at the outset of the study for random allocation of the patients to either of the two arms. The surgical arms are illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Postoperatively, patients were instructed to take standard supplementation of vitamins and minerals including multivitamin, calcium citrate, vitamin B-12 and vitamin D. Patients were followed up at the outpatient clinic with weight registration and metabolic surveillance, first after 3&#x000a0;months and then every 6&#x000a0;months for 3&#x000a0;years, then once a year.</p><p>Resolution of diabetes type 2 was defined as patient without diabetic medication and with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) within the normal range. Resolution of hypertension was defined as patient without treatment having blood pressure less than 140/90. Patients using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) were considered to have sleep apnoea.</p><p>Six to 7&#x000a0;years after surgery, patients received a standardized questionnaire including gastro-intestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). It is an interview-based rating scale consisting of 15 items, originally constructed for the assessment of gastro-intestinal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome and peptic ulcer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For the GSRS, the following five dimensions were used in this study: abdominal pain syndrome (three items), reflux syndrome (two items), indigestion syndrome (four items), diarrhoea syndrome (three items), and constipation syndrome (three items).</p><p>This study was approved by the institutional review board and the Icelandic scientific ethical committee VSNa2001050041.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data from all the patients during the study period were prospectively collected in a proprietary database as part of the hospital records. Proportions are referred to as numbers (%). Continuous data are presented as median and range unless otherwise stated. Differences between proportions were evaluated using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Median differences between groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Comparison of mean percentage excess BMI loss (EBMIL%) between groups was done using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. A <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Weight loss was expressed as percentage excess BMI loss (EBMIL%) plotted against time from operation.

All statistical computations were performed using the SPSS version 21.0 for MacOS (SPSS Inc., Chicago).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surgical Procedure</title><p>Five ports were used: two 5-mm and two 12-mm ports for instruments and one 10-mm port for the camera. A small gastric pouch (15&#x000a0;ml) was created with a 3.5-mm stapler (Endo-GIA II, Tyco/US Surgical). The greater omentum was then split vertically to allow a tension-free antecolic gastro-jejunal anastomosis (GJ anastomosis). The ligament of Treitz was identified, and jejunum measured (loose, not stretched using markers on the graspers) (comment 2, reviewer 2) 60 or 200&#x000a0;cm according to the group included (long A or long BP). The bowel was brought up, first as an omega loop in an antecolic and antegastric fashion, and the GJ anastomosis was created by stapling the jejunum to the posterior wall of the gastric pouch using a linear stapler (3.5-mm stapler). The entero-entero anastomosis (EE anastomosis) was created as a side-to-side anastomosis either 60 or 150&#x000a0;cm below the GJ anastomosis using a 2.5-mm stapler. The remaining openings were hand-sutured and the omega loop divided by the 2.5-mm stapler. The last step was testing the integrity of the gastro-jejunostomy by inflating it with methylene-blue-dyed saline via an NG tube. The mesenteric defects were not closed. Our surgical procedure at the time has previously been described in detail in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results of 187 consecutive patients equally distributed (2&#x02013;3 patients weekly) over a 2-year period (2004&#x02013;2005) are presented.

Both the amount of initial weight loss and the risk of later weight regain are issues that need addressing. The mechanisms behind the effect of gastric bypass are not yet fully understood. We chose to study the effect of different limb lengths in a group of consecutive patients, including both morbidly and super obese.</p><p>We found that the longer BP-limb patients did better in terms of weight loss and showed less weight regain over a 7-year period. This effect was achieved at the price of more GI symptoms and a higher need of supplementation.</p><p>Why does the 200-cm BP-limb RYGPB results in greater weight loss than the 150-cm A-limb? When performing gastric bypass with a 200-cm BP-limb, the whole jejunum (in most patients) is bypassed and the upper anastomosis is in fact a gastro-ileal anastomosis. The proposed mechanisms could be the following: (a) Food directly to the ileum could affect food tolerance and thereby eating behaviour, and (b) by creating a 200-cm BP-limb, most of the foregut is bypassed altering more, or differently, hormonal and immunological factors. We think the main mechanism is probably the different profile of the GI hormones as demonstrated by numerous recent studies on metabolic surgery (comment 8, reviewer 2). (c) In the 200-cm BP-limb group, 50&#x000a0;cm more of the intestine is bypassed creating consequently a shorter common channel.</p><p>In our database, we have measured the total small intestinal length in 650 patients to be 620&#x000a0;cm (420&#x02013;870&#x000a0;cm) (unpublished results). Thus, the common channel in our study will be more than 3&#x000a0;m in most patients. There is convincing evidence that the degree of malabsorption after gastric bypass is influenced mainly by the length of the common channel rather than the lengths of the Roux or biliopancreatic limbs as bypass is currently constructed by the majority of bariatric surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, the common channel in our study is probably long enough to ensure full uptake of calories, so malabsorption of calories will not explain the difference in weight loss between the two groups. The tendency of the two curves to converge in the super obese group should be interpreted with caution as this is based on few data points. There may also be a follow-up bias favouring those with weight regain problems. Further, follow-up will reveal whether this tendency will hold.</p><p>The metabolic problems associated with biliopancreatic diversion and very long limb RYGBP are mostly due to the short common limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>We found that 2-m BP-limb is associated with more micronutrient deficiency than 60-cm BP-limb and 150-cm long A-limb, especially iron and calcium deficiency, but these elements are known to be primarily absorbed from the proximal part of the intestines. However, most patients in both groups needed frequent adjustments of their supplementation also 5&#x000a0;years or more after surgery, emphasizing the need for lifelong follow-up after gastric bypass.</p><p>Six to 7&#x000a0;years after surgery, gastro-intestinal symptoms were similar in both study groups; the only significant difference was more frequent and looser stools in the BP-limb group. Gastro-intestinal symptoms usually diminish or disappear over time, and differences in symptoms between groups may have been more pronounced earlier after surgery.</p><p>Before this study (in our learning curve), we performed a gastric bypass with a 2-m BP-limb and a large gastric pouch (50&#x000a0;ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; this resulted in high ulcer rate (17&#x000a0;%); the pouch could dilate and many patient had GI symptoms. By reducing the pouch to 15&#x000a0;ml and taking good care of the vascularisation of the major curvature flap, the ulcer rate dropped to 9&#x000a0;% (same in between groups) and the GI symptoms diminished.</p><p>Differences in technique other than limb length (such as size of gastric pouch or stoma size) may account for weight loss differences and make it difficult to compare weight loss results between different studies.</p><p>Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] performed loop (mini) gastric bypass with the BP-limb tailored according to patients&#x02019; BMI from 150 to 350&#x000a0;cm and describe a linear relationship between the reduction in BMI and the BP-limb length. In accordance to our results, the same group found that a routine use of 2-m BP-limb mini bypass not only increased weight loss but also increased the incidence of late nutritional deficiencies, especially anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>We conclude that a gastric bypass with a 2-m BP-limb gives a better long-term weight loss than gastric bypass with a 150-cm A-limb, with similar complication rate, but with more nutritional deficiency. This difference is unlikely due to more malabsorption but more likely caused by other mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d30e1448"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest and the study has not been supported by any grants.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>EE</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gastric bypass</article-title><source>Ann Surg</source><year>1969</year><volume>170</volume><fpage>329</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/00000658-196909010-00003</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5804373</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brolin</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenler</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorman</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-limb gastric bypass in the super obese.
