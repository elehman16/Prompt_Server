(3) MBPc, and two controls groups (n = 4). After immersion in 0.2% Rhodamine B

development ceases. Consequently, the root canal is large, with thin and fragile walls,
and the apex remains open<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The aim
of the treatment of teeth with open apex is to seal a sizeable communication between the
root canal system and the periradicular tissue, and provide a barrier against which
filling material can be compacted<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.
Materials such as calcium hydroxide and, more recently, mineral trioxide aggregate
(MTA), have been used as apical plugs<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>MTA was developed by Torabinejad in the early 1990s, and the first study on this
material was published by Lee, et al.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (1993). In 2001, a Brazilian company (Angelus Solu&#x000e7;&#x000f5;es
Odontol&#x000f3;gicas, Londrina, PR, Brazil) introduced to the market the MTA developed
in Brazil, which is apparently identical to the MTA developed by Torabinejad<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The main components of MTA are tricalcium oxide, tricalcium silicate,
bismuth oxide, tricalcium aluminate, tricalcium oxide, tetracalcium aluminoferrite and
silicate oxide. In addition, there are a few other mineral oxides, which are responsible
for the chemical and physical properties of MTA. The powder consists of fine hydrophilic
particles that form a colloidal gel in the presence of water or moisture; this gel
solidifies to form a hard sealer in less than 4h<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p><p>In 2004, a material similar to MTA was developed for clinical use in Argentina under the
brand name CPM<sup>TM</sup> (Egeo S.R.L., Buenos Aires, Argentina). The powder also
consists of fine hydrophilic particles that form a colloidal gel in presence of
moisture, solidifying to form a hard sealer in 1 h. The main components are tricalcium
silicate, tricalcium oxide, tricalcium aluminate and other oxides<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>In 1984, the investigators Moraes and Berbert, from the Department of Operative
Dentistry, Endodontics and Dental Materials at Bauru Dental School, University of
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil., developed a epoxy resin sealer containing calcium hydroxide
(MBPc), which was introduced as a root-end filling material. MBPc is packed in glass
vials as a hydrophobic paste/paste sealer, mixed in a 4:1 ratio (base paste:catalyst
paste), with 4 h of setting time<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>The quality of apical sealing obtained by rootend filling materials has been assessed
using different methodologies such as dye penetration<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, bacterial
penetration<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, endotoxin<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, human saliva penetration<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and fluid filtration technique<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Studies on dye
penetration were considered an easy method to evaluate root-end filling
materials<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has also been used
to assess the adaptation and the sealing ability of root-end filling materials<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>The purposes of this study were to evaluate the sealing ability, by dye leakage, and the
marginal adaptation, by SEM, of apical plugs fabricated with gray MTA
Angelus<sup>TM</sup>, CPM<sup>TM</sup> and MBPc, as well as to verify the existence
of a correlation between apical leakage and marginal adaptation in the tested
materials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Specimen Preparation</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bauru Dental School
(133/2005). Ninety-eight extracted single-rooted human teeth (upper central and
lateral incisors) were used for this study. The teeth were stored in 10% formalin for
a period of 8 weeks<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and kept
moist before the experiment. The tooth crowns were removed below the cementoenamel
junction to obtain a standard root length of 13 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Canal Preparation</title><p>At first, the canals were instrumented with Gates Glidden burs #5 up to #1
(Dentsply-Maillefer Instruments SA, Ballaigues, Switzerland) according to the
crown-down technique until the #1 size bur could pass through the apical foramen. The
specimens were then prepared with K files (Dentsply-Maillefer Instruments SA,
Ballaigues, Switzerland), starting with an ISO file #50 until an ISO file #90 could
be visualized 1 mm beyond the apex. The root canals were irrigated with 1mL of 1%
sodium hypochlorite (Biodin&#x000e2;mica Qu&#x000ed;mica e Farmac&#x000ea;utica Ltda.,
Ibipor&#x000e3;, PR, Brazil) throughout instrumentation. The canals were filled with 1
mL of 17% EDTA (Biodin&#x000e2;mica Qu&#x000ed;mica e Farmac&#x000ea;utica Ltda) for 5
min and then dried with paper points (Tanariman Industrial Ltda, Manacapuru, AM,
Brazil).</p><p>The teeth were then allocated to 3 experimental groups (n=30), according to the
sealer used for fabrication of the 5-mm-thick apical plug - gray MTA
Angelus<sup>TM</sup>, CPM<sup>TM</sup> and MBPc, and 2 control groups (n=4), which
did not receive an apical plug. In the experimental groups, the external surface of
each root, except for the apical foramen, was made impermeable by application of a
layer of epoxy adhesive (Araldite-Ciba-Geigy, Tabo&#x000e3;o da Serra, SP, Brazil),
followed by two coats of nail polish (Cosbra Cosm&#x000e9;ticos Ltda., S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, SP, Brazil)<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In the negative controls, the external surface of
each root, including the apical foramen, was made impermeable<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; in the positive controls, the external surface of each root was
made impermeable, except for the apical foramen<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Apical Plugs</title><p>Gray MTA Angelus<sup>TM</sup> was prepared following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions,
mixed at a 1:1 ratio (powder:sterile water) and carried with a Lentulo spiral
(Dentsply-Maillefer Instruments SA, Ballaigues, Switzerland) at low speed up to 3 mm
short of the apical foramen. The MTA was condensed up to the apical end with an ISO K
file #90 wrapped in cotton. Another K file involved with moistened cotton was used to
remove the excess MTA from the dentin walls. In case of overfilling, the excess
material was also removed.</p><p>CPM<sup>TM</sup> was also prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions,
mixed at a 3:1 ratio (powder:saline solution) and carried with a Lentulo spiral at
low speed, in the same way as described for gray MTA Angelus<sup>TM</sup>.
CPM<sup>TM</sup> condensation and excess removal was performed as described for
the MTA.</p><p>MBPc was mixed at a 4:1 ratio (base paste:catalyst paste). Before mixture, small
cylindrical portions of the sealer were prepared, with smaller diameter than the root
canal diameter. These cylinders were individually placed in the root canal using an
ISO K file #70 up to the root canal end. The MBPc was condensed with pluggers and any
overfilling material was removed with care avoid compressing the sealer against the
apex. Radiographs were obtained from all teeth to check the thickness of the apical
plug.</p><p>After fabrication of apical plugs, the remaining root canal portions were filled with
a calcium hydroxide water-based paste (Odontopharma Ind&#x000fa;stria e
Com&#x000e9;rcio Ltda, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil) and placed in an oven at 37&#x000ba;C
for 15 days. After this period, the calcium hydroxide waterbased paste was removed by
irrigation with saline, with aid an ISO K file #100. The root canals were dried with
paper points (Tanariman Industrial Ltda, Manacapuru, AM, Brazil) and filled by the
lateral condensation technique., using gutta-percha points (Tanariman Industrial
Ltda, Manacapuru, AM, Brazil) and endodontic sealer (Sealer 26) (Dentsply
Ind&#x000fa;stria e Com&#x000e9;rcio Ltda, Petr&#x000f3;polis, RJ, Brazil).</p></sec><sec><title>Apical Leakage</title><p>The root surfaces were isolated with one layer of Araldite and two layers of nail
polish. The cervical portion of each root was recovered by immersion in sticky wax
followed by application of two layers of nail polish. The teeth of each group,
properly identified, were fixated on utility wax and were placed in plastic flasks,
leaving the apex free and facing upwards. The flasks were filled with 0.2% Rhodamine
B solution (Labsynth Produtos para Laborat&#x000f3;rios Ltda, Ara&#x000e7;atuba, SP,
Brazil; pH 7.0) in such a way to completely cover the apex of all teeth. The flasks
were kept at 37&#x000ba;C for 48 h. After that period, the teeth were removed from the
dye, washed in running tap water for 24 h, dried and sectioned longitudinally.</p><p>Then, sets of five specimens were placed on a sheet of utility wax and photographed
with a digital camera (Canon EOS Rebel 300 D) fixed on a tripod. The teeth were also
photographed close to a millimeter plastic ruler. For analysis of the sealing ability
of the tested materials, leakage of 0.2% Rhodamine B was linearly measured on the
photographs using the software Image Tool 3.0. Leakage measurement considered the
line with longer length of dye, on the apical plugdentin wall interface, from the
most apical to the most cervical portion. Statistical analysis of the results was
performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn tests at 5% significance level.</p></sec><sec><title>Marginal Adaptation</title><p>The marginal adaptation was evaluated in the 90 specimens (halves). These segments
were gold-sputtered and analyzed by JEOL JSM T-220 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) SEM at
&#x000d7;35 and &#x000d7;150 magnifications. For analysis of the marginal adaptation of
the root-end filling materials, the photomicrographs at &#x000d7;35 magnification were
analyzed on the software Image Tool 3.0 and the extent of gap was measured linearly,
in micrometers. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the
Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn tests at 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The sealing ability of the apical plugs fabricated from the different root-end filling

there was no dye penetration in negative controls.</p><p>Several methodologies can be used to evaluate apical leakage. Among these we could
mention endotoxin<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, human
saliva<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, fluid
filtration<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and bacterial leakage tests<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, we
agree with Aqrawabi<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> who stated that
if root-end filling materials were able to prevent leakage of small particles such as
dye, they would possibly prevent the penetration of bacteria and their subproducts.</p><p>Various substances have been used to delineate apical leakage. Among the dyes, the use
of methylene blue at different concentrations is outstanding<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. However, Wu, et al.<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (1998) conducted an interesting work and
stated that methylene blue suffers discoloration when in contact with some alkaline
filling materials, which may cause unrealistic results of such materials in leakage
studies. Methylene blue discoloration occurs because it is unstable when in contact with
alkaline materials. Such materials cause hydrolysis of methylene blue, resulting in
formation of a clear compound named thionine. This would explain why methylene blue is
discolored by calcium hydroxide. In relation to MTA, in the presence of water, calcium
oxide in the material could form calcium hydroxide, which would certainly cause
discoloration of methylene blue. In this study, a 0.2% Rhodamine B solution was used
because according to Moraes, et al.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
(2005) and Tanomaru Filho, et al.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
(2005) , Rhodamine B is not influenced by alkaline materials.</p><p>Regarding marginal adaptation analysis, Torabinejad, et al.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> showed that the specimen preparation for SEM
investigation could create artificial/artifacts gaps within the interface. The authors
suggest the use of resin replicas to avoid artificial gaps. At first, we tried to use
this methodology in our study, but the resin replicas obtained were not sufficient good.
So, considering other studies<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> that showed satisfactory results using
gold-sputtering and SEM investigation we adopted this methodology to evaluate the
marginal adaptation. All specimens were evaluated because no artificial/artifacts gaps
within the interface dentin wall/root-end filling material occurred.</p><p>Investigation of gray MTA was based on the frequency of utilization when apical plugs
are necessary, with excellent results<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Gray
MTA-Angelus<sup>TM</sup> was used instead of gray ProRoot MTA<sup>TM</sup>
(Dentsply/Tulsa Dental, USA) in order to use a national product, which is also easier to
find in the market.</p><p>According to the manufacturer, CPM<sup>TM</sup> has similar or better physical, chemical
and biological characteristics compared to MTA, with the same clinical
indications<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. As this material
is also a mineral trioxide aggregate, this study evaluated the possibility of using it
as apical plug, as well as its sealing ability and marginal adaptation, since few
studies are available on CPM<sup>TM</sup>.</p><p>MBPc was also used because its physical and chemical characteristics have been assessed,
showing great results<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. A previous
study has shown similar biological response to that of ProRoot MTA<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Since the initial clinical indications
of this material included only use for root-end filling and filling of root
perforation<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, the possibility
of using this material for fabrication of apical plug was investigated in the present
study.</p><p>Calcium hydroxide was used before the root canal filling to allow the materials to set.
A research study<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and some case
reports<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> support the two-step technique over the onestep
procedure. Besides, calcium hydroxide, when used as an intracanal medication, should
stay in the root canal, at least, for 15 days<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>The study of Bramante, et al.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (2006)
allows comparison between CPM<sup>TM</sup> and the present results. According to the
authors, CPM<sup>TM</sup> has dimensional adhesion stability through time, among other
properties. However, the results observed for this material with regard to sealing
ability were not so good, with a mean overall leakage of 4.00 &#x000b1; 1.00 mm.</p><p>With regard to MTA, the great sealing ability of both Pro Root<sup>TM</sup> MTA and gray
MTA-Angelus<sup>TM</sup>, used in this study, were highlighted by several
authors<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Conversely, in the study of Silva Neto
and Moraes<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, MTA was not considered a
good sealer. When used as apical plug, especially with 4- to 5-mm thickness, MTA has
shown great sealing ability<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Consequently, the
results observed for gray MTA-Angelus<sup>TM</sup> in this study confirm those found in
the aforementioned studies.</p><p>MBPc has been shown to have good sealing ability as a root-end filling
material<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Similar behavior has
been observed in the present study, in which MBPc had the best results with only 1.99
&#x000b1; 1.44 mm of leakage, with statistically significant difference in relation to
CPM<sup>TM</sup> and gray MTA-Angelus<sup>TM</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the two variables analyzed in this study, there was clearly a lack of
correlation between apical leakage rates and gaps at the dentin wall/root-end filling
material interface. These findings are contrary to those of Stabholz, et al.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (1985) ,who evaluated, <italic>in
vitro</italic>, the marginal adaptation of retrograde fillings with Restodent, zinc
phosphate cement, Cavit-W, Duralon and amalgam by SEM. The results were compared with
those of a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study which used a radionuclidic model for
comparing sealability of the same five retrograde fillings. A correlation was
established between marginal adaptation and sealing ability. The results demonstrated
that Restodent showed the best marginal adaptation as well as its sealability was
significant superior to that of the other four materials. Amalgam showed the poorest
marginal adaptation and sealability. However, our results were similar to those found by
Abdal and Retief<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (1982) and Xavier,
et al.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (2005), which also reported
lack of correlation between apical leakage and marginal adaptation of the materials. In
the Abdal and Retief<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (1982) study the
<italic>in vitro</italic> apical seal obtained by post resection filling with
heat-sealed gutta-percha alone and when reinforced with 16 retrofilling materials was
evaluated qualitatively by SEM and quantitatively by a dye penetration technique. The
results indicated that heat-sealed gutta-percha alone and when reinforced with a
composite dental resin (Adaptic) or a glass ionomer cement (ASPA) provided the most
effective apical seal. Xavier, et al.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (2005) evaluated the root-end sealing ability through dye leakage
evaluation and the marginal adaptation through SEM of MTA-Angelus, Super EBA and
Vitremer. Concerning marginal adaptation, MTA-Angelus presented the best results, while
Super EBA showed superior results when considering sealing ability. In our study,
CPM<sup>TM</sup> was the best root-end filling material considering marginal
adaptation. Nevertheless, when analyzed the apical leakage, CPM<sup>TM</sup> presented
the worst results.</p><p>Regarding the possible correlation between sealing ability and marginal adaptation in
this study, it is very important consider the limitations of the methodology used
Although sealing ability and marginal adaptation were evaluated in the same points, it
is impossible to affirm that what the SEM shows in that point occurred in all canal
perimeters. Perhaps marginal adaptations can occurred in some points, even if where SEM
showed gaps at the dentin wall/root-end filling material interface. If we considerer
sealing ability as the seal reproduction in the whole canal perimeter, a gap maybe not
represent what really occurred in the entire apical plug. Therefore, it is really hard
to establish a correlation between sealing ability and marginal adaptation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>When used as apical plugs, the tested rootend filling materials had similar marginal
adaptation to the dentin walls, but MBPc had the best sealing ability, as demonstrated
by the least apical leakage from all tested materials. It is possible to observe that
the lack of gaps at the interface between the root-end filling material and the dentin
walls did not hinder dye penetration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdal</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Retief</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The apical seal via the retro surgical approach I.
