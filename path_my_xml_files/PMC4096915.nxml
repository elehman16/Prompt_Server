Additionally, the effects of RSV on mitochondrial respiration in PmFBs were examined. Eight sedentary men (23.8&#x000b1;2.4 yrs; BMI: 32.7&#x000b1;7.1) reported to the lab on two occasions where they were provided a meal supplemented with 300 mg of RSV or a placebo. Blood samples, and a muscle biopsy were obtained in the fasted state and again, with the addition of an adipose tissue biopsy, two hours post-prandial. The effect of RSV on mitochondrial respiration was examined in PmFBs taken from muscle biopsies from an additional eight men (23.4&#x000b1;5.4 yrs; BMI: 24.4&#x000b1;2.8). No effect of RSV was observed on nuclear SIRT1 activity, acetylation of p53, or phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC or PKA in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. A decrease in post absorptive insulin levels was accompanied by elevated skeletal muscle phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but no change in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue insulin signalling. Mitochondrial respiration in PmFBs was rapidly inhibited by RSV at 100&#x02013;300 uM depending on the substrate examined. These results question the efficacy of a single dose of RSV at altering skeletal muscle and adipose tissue AMPK/SIRT1 activity in humans and suggest that RSV mechanisms of action in humans may be associated with altered cellular energetics resulting from impaired mitochondrial ATP production.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by NSERC (CGRP and BJG) and the Canaian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) (BJG).

The specific actions of RSV are further complicated by evidence that RSV activates AMPK in muscle <xref rid="pone.0102406-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0102406-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and findings that the activation of AMPK is required for the beneficial effects of RSV to manifest <xref rid="pone.0102406-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These findings have led to the speculation that RSV activates both SIRT1 and AMPK with direct activation of SIRT1 stimulating AMPK activity via LKB1 <xref rid="pone.0102406-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or indirect activation of SIRT occurring via AMPK subsequent to an effect of RSV on PDE/cAMP signalling <xref rid="pone.0102406-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Alternatively, there is evidence that RSV is capable of inhibiting ATP synthase <xref rid="pone.0102406-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and reducing ATP concentrations in a variety of cell lines <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Hawley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. While there is evidence that this effect may be dose dependent <xref rid="pone.0102406-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and impaired ATP production has yet to be demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>, the idea that RSV mediated activation of AMPK results from a disturbance in energy status is compelling.</p><p>In contrast to animal studies, chronic RSV supplementation in humans has yielded conflicting results for metabolic outcomes. Specifically, several studies have reported improved insulin sensitivity following chronic RSV supplementation <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Crandall1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, while others have not <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, positive effects of RSV have been primarily observed in obese or insulin insensitive/resistant individuals suggesting that an overweight/obese population may be more sensitive to the effects of RSV than lean healthy individuals. The activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway implicated in the mechanism of RSV action in animals has been observed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue following some <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, but not all <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> RSV trials in humans. Thus whether RSV is able to activate AMPK and/or SIRT1 in humans is currently controversial. Further complicating the interpretation of these chronic supplementation studies is the sampling of AMPK/SIRT1 after the intervention, when chronic adaptations induced by RSV may be altering the impact of RSV on signalling pathways. While it is clear that adaptation results from an accumulation of repeated stimuli following repeated daily RSV supplementation, examining the acute effects of RSV may provide new insight into the mechanisms by which chronic adaptations occur. At present much of the information regarding RSVs mechanism(s) of action have been gleaned from chronic feeding studies, however, there is evidence from various cell lines that a single exposure to RSV can activate the AMPK/SIRT1 signalling pathway <xref rid="pone.0102406-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Should similar acute activation occur in human tissue, this would provide an opportunity to observe the mechanisms of RSV action without the confounding influence of chronic adaptations inherent in prolonged feeding studies. Thus, the controversial results from human trials, and the timing of AMPK/SIRT1 measures made in humans to date, make it difficult to discern whether the mechanisms of RSV action proposed from cellular and animal models are conserved in human tissue.</p><p>In an attempt to address the mechanisms of RSV action in human tissue we conducted 2 studies with the following purposes: 1) to determine if the mechanisms of RSV action previously described in cellular and animal models <xref rid="pone.0102406-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, specifically the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, are activated in human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue following a single dose of RSV, and 2) to examine the effects of a wide range of RSV concentrations on skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative metabolism <italic>ex vivo</italic> utilizing permeabilized muscle fibre bundles (PmFBs). We hypothesize that an acute dose of RSV would activate AMPK and SIRT1 signalling in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>, and, consistent with observations in rat brain, liver <xref rid="pone.0102406-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, RSV would inhibit mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in human PmFBs, but only at supra-physiological concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures performed on human participants were approved by the Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Board at Queen's University and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.

The first experiment examined the effects of RSV on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue intracellular signaling and whole body fatty acid oxidation in overweight/obese males. This experiment consisted of the administration of a single dose of RSV (300 mg) or placebo supplement on two separate occasions using a randomized cross over, double-blind design. A 300 mg dose was chosen for the current study as it represents a moderate dose, falling between the lowest (10 mg/day; <xref rid="pone.0102406-Brasnyo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>) and highest (1&#x02013;2 g/day; <xref rid="pone.0102406-Crandall1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>) doses reported in the human literature. Each condition was separated by a seven day wash out period. For the second experiment, PmFBs were isolated from muscle biopsies obtained from lean males and the effects of RSV on ADP stimulated respiration were examined.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>In total, 16 men volunteered to participate in this study (participant characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102406-t001">Table 1</xref>).

On the evening prior to each experimental visit, participants were provided a standardized dinner which included a Stouffer's Saut&#x000e9; Sensations Country Beef Pot Roast (540 kcal; 56 g carbohydrate (CHO), 20 g fat, 14 g protein), 500 mL of 2% milk (260 kcal; 12 g CHO, 5 g fat, 9 g protein) and a Dole Apple Cinnamon Fruit Crisp (160 kcal; 30 g CHO, 3.5 g fat, 2 g protein) before reporting to the lab having fasted overnight (&#x02265;12 hours). Participants were asked to drive or walk slowly to the lab, and take the elevator in order to limit their physical activity. Participants then rested for 10 minutes before gas exchange measures were collected for 15 minutes (Moxus AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA) while participants rested in a seated position. Immediately following gas exchange collection, a blood sample and muscle biopsy were obtained while participants rested in a supine position (for details please see <italic>Physiological Measurements</italic>). Subsequently, participants were fed a standardized breakfast consisting of a plain bagel (190 kcal; 36 g CHO, 1 g fat, 7 g protein), 15 g of cream cheese (45 kcal; 1 g CHO, 4 g fat, 1 g protein), and 200 mL of orange juice (100 kcal; 23 g CHO, 0 g fat, 1 g protein), which they were given 10 minutes to eat. This meal was similar to that typically ingested by the participants and reflects a traditional North American diet. Ingestion of breakfast was immediately followed by the ingestion of unlabeled identical capsules containing either 300 mg of RSV supplement (resVida, DSM, Heerlen, Netherlands) or microcrystalline cellulose placebo supplement (PCCA Canada, London, ON) with 200 mL of water. Following ingestion of the supplement, participants rested in bed for 105 minutes and were provided water <italic>ad libitum</italic>, after which post-prandial gas exchange values were recorded for 15 minutes. A post-prandial blood sample, muscle biopsy, and adipose tissue biopsy were then obtained (120 minutes following supplement ingestion) in the same order as the fasted samples described above. The supplement order was randomized and given in a double-blind fashion on consecutive visits, a minimum of seven days apart.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Physiological Measurements</title><p>Resting blood samples were collected by venipuncture from an antecubital vein in sterile tubes (BD Vaccutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated with ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant.

Plasma insulin was determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Alpco Diagnositics, Salem, NH). Plasma glycerol was analyzed using the commercially available Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma, Oakville, ON). All samples were run in duplicate with the coefficient of variation being &#x0003c;10% for all values. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was determined from recorded gas exchange values at fasted and post-prandial time points. A 10 minute average was taken from 3&#x02013;13 minutes of recorded gas exchange values to minimize the impact of any adjustment period following putting on the mask and/or participant anticipation of the mask being removed. RER was used to estimate relative substrate contribution to total substrate oxidation assuming a linear relationship between an RER of 0.7 (100% fat, 0% CHO), and 1.0 (0% fat, 100% CHO) at rest.

Both types of tissue were added to tubes filled with the appropriate amount of pre-chilled (4&#x000b0;C) lysis buffer. Samples were subsequently homogenized for three seconds at 20 000 RPM (muscle) or 15 000 RPM (adipose) (Polytron PT10/35 GT Benchtop Homogenizer, Kinematic, Luzern, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were determined for all homogenates using a commercially available protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were diluted to equivalent concentrations with a mixture of 4&#x000d7; Laemmli sample buffer and H<sub>2</sub>O and then denatured by heating to 95&#x000b0;C for five minutes.

In contrast to evidence from cellular models where a single dose of RSV can activate AMPK and SIRT1 <xref rid="pone.0102406-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, these results suggest that a single 300 mg dose of RSV administered to overweight adults does not activate SIRT1 in human skeletal muscle or adipose tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The lack of an acute effect of RSV on intracellular signalling in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue in the current study likely reflects poor bioavailability of RSV following a single intraoral dose <xref rid="pone.0102406-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This potential bioavailability limitation of RSV in humans may help explain several recent reports that chronic administration of RSV has no effect on skeletal muscle or adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Alternatively, the lack of an effect of RSV observed in the current study, and in previous reports <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> may be attributed to the healthy populations studied (current study, overweight men; <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, non-obese women; <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, obese men). However, this is difficult to reconcile with the positive effects observed by Timmers et al. <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> in otherwise healthy obese men. The results from Timmers et al. <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> are also in contrast to the potential bioavailability limitation to RSV action in humans as they reported elevated AMPK phosphorylation, increased protein content of both SIRT1 and its downstream targets following chronic RSV administration. These results raise the possibility that an additive effect of repeated RSV ingestion may increase bioavailability within skeletal muscle and other peripheral tissues, although accumulation of RSV in plasma samples have not been observed following repeated RSV dosages at a similar dose to that used by Timmers et al. <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> or in the current study <xref rid="pone.0102406-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It remains difficult to reconcile the positive effects of RSV observed by Timmers et al. <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> with recent studies demonstrating no effects <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> of chronic RSV and the current data demonstrating no effect of an acute dose of RSV. It should be mentioned that several RSV metabolites have also been shown to have biological effects <xref rid="pone.0102406-Lasa1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, however, if these metabolites were elevated following a single RSV dose in the current study, they appear not to have impacted skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. This suggests that either 1) a single 300 mg dose does not produce enough active metabolites to activate musculoskeletal pathways, and/or 2) that these metabolites are not responsible for the proposed effects on skeletal muscle energetic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>An Alternative Mechanism Explaining the Activation of AMPK and SIRT1 in Skeletal Muscle</title><p>While there is evidence that RSV can interact directly with signalling molecules such as SIRT1 in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0102406-Hubbard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Park2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Horowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> it is also possible that RSV mediated activation of pathways associated with AMPK may result from an acute impairment in the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP <xref rid="pone.0102406-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Hawley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Consistent with the latter mechanism, we have demonstrated, for the first time in intact human skeletal muscle fibres (obtained from lean adult men), that RSV impairs mitochondrial oxidation of multiple substrates, including fatty acids and pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102406-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). While the mechanism underlying the observed inhibition is unclear, two potential mechanisms exist. First, RSV-meditated inhibition of ATP synthase <xref rid="pone.0102406-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> would directly inhibit mitochondrial respiration regardless of which substrate is oxidized. Conceivably, this may impair energy homeostasis leading to activation of AMPK. Second, SIRT3 inhibition by RSV <xref rid="pone.0102406-Gertz1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> may indirectly inhibit respiration via acetylation-based regulation of substrate catabolism though altered substrate provision to the electron transport chain <xref rid="pone.0102406-White1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Regardless of the mechanism(s), our results support the possibility that activation of AMPK/SIRT1 <italic>in vivo</italic> may result from RSV-mediated inhibition of ATP production/mitochondrial respiration.</p><p>This possibility positions RSV as a potential hormetic agent, a topic that has received recent attention in several other fields <xref rid="pone.0102406-Calabrese1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, but to date has been generally dismissed in skeletal muscle and metabolic health research <xref rid="pone.0102406-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While toxic effects of RSV have been demonstrated in muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0102406-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, this effect was observed at concentrations (20&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;M) above those generally observed in human plasma <italic>in vivo</italic> (&#x0003c;5 &#x000b5;M) <xref rid="pone.0102406-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our results also demonstrated impaired mitochondrial respiration at seemingly supra-physiological levels (&#x0223c;100&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;M depending on the substrate examined) a result that is consistent with the lack of an effect of RSV on whole body VO<sub>2</sub> observed in experiment #1. While this logic has been used in the past to dismiss a possible toxic effect of RSV <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0102406-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, our results suggest that attempts to increase RSV bioavailability using high oral dosages <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> or alternative methods of delivery <xref rid="pone.0102406-Walle1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> be approached with caution such that [RSV] be controlled within a hormetic zone far below toxic levels.</p><p>The current results contribute to a rapidly growing number of chronic RSV supplementation trials and the significant controversy regarding RSVs mechanism(s) of action in animals. The findings of acute inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in intact skeletal muscle from lean adult men provide a potential alternative mechanisms of RSV action and underscore the dearth of information regarding how and/or if RSV alters cellular function in humans, highlighting the need for future work to reconcile the divergent acute and chronic effects of RSV.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>RSV and Control of Blood Insulin</title><p>Interestingly, we observed that an acute dose of RSV decreased blood insulin (compared to placebo) 2 hours post meal challenge in overweight men (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102406-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The similar post-prandial phosphorylation of Akt and AS160, two of the critical intermediates in the insulin-signaling pathway, observed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102406-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and adipose tissue (Akt only; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102406-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), despite a lower plasma insulin concentration with RSV, suggests that RSV may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance in peripheral tissue. While this effect may have been related to the elevated p38 MAPK phosphorylation observed in the RSV condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102406-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), p38 MAPK is implicated as both a contributor to insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0102406-Somwar1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Thong1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and an activator of GLUT4 mediated glucose transport <xref rid="pone.0102406-Furtado1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, this is speculative at this juncture and it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions regarding the mechanisms underlying the lower post-prandial insulin levels from the current data set. Further, it is unclear whether lower insulin 2 hours post meal would have been reflected in different glucose/insulin kinetics during the immediate post meal period (i.e. &#x0003c;2 hours) and this represents an interesting question worthy of future study. Alternatively, RSV-mediated decreases in plasma insulin may have resulted from other tissues not examined in the current study. For example, RSV is known to impact liver function <xref rid="pone.0102406-Baur1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and can inhibit pancreatic insulin production in isolated pancreatic islets <xref rid="pone.0102406-Szkudelski1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>Regardless of mechanism, the observed change in blood insulin 2 hours post meal with RSV contributes to previous data demonstrating an insulin sensitizing effect of chronic RSV supplementation <xref rid="pone.0102406-Timmers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102406-Crandall1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While not all studies in humans have observed improved insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0102406-Yoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102406-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, our findings suggest a potentially novel clinical outcome. Specifically, that RSV may acutely boost endogenous insulin action, possibly in addition to the therapeutic/preventative benefit associated with the chronic adaptations. However, given the poor time resolution of the current study, the acute effects of RSV on glucose kinetics, uptake by peripheral tissue along with changes in insulin secretion by the pancreas represent important areas for future study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study examined both the effect of a single dose of RSV (300 mg) on several metabolic outcomes and intracellular signaling pathways hypothesized to be affected by RSV in overweight humans <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as the impact of RSV on human skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in PmFBs obtained from lean men <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrate that a single dose of RSV appears to have no impact on skeletal muscle and adipocyte intracellular signalling in overweight men, likely resulting from limited bioavailability. Interestingly, the lower blood insulin observed following RSV may reflect acute effects of RSV on either hepatic or pancreatic function. Finally, we have demonstrated that RSV impairs mitochondrial oxidation of multiple substrates including fatty acids and pyruvate in human PmFBs obtained from lean adult men. The latter result suggests a mito-toxic nature of resveratrol that has not previously been considered in human muscle and may stimulate hormetic improvements in metabolic capacities; however, this effect would appear to only occur at supra-physiological concentrations of RSV. Future studies should continue to examine the mechanisms by which RSV alters physiological function in humans with the important caveat that caution is warranted should higher doses, or alternative means of administration aimed at increased RSV bioavailability be pursued.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0102406-Chung1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
