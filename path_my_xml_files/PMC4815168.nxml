Although Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was developed to address this, its survival rate in occluso-proximal lesions is low. An alternative, the Hall Technique (HT) has shown better relative outcomes for occluso-proximal lesions, but has not been directly compared to ART or tested in field settings. This trial will compare ART and the HT for the most clinically- and cost-effective strategy for managing occluso-proximal lesions in primary molars, in a school setting, using low-technology and child-friendly dental techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This two-arm, parallel group, patient-randomized controlled, superiority trial will have treatment provided in schools. Schoolchildren (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;124, age 6&#x02013;8) with at least one occluso-proximal carious primary molar lesion will have random allocation to treatment with ART or HT. Baseline measures and outcome data will be assessed through participant report, clinical examination and parent report/questionnaires. The primary outcome is survival rate, a composite measure of absence of Minor Failures (a defect in the restoration/crown, but not interfering with tooth health) and Major Failures (signs or symptoms of irreversible pulp damage, such as dental fistula/abscess, tooth fracture or failures that cannot be repaired). Secondary outcomes are: (1) child-reported discomfort, (2) childrens&#x02019; and (3) parents&#x02019; concerns around dental appearance and (4) acceptability of treatments, (5) occlusal-vertical dimensions (OVD) changes, (6) plaque index, (7) gingival health, (8) decayed, missing, filled teeth in permanent teeth (DMFT)/decayed, missing, filled teeth in primary teeth (dmft), (9) oral health-related-quality of life, reported by children and parents/caregivers, (10) the incremental cost-effectiveness, and (11) operator effect. A trained and calibrated examiner will evaluate the treated teeth after 1&#x000a0;week, then 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;months post treatment. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression tests will be used to investigate the primary outcome. The Mann-Whitney or <italic>t</italic> test, Friedman test, paired <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon test and Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis will be used to analyze the secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this trial will support decision-making by clinicians and policy-makers for managing occluso-proximal lesions in settings with constrained resources and limited dental access.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>www.clinicaltrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02569047?term=NCT02569047&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02569047</ext-link>, registered 5 October 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1270-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART)</kwd><kwd>Caries treatment</kwd><kwd>Clinical studies/trials</kwd><kwd>Glass ionomer cements</kwd><kwd>Pediatric dentistry</kwd><kwd>Primary teeth</kwd><kwd>The Hall Technique</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The occurrence of cavitated caries lesions is still a problem in developed and developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with an increasing prevalence, particularly in developing communities, conflicting with a general descending trend in prevalence worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this context, the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was developed. ART is a two-part strategy for the management of caries: the restorative step, and the essential adjunctive educational-preventive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The performance of ART restorations for longevity has been evaluated through clinical trials with the results of numerous studies showing that ART performs well for occlusal cavities in primary and permanent teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but there appear to be much lower success rates for occluso-proximal ART restorations in permanent and primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, occluso-proximal cavitations are now the main focus for contemporary research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For primary teeth, reported restoration success rates range from 50 to 75&#x000a0;% in the first 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with reported survival rates after 3&#x000a0;years of evaluation even lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], dropping to only 20&#x000a0;% in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the paradigm around the ideal management of carious lesions has been changing. Conventional restorative approaches, with its emphasis on the complete removal of carious tooth tissue followed by placement of a restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been substituted by more biological and less invasive approaches, focusing on biofilm control and disruption of the cariogenic biofilm environment to arrest caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The Hall Technique (HT) fits this philosophy. A preformed metal crown (PMC) is cemented, using glass ionomer cement (GIC), over the carious tooth, without tooth preparation or caries removal. This seals the cariogenic biofilm under the crown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies have reported high survival rates of HT, with results of 98&#x000a0;% success rate after 1&#x000a0;year of evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and 95&#x000a0;% after 23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and 48&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Although HT is recommended for the management of dental caries in primary molars involving two or more surfaces and evidence of its efficacy had been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], these have all been carried out in clinical dental settings and have not been compared to ART. There are no clinical trials of the HT in a field setting and no direct comparisons of the longevity of occluso-proximal ART restorations with HT.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the survival rate of occluso-proximal ART restorations compared with the HT in primary molars. Furthermore, self-reported patient discomfort, perception and concerns related to dental appearance, acceptance in relation to treatments reported by children and their parents/caregivers, evaluation of occlusal-vertical dimension (OVD), evaluation of cost-effectiveness, the impact of the two techniques on the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and the influence of the operator experience on the survival rate of treatments will be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations and registrations</title><p>This protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Dental School, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (protocol 1.293.935).

If this is not possible we will measure the OVD on the contralateral side of the jaw. If there are no canines present, we will measure the OVD using the first primary molars. The OVD measurement and the teeth measured will be recorded. One examiner will measure the OVD before and after the treatment, and in the subsequent evaluations. The examiner will be trained and calibrated according to the protocol adopted for this measurement. The OVD will be measured using a probe with markings at 1, 3, 6 and 9&#x000a0;mm. The distance from the lowest point of the gingiva, around the lower canine on the vestibular side up to the point where the tip of the upper canine ends, will be measured.

The instrument consists of 29 questions, distributed into four domains (child symptoms, function, psychological, and self-image/social interaction domains) and in a family impact section (oral symptoms, functional limitations, emotional well-being and social well-being). Answers will be recorded through a Likert scale from 0 to 4: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;never, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;once or twice, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;sometimes, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;often, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;very often. The minimum possible score is 0, the maximum possible score is 116, with higher scores indicating a greater negative impact on OHRQoL. The CPQ<sub>8&#x02013;10</sub> questionnaires will be applied as an interview to children in the school. Furthermore, the parents will also be invited to answer the Brazilian version of the Parental-Caregiver Perceptions Questionnaire (P-CPQ) at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The questionnaire is composed of 35 questions that assess the perceptions of parents and/or guardians regarding the impact of oral diseases on the quality of life of children aged 6 to 14&#x000a0;years as well as a rating scale consisting of 14 questions that assess the effects of oral disorders in family functioning. Questions 1 and 2 refer to the overall perception of those responsible for oral health and the child&#x02019;s overall well-being. Answers will be recorded using a Likert scale from 0 to 4: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;excellent, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;very good, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;good, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;fair, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;bad.

As a result of this reduced longevity, there is some resistance within the dental and scientific community to recommending this technique for everyday use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review of the literature has shown the longevity of occluso-proximal ART restorations in primary teeth to be similar that of conventional restorations using amalgam, composite resin and compomer, suggesting that the real problem might be related to the type/extent of cavity and not the restorative material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, preformed metal crowns offer physical protection to teeth affected by caries, through complete tooth coverage, as well as arresting caries progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In direct comparisons, their longevity has been found to be equal to or superior to restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A less invasive alternative method for using preformed metal crowns is the HT, where crowns are pushed over teeth with no tooth preparation or caries removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The HT has also been shown to have good longevity. According to Santamaria et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the success rate for the HT was 98&#x000a0;% after 1&#x000a0;year and showed superior efficacy against a non-restorative approach and a conventional restoration. Moreover, the HT has shown more favorable results for pulpal health and tooth longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the question regarding the superior performance of the HT and ART remains unanswered. This trial will test the HT and ART in field conditions, without dental clinic facilities. This could provide a possible solution to caries treatment for more extensive lesions in public health systems in developing countries.</p><p>The preferences of children, their parents/caregivers for one of the treatments is also being tested. Neither ART nor HT require local anesthesia and both have been found to be preferred to conventional restorative methods, by children, their parents/caregivers and dentists, and usable by inexperienced practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although both treatments, ART and HT, have shown to be well-accepted by children and parents, there is no research directly comparing the two techniques for this outcome. However, esthetics related to dental treatment can be a concern of parents and caregivers and there may be a difference in the perceptions of metal crowns compared to white GIC. Previous reports have noted that one of the reasons given by dental practitioners for not fitting stainless steel crowns for multi-surface lesions, extensive caries and those where pulpal treatment was performed, was because metal crowns are not cosmetically acceptable to the child or the parent, although most dentists did recognize crowns as the most durable restoration for primary molars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Threlfall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] also noted that although some parents had complaints regarding the crowns&#x02019; esthetics, once the dentist explain all the advantages, they agreed with the treatment. As no trials have been conducted to evaluate the perception and concerns related to dental appearance of ART and the HT, this trial will also investigate whether the appearance of the metal crown is a barrier to providing this treatment.</p><p>Because there is no tooth preparation or caries removal, the OVD tends to be increased after placement of a crown using the HT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Although van der Zee and van Amerongen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that the occlusion re-establishes after 15 to 30&#x000a0;days, according to the authors, a major limitation in their study was the very small study population size at the 30-day evaluation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). Through frequent evaluation and more comprehensive capture of the study population in the school setting, this trial will test whether the occlusion re-establishes after crown cementation.</p><p>In order to define public health care policies, costs of treatment have to be taken into consideration. Cost-effectiveness is defined as the analysis of costs of alternative treatments to be offered to a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness analyses have been used to appraise ART sealants and restorations in children and elderly populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The HT has been subjected to clinical evaluation in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and one recent investigation addressed the results regarding the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for treating carious primary molars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, that study was a modeling design research and the economic evaluation of HT used in children has not yet been evaluated in a clinical trial.</p><p>In our investigation we aim to carry out an incremental cost-effectiveness evaluation where the initial costs of treatments (the costs to produce 1 unit of ART restoration or HT-crown) will be combined with the survival rates obtained by following the patients for 3&#x000a0;years. Therefore, we can calculate which treatment was initially cheaper to provide, but more importantly, what happened in terms of cost relative to the survival of restorations and teeth for each arm.</p><p>Understanding how people recognize the impact of oral health on their lives has become an emergent topic in the scientific community. With regards to dental caries, most research has been published on the impact of the disease and its consequences and little on the consequences of providing curative care on the population&#x02019;s quality of life. There have been some investigations of changes in OHRQoL associated with ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, to date, no research has been carried out to investigate the OHRQoL associated with the use of the HT.</p><p>Evidence from this study will expand the body of knowledge around ART and the HT, two minimally invasive treatments growing in popularity. The findings will also inform public health policy decisions as well as clinicians&#x02019;, childrens&#x02019; and parent/carers&#x02019; choices for primary molar occluso-proximal caries lesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is still currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1270_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Case Report Form.
