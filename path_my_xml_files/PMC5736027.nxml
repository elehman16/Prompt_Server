Several early intervention approaches have been designed in the hope of optimising neurological development in this context. It seems important that the intervention takes into account parental mental health, focuses on parent&#x02013;child interactions and lasts sufficiently long. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a stimulation programme administered by parents until 6 months post-term on motor and neurophysiological development of infants born preterm.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Participants will be infants born &#x0003c;32 weeks&#x02019; gestation and/or with a birth weight &#x0003c;1500&#x02009;g recruited prospectively from two tertiary neonatal intensive care units. They will be randomly assigned to receive nationally recommended follow-up only (control group) or also a stimulation programme between 37 weeks&#x02019; gestation and 6 months&#x02019; corrected age. Perinatal, clinical neurodevelopmental, socio-demographic and neuroimaging (ultrasonography or MRI) data will be collected. Bayley Scales of Infant Development will be used up to 24 months&#x02019; corrected age and Parental Stress Index at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months&#x02019; corrected age. High-density (64 or 128 electrodes) EEG, visual, somatosensory and long latency auditory evoked potentials will be recorded at term age, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months&#x02019; corrected age. They will be analysed for spatiotemporal frequency bands contents and source localisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the H&#x000f4;pital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola and CHU Saint-Pierre.

Early intervention may be contemplated based on the relatively high plasticity of the developing brain in young infants, when neural multiplication and migration have been mostly completed and synaptogenesis is very active.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> High brain plasticity is observed from about 2 months before term to about 6 months after term age. A particular emphasis has been placed on activity-dependent plasticity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> The suggested early intervention programmes show marked heterogeneity in type of stimulation, age at which it is offered, duration and frequency, and studies to evaluate them also show great variation in assessment tools and follow-up.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As a result, the effect of early intervention on development remains unclear, which constitutes an important gap of knowledge. Recent meta-analysis showed a&#x000a0;positive influence of some early preterm infants intervention programmes on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy and also cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x000a0;The authors emphasised the need to determine which early developmental interventions are effective in improving motor and cognitive outcomes. This should rely on sound approaches of functional evaluation. Recently, high-density EEG (HD-EEG)&#x000a0;has been shown to bring out rhythmic synchronous activity and transient events including those elicited by afferent stimuli in infants.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Primebrain is a parent-administered early intervention programme focusing on motor control and social interaction,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which should be soundly evaluated. It provides stimulation over 6 months during a particularly sensitive period for activity-dependent plasticity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8 12</xref>

They are located in Brussels, 9&#x02009;km apart, functioning in the same way and have similar recruitment. The very preterm infants are inborn in both settings.</p><p>Inclusion criteria are infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight &#x0003c;1500 g. Gestational age is defined as the time between the first day of the last menstrual period and the day of the birth. Corrected age is calculated by subtracting the number of weeks of prematurity from the chronological age; corrected age is expressed in months.&#x000a0;Infants with severe congenital malformation (cerebral, cardiac or within a syndrome), neurodevelopmental genetic syndrome, cytomegalovirus, rubella or toxoplasmosis congenital infection, neonatal hypothyroidism, peripheral neurological disorder or congenital muscular disorder, or neurodegenerative disorder, are excluded. If one or more of these exclusion criteria are diagnosed during the course of the study, the participant will leave the study.</p><p>Infants/parents dyads are recruited during the neonatal stay. In the studied settings, infants born very preterm stay in the neonatal department until around term age. Recruitment takes place when their condition does not require intensive care any&#x000a0;more, typically around 34 weeks of gestation.</p><p>Perinatal, clinical neurodevelopmental, socio-demographic and neuroimaging (ultrasonography or MRI) data will be collected. The social risk will be evaluated using the Social Risk Index,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which takes into account the family structure, maternal age at birth, education of the primary caregiver, occupation and status of the primary income earner, and language spoken at home. At least ultrasonography is expected to be available for all infants; MRI for many, at term age, as this is common practice for very preterm in the service level of the participating hospitals. For the study, the last brain ultrasonography performed during the neonatal stay is collected. Intraventricular haemorrhage is classified from grade I to IV according to Volpe.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Brain MRI abnormalities at term age will be classified and scored in white&#x000a0;matter abnormalities and grey&#x000a0;matter abnormalities according to Woodward <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Supportive analyses will take those into account when comparing the general characteristics of the study and comparison groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>Infants in the experimental group receive the Primebrain sensorimotor stimulation programme. The programme aims to facilitate the infant&#x02019;s self-organisation of postural competences by proposing varied sensorimotor experiences in a context supporting parent&#x02013;child interaction.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Physical therapists participating in the study followed a sensorimotor stimulation programme course and obtained a certification before coaching the parents.&#x000a0;The parents are trained by a physical therapist with a doll and their infant, and they receive a booklet with step-by-step written descriptions and photographic illustrations. They administer the programme at home once a day between 37 weeks&#x02019; gestation and 6 months of corrected age. A structured monthly diary is provided to the parents to keep data on number of administered sessions. During the 6-month&#x000a0;stimulation period, the physical therapist meets the parents seven times for coaching and monitoring, and substantiates that the parents continue to use the outlined protocol.&#x000a0;The parents may elect to discontinue the intervention at any time; this would cause the child to leave the study.</p><p>Parents also report eventual adverse incidents possibly related to the intervention. An observation diary will allow us to get compliance and safety data. During home visits, the physiotherapist assesses the stimulation performed by the parent.</p><p>The programme is divided in two phases to adapt the stimulation to the infant&#x02019;s neurological development, phase I from 37 weeks to 4&#x000bd; months of corrected age and phase II from 4&#x000bd; to 6 months of corrected age. Each stimulation session lasts for 10&#x02009;min. It is performed when the infant is awake and quiet.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The study primary outcome is the&#x000a0;BSID-III motor composite score at 24 months of corrected age. The secondary outcomes are BSID-III cognitive and language composite scores&#x000a0;at this age and receptive and expressive communication and gross and fine motor scale scores&#x000a0;at 6, 12 and 18 months of corrected age.&#x000a0;BSID-III is being done as described at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of corrected age in order to identify eventual developmental delays through the use of norm-referenced scores and to monitor infants&#x02019; progress during intervention. The short form of PSI,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which is also a secondary outcome, is administered at the same time&#x000a0;points as the BSID-III in order to document time-related trends in the parent&#x02019;s relationship with the child.&#x000a0;In addition, an exploratory&#x000a0;outcome is the neurophysiological maturation evaluated using HD-EEG and recording of event-related potentials (ERPs)&#x000a0;at term age, 3, 6, 12,&#x000a0;18 and 24 months of corrected age because it is anticipated that neurophysiological developmental changes might be age-specific over shorter periods in earlier than later infancy as assumed from general knowledge about brain maturation. Analysis of HD&#x000a0;EEG signals will include frequency, power and synchrony of oscillation in resting state with a focus on spatial patterning using EEGLab and in-house complementary programme. Spectral content of oscillatory activity in evoked potentials will be used to study the dynamic brain processing underlying the different components of the evoked potentials, including (1) power perturbation in specific frequencies of ongoing brain oscillations induced by a stimulus, that&#x000a0;is, event-related spectral perturbation; and&#x000a0;(2) synchronisation of ongoing brain oscillations induced by a stimulus, that&#x000a0;is, intertrial coherence. Source localisation will be performed using inverse modelling. Evaluations are performed in control and stimulation groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated to detect a minimum clinically important difference in the BSID-III at 24 months of 1 SD (15 points)&#x000a0;with a power&#x000a0;of 90% and using a level of significance of 0.05 (alpha value).&#x000a0;This calculation indicates&#x000a0;that 30 infants are needed in each group.
