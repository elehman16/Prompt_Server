</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well-established that focusing on improvements in glycaemic control in patients with diabetes reduces the risk of developing microvascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Addressing postprandial glucose excursions is important for improving overall glycaemic control, particularly in patients with mild to moderate overall hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, focus on postprandial glucose control seems to be a necessity to achieve glycaemic targets in more patients with diabetes.</p><p>In healthy individuals ingesting a meal, immediate endogenous insulin secretion leads to an inhibition of hepatic glucose production, which is important for postprandial glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, in patients with diabetes, fast absorption and early action of subcutaneously administered mealtime insulin are essential goals in order to counteract postprandial hyperglycaemia, at least in part through inhibition of hepatic glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another objective is to achieve an appropriately short duration of action, thereby reducing the risk of late postprandial hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although current rapid-acting insulin analogues have advantages over regular human insulin in terms of accelerated absorption, earlier onset of action and shorter duration of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], absorption of current rapid-acting insulin products still occurs considerably slower than endogenous prandial insulin release in the healthy state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is insulin aspart (IAsp) in a new formulation in which two additional excipients (<sc>l</sc>-arginine and niacinamide) have been added. <sc>l</sc>-arginine and niacinamide are both included in the US FDA database of inactive ingredients in products for injection at higher concentrations than present in faster aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In faster aspart, <sc>l</sc>-arginine serves as a stabilising agent, while niacinamide is responsible for accelerated initial absorption after subcutaneous administration. A proposed mechanism for the latter is that niacinamide promotes the formation of IAsp monomers in the subcutis and augments the permeation rate of IAsp across capillary endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the current investigation was to compare the pharmacological characteristics between faster aspart and IAsp in a post&#x000a0;hoc analysis of pooled data from all available and relevant clinical pharmacology trials in the faster aspart clinical development programme. The focus of the investigation was onset of exposure and glucose-lowering effect, early exposure and glucose-lowering effect, as well as offset of exposure and glucose-lowering effect. The pooled analysis has been conducted in order to obtain a robust summary of the differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties between faster aspart and IAsp in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This report presents a post&#x000a0;hoc analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart compared with IAsp based on data from individual phase I, randomised, double-blind, crossover trials (Online Resource 1, Table S1). A total of six trials contributed with pharmacokinetic data, while the three trials using a glucose clamp also contributed with pharmacodynamic data (see the Study Procedures and Assessments section). Trials were conducted at the Children&#x02019;s and Youth Hospital AUF DER BULT, Hannover, Germany (Trial 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Austria (Trials 2 and 3) and Profil, Neuss, Germany (Trials 4, 5 and 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Irrespective of trial site, comparable overall methodology was used. Furthermore, the trials shared several characteristics, such as the crossover design and the inclusion of IAsp as the comparator. Therefore, it was deemed valid to perform a pooled analysis of the six trials.</p><p>In each trial, the protocol, protocol amendments, consent form and subject information sheets were reviewed and approved by health authorities, according to local regulations, and by local ethics committees prior to trial initiation. All trials were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Before any trial-related activities were initiated, written informed consent was obtained from the participating subjects. The trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02035371 (Trial 1), NCT01924637 (Trial 2), NCT02131246 (Trial 3), NCT02033239 (Trial 4), NCT02003677 (Trial 5), NCT01618188 (Trial 6).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Population</title><p>The pooled analysis was based on data from 218 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes aged 18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years (both inclusive). For two of the trials, a subset of the full trial population was included because these trials also enrolled subjects aged &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years (Trial 1) or &#x0003e;64&#x000a0;years (Trial 5).</p><p>Key inclusion criteria for each trial are shown in Online Resource 1, Table S1. In addition, all subjects received treatment with multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy for at least 12&#x000a0;months with total insulin dose &#x0003c;1.2&#x000a0;(I)U/kg/day and bolus insulin dose &#x0003c;0.7&#x000a0;(I)U/kg/day (and bolus insulin dose &#x02265;0.3&#x000a0;(I)U/kg/day in Trials&#x000a0;1, 2 and 3). General exclusion criteria were clinically significant concomitant diseases (malignant neoplasms or cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, haematological, dermatological, neurological or psychiatric diseases), donation of any blood or plasma in the past month or more than 500&#x000a0;mL within 3&#x000a0;months prior to screening, smoking, or current treatment with drug(s) which might interfere with glucose metabolism. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Procedures and Assessments</title><p>In all trials, subjects received single subcutaneous dosing of 0.2&#x000a0;U/kg faster aspart (100&#x000a0;U/mL; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) and IAsp (NovoRapid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; 100&#x000a0;U/mL; Novo Nordisk) into a lifted skin fold of the lower abdominal wall above the inguinal area. There was a washout period of 3&#x02013;12&#x000a0;days (3&#x02013;15&#x000a0;days in Trial 4) between dosing visits, where subjects resumed their usual insulin treatment. Furthermore, subjects&#x02019; current insulin therapy was washed out before each dosing of the trial product: Subjects were excluded from the dosing visit if they had received insulin degludec within 72&#x000a0;h prior to dosing, insulin glargine or insulin detemir within 48&#x000a0;h prior to dosing, intermediate-acting insulin (such as neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] insulin) within 22&#x000a0;h prior to dosing, or IAsp within 12&#x000a0;h (for bolus) or 8&#x000a0;h (for basal infusion using a pump) prior to dosing.</p><p>Blood samples for serum IAsp assessment were taken within 2&#x000a0;min before dosing (within 5&#x000a0;min before dosing in Trial 6), then every 2&#x000a0;min from dosing until 20&#x000a0;min post-dosing, every 5&#x000a0;min from 20 to 80&#x000a0;min, every 10&#x000a0;min from 80&#x000a0;min to 2&#x000a0;h, every 15&#x000a0;min from 2 to 3&#x000a0;h (from 2 to 2.5&#x000a0;h in Trial 4), and then at 3, 3.5, 4, 5 (not Trial 4), 5.5 (only Trial 4), 6 (not Trial 4), 7, 8 (not Trial 4), 9 (only Trial 4), 10 (not Trial 4) and 12&#x000a0;h post-dosing. A validated IAsp specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10&#x000a0;pmol/L was used to measure free serum IAsp concentrations (polyethylene glycol-precipitated).</p><p>In Trials 4, 5 and 6, which were included in the pharmacodynamic analysis, an automated euglycaemic glucose clamp, with a target blood glucose concentration of 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L (100&#x000a0;mg/dL), was performed for 12&#x000a0;h post-dosing (ClampArt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Profil, Neuss, Germany, in Trials 4 and 5; Biostator<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MTB Medizintechnik, Amstetten, Germany, in Trial 6). The clamp was terminated earlier than 12&#x000a0;h post-dosing in case blood glucose was consistently above 11.1&#x000a0;mmol/L (200&#x000a0;mg/dL) without the need for intravenous glucose infusion during the last 30&#x000a0;min. Details of the glucose clamp procedure have previously been provided by Heise et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Trials 1, 2 and 3, subjects underwent a standardised liquid meal test for 6&#x000a0;h after dosing (data not included in the pooled pharmacodynamic analysis).</p><p>In Trial 4, subjects received three dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4&#x000a0;U/kg) of faster aspart and IAsp, as well as two additional doses of either 0.2 U/kg faster aspart or 0.2 U/kg IAsp at a total of eight dosing visits. Results from all 0.2 U/kg dosing visits are included in the current pooled analysis. In Trial 6, subjects received two formulations of faster aspart, but only data for the formulation being pursued in further clinical development are included in the current pooled analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>The onset was assessed by the following endpoints: onset of appearance, time to 50% of maximum IAsp concentration in the early absorption phase of the pharmacokinetic profile (<italic>t</italic>

Thus, compared with IAsp, faster aspart appears to better approximate the endogenous prandial insulin secretion in the healthy state.</p><p>The clinical implications of the 5&#x000a0;min earlier onset of appearance and the generally accelerated initial absorption of faster aspart compared with IAsp have been investigated in phase III trials comparing mealtime faster aspart and IAsp in subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes treated for 26&#x000a0;weeks in a basal&#x02013;bolus regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These trials have shown faster aspart provides better control of postprandial hyperglycaemia in a standardised meal-test compared with IAsp. In subjects with type 1 diabetes, faster aspart was superior to IAsp regarding change from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose increment (treatment difference faster aspart-IAsp [95%&#x000a0;CI] &#x02212;0.67&#x000a0;mmol/L [&#x02212;1.29 to &#x02212;0.04]; &#x02212;12.0&#x000a0;mg/dL [&#x02212;23.3 to &#x02212;0.7]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0375), and a statistically significant difference in favour of faster aspart was seen regarding change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increment (&#x02212;1.18&#x000a0;mmol/L [&#x02212;1.65 to &#x02212;0.71]; &#x02212;21.2&#x000a0;mg/dL [&#x02212;29.7 to &#x02212;12.8]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, a more heterogeneous population than subjects with type 1 diabetes, superiority of faster aspart over IAsp could not be confirmed for the reduction from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose increment as the difference in favour of faster aspart did not reach statistical significance (&#x02212;0.36&#x000a0;mmol/L [&#x02212;0.81 to 0.08]; &#x02212;6.6&#x000a0;mg/dL [&#x02212;14.5 to 1.4]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;non-significant), while the reduction from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increment was statistically significantly greater for faster aspart than for IAsp (&#x02212;0.59&#x000a0;mmol/L [&#x02212;1.09 to &#x02212;0.09]; &#x02212;10.6&#x000a0;mg/dL [&#x02212;19.6 to &#x02212;1.7]; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0198) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The best possible postprandial glucose control with current rapid-acting insulin analogues is achieved by injecting the insulin 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min prior to meal initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This injection&#x02013;meal interval is introduced to counterbalance the delay from subcutaneous administration until insulin concentration in the circulation is high enough to process the carbohydrate load from the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, in daily life, due to convenience, many diabetes patients use no or only a relatively short injection&#x02013;meal interval, which is in accordance with approved labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This may be particularly critical with higher glycaemic index meals, where a mismatch between rapid glucose absorption and the relatively delayed action of exogenous insulin results in initial postprandial hyperglycaemia, as discussed in a systematic review on the effects of dietary fat, protein and glycaemic index on postprandial glucose control in type 1 diabetes and prandial insulin dosing strategies for these dietary factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The earlier onset of action and greater early glucose-lowering effect for faster aspart versus IAsp should help dosing at mealtime, in contrast to pre-meal dosing. Furthermore, it may provide the possibility for post-meal dosing when necessary in certain situations if an injection has been forgotten or if the size and/or composition of a meal cannot be estimated in advance, e.g. in toddlers or multimorbid geriatric patients. In the abovementioned phase III trial in subjects with type 1 diabetes, a treatment arm with a 20&#x000a0;min post-meal dosing of faster aspart was also included and showed an HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction that was non-inferior to IAsp administered at mealtime, as well as similar rates of severe and confirmed hypoglycaemia versus mealtime IAsp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in a meal-test the change from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose increments did not differ statistically significantly between post-meal faster aspart and mealtime IAsp, while the increase from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increments was statistically significantly greater for post-meal faster aspart versus mealtime IAsp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These results suggest the accelerated absorption of faster aspart versus IAsp may provide patients with the flexibility of dosing up to 20&#x000a0;min post-meal with no impact on overall glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia risk compared with IAsp administered at mealtime.</p><p>The present analysis showed faster aspart has an earlier offset of exposure and action compared with IAsp. The increased rate of offset may reduce the risk of late postprandial hypoglycaemia by avoiding that the glucose-lowering effect of the mealtime insulin lasts beyond the duration of glucose absorption after the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, a very fast offset of exposure might result in lack of circulating insulin in the late postprandial period and, consequently, the glucose-lowering effect does not last long enough to cover the glucose absorption from the meal, especially in the case of higher-fat meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, a further accelerated absorption than seen with faster aspart could possibly lead to under-insulinisation in the late postprandial period and might therefore not be of clinical advantage. Importantly, for faster aspart, results from meal-test studies do not indicate that the rate of offset is too fast. Thus, plasma glucose for faster aspart was consistently lower than or equal to that for IAsp for up to 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h post-meal in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The same general methodology was used in all six trials included in the current analysis, which qualified the approach to combine the trial results into a pooled analysis. The accelerated pharmacological properties of faster aspart compared with IAsp were consistently observed across the individual trials. Thus, all trials generally showed the same picture in terms of faster onset, greater early exposure and glucose-lowering effect and earlier offset for faster aspart relative to IAsp. The only difference between the individual trial results and the pooled results was the smaller CIs for the pooled analysis, which is an expected consequence of the substantially larger sample size.</p><p>Onset of action was defined as the time from trial product administration until the blood glucose concentration had decreased at least 0.3&#x000a0;mmol/L (5&#x000a0;mg/dL) from baseline. This definition may not reflect the exact time point of first insulin action but rather is a product of both onset and initial rate of action and thus may slightly overestimate the true onset of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Still, the strength of this definition is that onset of action can be accurately measured and is deemed valid for comparison between two insulin products. Furthermore, the currently used definition of onset of action is closer to the exact time point of first insulin action compared with previously used definitions such as <italic>t</italic>
<sub>Early&#x000a0;50%&#x000a0;GIRmax</sub> and time to reach 10% of AUC<sub>GIR</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As such, the current definition may be regarded as having high clinical relevance. It should be recognised that using the decline in blood glucose concentration as a measure of onset of action compromises the basic concept of glucose clamping. The consequence is that with the current clamp design the very initial part of the GIR profile reflects the combined impact of increasing insulin action, as well as blood glucose concentration being below the glucose clamp target. However, this should not affect the comparison between faster aspart and IAsp as the same approach was used in all experiments. As a supplement to onset of action, onset of appearance can be appropriately used as this endpoint is estimated with high precision and the absolute value of onset of appearance is most likely closer to the real onset than the value obtained with any definition of onset of action.</p><p>It is inherently difficult to determine the end of action in a glucose clamp setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The classical definition of end of action, based on blood glucose escape to 8.3&#x000a0;mmol/L (150&#x000a0;mg/dL), will overestimate the end of action from a clinical perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. At the same time, the exact point of last GIR above zero may be challenging to estimate and thus prone to some variability due to the small and erratic glucose infusion often needed during the last part of a glucose clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Consequently, we chose offset of action as a measure of late glucose-lowering effect since this approach was assessed to provide the best combination of robustness and clinical relevance. In the present analysis, the endpoints <italic>t</italic>

The analysis demonstrated that faster aspart provides faster onset and greater early exposure and glucose-lowering effect, as well as earlier offset, compared with IAsp. Thus, faster aspart has the potential to more closely mimic the endogenous prandial insulin secretion pattern seen in healthy individuals and thereby to provide improved postprandial glucose control in patients with diabetes compared with currently available rapid-acting insulin analogues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
