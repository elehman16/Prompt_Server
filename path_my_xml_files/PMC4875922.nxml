The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of V158866.

V158866 was well tolerated, with no apparent treatment-related effects on laboratory variables. V158866 was rapidly absorbed with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 9.6&#x02013;18.3&#x000a0;h (Day 7; Part B). V158866 reached steady state within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days of administration, with an accumulation ratio, based on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub>, of approximately 2 on Day 7. V158866 showed a linear relationship between dose and AUC across the entire dose range. V158866 caused reversible, dose-related increases in plasma ECs.

Cannabinoids, the pharmacologically active components of cannabis, act in vertebrates primarily on the G-protein-coupled post-synaptic receptors CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub>. CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are predominantly located in the central nervous system (CNS), and additionally in tissues including the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, gut, genital tract and muscle. Agonism typically causes cognitive impairment, hypolocomotion, hyperphagia, hypothermia, anticonvulsant activity and analgesia. Endogenous ligands at the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors include the endocannabinoids, anandamide (<italic>N</italic>-arachidonyl ethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol. Those receptors are also activated by &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal active substance in cannabis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. THC and other direct CB<sub>1</sub> agonists (e.g. dronabinol, nabilone) have a range of clinical benefits, including analgesia (particularly for neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), anxiolysis, antidepressant and antiemetic properties, appetite stimulation and muscle relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, their clinical utility is limited by multiple side effects, such as impairment of cognition and motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an integral membrane enzyme that hydrolyses the endocannabinoid, AEA, and related signalling lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In humans, FAAH exists in two forms (FAAH1 and FAAH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). FAAH-knockout (KO) mice display analgesia and anti-inflammatory phenotypes without disruption of motility, cognition or body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], effects which are emulated by pharmacologic inhibition of FAAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. That has led to the hypothesis that FAAH inhibitors may be effective for the treatment of pain without the side effects associated with direct-acting cannabinoid agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Several FAAH inhibitors are reported to be in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but to our knowledge the only published clinical studies use the irreversible, urea-based inhibitor PF-04457845 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PF-04457845 is well tolerated at doses that cause maximal inhibition of FAAH and elevation of plasma endocannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and was progressed into a phase II study in osteoarthritic pain where it was found to be without effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Whilst there has been some debate about the trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the lack of effect of PF-04457845 in osteoarthritic pain argues for a more detailed review of the rationale for phase II clinical trials of FAAH inhibitors, with particular reference to the effects of cannabinoid agonists in patients with any particular pain state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Indeed, as the beneficial clinical effects of cannabinoids are often due to their effects on comorbidities (rather than the perception of noxious stimuli per se), FAAH inhibition may be more appropriate for the treatment of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>This is a report of the first clinical study of the azetidine analogue V158866, a potent, reversible, orally available FAAH inhibitor with efficacy in rodent models of inflammatory pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses of V158866 in healthy male subjects. The secondary objectives of the study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of V158866.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single centre, phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, adaptive dose, single (Part A) and repeated ascending (Part B) dose study designed to compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of V158866 with placebo. The trial was conducted at Hammersmith Medicines Research (HMR), London, UK.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligibility for this study required that subjects be healthy men aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years, with a body mass index between 19 and 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects had to be able to provide a semen sample and willing to use an effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 4&#x000a0;months after the last dose of study medication. All subjects had to be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the entire study, and provided written informed consent before participating.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included prior vasectomy, or the intention to father a child within 4 months of study conclusion, multiple drug allergies or allergy to any of the components of V158866 study medication and laboratory, electrocardiography (ECG) or other abnormalities that might increase the risk to the subject or interfere with the interpretation of study results. The remaining, standardized criteria related to cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, recreational and therapeutic drug use (except paracetamol), and seropositivity for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Subjects were not permitted to consume caffeine-containing food or drinks, grapefruit products, or alcohol for 24&#x000a0;h before or during each admission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was conducted between February and July 2011 in two parts, with Part B commencing after completion of Part A.</p><p><italic>Part A</italic> Single ascending dose, partial cross over: subjects in two cohorts of nine (six active and three placebo at each dose level) each received two single oral doses of V158866 and one dose of matching placebo in separate study periods, with a washout of at least 7&#x000a0;days between successive doses. Subjects participated in Part A for about 9&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p><italic>Part B</italic> Repeated ascending dose, parallel group: subjects in four cohorts of eight (six active and two placebo at each dose level) each received once-daily doses of V158866 or placebo for 7&#x000a0;days. Subjects participated in Part B for about 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>For each cohort, eligible subjects were assigned a sequential randomisation number on admission and treatment was allocated according to a pre-defined randomisation code generated by the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) programmer at HMR. Randomisation lists were not available to personnel at the study centre (with the exception of the Pharmacist and delegated study staff involved in dispensing), the Vernalis monitor, project statisticians or any of the project team at Vernalis until after database lock.</p><p>During Part A, between Part A and Part B, and during Part B of the study, the safety, PK and PD data from the previous dose cohort were reviewed in a blinded manner before recommendations for the next dose level were made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dose Selection</title><p>In non-clinical toxicology studies, the no observable adverse event level (NOAEL) dose of V158866 in rat and dog was associated with area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to 24&#x000a0;h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub>) values of 13 and 87&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively. Using a safety factor of 100 and comparison with the NOAEL on a mg/kg basis, or a safety factor of 10 and two different methods for predicting human exposure (PK modelling, and body surface area-corrected human equivalent dose), the estimated safe starting dose range based on the rat or dog was 2&#x02013;7&#x000a0;mg and 25&#x02013;150&#x000a0;mg, respectively. The starting dose of V158866 chosen in Part A of the study was 5&#x000a0;mg. As toxicological findings in the rat included minor reversible changes in the male reproductive tract, safety assessments included routine seminology. The doses selected for the remainder of the study were chosen on the basis of (blinded) emerging safety, PK and PD data to determine a safe and tolerable dose of V158866, maximum inhibition of FAAH and significant increases in plasma endocannabinoid concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Safety</title><p>Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) (coded using MedDRA version 14.1), recording vital signs (supine/semi-recumbent and standing blood pressure and pulse; respiratory rate and oral temperature), 12-lead ECGs, physical examination, body weight, laboratory safety tests (haematology, biochemistry, endocrine markers and urinalysis) and telemetry for cardiac rhythm monitoring. Semen quality was assessed at baseline and follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Bioanalytical Methods</title><p>Venous blood samples were collected from each subject into lithium-heparinised tubes at intervals from pre-dose until 72&#x000a0;h (Part A) or 240&#x000a0;h (Part B) post-dose. Samples were centrifuged within 60&#x000a0;min of collection and the resultant plasma split into aliquots (for V158866 and endocannabinoid determination) and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or below until assay.</p><p>Urine was collected and pooled into 1-L polypropylene containers and stored at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for the duration of each specified collection interval (12 or 24&#x000a0;h).

Plasma samples were analysed for AEA, <italic>N</italic>-linoleoyl ethanolamide (LEA), <italic>N</italic>-oleoyl ethanolamide (OEA) and <italic>N</italic>-palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA) using a validated LC&#x02013;MS/MS method. Blood FAAH activity was determined by the method of Ahn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For all assays, samples in which the concentration of test agent exceeded the calibration range were diluted with blank assay matrix and re-analysed. The calibration ranges, Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ) and accuracy values (based upon the calibration standards across the range) for each assay are detailed in the electronic supplementary material (Table ESM1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Test Product</title><p>V158866 was presented as a liquid suspension (2&#x000a0;mg/mL or 20&#x000a0;mg/mL) in OraBlend&#x02122; suspending vehicle containing 5&#x000a0;% weight/volume (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Kollidon K90) for oral administration, taken with 180&#x000a0;mL of water. Subjects were fasted for 10&#x000a0;h before each dose. Six dose levels (5, 15, 30, 70, 150 and 300&#x000a0;mg) of V158866 were administered in Part A as single doses. Four dose levels (50, 150, 300 and 500&#x000a0;mg) of V158866 were administered in Part B as daily doses for 7&#x000a0;days. Placebo was identical to the test product without the active ingredient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data Analysis and Statistics</title><p>No formal sample size calculation was performed as this was an exploratory study. Sample sizes of 6&#x000a0;V158866-treated subjects per dose level and 18 (Part A) or 8 (Part B) in the pooled placebo groups were considered sufficient to achieve the objectives of the study. No formal hypothesis testing was conducted.</p><p>Descriptive statistics [number of observations and mean and coefficient of variation (CV) or median and range according to distribution] are presented for continuous PK and PD variables, with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate.

V158866 was well tolerated after single oral doses of 5&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mg, and repeated oral doses of 50&#x02013;500&#x000a0;mg for up to 7&#x000a0;days. Treatment-emergent adverse events for V158866 after single and repeated doses were mostly mild in severity and similar to those reported for placebo, except perhaps at the highest repeated dose (500&#x000a0;mg daily). The most commonly reported adverse events were nervous system disorders, as might be expected for a CNS-active drug, and symptoms such as dizziness and orthostatic hypotension might have been treatment-related. This bland tolerability profile is consistent with both the phenotype of the FAAH KO mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and with previous clinical reports of the effects of FAAH inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. V158866 had no effect on vital signs, ECG, routine laboratory safety tests or on any seminology variable.</p><p>After single oral doses, the pharmacokinetics of V158866 were predictable, with rapid absorption followed by elimination with a half-life in the range of 5.4&#x02013;11.2&#x000a0;h. V158866 showed a linear relationship between dose and exposure across the entire dose range, with no evidence of the non-linear pharmacokinetics reported for PF-04457845 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The repeated dose pharmacokinetics of V158866 are suitable for once-daily administration, with rapid absorption, a non-compartmental terminal elimination half-life in the range 9.6&#x02013;18.3&#x000a0;h on Day 7, and clear dose-proportionality at the 7-day time point. V158866 reached steady state <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days of administration, with an accumulation ratio (at doses of 150&#x000a0;mg and above, based on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub>) of about twofold on Day 7. When half-life is estimated from the extent of accumulation in Part B, the approximately twofold accumulation of V158866 is consistent with the terminal elimination half-lives determined in Part B.</p><p>There was a tendency for the plasma concentration of V158866 to increase between 18 and 24&#x000a0;h after administration in both Part A and Part B. The reason for that is unclear. Whilst it is possible that V158866 is subject to enterohepatic recirculation, we would expect such a peak in plasma concentrations to occur earlier in the PK profile or after breakfast at 24&#x000a0;h. However, as faecal samples were not collected, we have no evidence for the presence of enterohepatic recirculation. As V158866 is more soluble at high pH, it is also possible that further absorption of V158866 from the large intestine occurred between 18 and 24&#x000a0;h after oral administration.</p><p>We had initially intended to measure the pharmacodynamics of V158866 using two mechanistic biomarkers: inhibition of FAAH, and changes in EC concentrations as indicators of FAAH inhibition. However, in our hands, the blood FAAH inhibition assay was not precise enough: whilst it provided a clear &#x02018;all-or-none&#x02019; marker of FAAH inhibition (which was complete at doses of 30&#x000a0;mg and above in Part A and 50&#x000a0;mg in Part B), it was unsuitable for more detailed PD analysis. As V158866 acts as an inhibitor of FAAH in blood with an IC<sub>50</sub> (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of ~60&#x000a0;nM (data not shown), we relied on the measurement of plasma EC concentrations as proof of mechanism for this study.</p><p>The effect of single oral doses of V158866 on plasma AEA, OEA and PEA concentrations was consistent with that of a potent, reversible FAAH inhibitor. V158866 caused dose-related increases in plasma AEA, OEA and PEA, which lagged some 2&#x000a0;h behind the pharmacokinetic <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, closely followed the changes in plasma V158866 concentrations (including the tendency to increase between 18&#x000a0;and 24&#x000a0;h post-dose), and returned to baseline at 72&#x000a0;h post-dose. This profile is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effect being due to parent compound rather than active metabolites. The exception to that pattern was LEA, which showed a secondary increase in plasma concentrations in response to V158866 (but not placebo) at the 12- and 18-h time points. As LEA is a peripheral endocannabinoid produced in high levels by the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we speculate that this may be a local effect of V158866 in transit through the gut, on gastrointestinal cells, resulting in a &#x02018;pulse&#x02019; of LEA production which is detectable in the plasma.</p><p>The counter-clockwise hysteresis loop observed in Part A might be a result of either a requirement for V158866 to distribute to an effect compartment, or the result of the indirect response mechanism of V158866: in the presence of FAAH inhibition, changes in ECs become dependent on their rate of synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We have no evidence to refute either hypothesis. Nevertheless, V158866 behaves very differently to PF-04457845, which acts as an irreversible inhibitor of FAAH with pharmacodynamics that outlive the presence of the drug and are dependent on enzyme turnover to terminate their effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this respect, we expect V158866 to be straightforward to dose titrate, particularly when there is a need to reduce or terminate the effects of FAAH inhibition.</p><p>We chose to analyse the dose&#x02013;response relationship of V158866 at the <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values in Part B, as this approach allowed a concentration&#x02013;response curve to be generated for each EC at hemi-equilibrium and minimized the influence of hysteresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. V158866 caused dose-related increases in plasma AEA, LEA, OEA and PEA concentrations, with the plasma concentration effect best described by a sigmoidal <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> relationship. The potency of V158866 differs according to EC (PEA&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;OEA&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;AEA&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;LEA), which appears to reflect the differential substrate specificity of FAAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and argues for the use of more than one EC as a plasma biomarker in future studies. Nevertheless, we are confident that V158866 is capable of inducing maximal increases in plasma ECs for three reasons: firstly, the relationship between plasma V158866 and EC concentrations appears to reach an <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>); secondly, at Day 7 of administration (Part B), further increases in plasma V158866 from <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> at 300 and 500&#x000a0;mg/day (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) cause only moderate increases in plasma AEA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and minimal changes in OEA and PEA concentrations, whilst LEA concentrations are doubled (electronic supplementary material, Fig. ESM6); and thirdly, the maximum changes in plasma AEA, LEA, OEA and PEA concentrations (approximately 3, 4, 8 and 5&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively), are very similar to the maximum values reported for PF-04457845 in a similar study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This report summarises the first in-man study of the novel, reversible FAAH inhibitor, V158866. V158866 had a good tolerability profile, linear pharmacokinetics suitable for once-daily administration, and reversible effects on plasma endocannabinoids. Our analysis indicates that maximum increases in AEA, OEA and PEA occurred at plasma V158866 concentrations of around 300&#x000a0;ng/mL or greater, which were achieved with oral V158866 doses of 300&#x02013;500&#x000a0;mg/day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
