Here we used a human thermal pain model to compare self-reports of expected, concurrent, and recalled efficacy of a topical placebo analgesic, and tested associations of the three measures of efficacy with changes in dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in brain using [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride with positron emission tomography (PET). Participants (15 healthy women) were assessed on three test days. The first test day included a laboratory visit, during which the temperature needed to evoke consistent pain was determined, placebo analgesia was induced via verbal and experience-based expectation, and the placebo response was measured. On two subsequent test days, PET scans were performed in <italic>Control</italic> and <italic>Placebo</italic> conditions, respectively, in counterbalanced order. During Visit 1, concurrent and recalled placebo efficacy were unrelated; during the <italic>Placebo</italic> PET visit, expected and recalled efficacy were highly correlated (&#x003c1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.68, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005), but concurrent efficacy was unrelated to expected or recalled efficacy. Region of interest analysis revealed dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was lower in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the <italic>Placebo</italic> condition (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, uncorrected), and greater change in this measure was associated with higher levels of recalled analgesic efficacy (&#x003c1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.58, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). These preliminary findings underscore the need to consider how self-reported symptom improvement is assessed in clinical trials of analgesics and suggest that dopaminergic activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may promote recalled efficacy of placebo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Healthy women reported on expected, concurrent, and recalled placebo analgesia.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Measures were obtained in the lab and during PET scanning with [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in PFC was associated with placebo analgesia.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>This relationship was specific to recalled placebo analgesia efficacy.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Placebo effect</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>PET</kwd><kwd>[<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride</kwd><kwd>Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinical outcomes across a broad range of disorders are influenced by placebo effects. Self-reported symptom improvement is a common measure of the placebo response, particularly among patients with chronic pain disorders, which often lack biologically based measures of disease severity (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Farrar et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Von Korff et al., 1992</xref>). In chronic pain patients, subjective symptoms of pain are the leading cause for health care utilization (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Von Korff et al., 1991</xref>) and the basis for perceived success of treatment (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Dworkin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Turk et al., 1993</xref>). Isolating biological mechanisms that mediate discrete forms of self-reported placebo analgesia may help minimize placebo effects in the context of clinical trials, or maximize them in the context of clinical management of chronic pain.</p><p>The subjective experience of pain is shaped by many factors, including mood and affect, expectations, prior sensory information, and the subsequent appraisal of this information (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Senkowski et al., 2014</xref>). Neuroimaging studies have suggested that placebo analgesia involves increased functional activity in medial, lateral, and orbitofrontal aspects of prefrontal cortex (PFC), brain regions commonly implicated in regulating expectations and reappraising outcomes (see meta-analysis by <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amanzio et al., 2013</xref>). This heightened engagement in brain regions that may inhibit the experience of pain through cognitive mechanisms, is often coupled with diminished activity in the insula and striatum, brain regions commonly implicating in indexing the actual experience of pain (see meta-analysis by <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amanzio et al., 2013</xref>). Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have previously shown that, among patients with a pain disorder, placebo analgesia is associated with heightened functional activity in ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman et al., 2004</xref>). Other PET studies have shown that endogenous opioid release in regions of the PFC and striatum also mediate placebo analgesia (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Pecina et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Zubieta et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Zubieta et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, dopamine release in the striatum has been linked to placebo effects in Parkinson's disease (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente-Fernandez et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Lidstone et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Strafella et al., 2006</xref>) and placebo analgesia (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Such studies of dopamine release have not been extended to extrastriatal brain regions, leaving open the question of how extrastriatal dopaminergic function may contribute to placebo analgesia. Moreover, despite the role of dopamine in shaping expectations, concurrent experience, and memory (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Schultz, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Wise, 2004</xref>), whether distinct aspects of self-report are differentially related to subjective efficacy of placebo and to dopaminergic function has not been fully explored (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Pecina et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, overlapping psychological processes, related to expectation, concurrent experience and memory, have important roles in shaping a wide range of placebo effects (e. g., <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Benedetti et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Leuchter et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, distinct self-reported measures of placebo analgesia may vary in magnitude, which in turn may be related to dopaminergic function.</p><p>To address these issues, we assessed self-reports of expected, concurrent, and recalled placebo analgesia using a thermal pain model. We used [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride, a high-affinity D2/D3 dopamine receptor ligand (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2002</xref>), with PET to quantify striatal and extrastriatal receptor binding as participants underwent a sustained pain challenge with and without a topical placebo analgesic. We hypothesized that placebo effects would vary in magnitude, depending on type of self-report measurement. The dopamine system has consistently been linked with pain processing and placebo effects; therefore, we hypothesized that D2/D3 dopamine-receptor availability in the striatum and vlPFC would be lower in the placebo condition, reflecting enhanced endogenous dopamine release. As distinct brain regions that comprise the dopamine system may influence a variety of mechanisms implicated in the appraisal subjective experiences, we also hypothesized that dopamine release would be differentially related to discrete self-reported measures of placebo analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifteen young women (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD: 24.33&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.11&#x000a0;years) completed the study. Participants were medication-free, right-handed, nonsmokers with no current or lifetime major medical illnesses. The SCID-I/NP was administered to confirm the absence of current and lifetime psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV-TR, Axis I or II). Participants underwent a urine drug screening at the beginning of each visit to confirm that they were drug-free. Visits were scheduled to occur during the follicular phase of each participant's menstrual cycle, and were re-scheduled as needed to accommodate cycle irregularity. On each testing visit, participants reported the first day of her last cycle, and provided a saliva sample to test if estradiol and progesterone levels were consistent with the follicular phase of her cycle. Participants gave written informed consent prior to enrollment, and at the conclusion of the study, were fully debriefed regarding the use of deception. The institutional review board of the University of California, Los Angeles approved all aspects of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Experiment overview</title><p>Procedures were modified from a well-established paradigm in which placebo analgesia is induced via verbal and experience-based expectations of pain relief (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2004</xref>). Participants were told that the goal of the study was to evaluate how the brain responds to thermal stimulation when it is paired with topical application of either a pain-relief medication or a control liquid that does not contain medication. The <italic>Placebo</italic> was identified as Lidocaine, a powerful topically active, liquid analgesic. The <italic>Control</italic> was identified as water, which would not affect pain but otherwise would provide a sensory experience similar to that of the purportedly active medication. In actuality, both <italic>Placebo</italic> and <italic>Control</italic> liquids were water; no active medication was used. The experimenter wore a white coat, applied the <italic>Placebo</italic> and <italic>Control</italic> liquids with sterile, cotton-tipped applicators, from amber vials marked &#x0201c;LIDOCAINE&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;WATER&#x0201d;, respectively. The investigator wore examination gloves while applying the <italic>Placebo</italic> liquid but not the <italic>Control</italic> liquid. During a laboratory visit, the temperature required to evoke a subjective rating of moderate pain was determined, and placebo analgesia was induced via an expectancy paradigm, as described below. On two separate days, PET scans were performed using [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride to quantify D2/D3 receptor availability and how it may differ following application of the <italic>Placebo</italic> and <italic>Control</italic> liquids, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Laboratory visit</title><p>The laboratory visit (Test day 1) had two parts: part 1, to identify the temperature of thermal stimulus needed to evoke consistent pain and induce placebo analgesia via a verbal and experience-based expectancy procedure; part 2, to measure the placebo response during a painful thermal stimulation.</p><sec id="s0075"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Define thermal stimulus profile (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A)</title><p>The <italic>Control</italic> solution, which was truthfully identified to the participant as water, was applied to the left upper or lower volar forearm (location counterbalanced with that of <italic>Placebo</italic> across subjects). A thermal stimulus was then delivered continuously for 12&#x000a0;min to the same location using a temperature contact device (Yale University Bioengineering Department; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Jarcho et al., 2013</xref>). Stimulation started at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and pain was rated at 15-sec intervals. Ratings were made by finger press on a button box according to a 0-to-100 (no pain to most pain imaginable) visual analog scale (VAS), which was displayed on a computer screen in front of the participant. During each interval, a red bar on the VAS began at 0 and increased by 1 point every 150&#x000a0;ms. The participant was instructed to make a button press when the bar reached the point on the VAS that described her current level of pain. The bar remained at that point on the VAS for the remainder of the 15-sec interval before being reset to 0. Temperature was adjusted at each interval to maintain a moderate level of pain, defined as 30&#x02013;40 on the 0 to 100 VAS scale, with 35 as a target rating. Ratings 15 points above or below the target rating resulted in a 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C increase or decrease in temperature; parametrically smaller adjustments were made as ratings approached 35 VAS. To avoid tissue damage, the maximum temperature was set to 46&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Expectancy procedure to induce placebo analgesia (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B)</title><p>The <italic>Placebo</italic>, characterized as Lidocaine, was applied to a distinct location of the upper or lower volar forearm (opposite location as the control). A 3-min continuous thermal stimulus, purportedly at the average temperature required to evoke moderate pain (i.e., the average temperature for all intervals with a rating between 30 and 40 VAS), was then delivered to the same location. To simulate the sensation of analgesia, the thermal stimulus was surreptitiously decreased by 3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C from the average temperature actually required to evoke moderate pain. This procedure was performed to reinforce the expectation of analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>2.3.3</label><title>Measurement of placebo analgesia (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B)</title><p>Prior to receiving the 12-min thermal-stimulus profile paired with <italic>Placebo</italic>, participants rated how effective they expected the analgesic treatment would be on a 0 to 100 ("not at all" to "entirely") VAS scale.

Although participants rated their pain at 15-sec intervals, the temperature of the stimulus was no longer adjusted on the basis of these ratings. Instead, the temperature at each interval was set to the temperature determined by the initial thermal-stimulus profile. Thus, the temperature during each interval was identical during the <italic>Control</italic> and <italic>Placebo</italic> conditions, while ratings were allowed to vary.

Thus, the first scanning block comprised frames 1&#x02013;7, and the second scanning block comprised frames 8&#x02013;15. For scans in both the <italic>Placebo</italic> and <italic>Control</italic> conditions, thermal stimulation was initiated during the second scanning block, at the start of frame 10.

In the first step, a simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM) (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lammertsma and Hume, 1996</xref>), was used to determine k2&#x02032; estimates and generate time-activity curves (TACs) from one region of interest (ROI) with a high level of receptor availability, in this case the striatum (comprised of nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen), and another with negligible receptor expression, in this case the cerebellum (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2002</xref>), to serve as a reference tissue. Bilateral striatal ROIs were delineated on each participant's anatomical MRI using FMRIB [functional MRI of the brain] Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool [FIRST], a template-based method in FSL [FMRIB Software Library] (Oxford University, Oxford UK). Unlike the striatum, the cerebellum has negligible and homogeneous D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2002</xref>). As such, cerebellar TACs can be derived from several consecutive slices, which reflect D2/D3 dopamine receptor binding in the structure as a whole. Bilateral cerebellar ROIs were manually delineated with cylindrical volumes (diameter&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;mm; height&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;mm) placed in the middle of the cerebellum to avoid potential artifacts introduced at CSF/grey matter intersections. In the second step, ROIs were transferred to the co-registered PET data, where TACs were extracted and entered, along with the fixed k2&#x02032; estimate obtained in step one, into an SRTM2 (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Carson, 2002</xref>) pixel-wise analysis that produced a whole-brain BP<sc>nd</sc> map for each participant.

Expected and recalled placebo efficacy occurred at equally high levels across both visits. Concurrent efficacy was only observed during the laboratory visit. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was lower in left vlPFC when the stimulus complex for a topical placebo analgesic was present during noxious thermal stimulation compared to a control stimulus complex. The degree to which receptor availability was higher in left vlPFC in the <italic>Control</italic> than the <italic>Placebo</italic> condition was associated with higher levels of recalled analgesic efficacy. While derived from a small sample, these results support research that suggests the dopamine system plays important role in mediating placebo effects (e. g., <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Boileau et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Brody et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente-Fernandez et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Haltia et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Kaasinen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Lidstone et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Martikainen et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Strafella et al., 2006</xref>), and provide further insight into the psychological and neuropharmacological mechanisms that promote placebo analgesia.</p><p>Pain is a subjective experience. Thus, the method used to measure placebo analgesia may affect the magnitude of self-reported placebo effects. In this study, relatively high levels of placebo analgesia were obtained with measures of expected and recalled efficacy. However, expected efficacy during the <italic>Placebo</italic> PET scan was negatively correlated with the number of days that had elapsed from the laboratory visit. This suggests that temporal factors related to prior experience may influence some measures of placebo response. Hints of other temporal influences on placebo effects also emerged. For instance, there was a lack of continuity between all three forms of placebo response during the initial laboratory visit, yet high levels of continuity for expected and recalled efficacy during PET scanning. Thus, some form of experience-related consolidation may occur during the initial laboratory visit that influences the subsequent experience of placebo analgesia.</p><p>Concurrent efficacy, calculated as the difference between online pain ratings when the 12-min thermal stimulus was paired with placebo, relative to control, was only observed during the laboratory visit. Closer inspection of the data shows that when the thermal stimulus was paired with placebo, participants made equally low ratings during clinic and PET visits. However, when the thermal stimulus was paired with the control condition, significantly higher ratings were provided in the laboratory than in the PET environment. This suggests that factors unrelated to placebo analgesia may have modulated pain during the control scan (e.g., anxiety for painful stimulations).</p><p>There was weak evidence for a role of prefrontal cortical dopaminergic transmission in placebo analgesia. Specifically, dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was lower in left vlPFC when analgesia was anticipated, suggesting that prefrontal cortical dopamine release occurred. These findings correspond with fMRI studies that, using similar experimental methods, show the vlPFC is engaged by placebo analgesia and is related to placebo efficacy (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2009</xref>). In that work, as with in the current study, the memory of placebo efficacy was established during an initial testing session, and then retrieved and evaluated in light of stimuli delivered during the neuroimaging phase of the experiment. This reflects one of the primary functions of dopaminergic transmission in PFC, which is to maintain memory representations and update them at appropriate times (reviewed by <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Seamans and Robbins, 2010</xref>). Thus dopaminergic transmission in PFC may help promote placebo analgesia by maintaining memory of treatment efficacy and updating beliefs about that efficacy.</p><p>An effect-size analysis demonstrated that dopamine D2/D3 BP<sc>nd</sc> was reduced in a widespread network of brain regions often implicated in nociception and placebo analgesia (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Apkarian et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Atlas and Wager, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Larrea and Peyron, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Peyron et al., 2000</xref>), including striatum, dorsal anterior cingulate, thalamus, hippocampus and insula along with vlPFC. Failure to reach prescribed statistical significance, particularly in the striatum, may be related to the small sample size, methodological differences with prior work, and/or limitations in the design of the current study. For instance, in prior PET studies that find a relationship between placebo analgesia and striatal dopamine transmission (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2008</xref>), participants learned about the effectiveness of the placebo while undergoing PET scanning, without the opportunity to form experience-based expectations about the placebo's efficacy. Given that the striatum plays an integral role in learning, these findings are not unexpected. In the present study, participants formed experience-based expectations about the placebo's efficacy during their initial laboratory visit. Thus, unlike prior work, participants had already learned about the effectiveness of the placebo before to undergoing PET scanning. Because of this, dopamine transmission may have been more closely related to the implicit or explicit <italic>recall</italic> of previously learned relationships, which is commonly associated with engagement of vlPFC (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Badre and Wagner, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Murray and Ranganath, 2007</xref>). This suggests that the vlPFC may play a critical role in promoting placebo analgesia, once the relationship between a placebo and the experience of analgesia has been learned. Future work that differentiates the neural mechanisms implicated in promoting suggestion and learning-based analgesia as they differ from the recall of learned associations is critical.</p><p>Alternatively kinetics of the radioligand used in the present study in conjunction with the length of PET scanning may have contributed to a failure to observe statistically significant effects in the striatum. Prior PET studies assessed the relationship between DA system function and placebo effects using [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). This radiotracer has relatively rapid kinetics and uptake/washout properties that make it well suited to measure BP in brain regions with a high density of D2/D3 receptors, such as the striatum, but largely precludes the reliable measurement of BP in brain regions with a low density of D2/D3 receptors, such as the cortex (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Farde et al., 1987</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Kohler et al., 1985</xref>). [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride has relatively slow kinetics and uptake/washout properties that make it well suited to measure BP in brain regions with both high and low density D2/D3 receptors (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Zald et al., 2010</xref>). However, the rate of uptake and washout of [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride varies across brain regions depending on D2/D3 receptor density. In regions with low D2/D3 receptor density, uptake and washout occur more rapidly than in regions with high D2/D3 receptor density. Thus, the duration of scanning (165&#x000a0;min from tracer injection to the end of scanning) may have been sufficient to obtain a reliable signal in vlPFC (low D2/D3 receptor density), it may have been insufficient to obtain a reliable signal in the striatum (high D2/D3 receptor density). Some argue that a scan duration of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h is necessary for [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride to achieve maximal stability in the striatum (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kegeles et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2002</xref>), while others suggest such long-duration scans are optimal for studies that include a task-based experimental manipulation (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Ceccarini et al., 2012</xref>). Follow-up studies may be better able to simultaneously detect effects of placebo analgesia on DA function in cortical and striatal regions by implementing longer [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride PET scans.</p><p>The study had two additional limitations. First, only women were assessed. Although a preponderance of evidence demonstrates gender differences in nociceptive processing, the mechanisms driving this difference remain unclear (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Mogil, 2012</xref>). Given the limited sample size of this preliminary study, it was not possible to assess a sufficient number of men and women to make meaningful conclusions about potential gender effects. Since more women than men suffer from chronic pain syndromes (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Mogil, 2012</xref>), we sought to maximize the potential clinical impact of this work by specifically studying women. Follow-up studies with a larger sample size should include men and women to determine whether results are generalizable, or if gender-based differences emerge. A second limitation is that the thermal stimulus profile was defined in the context of the <italic>Control</italic> condition. This replicates well-tested methods used in prior studies relating brain function to placebo analgesia (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wager et al., 2004</xref>); however, defining the thermal stimulus profile independently, during a separate laboratory visit, may optimize this design. By implementing this change, order of <italic>Control</italic> and <italic>Placebo</italic> conditions could then be counterbalanced during the laboratory visit in which the expectation manipulation is performed.</p><p>Despite these limitations, taken together, these findings are consistent with an important role of cortical dopaminergic transmission in modulating specific forms of placebo analgesia. They provide initial evidence that dopamine transmission in vlPFC modulates learning-based placebo analgesia. Further work is needed to determine whether learned, compared with verbally induced expectation of placebo analgesia is associated with distinct pathways of DA transmission. Finally, these results underscore the need to carefully consider how self-reported symptom improvement is assessed in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amanzio</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Benedetti</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Porro</surname><given-names>C.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Palermo</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cauda</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of brain correlates of placebo analgesia in human experimental pain</article-title><source>Hum.

An initial laboratory visit included 2 phases, depicted in Panels A and B. (A) Define thermal stimulus profile. A 12-min continuous thermal stimulus was delivered to the same location of the volar forearm where the <italic>Control</italic> liquid had been applied. Stimulation started at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and pain was rated at 25-sec intervals using an electronic visual analog scale. Temperature was adjusted at each interval to maintain a moderate level of pain. (B) Expectancy procedure and measurement of placebo analgesia. The <italic>Placebo</italic>, characterized as Lidocaine, was applied to a distinct location of the volar forearm. To produce the sensation of analgesia, a 3-min continuous thermal stimulus, purportedly the average temperature required to evoke moderate pain, was then delivered to the same location, but surreptitiously decreased by 3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Prior to receiving the 12-min thermal stimulus profile paired with <italic>Placebo</italic>, participants rated how effective they expected the analgesic treatment would be. Thermal stimulation was delivered to the location where the experienced-based expectancy procedure had been carried out. Although participants rated their pain at 25-sec intervals, these ratings were now independent of the temperature. Thus, the temperature was held constant across <italic>Control</italic> and <italic>Placebo</italic> conditions while the ratings were allowed to vary. Once the thermal stimulus concluded, participants were asked to report their recalled efficacy of the analgesic treatment. After their laboratory visit, participants received two PET scans: for one scan the 12-min thermal stimulus profile was paired with the <italic>Control</italic> (Panel C), for the other it was paired with the <italic>Placebo</italic> (order counterbalanced; Panel D). As with the laboratory visit, participants rated expected and recalled efficacy of the <italic>Placebo</italic> prior to and following thermal stimulation, respectively.
