training program on gait, mobility and quality of life of post-acute stroke patients.
[Subjects] Twenty-one individuals with unilateral stroke participated in this study. All
participants had suffered from first-ever stroke with time since onset of at least 3
months. [Methods] A single-blinded, non-equivalent, pre-post controlled design with
1-month follow-up was adopted. Participants received either a forced-use or a conventional
physical therapy program for 2 weeks. The main outcomes assessed were preferred and
fastest walking velocities, spatial and temporal symmetry indexes of gait, the timed up
and go test, the Rivermead Mobility Index, and the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale
(Taiwan version). [Results] Forced-use training induced greater improvements in gait and
mobility than conventional physical therapy. In addition, compared to pre-training,
patients in the conventional physical therapy group walked faster but more asymmetrically
after training. However, neither program effectively improved in-hospital quality of life.
[Conclusion] The forced-use approach can be successfully applied to the lower extremities
of stroke patients to improve mobility, walking speeds and symmetry of gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Forced-use</kwd><kwd>Mobility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is an epidemic worldwide. It is the second leading cause of death in the world<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the third leading cause of death in
Taiwan<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. More importantly, it is a
leading cause of long-term disability in adults<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
has been recognized that individuals with stroke-related hemiparesis bear most of the body
weight on their unaffected limb despite the fact that the affected limb may already be able
to bear weight efficiently during the course of recovery<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weight-bearing asymmetry in
stance and during functional activities may arise from compensatory patterns learned in the
early post-stroke period known as learned misuse or disuse after stroke<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the disuse
is left uncorrected, it may lead to further balance impairments, gait abnormalities and
ambulation dysfunction<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forced-use
training (FUT) is a treatment strategy, designed to compel usage of the more-affected limb
by intensive practice of task-oriented activities to shape behavior, and was originally
developed for upper extremity rehabilitation following stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Controlled experiments have shown that constraint-induced movement
therapy (CIMT), a version of forced-use training, is effective at overcoming the learned
non-use of affected upper limbs and elicits significant improvements in motor function and
real-life usage of the affected upper limb after cerebrovascular accidents<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have also shown that CIMT or modified CIMT (CIMT with less
training intensity) can improve some aspects of quality of life (QOL) in chronic or elderly
stroke survivors<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it would appear sensible to conduct CIMT, or FUT for
individuals with stroke to enhance the recovery of the affected lower extremity and
independence in functional mobility. Efforts have been made to force the use of the affected
lower limb of stroke patients by rehabilitation professionals. Essentially, placing joints
of the affected leg into biomechanically disadvantaged positions<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, or simply immobilizing the joints by splinting<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, have been used to restrain the unaffected lower limbs of stroke
patients. Single limb exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> or
unilateral step training<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> have also been
used to work the affected lower limb intensively. Furthermore, intensive, practice of
gait-related activities without restraint of the unaffected limb has improved the gait
performance of individuals with multiple sclerosis to a certain degree<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, owing to the bi-pedal nature of human locomotion
and mobility, forced-use by constraint of the unaffected limb or intensive unilateral use of
the affected limb may actually prevent walking or functional mobility performance or
practice in task-oriented ways.</p><p>It has been shown that shoe inserts (shoe lift or shoe wedge) fitted under the unaffected
lower extremity of stroke patients forces the affected limb to bear more weight and resume a
more symmetrical weight-bearing stance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a shoe insert (7-degree wedge) was fitted to a group of stroke
patients and worn during physical therapy sessions for three weeks, it significantly
improved gait speed<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is important to
note that shoe inserts not only compel the stroke patients to shift the body weight onto the
paretic leg but also permit functional mobility to be performed in natural ways. Since
task-oriented training for mobility enhances gait performance and mobility after stroke<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, we hypothesized that combined with the
use of a weight-shift insert, it would help to overcome learned disuse of the affected lower
extremity of stroke patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the
effects of a forced-use training program which utilized a weight-shift technique and
task-oriented lower extremity training on gait performance, mobility and QOL of sub-acute or
chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were a convenience sample from the inpatient rehabilitation unit of the
Tao-Yuan Branch of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in northern Taiwan. Inclusion criteria were
stroke patients suffering from their first-ever stroke, three months or longer post-stroke,
with a Brunnstrom stage of the affected lower extremity between III to V, a Mini-Mental
State Examination score &#x02265; 24, a Functional Ambulation Category score&#x02265; 2, and the ability to
walk 3 meters with or without an assistive device, who attended of physical therapy sessions
five times a week for 2 weeks. Subjects were excluded if they had any medical condition that
would have restricted their participation in the exercise program, such as congestive heart
failure, or uncontrolled hypertension. Pre-existing neurological conditions other than
stroke or musculoskeletal conditions that would have confounded the training effects also
served as exclusion criteria. All subjects signed informed consent documents before data
collection, and all procedures were performed in accordance with the approval granted by the
Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
(92-504).</p><p>An assessor-blind, non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design with 1 month
follow-up was adopted as the design scheme. To avoid diffusion of the treatment effects,
forced-use training (FUT) or conventional physical therapy (CPT) was offered in two separate
periods of the year in the same rehabilitation ward. In order to equalize the training
intensity of the groups, both groups received 90 minutes training per day, 5 times a week,
for 2 weeks. The CPT program provided gait correction, treadmill training, postural training
and other training activities prescribed by physical therapists to improve functional
mobility. Participants in the FUT group wore a custom-fitted wedged insole under the
unaffected side to force the use of the affected limb during all floor activities during the
two-week period and during a daily, circuit training program. The wedged insole of the
unaffected shoe was made of multi-layered cork to provide 5 degrees of elevation on the
lateral border of the unaffected foot. The circuit training program was designed to work the
affected lower extremity in a functionally relevant way<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, it
included 5 workstations: sit-to-stand, stepping over blocks in different directions, walking
on an inclined treadmill, climbing stairs, and walking over various surfaces with obstacles.
All training activities in the FUT group were conducted by the same physical therapist who
constantly adjusted the difficulty of each task according to patients&#x02019; abilities and
encouraged maximal usage of the affected limb while performing those tasks.</p><p>Performance of gait and mobility were assessed by the preferred and fastest walking
velocities (PWV; FWV), spatial and temporal symmetry indexes (SSI; TSI), the timed up and go
(TUG) test, and the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), while the quality of life was assessed
using the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale Taiwan Version (SSQOLTV). Walking velocity
was measured and gait parameters were derived using an electronic walkway system (GAITRite,
CIR system Inc., USA). The equations used to compute symmetry of gait have been described
elsewhere<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> and they were adopted by this study as follows: </p><p>&#x025cf;<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-421-e001.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>&#x025cf;<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-421-e002.jpg"/></disp-formula>US: Unaffected side; AS:
Affected side</p><p>The subjects were assessed three times, before the training (pre-training), at the end of
the training (post-training), and 1 month later (follow-up) by a licensed physical therapist
who was independent of the study.</p><p>The between-group comparisons of demographic data and pretest scores were analyzed using
the independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Changes in values from
pre-training to post-training, and from post-training to follow-up were calculated for
walking velocities, TUG times and SSQOLTV scores and were analyzed by mixed two-way ANOVA
(2X2) with repeated measures. Analysis of simple main effects by one-way ANOVA or one-way
ANOVA with repeated measure was performed if interaction effects were detected. Owing to the
bi-directional nature of the symmetry index, SSI and TSI were analyzed as their original
scores by mixed two-way ANOVA (2X3) with repeated measures, while the Friedman with Wilcoxon
test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare within or between-groups differences of
RMI scores. All of the statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences version 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty-one individuals with stroke were enrolled in this study. There were no significant

patients&#x02019; walking velocity and mobility more than conventional physical training with the
same training intensity. In addition, while patients in the FUT group walked with a more
symmetrical gait pattern, patients in CPT walked more asymmetrically at follow-up. However,
the superior training effects of FUT on walking performance and mobility did not lead to
better in-hospital quality of life. Walking velocity has been considered a preferred outcome
measure of functional ambulation ability due to its simplicity and reliability of its
measurement, and more importantly, its predictive ability for independence of community
ambulation<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, forced-use training elicited 9 times greater
improvement than conventional physical therapy in mean preferred walking velocity (gain of
31.2&#x02005;cm/s vs. 3.5&#x02005;cm/s) and 5 times greater improvement in fast walking velocity (gain of
24.9&#x02005;cm/s vs. 5.0&#x02005;cm/s) immediately after training and both walking velocities continued to
improve through to follow-up (preferred walking, 81.9&#x02005;cm/s; fast walking, 97.2&#x02005;cm/s). In
view of the fact that the mean preferred walking speed attained by the FUT group at
follow-up exceeded the speed required for community ambulation (80&#x02005;cm/s), and thus promotes
upgrading of ambulation classification; the FUT program used in the present study could be
considered to promote successful walking recovery in stroke patients<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. The beneficial effects of this forced-use training
program were also confirmed by measures of basic as well as functional mobility skills (TUG
and RMI). Essentially, improvements or values of TUG and RMI in the FUT group were
consistently larger than those of the CPT group at post-training and follow-up, and only the
FUT group showed significant changes in RMI scores after training. Improvements in the gait
performances and mobility observed after FUT may be explained by the successful combination
of a forced compelled weight-bearing approach and a relatively intensive task-oriented
mobility training. Using a shoe wedge or shoe lift for the unaffected foot facilitates
symmetrical weight bearing by stroke patients during quiet stance, and thus may help to
overcome the learned disuse of the affected lower extremity of stroke patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alternatively, Kim and Eng proposed that
increased weight bearing by the paretic limb may increase feedback from load receptors to
the central nervous system, thereby improving gait symmetry<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Though, the present study did not measure the symmetry of weight
bearing achieved by the 5-degree shoe wedge, patients in the FUT group did show more
symmetrical gait after fitting of the wedge. When a shoe wedge was combined with weight
bearing feedback and 30 minutes of gait training for 15 sessions<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, or shoe lift was combined with goal-directed balance
training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, improvements in gait speed,
dynamic balance, and gait symmetry of stroke patients were also recognized. However, the
walking velocities achieved by the above-mentioned methods<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> (0.35 m/s to 0.54 m/s)
never reached the speed required to walk independently in the community<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since intensive mobility training and treadmill training
combined with task-specific practice have been found to improve gait ability
effectively<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, we believe that the
task-oriented circuit training focused on improving mobility used in this study contributed
in part to the pronounced effect on gait speed observed in this study. However, effects of
the training programs on QOL were not realized in the present setting. It is possible that
in an in-hospital setting, the environment may pose less of challenge on the quality of life
than that in the real life<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
gains in gait performance and mobility may not exert their full impact on QOL. In addition,
the SSQOLTV score of the FUT group was relatively high, approaching the ceiling of the scale
(193.3/245) at pre-training, which may have limited the room for training-related
improvement. The limitations of this study include its small sample size, the unmatched
quality of life between the two groups at pre-training, our inability to randomly assign
patients to the two treatment groups, and the short follow-up period which measured quality
of life in the hospital rather than in a real life situation. A randomized control trial
with multiple follow-ups is warranted to verify the effectiveness of FUT for stroke patients
at different phases of recovery. In conclusion, two-weeks of ninety minutes per day, 5 days
per week forced-use training improved walking velocities and functional mobility more
effectively than conventional physical therapy at a similar training intensity. Five degrees
of shoe wedge under the unaffected foot combined with intensive, task-oriented gait and
mobility training should be an optimal strategy for forced-use training for the affected
lower extremity of stroke patients in the sub-acute or chronic stage.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">World Health Organization: The
