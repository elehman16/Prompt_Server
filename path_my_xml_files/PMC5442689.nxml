Volunteers and study coordinators were deceived as to study aim. Drug concentrations were determined blindly by in-house, high performance liquid chromatography assays. Terminal-elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) (primary outcome), maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), C<sub>max</sub> first time (T<sub>max</sub>), terminal-elimination-rate constant (&#x003bb;), area-under-the-concentration-time-curve, to last measured concentration (AUC<sub>T</sub>), extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>I</sub>), or to T<sub>max</sub> of overt drug (AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub>), and C<sub>max</sub>/AUC<sub>I</sub> were calculated blindly using standard non-compartmental method. Covert-vs-overt effect on drug pharmacokinetics was evaluated by analysis-of-variance (ANOVA, primary analysis), 90% confidence interval (CI) using the 80.00&#x02013;125.00% bioequivalence range, and percentage of individual pharmacokinetic covert/overt ratios that are outside the <underline>+</underline>25% range.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty, 30, and 50 healthy volunteers (18%, 10%, and 6% females, mean (SD) age 30.8 (6.2), 31.4 (6.6), and 31.2 (5.4) years) participated in 3 studies on cephalexin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol, respectively. Withdrawal rate was 4%, 0%, and 4%, respectively. Eighteen blood samples were obtained over 6, 10, and 14&#x000a0;h in each study period of the three drugs, respectively. ANOVA showed no significant difference in any pharmacokinetic parameter for any of the drugs.

Changes over time in the placebo arm of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials don&#x02019;t separate the placebo effect (meaning response) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] from methodological factors such as regression to the mean, natural course, and the Hawthorne effect. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Although it was once argued that if a placebo effect exists it would be of negligible importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], under some circumstances, the placebo effect could be clinically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and comparable in size to the drug effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The placebo effect may explain why generic drug products that pass rigorous bioequivalence tests are perceived as less potent (not more potent) than their more expensive branded counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Differences between drug and placebo arms in clinical trials may represent not only drug pharmacological effect but also a drug*placebo interaction effect and thus may underestimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or overestimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] pharmacological drug effect. The possibility of a negative interaction effect may explain the clinically trivial effect of antidepressants as deduced from clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>It was suggested since the 1950s that the effect of false belief may countermand the effects of active drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A neuro-imaging study showed that alcohol intoxication and expectancy have opposite effects on neuronal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The possibility that the drug*placebo interaction effect may involve modulation of drug bioavailability has not been well explored. Theoretically, it is possible that the interaction effect may involve altering gastric emptying, intestinal transit time, or drug elimination. Previously, we conducted a 14&#x000a0;h bioavailability study on 22 volunteers who received caffeine described as caffeine or as placebo in a balanced randomized cross-over design. Mean plasma caffeine levels were consistently lower in the terminal part of the concentration-time curve, caffeine area-under-the-time-concentration curve (AUC) was significantly lower, and plasma caffeine terminal half-life was significantly shorter after receiving caffeine described as placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], suggesting the importance of blinding in bioequivalence studies which compare generic and brand drug products and in clinical trials even with objective endpoints.</p><p>The rate and extent of drug bioavailability are commonly evaluated by maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and AUC to last measured concentration (AUC<sub>T</sub>) or extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>I</sub>), respectively, using the non-compartmental method. The rate of bioavailability can be also evaluated by first time of C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), the ratio C<sub>max</sub>/AUC<sub>I</sub>, and AUC to T<sub>max</sub> of reference drug (AUC<sub>Reftmax</sub>). Average bioequivalence (ABE) between a test and reference products of the same drug, the standard worldwide requirement to market generic drug products, is demonstrated if the 90% confidence interval (CI) on their C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>T</sub>, and AUC<sub>I</sub> geometric mean ratio is in the range 80.00&#x02013;125.00% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Several concerns have been raised regarding the ABE standards, including, using relatively wide bioequivalence limits and being unable to ensure therapeutic equivalence in all subjects; several individual pharmacokinetic ratios can fall well outside the <underline>+</underline>20% range despite demonstrating ABE. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Intra-subject variability is commonly estimated by intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV). Large intra-subject CV can be due to intra-drug variability (first-pass or metabolic variability, gastric emptying, etc.), intra-product variability (tablet to tablet or batch to batch), inter-product variability (generic vs. reference product), or subject-by-product interaction (i.e., the difference between products is not the same across subjects). Large intra-subject variability is especially important for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs, for which individual bioequivalence (IBE) model, 75/75 rule, and intra-subject variability comparisons have been advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The 75/75 rule requires &#x02265;75% of individual test-reference pharmacokinetic ratios to be within <underline>+</underline>25%.</p><p>We hypothesized that the drug*placebo interaction effect may involve modulation of drug pharmacokinetics. We elected to study two over-the-counter medicines, ibuprofen and paracetamol, because of their expected familiarity to study volunteers (and hence potentially having a placebo effect) and cephalexin as a &#x0201c;negative control&#x0201d; because of its expected unfamiliarity. We were not able to confirm our previous observation in any of the three drugs. However, we used the data to explore the extent of bio-variability that can be observed when comparing a drug product to itself.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>Volunteers were consecutively assigned to one of three randomized, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over studies, using cephalexin, ibuprofen, or paracetamol.

Fasting from food and beverages continued for 4&#x000a0;h post-dosing. However, volunteers were allowed 120&#x000a0;ml water per hour, starting one hour after drug administration. A standardized breakfast and dinner were provided 4&#x000a0;h and about 10&#x000a0;h after drug administration. Meal plans were identical in all parts of the studies. Strenuous physical activity was not permitted during study periods. Volunteers remained ambulatory or seated upright (unless deemed medically necessary) for the first four hours after drug administration and were under continuous observation regarding occurrence of adverse events and compliance with study procedures.

Secondary outcome measures were the other pharmacokinetic parameters. Outcome measures were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) after natural log-transformation, except for T<sub>max</sub>. The model included sequence, subjects nested within sequence, period, and intervention (covert vs overt drug administration). Mean square residual error (MSR) was used to test the significance of period and intervention effects. Subjects nested in sequence mean square was used to test the significance of sequence effect. Secondary analysis evaluated covert-overt drug ABE: the 90% CI on the difference between means of log-transformed values was determined (using MSR) and the antilog of the 90% CI limits were compared to the 80.00% and 125.00% bioequivalence limits.

As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 6&#x02013;18% of the volunteers per study were females. Mean (SD) age ranged from 30.8 (6.2) to 31.4 (6.6) years and mean BMI from 24.8 (3.1) to 25.2 (3.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, withdrawal rate ranged from 0% (ibuprofen) to 4% (cephalexin and paracetamol). Withdrawal reasons were personal (one volunteer withdrew before period-1 and one after period-2, refusing to provide post-study consent) or incompliance with study procedures (one volunteer smoked during the study and one did not swallow cephalexin tablet). We were able to contact 68 (54%) out of the 127 volunteers who completed the study for post-study debriefing and consenting, all gave full informed consent except one volunteer (noted above), whose data were removed from analysis. Adverse events occurred in 0% (ibuprofen) to 2% (cephalexin and paracetamol) of volunteers (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); all were minor and resolved spontaneously.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12952_2017_75_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

We measured the effect of describing a drug as placebo (covert drug) on the pharmacokinetics of cephalexin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol. The three drugs were selected in part because of their known safety profiles. Ibuprofen and paracetamol were studied because of their expected familiarity (and hence ability to elicit a placebo effect) and cephalexin was used as &#x0201c;negative control&#x0201d; because of its expected unfamiliarity to study volunteers. We designed a two-period, two-sequence, cross-over study for each of the three drugs, with a 90% power to detect a 10% difference in t<sub>1/2</sub> between overtly and covertly administered drugs. Drug concentrations were blindly determined using in-house HPLC assays and AUC<sub>T</sub>, AUC<sub>I</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, &#x003bb;, t1/2, and AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub> were blindly estimated by the standard non-compartmental method. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters under the two administration conditions using ANOVA, computed 90% CIs on the difference (covert-overt) between the means of their log-transformed values and compared them to the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 125.00%, and calculated the percentages of the untransformed individual pharmacokinetic covert/overt ratios that are outside the <underline>+</underline>25% range. We found that: 1) there is no placebo effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied, 2) the two conditions of administering the drugs resulted in bioequivalent profiles, and 3) about 34.4%, 71.6%, and 60.2% of individual covert/overt ratios for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub>, and T<sub>max</sub>, respectively, were outside the <underline>+</underline>25% range.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Describing drugs as placebos doesn&#x02019;t significantly alter their pharmacokinetic parameters</title><p>We found no significant differences between the covert and overt conditions in any of the studied pharmacokinetic parameters of the three drugs. This is in contrast to the results of a previous, similarly designed cross-over study on 300&#x000a0;mg caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which found that mean plasma caffeine levels were consistently lower in the terminal part of the 14-h concentration-time curve, mean caffeine AUC was significantly lower, and mean plasma caffeine terminal half-life was significantly shorter when caffeine was given covertly. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. It is possible that the results of the caffeine study were due to chance, especially because the study was exploratory, had a low power (22 subjects), and tested a novel mechanism, which are expected to increase the probability of false discovery, despite having statistically significant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, it is also possible that a placebo effect for ibuprofen and paracetamol was not successfully elicited in the current study; other outcomes (for example pain reduction) unfortunately were not examined. There are several modulators of the placebo effect, including conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], expectancy, suggestion, personality, desire for symptom change, and affective state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Average bioequivalence of the three drugs under covert and overt conditions</title><p>Since no placebo effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the three drugs, the volunteers could be considered to have received the same drug product.

In retrospect, power analysis revealed that the ibuprofen study has only a 0.32 power to show bioequivalence for C<sub>max</sub>.</p><p>Intra-subject variability can be due to the drug substance itself (being readily affected by physiological variability of the volunteer), product quality variability, analytical variability, or unexplained random variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In a typical bioequivalence study comparing test and reference drug products, intra-subject variability includes, in addition, variability due to differences between the two products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. When a generic drug product is declared therapeutically equivalent to a reference product, it is expected that any difference between the two products should be no greater than the difference between two batches of the reference product. In fact, reviewing the bioequivalence studies of its approved generic products, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found a mean generic-reference deviation of 3.47% for AUC and 4.29% for C<sub>max</sub> in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and 3.56% for AUC and 4.35% for C<sub>max</sub> in another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Commonly, there are several marketed drug products that are linked by a chain of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; concerns have been raised that reference-bioequivalent generic products may not be bioequivalent to each other. However, secondary analysis of 120 bioequivalence studies on three immunosuppressants and six selected drugs showed a mean generic-generic deviation of 4.5% for AUC<sub>T</sub> and 5.1% for C<sub>max</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, in the current study, we found that covert-overt deviation was &#x02264;3.34, &#x02264;1.46, and &#x02264;12.89 percentage points for AUC<sub>T</sub>, AUC<sub>I</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>, respectively; suggesting that most of the deviation observed in typical bioequivalence studies is not related to using two different products.</p><p>Bioequivalence studies&#x02019; guidelines of regulatory agencies (except for Health Canada (HC)) are silent regarding blinding of study volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results suggest that failure to blind would not be expected to have a negative impact; even describing the drugs as placebo did not affect their pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>There is disagreement among the different regulatory guidelines on the bioequivalence criteria for C<sub>max</sub>, whereas some require that the 90% CI should fall within the 80&#x02013;125% or the 70&#x02013;143% limits, others require only the point estimate to fall within the 80&#x02013;125% limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results suggest that requiring the 90% CI to fall within the 80&#x02013;125% limits may be too strict as ibuprofen reference product failed this criteria when compared to itself, despite having a relatively large sample size.</p><p>For drugs where time of onset of effect is important, the US FDA and HC recommend that the 90% CI of AUC truncated at reference product median T<sub>max</sub> or AUC<sub>Reftmax</sub>, respectively, should be within the 80&#x02013;125% limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results indicate that such criteria would be difficult to achieve; only one of the three 90% CIs of AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub> was within the 80&#x02013;125% limits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Individual bioequivalence of the three drugs under covert and overt conditions</title><p>It has been argued that because ABE testing focuses on differences between mean values and relatively neglects differences between variances and subject-by-product interaction, it is possible that, despite establishing ABE, a patient switched from a reference product to a generic product (or vice versa) could be over-dosed or under-dosed and that some patients may have the highest drug exposure values with the reference product and lowest exposure values with the generic product and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In fact, a bioequivalent study comparing generic and reference cyclosporine products found that 38% of individual C<sub>max</sub> ratios and 18% of individual AUC ratios were less than 0.80 despite having 90% CI within the 80&#x02013;125% limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Our findings that about 6.9%, 3.2%, and 34.4% of individual covert/overt ratios for AUC<sub>T</sub>, AUC<sub>I</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>, respectively, were outside the <underline>+</underline>25% range indicate that most of the variation in individual ratios are not related to using different drug products but rather to the volunteers, drug moiety, study setting, drug assay, or random variations. Our findings are consistent with the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A simulation study (assuming inter-subject variability of 20% and intra-subject variability of 10%) found that 11.1% of the reference/reference AUC ratios fell outside the 0.80&#x02013;1.25 range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Further, in a fully-replicated bioequivalence study on the antiepileptic drug, lamotrigine, 3% and 18% of the generic/generic ratios and 3% and 9% of the reference/reference ratios for AUC and C<sub>max</sub>, respectively, were outside the 0.75&#x02013;1.25 range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>Finally, it could be argued that some patients&#x02019; distrust of reference-bioequivalent generic products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] could be related to generic products&#x02019; different onset of action, which in turn may be related to different inactive ingredients or manufacturing processes. However, this is not likely. Onset of a drug effect is for the most part related to its pharmacodynamic characteristics and as shown in the current study, large variations in T<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub> (60.2% and 71.6% of individual ratios, respectively, were outside the &#x000b1;25% range) can be observed when comparing a product to itself.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p>The interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the following. 1) Intervention&#x02019;s administration by an undeceived investigator may have reduced the placebo effect. 2) It is possible that the study setting and the drugs used were not conducive to elicit adequate placebo effect; thus the finding of no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the overt and covert conditions may not be related to the placebo effect not modulating drug bioavailability but rather to failure to induce a placebo effect. 3) The protocol-defined aim of the study was to examine if the drug*placebo effect involves modulating drug bioavailability; thus the findings regarding bioequivalence of drug products with themselves are based on post hoc analysis. 4) Our study was not designed to partition intra-subject variability into its various components. Thus, it is not clear how much of the observed variability is due to the drug products themselves (i.e. to drug product quality variability rather than to the drug moiety, random error, etc.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study couldn&#x02019;t confirm that awareness of drug ingestion can modulate its bioavailability. Although this may be due to inability to elicit adequate placebo effect, the results cast doubt on the concept that the drug*placebo interaction effect may involve modulating drug pharmacokinetics through mechanisms such as altering gastric emptying, intestinal transit time, or drug elimination. On the other hand, the study demonstrates that most of the generic-reference deviation observed in typical bioequivalence studies may not be related to using different products but is inherent in study design and setting, that failure to blind subjects in bioequivalence studies may not negatively impact validity of the results, that the 80&#x02013;125% bioequivalence limits for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub> 90% CI may be too strict, and that considerable intra-subject variability in C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and AUC<sub>Reftmax</sub> would be expected even when comparing a drug product to itself.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ABE</term><def><p>Average bioequivalence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>T</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-concentration-time-curve to last measured concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>I</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-concentration-time-curve extrapolated to infinity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>Overttmax</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-concentration-time-curve to time of maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of drug given overtly</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>Reftmax</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-concentration-time-curve to time of maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of reference product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Maximum concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p>Coefficient of variation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p>Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HC</term><def><p>Health Canada</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLC</term><def><p>High performance liquid chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBE</term><def><p>Individual bioequivalence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KFSH&#x00026;RC</term><def><p>King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSR</term><def><p>Mean square residual error from ANOVA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Time of maximum concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x0039b;</term><def><p>Terminal elimination rate constant</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Special thanks to participants of the study for their dedication and contribution to research.
