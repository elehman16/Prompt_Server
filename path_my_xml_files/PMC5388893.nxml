Eligible infants were tracked from birth and randomly assigned (1:1) at 4 months corrected age to receive complementary feeding at 4 months corrected age (4 month group), or continuation of milk feeding and initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months corrected age (6 month group), using computer generated randomisation schedule of variable block size, stratified by gestation (30 weeks or less, and 31&#x02013;33 weeks). Iron supplementation was provided as standard. Participants and the implementation team could not be masked to group assignment, but outcome assessors were masked. Primary outcome was weight for age <italic>Z</italic>-score at 12 months corrected age (WAZ<sub>12</sub>) based on WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study growth standards. Analyses were by intention to treat.

There was no difference in WAZ<sub>12</sub> between two groups: &#x02212;1&#x000b7;6 (SD 1&#x000b7;2) in the 4 month group versus &#x02212;1&#x000b7;6 (SD 1&#x000b7;3) in the 6 month group (mean difference 0&#x000b7;005, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;24 to 0&#x000b7;25; p=0&#x000b7;965). There were more hospital admissions in the 4 month group compared with the 6 month group: 2&#x000b7;5 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 4 month group versus 1&#x000b7;4 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 6 month group (incidence rate ratio 1&#x000b7;8, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;0&#x02013;3&#x000b7;1, p=0&#x000b7;03). 34 (18%) of 188 infants in the 4 month group required hospital admission, compared with 18 (9%) of 192 infants in the 6 month group.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although there was no evidence of effect for the primary endpoint of WAZ<sub>12</sub>, the higher rate of hospital admission in the 4 month group suggests a recommendation to initiate complementary feeding at 6 months over 4 months of corrected age in infants less than 34 weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Indian Council of Medical Research supported the study until Nov 14, 2015.

However, none of the organisations including WHO,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN),<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> or the American Academy of Pediatrics<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> provide evidence-based guidelines with respect to the optimal time of initiation of complementary feeding in preterm infants who are at a much higher risk of postnatal growth restriction than full-term infants.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The only available guidelines are from the UK, and are based on a single, non-systematic review of primarily physiological studies.</p><p>Extrapolating the recommendation for full-term infants to initiate complementary feeding at 6 months of age to preterm infants is dependent on two major questions: what does 6 months refer to in a preterm infant&#x02014;chronological (postnatal) age or corrected age? Health-care providers generally use corrected age for monitoring the physical growth and development of preterm infants. Secondarily, if we assume that 6 months refers to the corrected age, should these infants not start complementary feeding earlier than their full-term counterparts&#x02014;for example, at 4 months corrected age instead of 6 months corrected age (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>)? Preterm infants have higher energy requirements compared with full-term infants,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and it is not known how long in infancy milk feeds alone (breastmilk or formula) are sufficient to meet their requirements. Most complementary foods provide higher calorie density compared with milk feeds, and can make up for the energy gap between increased requirements of preterm infants, and limited supply from milk feeds. Therefore, an earlier introduction of complementary feeding in preterm infants than is recommended for full-term infants might help improve their growth.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 6 Feb 2016, limited to human studies but with no restriction of language or publication date, using the terms &#x0201c;complementary food&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;complementary foods&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;complementary feeding&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;supplementary feeding&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;weaning&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;weaning foods&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;beikost&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;semisolids&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;semisolid foods&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;semisolid food&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;semisolid feeds&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;infant feeding&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;infant diet&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;infant food&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;infant foods&#x0201d;. We found 22723 articles on MEDLINE and 3667 on CENTRAL. After screening the title and abstracts and excluding duplicates, we reviewed the full text of 50 potentially relevant studies. We also searched the reference list of all these 50 studies to identify any other relevant studies.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the Review were: any randomised, quasi-randomised trial or observational study investigating different time or age at initiation or introduction of complementary feeding in preterm infants. Complementary feeding was defined as initiation of semisolid, soft or solid foods other than breast, formula, or animal milk. We therefore excluded any studies enrolling full term infants or those where the term &#x02018;weaning&#x02019; was used to indicate transition from breastfeeding to formula or animal milk rather than to semisolid, soft, or solid foods.</p><p>On full text review and reference list search, we identified three studies eligible for this Review&#x02014;one randomised trial, one prospective observational study and one study that was a secondary analysis of data from original unrelated studies. The first study randomly assigned all preterm infants of less than 37 completed weeks gestation (n=68) to receive complementary feeding after 13 weeks of postnatal age if weighing at least 3&#x000b7;5 kg; or after 17 weeks of postnatal age if weighing at least 5&#x000b7;0 kg. The intervention, ie, initiation of complementary feeding in both groups, was also subject to parental perception of infant being ready to accept complementary feeding. The 13 week group also received a co-intervention in the form of energy and protein-dense food. The study did not find any significant difference in the SDs of length (0&#x000b7;2, 0&#x000b7;2 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02212;0&#x000b7;1, 0&#x000b7;3), weight (&#x02013;0&#x000b7;7, 0&#x000b7;2 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02212;0&#x000b7;8, 0&#x000b7;2) and head circumference (&#x02013;0&#x000b7;5, 0&#x000b7;2 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02212;0&#x000b7;5, 0&#x000b7;2) between the groups. However, there was some improvement in length gain per week from birth to 12 months corrected age (mean cm per week, SD: 5&#x000b7;1, 0&#x000b7;07 <italic>vs</italic> 4&#x000b7;9, 0&#x000b7;10; p=0&#x000b7;04) and change in mean length SDs in the early weaning group (mean, SD: &#x02212;1&#x000b7;1, 0&#x000b7;2 at birth to 0&#x000b7;2, 0&#x000b7;2 at 12 months corrected age) when compared with late weaning group (mean, SD: &#x02212;1&#x000b7;0, 0&#x000b7;2 at birth to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;1, 0&#x000b7;3 at 12 months corrected age).</p><p>The second study followed preterm infants from birth until 12 months corrected age, and recorded the time of initiation of complementary feeding based on information on introduction of 12 prelisted food items. Introduction of 4 or more items (n=203 infants) compared with that of less than 4 items (n=54 infants) by 17 weeks corrected age was associated with 3&#x000b7;5 times higher risk for developing eczema at 12 months corrected age.</p><p>The third study was a secondary analysis of data with respect to introduction of solid foods at &#x02264;12 weeks or &#x0003e;12 weeks on growth parameters of preterm infants, from two previous trials&#x02014;one on post-discharge formula <italic>vs</italic> full term formula (published), and another unpublished. The study did not find any difference with regard to introduction of solid foods &#x02264;12 weeks or &#x0003e;12 weeks on weight gain in kg (mean, SE: 8&#x000b7;25, 0&#x000b7;05; n=365 <italic>vs</italic> 8&#x000b7;27, 0&#x000b7;07; n=102), length gain in cm (70&#x000b7;3, 0&#x000b7;16; n=362 <italic>vs</italic> 70&#x000b7;6, 0&#x000b7;2; n=102) and head circumference gain in cm (45&#x000b7;8, 0&#x000b7;08; n=364 <italic>vs</italic> 45&#x000b7;8, 0&#x000b7;12; n=102) between 12 weeks and nine months corrected age, or between 12 weeks and 18 months corrected age (data not reported). There was no difference in the prevalence of atopy, lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, sleep duration, or waking at night between the two groups.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Our study provides level-1 evidence with regard to the timing (4 <italic>vs</italic> 6 months of corrected age) for initiation of complementary feeding in preterm infants less than 34 weeks of gestation, a group most susceptible to postnatal growth restriction. It shows that early initiation of complementary feeding at 4 month compared with 6 months of corrected age does not improve growth of preterm infants at corrected age of 12 months. It also does not result in a difference in neurodevelopment outcomes, body composition, bone mineralisation, and any marker for metabolic syndrome like insulin resistance, lipid profile, and blood pressure in infancy. Rather, earlier initiation of complementary feeding at 4 months corrected age increases the risk of hospital admission due to concurrent morbidities, predominantly diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections. In both groups, dietary patterns remain poor and body iron stores remain depleted despite iron supplementation until 12 months of corrected age.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>Our study suggests that 6 months of corrected age should be preferred over 4 months of corrected age for initiation of complementary feeding in preterm infants less than 34 weeks of gestation. Findings of clinically significant iron deficiency despite iron supplementation and poor dietary patterns in infancy will guide further research.</p></boxed-text></p><p>We did a systematic review to answer this crucial question but found only one low quality randomised trial addressing the issue.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> We therefore chose to test the hypothesis that initiation of complementary feeding (defined as semisolid, soft, or solid foods other than breastmilk, formula, or animal milk) at 4 months compared with 6 months corrected age in infants less than 34 weeks of gestation will increase their weight for age <italic>Z</italic>-score at 12 months corrected age (WAZ<sub>12</sub>) by 0&#x000b7;5 standard deviation score (SDS; around 500 g, based on WHO-Multicentre Growth Reference Study [MGRS] growth standards).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> We also investigated neurodevelopment, body composition, bone density, and early markers of metabolic syndrome as there is little evidence on the links between infant feeding and later health, and sought to characterise potential effects of the nutritional intervention on some markers of the same.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design</title><p>We did this randomised, open-label, parallel group trial at three public health facilities; the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Vardhman Mahavir Medical College associated Safdarjung hospital, and Kasturba hospital in New Delhi, India. All three sites provide tertiary care neonatal services to inborn neonates. Neonatal intensive care is provided to all infants less than 34 weeks of gestation, and exclusive breastmilk feeding is actively promoted (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). Ethics approval was obtained from institutional ethics committees at all sites.

Infants requiring hospital admission from birth to later than 40 weeks postmenstrual age were excluded. Research team identified potentially eligible infants at birth, kept them in follow-up after discharge and called their caregiver by telephone at 4 months corrected age for enrolment into the study. Infants were excluded at this stage if they had already been started on complementary feeding. Initiation of complementary feeding was defined as intentional initiation of complementary food by family irrespective of amount, unintentional initiation but food given for more than 3 days, or that the total amount given provided more than 1% of recommended dietary allowance of calories for the infant. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legally acceptable representative.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to the 4 month group, wherein parents or family were advised to initiate complementary feeding at 4 months corrected age; or to the 6 month group, in which they were advised to continue milk feeds until 6 months corrected age, followed by initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months corrected age. An independent person (MJS) provided computer generated random sequences, stratified for site and gestation (30 weeks or less and 31&#x02013;33 weeks) with variable block size unknown to the research team involved in implementation. Allocation was concealed using sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. The families and research team involved in implementation could not be masked to the allocation groups following randomisation, however, those assessing primary and secondary outcomes were masked.

At 4 months corrected age, we randomly assigned the infants and did baseline anthropometric measurements and Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA).</p><p>A single person counselled the families for initiation of complementary feeding at corrected age 4 months or 6 months, using uniform, prerecorded audio-visual counselling instructions in local language. The instructions were based on the WHO guidelines on complementary feeding of the breastfed child,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and specified the desired frequency, amount, consistency, and texture of food, and principles of responsive feeding, hygiene, feeding during and after illness, and maintenance of breastfeeding. In the audio-visual presentation, we also included a demonstration on cooking common recipes of the region, which were prepared and standardised in terms of energy and other nutrient densities in accordance with the WHO guidelines. Additionally, families' queries were resolved through one-to-one counselling. The mothers were provided a handout of the instructions and suggested recipes in local language, and a set of uniform household utensils with known capacity to measure the ingredients and to feed the child.</p><p>We asked mothers to maintain a daily dietary record incorporating information on type, frequency and amount of food consumed by the child, and problems faced, if any. Mothers maintained this record for 4 weeks beginning from date of counselling for initiation of complementary feeding. We reinforced at each visit the supplementation of the infants with vitamin D (400 IU per day) and elemental iron (2&#x02013;3 mg/kg per day), which was started from 2 weeks of age as part of the study hospitals' clinical policy. Subsequently, we called the infants for hospital visit at corrected age 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12 months to measure anthropometry, morbidity inquiry, and 24 hour dietary recall (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). Additionally, we provided families in both groups with 24-h, 7-day per week need-based telephone support. At the 12 month visit, we did neurodevelopmental assessments, DXA, and fasting blood sampling as part of final outcome assessment. If an infant could not be brought to the hospital, the study team made a home visit to measure outcomes, except blood sampling and DXA. We measured compliance to intervention through telephone calls made on days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 at 4 months and again at 6 months of corrected age in both groups, which was also corroborated by the daily dietary record maintained by the mothers.</p><p>We defined infants as receiving allocated intervention if they were offered complementary feeding within 4 weeks of counselling for initiation of food, irrespective of amount consumed.

However, there was a higher risk of hospital admission in the group with earlier initiation, suggesting that initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months corrected age might be preferable to 4 months corrected age in infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation.</p><p>This evidence can be considered robust, as the study was adequately powered to detect the outcome of interest and met all criteria for high internal validity: it was a randomised trial with groups being similar at the start, groups were treated similarly except for allocated intervention, no co-intervention was administered, the overall follow-up rate was high, analyses were by intention to treat and the outcomes were either blinded or objective.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one trial published earlier compared the effect of initiation of complementary feeding on growth of preterm infants. The study had several limitations and concluded that there was no difference in the anthropometric parameters between the two intervention groups at 12 months of age. Two other studies&#x02014;one in full-term, healthy and one in low birthweight, exclusively breastfed infants&#x02014;have compared the effect of initiation of complementary feeding at 4 versus 6 months of age.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Both studies showed that the intervention resulted in no significant difference in weight or length at 12 months of age, similar to our study. Unfortunately, we could not measure breastmilk intake in our study. However, we did note that in breastfed infants, energy intake per kg bodyweight (excluding breastmilk) was higher in the 4 month group compared with the 6 month group at all timepoints, although it was similar among non-breastfed infants (except for a small difference at 6 months corrected age; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). Since there was no difference in growth parameters between the two groups at any timepoint, it is likely that the breastfed infants in the 6 month group increased their breastmilk intake and were deriving the additional energy from breastmilk. Studies using robust isotopic methods have also shown increased breastmilk intake in full-term exclusively breastfed infants who continue to remain breastfed until 6 months of age, and decreased intake among those who start on complementary feeding at 4 months of age.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The overall incidence of hospital admission in the study population was low, but infants in the 4 month group had more episodes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections until 12 months corrected age. Although these might be explained by potential contamination of complementary foods due to inadequate hygiene,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> a more biological rationale should also be considered. Breastmilk is known to confer immunological benefits to infants that are especially important for preterm infants,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and breastmilk intake is likely to have been lower among infants in the 4 month group, as discussed earlier. Besides, the role of dietary exposures in shaping both short and long term immune function in infants might also be a factor.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Little difference in growth patterns between the two groups with little catch up growth in either group might explain similar body composition and similar markers of metabolic syndrome between the groups. The mean fat mass and % fat at 12 months of corrected age in either group were close to that reported in literature, suggesting that the biology of growth among this group of infants is similar across settings.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, we need to be cautious with whole body DEXA as a measure as it is not able to accurately establish the aberrant adiposity that might occur.</p><p>Poor dietary practices among all study infants despite counselling are more difficult to understand, especially as available evidence suggests that counselling helps to improve feeding practices.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> We postulate that the practices would possibly have been worse without counselling as the indicators obtained in our study were better than reported in literature from similar settings.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> It appears that to achieve the recommended dietary standards in this population requires a degree of behaviour change at the family level that is difficult to achieve, and requires innovative approaches to supplement the counselling. It is also important to consider that infant factors such as taste, preference, ability, or interest in taking feeds and pattern of eating could also have contributed to the dietary patterns seen in the study.</p><p>Another important concern revealed by the study is the greatly depleted iron stores, despite most infants having received iron supplementation. This is a puzzling finding, and since we had strictly ensured the compliance, it requires some explanation. Studies have shown that iron bioavailability from habitual Indian diets is low, due to high phytate and low ascorbic acid to iron ratios. Additionally, food matrix effect and food synergies specific to the local context could have been an issue.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We also presume that coadministration of iron supplements with food or milk could have resulted in decreased absorption of iron. Delayed cord clamping was not being practiced at any of the sites during the study period, and that could also be a reason in part. However, despite all of these postulations, this is a crucial outcome with a bearing on neurodevelopment of these vulnerable infants. Therefore, it is important to do further research to ascertain the adequacy of recommended doses of supplementation in preterm infants, factors that retard iron absorption, and possibly better iron preparations with enhanced bioavailability.</p><p>This study was done in a lower middle-income country setting, but we propose that the results could hold relevance even for high-income country settings for two main reasons. First, we observe that growth pattern of this group of infants is similar across settings, with universal postnatal growth restriction.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In this study, the parameters of fat mass at 12 months of age were close to that reported in the literature.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Second, the feeding or dietary patterns in infancy are also similar with low rates of exclusive breastfeeding and inadequate complementary feeding practices.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, other factors that might limit the generalisation of results to other settings and would need prior consideration include differences between developing and developed country settings with respect to the birthweight of preterm infants, prevalence rates of intrauterine growth restriction in the population, practices with respect to use of post-discharge, nutrient-enriched formula or animal milk, breastfeeding rates, fortification of complementary foods, background infection rates, and sociodemographic factors such as maternal education and socioeconomic status, which would influence hygiene and compliance to dietary advice.</p><p>We also report that the mean postnatal age of study infants at intervention was 5&#x000b7;7 months (SD 0&#x000b7;3) in the 4 month group, and 7&#x000b7;9 months (SD 0&#x000b7;4) in the 6 month group. Since the 4 month group did not result in improved outcomes but increased hospital admissions, it follows that 6 months of postnatal age might not be preferred over 6 months of corrected age for initiation of complementary feeding in preterm infants.</p><p>The limitations of the study are the open-label design and differential loss to follow-up in the two allocation groups. However, the outcome assessors were masked to the allocation groups, and the baseline characteristics of infants lost to follow-up in either group were similar. The diagnostic utility of any neurodevelopmental assessment at 1 year of age is also inadequate, which might also be considered a limitation. There is a need for longer term follow-up of this cohort, and reassessment of their growth, development, micronutrient status, and markers of chronic disease.</p><p>Future research should focus on identifying an appropriate window, if one exists, to improve the postnatal growth of preterm infants. There is also an urgent need to identify the reasons for poor dietary patterns and greatly depleted iron stores despite supplementation in the preterm infants, and test potential interventions and institute preventive measures to target the same. Long-term follow-up of such infants, ideally till adulthood, is highly desirable.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
