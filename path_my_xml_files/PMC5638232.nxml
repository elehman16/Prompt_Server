Although anxiety disorders differ in the nature of feared objects or situations, they share a common mechanism by which fear generalizes to related but innocuous objects, eliciting avoidance of objects and situations that pose no objective risk. This overgeneralization appears to be a crucial mechanism in the persistence of anxiety psychopathology. In this study we test whether an intervention that promotes discrimination learning reduces generalization of fear, in particular, harm expectancy and avoidance compared to an irrelevant (control) training. Healthy participants (N = 80) were randomly allocated to a training condition. Using a fear conditioning paradigm, participants first learned visual danger and safety signals (set 1). Baseline level of stimulus generalization was tested with ambiguous stimuli on a spectrum between the danger and safety signals. There were no differences between the training groups. Participants then received the stimulus discrimination training or a control training. After training, participants learned a new set of danger and safety signals (set 2), and the level of harm expectancy generalization and behavioural avoidance of ambiguous stimuli was tested. Although the training groups did not differ in fear generalization on a cognitive level (harm expectancy), the results showed a different pattern of avoidance of ambiguous stimuli, with the discrimination training group showing less avoidance of stimuli that resembled the safety signals. These results support the potential of interventions that promote discrimination learning in the treatment of anxiety disorders.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>069777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehlers</surname><given-names>Anke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Oxford Cognitive Health NIHR Clinical Research Facility</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehlers</surname><given-names>Anke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by Wellcome Trust grant 069777 and supported by the Oxford cognitive health NIHR Clinical Research Facility.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and are characterized by excessive fear and avoidance. While the type of feared stimuli varies across the different anxiety disorders, e.g., social interactions in social anxiety disorder, spiders is spider phobia, intense exercise in panic disorder, a common feature is that the patients' fear has generalized to innocuous stimuli or situations and elicits excessive avoidance responses. The fear and avoidance can dominate patients' lives by impairing physical, social, emotional, and professional functioning [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>There is a growing interest in the mechanisms of fear generalization. Fear conditioning paradigms have been used to investigate this process in the laboratory. After a conditioning phase, these paradigms measure responses to ambiguous or generalized stimuli (GS) that share features of learned danger (CS+) and safety (CS-) signals to varying degrees. The subjective reaction (e.g., harm expectancy) and the physiological activity these GSs evoke are usually assessed as indicators of the level of fear generalization. Fear generalization is operationalized as the transference of the fear evoked by the danger signal to stimuli that are either perceptually similar to the CS+, or non-perceptually related to the CS+, for example by being semantically or symbolically related to the CS+ (for an overview see [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p>Compared to healthy controls, patients with generalized anxiety disorder [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or panic disorder [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], tend to show an overgeneralization of fear: they tend to generalize their fear response to stimuli that are less closely related to the CS+, and to a larger number of stimuli in general. One of the ways the overgeneralization is assessed in clinical samples is the shape of the curve when the stimuli (CS-, GSs and CS+) are plotted on the x-axis and the responses to the CSs on the Y-axis: the curve is more quadratic in the healthy control group and more linear in the anxiety patient group (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), reflecting increased responses towards GSs in the anxiety population. Although not all studies have found this overgeneralization effect [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there is substantial evidence for the role of fear generalization in anxiety pathology [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An important limitation of the research in fear generalization is the scarcity with which overt behaviour or avoidance tendencies have been included as an index of fear [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Avoidance behaviour in response to innocuous stimuli constitutes one of the major aspects of diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, avoidance seems to play a crucial role in the maintenance and possibly even exacerbation of pathological anxiety by preventing disconfirmation of irrational or exaggerated danger beliefs[<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, assessing avoidance behaviour in fear generalization paradigms seems to have important clinical relevance. Thus far, only a few studies have done this by studying learning and generalization of avoidance [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], showing support for an association between overgeneralization of fear and overgeneralization of avoidance [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and enhanced avoidance of GS in anxiety prone individuals (i.e., high neuroticism, [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).</p><p>A next challenge in the field of fear generalization is to further insight into interventions that target (over)generalization of fear and avoidance. A first successful attempt has recently been shown in a study in healthy adults. Compared to a control group, those who were trained to spot small differences in contour and size of stimuli (stimulus discrimination) reported increased risk ratings of generalized stimuli of which the colour was lying on a continuum between the colour of CS+ and CS-. Although these differences in fear generalization were not present in the fear potentiated startle responses, the results show that a training promoting perceptual discrimination might be a promising way to reduce fear generalization [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since avoidance responses were not included it remains unclear whether such a training task would target avoidance generalization. In this study we tested whether a training to enhance stimulus discrimination would result in less overgeneralization of fear and avoidance compared to an irrelevant (control) training.</p><p>The training used in this study aimed at diminishing generalization of fear and avoidance was inspired by a clinical intervention &#x0201c;stimulus discrimination&#x0201d;, which is part of the cognitive therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the clinical intervention, PTSD patients learn to identify triggers of their intrusive memories (often subtle sensory cues) and then learn to discriminate these by focusing their attention on the differences between the triggers and their current context from those in the actual trauma. For example, a road traffic accident survivor who survived a head-on car crash at night identified that bright light on a dark background triggered his intrusions. In therapy, he looked at different kinds of bright lights against dark backgrounds, while focusing on differences in the perceptual pattern and the context in which he observed the light. He learned to discriminate the lights and their present context from the headlights he saw in the darkness of the night before his accident [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar to this clinical intervention, the training in this study aimed to promote discrimination of stimuli with perceptual similarities.</p><p>In sum, overgeneralization of fear and avoidance appears to play a major role in the maintenance of anxiety disorders. This study investigates the effects of training that promotes perceptual stimulus discrimination on the generalization of fear, in particular, harm expectancy and avoidance. To rule out that potential differences in fear (over)generalization between the training groups can be attributed to other third factors, this study will test and if needed control for group differences in the acquisition of fear, or individual differences in trait anxiety, neuroticism and worry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Via posters and online advertisements, a total of 80 members of the Oxford community, most of them student at the University of Oxford or Oxford Brookes University, were recruited and selected to take part in this study.

The relevant (stimulus discrimination) training consisted of 30 trials in which two different stimuli were presented shortly after each other. The participants&#x02019; task was to decide whether the stimuli differed in terms of shape, colour, or not at all while trying to make as few mistakes as possible. In this training phase, the same colours were used as in stimulus set 2. In the generalization phase after the training phase, the shapes used differed from the ones used in stimulus set 1 and 2. Participants received audio feedback on their choice: a buzzer sound (low tone) if the answer was wrong, and a high-pitched bleep sound (high tone) if the answer was right. Both sounds were introduced to participants before the start of the phase to prevent any misunderstanding about their meaning. This relevant training aimed to promote stimulus discrimination by asking the participants to focus on subtle differences in physical resemblance of the stimuli.</p><p>In the irrelevant (control) training, the same set of stimuli was used as in the relevant training group, however, participants were presented one stimulus at the time and had to decide as quickly as possible whether the word in the left or the right bottom corner of the screen related to the stimulus. The words related to the shape (e.g. circle or trapezium) or the colour (e.g. milk or elephant) of the stimulus. The training was presented as a reaction time task, and participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible while making as few mistakes as possible. They received audio feedback on their choice and their reaction time was shown. The irrelevant training did not promote stimulus discrimination as it did not ask the participant to focus on the subtle differences in physical resemblance of the stimuli, but on their semantic knowledge related to the stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Posttraining acquisition and generalization</title><p>Stimulus Set 2 was used for this experimental phase.</p><p><bold>Habituation phase II</bold>.

To deal with these dependencies in the data we used a hierarchical modeling approach [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Use of hierarchical models is a more appropriate way of analyzing generalization data than using repeated measures ANOVA, as the latter treats the generalization stimuli as a categorical dimension whereas a dimensional approach seems more appropriate. Because hierarchical models allow the inclusion of the stimulus dimension as a continuous variable, it is possible to model the strength of the response as a parametric function of the stimulus dimension (i.e., more specifically as a quadratic function). Moreover, the assumption of sphericity in a repeated measures ANOVA, that is equality of variances within stimuli and correlations between stimuli, is not realistic when working with generalization data, resulting in increased probability of type I error. For a full discussion of the benefits of the used approach over a repeated measures ANOVA, see [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Since this increased fear generalization may play a role in the development or possibly further exacerbation of pathological fear, it is of clinical relevance to examine whether fear generalization can be reduced by promoting stimulus discrimination. In this study it was tested whether a perceptual discrimination training would result in less fear overgeneralization in a perceptual conditioning task compared to an irrelevant control training in a non-clinical sample.</p><p>The results show that the groups did not differ in fear generalization before training. After the training phase the group that received the relevant discrimination training was less likely to avoid ambiguous, generalized stimuli compared to the irrelevant control group, despite the absence of group differences on harm expectancies related to the generalized stimuli.</p><p>This is one of the first studies that attempts to test whether the promotion of discrimination ability could decrease fear generalization, by isolating this specific intervention used in clinical practice and bringing it to the lab. Although this study focused specifically on perceptual discrimination, it can be seen as a proof of principle and future studies could test the effect of discrimination training on other levels on which fear generalization occurs. Although group differences were only found on the behavioural outcome measure (avoidance) and not on the cognitive outcome measure (harm expectancy), the results can be seen as promising, given that avoidance of generalized stimuli maintains fear by preventing disconfirmation of erroneous fear beliefs. These results encourage further research on the effects of discrimination training on fear generalization in at-risk population, for example individuals high on neuroticism [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or clinical populations, using a longer and more intense discrimination training.</p><p>A few limitations should be taken into account. First, the pre-training test did not show any group differences, but did not include a behavioural outcome measure, so no firm conclusions about causal effects of the training on avoidance behaviour can be drawn from this study. Possibly other factors like individual differences might have contributed to the group differences in avoidance of generalized stimuli, however, since there were no group differences on trait anxiety, neuroticism or worry it is unlikely that these variables that have been related to fear conditioning in earlier studies account for the difference in avoidance in the present study. With regard to the design, two CS+s and CS-s were chosen to increase the idea of a continuum instead of three categories: white (CS+/-), black (CS+/-) and all grey colours (GSs). Even though the colour differences for all stimuli were equal in terms of RGB values, it might have been easier to discriminate between pitch black and off-black and white and off-white than between grey colours. However, by using 2 CS+s and CS-s participants may learn in the acquisition phase that small colour differences are irrelevant. Even though the curve of US expectancies in the generalization phase before the training phase does not seem to support this and the relevant training group would still learn in the training phase that small differences are relevant, using only the off-white and off-black one as CS+ or CS- would be preferable in future studies. Furthermore, the relevant training only decreased avoidance of generalised stimuli, whereas harm expectancies were not affected. Possibly cognitive changes require more experiences that violate the harm expectancies in order to adapt them. Since all generalized stimuli were only shown twice in the generalization phase, this might have not been sufficient to result in harm expectancies changes. The discrepancy between training effects on US expectancy and avoidance encourage the inclusion of other outcome measures like psychophysiological measures that could provide further inside in which levels of fear generalization are affected by the discrimination training.</p><p>This study includes one of the first attempts to tackle the problematic fear overgeneralization as observed in clinical groups suffering from pathological anxiety. Together with results of a recent study in which a perceptual discrimination training task related to reduced fear generalization based on self-reported risk ratings of generalized stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], these results show promising evidence for the potential benefits of a discrimination training to diminish fear overgeneralization. It should be noted however, that the relationship between perceptual discrimination and fear generalization remains to be clarified by including concurrent recordings of subjective perception and fear responses to generalized stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Reduced perceptual discrimination could underlie fear overgeneralization, but generalization differences might also occur despite differences in discrimination ability. More insight in various mechanisms that could underlie gear overgeneralization is relevant, as these might require different clinical interventions.</p><p>In sum, in this study discrimination training was associated with less avoidance of ambiguous or generalized stimuli. Since avoidance behaviour maintains a sense of current threat [<xref rid="pone.0184485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and prevents exposure to corrective experiences, interventions that promote stimulus discrimination may contribute to the treatment of anxiety related disorders such as PTSD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Acquisition phase pre-training select25_75.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Acquisition phase post-training select25_75.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Generalization phase pre-training select25_75.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s003.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Generalization phase post-training selection 25_75 USexpectancy CS-s GSs CS+s.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s004.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Generalization phase post-training selection 25_75 avoidance CS-s and GSs.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s005.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184485.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Value names and descriptions excel files S1&#x02013;S5.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184485.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by Wellcome Trust grant 069777 and supported by the Oxford cognitive health NIHR Clinical Research Facility.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0184485.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Consortium TWWMHS.
