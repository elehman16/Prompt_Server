As a result of the alteration in bone remodeling activity in patients with bone metastases, various markers of bone formation or resorption have been investigated as a measurement of activity of skeletal metastases. Balance between bone resorption and bone formation is required for maintenance of bone metabolism, and can be reflected by bone turnover markers (BTM). The usefulness of BTM as a tool for the diagnosis of bone metastases in many types of cancers has been investigated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that some BTM can indicate the existence of bone metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and have analyzed their relationship with clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The two most clinically relevant markers of bone turnover in patients with skeletal metastases are bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX). Total amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP) and BAP are markers of bone formation; BAP has a linear relationship with osteoblast and osteoblastic precursor activity. NTX is a breakdown product of type I collagen produced by various proteolytic enzymes during bone resorption and dissolution of the organic bone matrix. Additionally, pyridinium cross-links pyridinoline (PYD) and desoxy-pyridinoline (DPD) are well-characterized markers for bone resorption. C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) can be considered a complementary tool for prediction of clinical outcome as a marker of resorption. At the present time, although biochemical markers of bone turnover have shown some utility in clinical trials by predicting clinical outcomes such as death or development of SREs, they are not routinely used in clinical practice. Questions remain as to how clinicians should best use these markers to select and time appropriate treatments among patients with bone metastases. The use of these markers may, in the future, better allow physicians to selectively treat patients with bone metastases.</p><p>In our recent work, we could show the feasibility of resistance training in patients with spinal bone metastases under RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Importantly, we demonstrated that the bone density in metastases of the resistance training arm was significantly higher than in the control arm after 3&#x000a0;months. Therefore, we hypothesized that resistance training concomitant to RT could influence bone metabolism, and would be reflected by BTM.</p><p>The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the effect of resistance training concomitant to RT versus RT only on BTM, such as BAP, PINP, CTX-I, PYD, DPD, and NTX in patients with spinal bone metastases. Secondly, we evaluated an association of these markers as predicted factors for local response, prevention of SRE, and number of metastases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Settings and patients</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled, two-armed intervention trial. A block randomization approach with block size 6 was used to ensure that the two intervention groups were balanced. After the baseline measurements, the patients with stable bone metastases were assigned to the respective treatment groups on a 1:1 basis according to the randomization list. Arm A (intervention group, resistance training) and arm B (control group, passive physical therapy) each consisted of 30 patients.</p><p>The blood and urine parameters were measured before start of RT (t<sub>0</sub>) (day of the first fraction), and after three months (t<sub>2</sub>) on an empty stomach. The primary endpoint was to compare BTM after 3&#x000a0;months in patients treated with resistance training concomitant to RT versus RT only in spinal bone metastases. Secondary endpoint was to evaluate predictive bone markers for local response, prevention of SRE, and number of metastases. Local response of metastasis was assessed on the basis of computed tomography. Positive local response was defined as complete or partial re-calcification on the basis of computed tomography observation at 3&#x000a0;months after RT. The definition of SRE was the first of any of the following events: pathological fractures, severe pain (increase of more than 2 points according to numeric rating scale), hypercalcaemia, and spinal cord compression. Number of metastases was classified in 1 or &#x0003e;1 (solitary vs. multiple). The data of the patient records were collected by the authors.

Patients were excluded if they presented with concomitant pathologies that could interfere in the evaluation of bone turnover markers, such as bone metabolic disorders, Paget`s disease of bone, hyperparathyroidism, thyroid abnormalities, abnormal intestinal absorption, or hepatic or renal dysfunction. In all cases, anticancer treatment could be changed as clinically indicated throughout the course of the study. The patients were subjected to a staging of their vertebral column within the context of the computed tomography (CT) designed to plan the radiation schedule prior to enrolment into the trial. In this examination metastases were classified as &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unstable&#x0201d;. This was diagnosed independently by a specialist for radiology as well as by a specialist for orthopedic surgery. The specifications for an unstable vertebral body were tumor occupancy more than 60&#x000a0;% of the vertebral body, and pedicle destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Only a metastasis classified by both specialists as &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; was suggested eligible for inclusion. Patients with significant neurological or psychiatric disorders were excluded. The study was approved by the Heidelberg Ethics Committee (Nr.

After virtual simulation was performed to plan the radiation schedule, RT was carried out over a dorsal photon field of the 6MV energy range. Primary target volume (PTV) covered the specific vertebral body affected as well as the ones immediately above and below. In Arm A, 24 patients (80&#x000a0;%) were treated with 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;Gy, three patients (10&#x000a0;%) with 14&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;Gy, and three patients (10&#x000a0;%) with 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;Gy. In Arm B the dose fractions for 28 patients (93.4&#x000a0;%) were 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;Gy, for one patient (3.3&#x000a0;%) 14&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;Gy, and for one patient (3.3&#x000a0;%) 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;Gy. The median individual dose in all patients was 3&#x000a0;Gy (range 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;Gy), the median total dose 30&#x000a0;Gy (range 20&#x02013;35&#x000a0;Gy).

During the 2-week RT period, the patients in the resistance training arm (Arm A) performed the exercises under the guidance of a physiotherapist. The patients were then instructed to practice the training in their homes three times a week and continued the resistance training themselves until the last investigation after three months, and conducted the documentation in form of a training diary. The resistance training lasted approx. 30&#x000a0;min, the passive physical therapy (Arm B) approx. 15&#x000a0;min. Since the site of the bone metastases differed from patient to patient, three different exercises were enacted to ensure an even isometric resistance training of the paravertebral muscles. Patients in the control arm (Arm B) received passive physical therapy in form of breathing exercises also for a period of 2 weeks. This was conducted so that these patients were not discouraged in comparison to the intervention arm, and for avoidance of a high drop-out rate. A detailed report of the intervention and its application has already been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Bone marker values were presented in terms of mean and standard deviation (SD).

Therefore as all surviving patients completed all surveys we assumed that 23 patients in Arm A and 24 patients in Arm B were eligible for the analysis. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were fitted to quantify the degree of association between potential predictors of markers at baseline according to local response (yes/no), prevention of SRE (yes/no), and number of metastases (1/more than one). Group had been included as a covariate in the analysis. Arm A with 23 survived patients was the reference. Level of significance was set to 0.05 for all tests.

The usefulness of BTM as tool for the diagnosis of bone metastases in many types of cancers has been investigated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many studies have analyzed their relationship with clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as well as their clinical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, there is still no concensus among these studies as to which BTM is the ideal marker.</p><p>In the current work, all BTM in arm A decreased after 3&#x000a0;months, especially the mean change values of PYD and CTX-I were significantly lower at 3&#x000a0;months after RT due to resistance training. BTM in arm B showed also decreased values after 3&#x000a0;months except of PYD and CTX-I, but not so distinctive as in arm A. Importantly, local response as re-calcification in metastasis was improved in arm A due to resistance training. In our recent work, we could show that bone density was significantly increased in metastasis 3&#x000a0;months after start of resistance training concomitant to RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This factor may influence the BTM and was demonstrated in our results. Therefore, PINP could be detected as a strong marker for bone formation after combined treatment with resistance training concomitant to RT.</p><p>Determination of CTX-I is recommended for monitoring the efficacy of antiresorptive therapy. Patients with renal cell carcinoma who died or progressed had higher baseline B-CTX levels and those who experienced SRE during follow-up showed high BAP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, in our results we could not found any useful data in normal/abnormal values of BTM. A multicenter study found that increased values of BAP and NTX were associated with increased risk of SRE, and disease progression in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other solid tumors, treated with bisphosphonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These markers of bone turnover have been used clinically to predict the risk of SREs and disease outcomes. According our results, we could identify BAP and PINP for avoidance of SRE. In addition, biochemical markers of bone turnover may prove useful in the monitoring of patients on bisphosphonate treatment for bone metastases. One review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] of 121 patients with skeletal metastases from variety of solid tumors revealed that mean values of NTX were consistently elevated in patients experiencing SREs compared with those who did not. An additional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] showed in 441 patients that patients with high NTX or BAP levels had a greater incidence of SREs compared with patients with low levels of NTX or BAP. Patients with increased NTX or BAP at baseline had an increased risk for SRE, shorter time to first event, disease progression and death. As NTX levels have been shown to correlate with response to bisphosphonate treatment. In our data, we could not show any correlation of NTX to local response, SRE, and number of metastases, but we were able to confirm the relation to BAP with prevention of SRE. Zoledronic acid normalizes or maintains normal NTX levels in most patients with bone metastases. All of our participants were treated with bisphosphonates. Our data presented no differences between arms of NTX.</p><p>However, a PINP could be identified as a predictor for local response and avoidance of SRE. In this novel study, our results showed that resistance training concomitant to RT can even enhance an effect on BTM.</p><p>Since all patients were in advanced stages of their cancer, 40&#x000a0;% of the patients in either group were lost to follow-up due to progressive disease and subsequently death. Further limitations of the study were the relatively small sample size, the variety of primary tumors and patient conditions, and the exclusion of patients presenting with cervical spine metastases.</p><p>Among the strengths of our novel and original study were the randomized design and the very first presentation of bone turnover markers in combined treatment of resistance training concomitant to RT in patients with spinal bone metastases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this group of patients with spinal bone metastases, we were able to show that patients with guided resistance training of the paravertebral muscles can influence BTM. PYD and CTX-I decreased significantly in arm A. PINP can be considered as a complementary tool for prediction of local response, and PINP as well as BAP for avoidance of SRE. More studies in larger groups of patients are necessary for further confirmatory research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Heidelberg Ethics Committee (Nr.
