The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of stress level on the frequency and the amount of snack consumption. The high stress group (HS) showed significantly higher frequency of consumption for bread, chips, cookies, ramyeon, and frozen snacks (p&#x0003c;0.05) compared to low stress group (LS) with higher frequency of snack consumption (p&#x0003c;0.01), and increased intakes of energy, carbohydrates, and sodium from snacks (p&#x0003c;0.01) than LS. As the stress level became higher, the proportions of students with irregular meals, overeating, and night snacking increased (p&#x0003c;0.01). Also, 33.0% of the subjects answered that they consumed an increased amount of snacks when they were feeling stressed. Our results indicated that stress has negative influence on snack consumption in middle school girls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>snack consumption</kwd><kwd>middle school girls</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adolescence is an important period of growth as well as establishment of healthy dietary behaviors for balanced nutrient intakes. Balanced nutrient intakes promote appropriate physical growth and development and play an important role in maintaining mental and emotional stability. However, three meals a day may not be sufficient for providing nutrients required for growth, and snack consumption between regular meals are necessary to supplement nutrients.</p><p>A healthy snack includes some foods that have short gastric emptying time, lower degree of satiety, and various nutrientswith 10-15% of daily total energy intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Koo et al., 2006</xref>). However, according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Joo &#x00026; Park, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Joo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Kwon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Park &#x00026; Kim, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Park, 2003</xref>), adolescents eat snacks too frequently and sometimes replace meals with snacks, and then overeat the next meal, and are more likely to become obese by consuming high calorie snacks such as soft drinks and cookies. In addition, the preference for a specific snack food may result in preference of rejecting a certain food. Improper dietary attitude can lead to consuming a large amount of snacks, and further to undesirable dietary behaviors such as skipping or irregular of meals. Factors associated with snack consumption have been reported to be a sense of values, belief, knowledge, attitude, economic status, parents' occupations and academic background, number of siblings and family members, and birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Choi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Joo &#x00026; Park, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Parraga, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, stress has been reported to affect dietary behaviors. Adler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1994</xref>) reported that stress had influences on health behaviors, particularly dietary behaviors such as increasing dietary intakes. One study of elementary &#x000b7; middle &#x000b7; high school students in Korea showed that dietary behaviors changed during the school examination periods when students were under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jang et al., 2000</xref>). Also in Kim's study among high school students, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2001</xref>) increased stress induced overeating. Some studies on the relationship between stress and certain nutrients showed that individuals with higher levels of stress consumed more carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">McCann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Michard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wardle, 2000</xref>), and another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Oliver, 1999</xref>) showed that individuals with greater stress chose high carbohydrates or high fat foods. In Yeom's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>) study with elementary school students, subjects with higher stress levels had higher intakes of fat and vitamin B<sub>1</sub> and lower intakes of calcium and vitamin C.</p><p>Adolescents are full of anxiety, conflict, and agony. They experience the most significant changes and the most serious stress than in any other developmental stage because of many tasks to be accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Han &#x00026; Cho, 2000</xref>). Such stress can greatly affect eating habits and health of adolescents. As snacks tend to value preference more than nutrition, unhealthy snack consumption behaviors due to stress may have adverse effects on health.</p><p>Although there are some reports on the associations of stress and eating behaviors in adolescents, few studies have observed the relationship between stress and snack consumption. Previous studies showed that stress was higher in female students than in male students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Han &#x00026; Cho, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lee &#x00026; Park, 2000</xref>) and so was the frequency of snack consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cho, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Ha &#x00026; Lee, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kim &#x00026; Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lee et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Park &#x00026; Kim, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the status of stress and the relationship between stress and snack consumption in middle school girls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was performed by using a survey questionnaire for female students in three middle schools located in Suwon. The preliminary survey was undertaken for 41 middle school girls from June 10 to June 11, 2005, and the survey questionnaire was modified and complemented based on the results of the preliminary study. The survey of the study was performed between July 7 and July 15, 2005; a total of 370 questionnaires were distributed and 360 were collected (response rate 97.3%). Finally, a total of 350 questionnaires were used in the statistical analysis, excluding 10 with incomplete answers for the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of subjects</title><p>For general characteristics of subjects, 5 questions such as grade, father's occupation, the presence of mother's occupation, monthly household income, and monthly allowance were included.

The degree of stress was checked by the 4-point Likert scale, and scored as follows: 1 for 'Disagree strongly', 2 for 'Agree slightly', 3 for 'Agree', and 4 for 'Agree strongly', and thus the higher score meant a higher degree of stress. Participants were divided into 3 groups according to the total stress score: low stress group (LS) with the score of lower 0%~ 25%, medium stress group (MS) with the score of 25%&#x0003c; ~ 75%, and high stress group (HS) with the score of 75%&#x0003c; ~ 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of a questionnaire on snack consumption behaviors</title><p>A questionnaire on behaviors of snack consumption was developed with reference to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Lee &#x00026; Han, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Park &#x00026; Kim, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Park, 2003</xref>) and 'a collection of survey questions related to dietary practices' (2000).

For the desire for snacks, 98.5% of the respondents answered as 'yes'. The frequency of night snacking per week was the highest in '1~2 times a week' as 36.8% and then '3~5 times a week' as 34.1%. 33.0% of the subjects answered that they consumed an increased amount of snacks when they were more stressed. The results of &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, which was performed to find out the influence of stress level on the snack consumption behavior, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, showed that middle school girls with higher stress levels (HS) had higher daily frequencies of snack consumption and weekly night snacking, and higher rates of answering 'yes' for the desire for snacks compared to those with lower stress levels (LS).

Also, higher stress levels caused irregularities in regular meal eating patterns (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study on the stress level in middle school girls showed that study-related stress was the highest as 2.52 points, and then body-related stress (2.24 points) and boyfriend-related stress (2.22 points). These results were similar to the results of Cho et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1998</xref>) and Lee and Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2000</xref>) with adolescents and Yoo and Han (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1994</xref>) and Yeom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2001</xref>) with elementary school students. The high scores of body-related stress and boyfriend-related stress were considered as an observation due to the developmental stage of adolescence in middle school girls, when the interests in personal appearance and in boyfriends have increased. In addition, the subject schools in this study were co-ed schools and thus the interests for boyfriends might be higher.</p><p>The results from the influence of stress on snack consumption behaviors of middle school girls showed that the stress level had significant correlation with the frequency of night snacking (p&#x0003c;0.01), with more than 3 times of night snacking per week as 27.7% in LS group, 48.0% in MS group, and 58.5% in HS group, suggesting the highest frequency of night snacking is in the HS group. These results were similar to the results of Nam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2002</xref>), in which female college students had more snacks before regular meals and before sleep at night when they had higher levels of stress.</p><p>The amount of snack consumption changed due to stress also showed significant correlation with the stress level (p&#x0003c;0.01), with the rate of more snack consumption than usual as 26.5% in LS group, 28.6% in MS group, and 48.8% in HS group, suggesting the highest snack consumption is in the stressed HS group. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">McCann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Michard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Oliver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wardle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Yeom, 2001</xref>) also showed that stress increased dietary intakes.</p><p>The stress of middle school girls increased the weekly frequency of snack consumption of breads, chips, cookies, soft drinks, ramyeon, and frozen snacks. Total snack consumption frequency per day was 2.2 in HS group, which was significantly higher than those in LS and MS groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). Foods related to stress in this study were found to be chips, cookies, soft drinks, ramyeon, frozen sweets, which were also showed high preference and high purchase frequency in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Cho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Kang et al., 2004</xref>). In the study of Moon and Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1987</xref>), children consumed 27% of the whole snack as cookies, instant foods such as ramyeon and refined sugars. Joo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2006</xref>) reported that higher intakes of chips, biscuits (cookies), candies, fast foods, and soft drinks had possibility for hyperactivity. In the study of juvenile criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Gray, 1987</xref>), it was reported that the frequent use of natural foods corrected their impulsiveness and aggressiveness. Thus it is needed to introduce nutrition education for selecting healthy snacks to students.</p><p>The results of the relationship between stress and daily average nutrient intake from snacks showed that stress of middle school girls had significant correlation with daily average nutrient intakes of energy, carbohydrates, and sodium from snacks. The average energy intake from snacks was 842.9 kcal, which was 42.2% of daily estimated energy requirement (2000 kcal) of middle school girls and particularly in the HS group, it was 948.8 kcal which was 47.4% of daily estimated energy requirement. Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>) reported that the snack consumption in adolescents increased with high proportion of energy among total energy intake from snacks, and the clear distinction between meals and snacks was disappearing. Also in the study of Cho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2002</xref>) with adolescents, they took more than 33% of daily total energy from snacks, and in the study of Sin and Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2005</xref>) with preschool children, snacks took more than 59% of daily total energy intake. These results showed far greater percentages than 10~15%, the ideal ratio of snacks for daily total energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Koo et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting the seriousness of the current situation. Frequent snack consumption can take the place of regular meals, which can lead to skipping meals and then overeating atthe next meal, and also causes obesity and related diseases by consuming high-energy snacks such as soft drinks and cookies. Then the preference of certain types of snacks can promote unbalanced dietary practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Park &#x00026; Kim, 1995</xref>). The intake of carbohydrates was 135.8 g in HS group, which was significantly higher than 121.7 g in MS group and 100.3 g in LS group (p&#x0003c;0.01). The average intake of sodium was 1311.0 mg in HS group, which was also significantly higher than 1066.5 mg in MS group and 882.3 mg in LS group (p&#x0003c;0.01). These results can explain the relationship in which higher stress levels cause increased intakes of carbohydrates and sodium. For the relationship between stress and each nutrient, it has been reported that individuals with higher stress had higher intakes of carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">McCann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Michard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Oliver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wardle, 2000</xref>), which is consistent with the results of this study.</p><p>The correlations among stress, dietary behaviors, and snack consumption in middle school girls showed that higher levels of stress caused higher frequency of snack consumption (p&#x0003c;0.01), frequency of overeating (p&#x0003c;0.01), frequency of night snacking (p&#x0003c;0.01), energy (p&#x0003c;0.01), carbohydrates (p&#x0003c;0.01) and sodium intake (p&#x0003c;0.01) from snacks, and irregular meals (p&#x0003c;0.05), and that they had higher snack consumption than usual when they were feeling stressed (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Therefore, a nutrition education program including stress management, proper snack choice, importance of regular meal eating, avoiding overeating, and proper night snacking should be developed and implemented to change the dietary behavior of a group with higher stress levels.</p><p>In conclusion, middle school girls in Korea have high stresses including study related stress, body related stress and boyfriend related stress, and those who had higher levels of stress showed higher frequencies of snack consumption and increased energy, carbohydrates, and sodium intakes from snacks. Also, higher levels of stress caused irregularity in regular meal eating patterns, higher frequencies of overeating and night snacking, and more snack consumption than usual when they were feeling stressed. Therefore, differentiated nutrition education is necessary for groups with higher stress and the contents for nutrition education including stress management should be developed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by the research grant of the Chungbuk National University in 2006.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref
