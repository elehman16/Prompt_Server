This study aims to assess the acceptability and feasibility of Patient-Centred Family Meetings in specialist inpatient palliative care units for patients, families, and clinicians and determine the suitability and feasibility of validated outcome measures from the patient and family perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study is a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design with pre-planned Patient-Centred Family Meetings at the intervention site. The patient will set the meeting agenda a priori allowing an opportunity for their issues to be prioritised and addressed. At the control site, usual care will be maintained which may include a family meeting. Each site will recruit 20 dyads comprising a terminally ill inpatient and their nominated family member. Pre- and post-test administration of the Distress Thermometer, QUAL-EC, QUAL-E, and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 will assess patient and family distress and satisfaction with quality of life. Patient, family, and clinician interviews post-meeting will provide insights into the meeting feasibility and outcome measures. Recruitment percentages and outcome measure completion will also inform feasibility.</p><p id="Par3">Descriptive statistics will summarise pre- and post-meeting data generated by the outcome measures. SPSS will analyse the quantitative data. Grounded theory will guide the qualitative data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">This study will determine whether planned Patient-Centred Family Meetings are feasible and acceptable and assess the suitability and feasibility of the outcome measures.

The bringing together of patients, family, and clinicians for a purposeful discussion has been recognised as a means of assisting with patient-family and clinical team communication in the specialist palliative care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This &#x0201c;family meeting&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;family conference,&#x0201d; as it is variously referred to in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], facilitates discussion about the illness experience, care choices, and end-of-life decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this setting, &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; is defined as whomever the patient designates as &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; and may include close friends or carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Only a limited number of studies have been undertaken to examine the outcomes of family meetings. Hannon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] demonstrated that unmet family needs and concerns were significantly improved as a result of family meetings. The authors recommended further studies to review the impact of family meetings from the family and clinician perspective and to incorporate qualitative data collection.</p><p id="Par8">A prospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] of family meetings demonstrated that the high levels of verbal expression of distress exhibited by primary caregivers were not significantly affected by the presence of the patient. However, other family members verbally expressed their emotional distress more often when the patient was absent. Patient presence was also significantly associated with increased discussion regarding goals of care and decreased discussion about prognosis and the symptoms dying patients may experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, no validated measures were used to assess distress, and patients did not routinely participate in the family meetings. The authors of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] recommended identification of patient preferences for family meeting structure and procedures, and that consideration should be given to a randomised control trial (RCT) to compare patient and family participation with family only participation in family meetings.</p><p id="Par9"><italic>Guidelines for Conducting Family Meetings in Palliative Care</italic> were developed in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and provide a structured approach for preparing and conducting a family meeting. An evaluation of the Guidelines&#x02019; effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and their impact on family outcomes demonstrated a significant increase post-meeting in the overall means for addressing important family needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The timing of the family meeting and a review of patient benefits were suggested as important areas for further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The authors concluded that family meetings were acceptable and feasible to ascertain and deal with family concerns; however, the authors did not document the feasibility and acceptability for patients and clinicians.</p><p id="Par10">A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] examined what measureable health outcomes improved as a result of family meetings convened in acute and sub-acute inpatient care settings, including palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This review found low-to-moderate positive evidence that family meetings led to a reduction in family psychological distress and addressed the information and support needs of families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further research to assess patient outcomes and the patient&#x02019;s role in family meetings was recommended. A more recent review found a dearth of evidence to support the use of family meetings in palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In particular, there was no study that demonstrated patient benefits using a validated measure and only two studies used a validated measure to demonstrate family benefits as a result of participation in a family meeting. There was also limited qualitative evidence to support positive outcomes for patients, families and clinicians participating in a family meeting.</p><p id="Par11">Overall there is limited high-level evidence to demonstrate the benefits of family meetings for patients, families and clinicians in the palliative care context. The feasibility and acceptability of family meetings has only been confirmed for families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The authors of published studies have recommended that additional research is required to assess patient outcomes, preferences, and participation in family meetings in the palliative care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and that clinician outcomes should also be evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of qualitative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], to assess the impact of family meetings on family participants and to examine the timing of family meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have also been advocated as areas for further investigation. In addition, the majority of studies have not used validated measures to evaluate the impact of family meetings on participants, in particular patient and family distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, there is a clear need to undertake research using quantitative and qualitative data to assess the feasibility, acceptability and impact of family meetings from the perspective of all participants - patient, family and clinicians. A clearer understanding of the patient&#x02019;s role and their preferences for family meetings is imperative given: (a) the vulnerability of this patient cohort; (b) the uncertainty regarding the value of family meetings in palliative care; (c) the resource intensity of clinician time associated with this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; and (d) the current intuitive belief that these meetings are an important aspect of standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In the proposed study,&#x000a0;qualitative data collection with interviews of patients, families and clinician focus groups will assess the feasibility and acceptability of Patient-Centred Family Meetings and the suitability and feasibility of the measures used. Patients will complete the QUAL-EC questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and family members will complete the corresponding QUAL-E (Family) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to measure patient and family satisfaction with quality of life at end-of-life. Patients and families will complete the National Cancer Collaborative Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as a measure of distress and families will complete the PHQ-4 (Patient Health Questionnaire-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as an additional distress measure.</p><p id="Par14">As recruitment will be from a palliative care population, patients who are terminally ill or debilitated can affect data collection. This issue will be addressed by the eligibility criteria. The Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration (PCOC) palliative care phase classification system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] will be used to confirm that the patient is not in the terminal phase and the Australian Modified Karnofsky Performance Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] will be used to confirm the physical capability of the patient to participate in the VOICE Study.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par15">The primary objectives of the VOICE Study are to:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(i)</label><p id="Par16">Assess the acceptability and feasibility of providing planned Patient-Centred Family Meetings in a specialist inpatient palliative care unit for patients, families and clinicians;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(ii)</label><p id="Par17">Understand the benefits and burden of participating in a Patient-Centred Family Meetings from the patient, family and clinician perspective; and</p></list-item><list-item><label>(iii)</label><p id="Par18">Assess the suitability and feasibility of the selected outcome measures for patients and families.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par19">The secondary objective is to inform the development of a future phase III RCT.</p><p id="Par20">The principles of patient-centred care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] will underpin the proposed intervention and are congruent with the clinical practice of palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For this reason, the family meeting intervention in this study will be referred to as a Patient-Centred Family Meeting. The recognition of the patient as an individual and the obligation to acknowledge their unique needs, wants, values and concerns and those of their family and/or significant others (if present) is paramount. The Patient-Centred Family Meeting will focus on the patient and give them a &#x0201c;voice&#x0201d; by facilitating the meeting discussion concerning their needs, concerns opinions and experiences. The VOICE acronym reflects this concept. By also assessing the acceptability and feasibility of Patient-Centred Family Meetings from the perspective of families and clinicians, all participants are given a &#x0201c;voice&#x0201d; in the VOICE Study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Research design</title><p id="Par21">The VOICE Study Research Protocol (Version 5.6, 11.3.2017) will utilise a mixed methods quasi-experimental (pre-post-test) design.

Nevertheless, the currently limited high-level evidence to support the routine use of family meetings in the inpatient palliative care setting indicates that this feasibility study is warranted. In particular, there is limited evidence for patient and family benefits using validated outcomes measures and limited qualitative evidence to demonstrate advantages for clinicians.</p><p>This study will determine whether planned Patient-Centred Family Meetings are feasible and acceptable to participating patients, families and clinicians. It will also assess the suitability and feasibility of the selected outcome measures for patients and families. In addition, the study is expected to enhance the understanding of the benefits and burdens of participating in a planned Patient-Centred Family Meetings for patients, families and clinicians. The results will also inform the need for a possible Phase III Randomised Controlled Trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The VOICE Study research is supported through the Australian Government&#x02019;s Collaborative Research Networks (CRN) program.
