Modern therapeutic strategies usually focus on the manipulation of enzymes and biomolecules involved in fat metabolism. Lipase inhibitors, agents that act on the inhibition of enzymes responsible for the digestion of long-chain triglycerides, are generally regarded as a safer choice of treatment for weight management.<xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,13</sup></xref> However, these antiobesity agents are not without downsides. Apparent gastrointestinal side effects, such as increased defecation, soft stools, fatty oils evacuation, and oily spotting have been reported.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Also, the question of possible liver damage associated with the use of lipase inhibitors remains unanswered.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>Due to concerns over drug toxicity and side effects, there is increasing interest to seek alternative nonpharmacologic approaches from natural sources for weight management. <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica</italic> (also known as nopal) is a species of cactus found abundantly in Mexico and over a large area of Latin America, South Africa, and the Mediterranean.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The fruit (prickly pear or cactus pear) and the pad (cladode) of the cactus are common ingredients in Mexican cuisine.

It is postulated that dietary fat bound by the fiber complex is not available for digestion and is eventually eliminated unabsorbed, thus helping to reduce energy intake and promote weight loss.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A cactus fiber preparation (IQP-G-002AS), supplied by InQpharm Group (Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) used in our study is derived from the dehydrated cladode of <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica</italic> and fortified with soluble fiber from <italic>Acacia</italic> spp. The cactus fiber preparation is composed of soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, including cellulose and hemicellulose, and is standardized in its fat binding capacity (1 g compound binds to 10 g fat). The in vivo efficacy of the standardized cactus fiber on weight loss was previously established during a 14-week study on 123 obese or overweight subjects.

Subjects compliant with the meal plan and investigational product (IP) regimen during B1 entered a 7-day intervention phase (Intervention 1) and were randomized to either receive cactus fiber tablets or matching placebo, 2 tablets TID after each main meal. Each cactus fiber tablet contains 500 mg standardized cactus fiber, as well as common tableting excipients. Identical placebo tablets were manufactured based on the same formulation, but the active ingredient was replaced by a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose (316.5 mg) and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (183.5 mg).</p><p>A 7-day washout period followed by a second baseline measurement period (Baseline 2) took place before subjects were crossed over to the second treatment arm (Intervention 2).

In relation to the amount of daily fat intake, cactus fiber facilitates excretion of 15.79% (5.79%) of the dietary fat in comparison to 4.56% (3.09%) in subjects consuming placebo. The results of our study further strengthen the mode of action of cactus fiber in binding and reducing fat absorption. In comparison, a retrospective analysis of the dose&#x02013;response relationship of orlistat suggests that mean fecal fat excretion plateaus at approximately 35% of daily fat intake at daily doses of &#x02265;400 mg/d.<xref rid="bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28,29</sup></xref> At the recommended dose of orlistat 120 mg TID and 60 mg TID, the inhibition of dietary fat absorption is estimated to be at 30% and 25%, respectively.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Flaxseed, another food ingredient with high dietary fiber content, which has previously been suggested to be able to reduce fat digestion, was found to result in higher fecal fat excretion of 4.96 (0.31) g per day, compared with 3.20 (0.33) g per day in control when given as drink at a dosage of 3 g fiber per day for 7 days.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Even though there are differences in the study design, our study showed that cactus fiber may possess higher fat excretion capacity in comparison to flaxseed-extracted fiber; the difference may be due to differences in the compositions of flaxseed fiber and cactus fiber in the studies. Although the flaxseed-extracted fiber comprises arabinoxylants, galactose, fructose residues, and some pectin,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> the cladode of <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica</italic> is reported to contain 40% to 50% dry weight of dietary fibers, which consist of mucilage, gum, pectin, and hemicellulose.<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31&#x02013;33</sup></xref> Bendsen et al<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> showed that an increase in calcium intake can lead to fecal fat loss, with a mean (SD) excretion of 11.5 (1.4) g fecal fat per day from a high calcium diet (~2300 mg/d) as opposed to 5.4 (0.5) g per day fecal fat from a low calcium diet (~700 mg/d). It should be noted that the levels of calcium included in the diets of this study are much higher than the levels used in the active and placebo tablets of our study (81 mg and 337 mg calcium per day, respectively) and the fecal fat excretion observed is unlikely a result of calcium found in the IPs.</p><p>Approximate weight loss effect from the absolute amount of fat excreted from cactus fiber consumption can be extrapolated from a model proposed by Hall et al,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> which takes into account the compensatory effects of the body toward energy expenditure during weight loss. Given that 1 g fat equals 9 kcal energy, 15.11 g fat excreted per day would correspond to 136 kcal of reduced energy intake per day. Assuming&#x02014;according to the model of Hall et al<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>&#x02014;that a permanent 10 kcal energy deficit would result in a weight loss of 0.45 kg, and that 1 year is needed to achieve 50%, and 3 years to achieve 95% of this weight loss, the 136 kcal energy deficit per day would lead to a loss of approximately 3 kg body mass after 1 year, and 5.8 kg after 3 years. As quoted above, the reported fecal fat excretion of orlistat at 180 mg/d is 25%, yet in a study of 16 weeks&#x02019; duration, orlistat at 60 mg TID has been shown to only result in a 3.50 kg weight loss compared with 1.90 kg in the placebo group, with a net weight loss of 1.6 kg.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> In comparison, 2.4 kg mean net body weight loss was observed over a 3-month period during a previous study of cactus fiber,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> suggesting a more pronounced weight loss effect size than explained by the reduced energy intake due to fat excretion alone. The additional weight loss effect may be attributed to other functional properties of fibers contained in cactus fiber; for example, the effects of fibers on promoting satiety<xref rid="bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37,38</sup></xref> and delaying absorption of nutrients during digestion,<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33,39</sup></xref> which have been frequently reported in literature.

There is variation in terms of daily stool weight, ranging from 34.9 g to 481.4 g, with a mean (SD) of 153.0 (73.7) g. This figure is nevertheless in line with the findings of Cummings et al,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> who reported stool weight with a range of 72 to 470 g/d in the different populations of the world. Our investigation decided against a longer study period with additional stool collection, considering that the task of stool collection may be unpleasant or stressful for subjects and that the use of standardized diet in a longer study may reduce compliance with the diet plan and stool collection. Additionally, a second baseline measurement was incorporated after the washout period to further rule out any possible carryover effect. These measures were perceived to be beneficial in ensuring the consistency and reliability of results.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that it does not provide indication if the increase in fecal fat excretion can be sustained and if tolerance/adaptation effects may develop as a result of longer-term consumption of cactus fiber.
