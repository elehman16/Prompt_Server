The objective is to stimulate the formation of reparative dentin and to retain the tooth as a functional unit. It may involve the transdentinal (indirect) or direct stimulation of tertiary dentin matrix formation in and by vital dental pulps.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Although a variety of materials have been suggested as pulpotomy agents, for regenerative pulpotomy technique the most frequently used materials are mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide (CH), and Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>. CH has been the gold standard for pulp therapy procedures, introduced by Herman <italic>et al</italic>. in 1936, as a biologic dressing and it was found to produce satisfactory results in indirect and direct pulp capping, because of its capacity to induce dentin.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, CH may wound the primary tooth pulp due to its alkalinity leading to drawbacks of internal resorption, dystrophic calcification, and mechanical instability. CH loses its antibacterial capacity when it comes in contact with tissue fluid and is not a good material for sealing against bacterial penetration.</p><p>A quest for a new material with better qualities as dentin substitute led to the use of materials such as MTA and tricalcium silicate-based dentin substitute Several new calcium silicate-based materials have recently been developed aiming to improve some drawbacks of MTA such as its difficult handling property, long setting time, and potential for discoloration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Biodentine&#x02122; (Septodont, Saint Maur des Fosse&#x02019;s, France) is among these materials and is claimed to be used as a dentine restorative material in addition to endodontic indications similar to those of MTA. Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dentine substitute has shown several advantages which include good sealing ability, adequate compressive strength and short setting time, providing a significant clinical advantage over other comparable materials.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It shares both its indications and mode of action with CH but does not have its drawbacks.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The present <italic>in-vivo</italic> split mouth triple blind randomized clinical trial was therefore designed to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effectiveness of Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dentin substitute and compare it with CH in encouraging vital pulpal reaction and dentin bridge formation in vital primary teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study was conducted at the Outpatient Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Punjab Government Dental College and Hospital, Amritsar, Punjab, India.

Thirty healthy individuals (19 boys and 11 girls) showing bilateral deep carious lesions fulfilling clinical inclusion criteria indicative of pulpotomy treatment in primary mandibular molars (D or E) were selected for future investigation to make the final selection [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing study sample selection to final analysis of the sample</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-7-457-g001"/></fig><p>Clinical evaluation for the vitality of pulp in the selected teeth showing a response to thermal pulp sensibility tests was carried out, and a preoperative standardized radiographic evaluation was done to study the extent of carious lesion. Finally, only those children were selected as study group whose parents/guardian gave written consent for being a part of the study. A power calculation indicated that we needed 15 teeth in each group to demonstrate the effect at 90% power of significance. The final convenience sample comprised forty teeth in twenty participant children (aged 5&#x02013;10 years - weighted mean age of 7.1 years for males and 7.6 years for females) indicated for pulpotomy in bilateral primary molars and fulfilling the inclusion criteria was selected [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of teeth according to age and gender and type of pulp capping material</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-7-457-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection criteria</title><p>Bilaterally placed carious primary mandibular molars (D or E) with not more than one wall defect (buccal or lingual) and history of sensitivity to cold impulses and recent history of transient, sharp, lancinating, and momentary type of pain were selected for the study. Only those teeth where no previous treatment therapy was done such as restoration or secondary caries at the margins of the previous restoration were included. Restorable or nonrestorable deeply carious teeth with more than one wall defect and medically compromised subjects and teeth with a history of spontaneous pain or tenderness to percussion were excluded from the study. No clinical evidence of soft tissue pathology, mobility around or adjacent to the tooth in question was noted.</p><p>Radiographically, teeth fulfilling Ekstrand's criteria no. 4, i.e., presence of carious lesion radiolucency in pulpal one-third of the dentin and absence of radiographic signs of widened periodontal ligament space, any furcation/apical radiolucency, pathological internal or external root resorption, and absence of pulp canal obliteration were selected for the study. Physiological root resorption not more than one-third of the root length if present was considered in the radiographic inclusion criteria.</p><p>Twenty participant children with bilaterally placed carious molars indicated for pulpotomy were recruited for two study groups. Simple randomization, without any restriction of teeth indicated for pulpotomy in each participant children, was done through computer generated allocation ratio of 1:1. Thereby allocating equal number of teeth for both study groups bilaterally. Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dentin substitute vital pulpotomy procedure was carried out in twenty teeth (Group-1) and CH regenerative pulpotomy was carried out in 20 teeth on contralateral side (Group-2).</p><p>After ruling out any history of allergies to local anesthetic agents, all teeth were treated under local anesthesia and with rubber dam isolation. Straight line access with water-cooled high-speed handpiece was made for caries removal, and ablation of the coronal pulp was carried using round burs no. &#x000bd; and &#x000bc; or spoon excavator. The entire cavity was flushed with sterile normal saline solution, and pulp hemostasis was achieved using a dry sterile cotton pellet applied for 2&#x02013;3 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedure for mixing of Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dentin substitute: Group-1</title><p>Ca<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>-based dentin substitute in capsular form was used.
