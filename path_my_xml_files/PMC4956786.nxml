The sample size of the study was calculated using a free software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statpages.org/">http://www.statpages.org</ext-link>) based on a pilot study. Eligible subjects were ASA I or II patients between 65 and 80 years of age, scheduled for total knee arthroplasty. Exclusion criteria were: ASA&#x0003e;II; peptic ulcer disease, cardiac-cerebral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus; neurological or psychiatric disorders; history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs; history of drug and alcohol abuse; hepatic and/or kidney dysfunction; BMI&#x0003e;35; patients on analgesics or antidepressants; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;23; inability to comply with the study protocol or procedures.

Bispectral Index Score was maintained at 40&#x02013;60 by adjusting the propofol infusion rate. Heart rate, arterial pressure, respiratory rate, PETCO<sub>2</sub> and SpO2 were recorded continuously. Patients revived spontaneously without administration of any anesthetic antagonists. Fentanyl was used for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and tropisetron was administered for nausea treatment after surgery.

In patients treated with parecoxib sodium, serum IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; levels were decreased in comparison with control values. Besides, parecoxib sodium decreased postoperative pain scores in patients after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial demonstrating the protective effect of parecoxib on POCD in elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, and unveiling a possible mechanism by which parecoxib exerts anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities.</p><p>Accumulating evidence demonstrates a pivotal role of neuroinflammation in the POCD process. Proinflammatory cytokine release and astrocyte activation are associated with declined cognitive performance in humans and animals.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Indeed, proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6, can be released by activated astrocytes, triggering neuroinflammation and leading to cognitive dysfunction.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> High concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines inhibit long-term potentiation and impair memory.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Neuroinflammation has been implicated in cognitive impairment; this may provide a viable target to prevent the development of POCD. Animal studies suggested COX-2 inhibitors to be promising candidates for the treatment of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline caused by surgical trauma.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In the current study, the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated after surgery in both parecoxib and control groups, but the degree of increase in the parecoxib group was markedly lower compared with that of controls. We speculate that the prophylactic effect of parecoxib on POCD likely results from its anti-inflammatory activity. However, more studies are needed to further understand parecoxib's effects.</p><p>Postoperative acute pain is another potential risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. Animal studies demonstrated that postoperative acute- or inflammatory pain could exacerbate memory deficits.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Available evidence indicates that ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can prevent the development of surgery-associated cognitive dysfunction via its pain-relieving effects in aged rats.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Parecoxib sodium is frequently used for postoperative analgesia because of less side effects. In the current study, parecoxib decreased postoperative pain scores in patients after surgery. Furthermore, parecoxib reduced POCD incidence in aged patients. Therefore, the effectiveness of parecoxib in reducing POCD incidence might also be explained by its analgesic activity, which alleviates cognitive deficits.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study that should be mentioned. First, sample size was relatively small to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of parecoxib. No statistically significant difference was found in POCD incidence between both groups at 3-month follow-up, which may result from the reduced sample size. In addition, POCD is a common neurological complication of surgery; therefore, cerebrospinal fluid samples may be more suitable than plasma specimens for assessing proinflammatory cytokines levels. Furthermore, despite randomization, fewer smokers were found in the control group compared with the parecoxib group. It is unknown whether smoking would affect such studies, but it was recently shown that nicotine, the main specific alkaloid in tobacco smoke, does not alter cognitive function.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Ongoing work in our laboratory aims at addressing these issues.</p><p>In conclusion, parecoxib decreased POCD incidence after total knee arthroplasty in elderly patients. Anti-inflammatory therapy and effective postoperative pain control with parecoxib may have benefits in preventing POCD in elderly patients. The current study provides a strong basis for parecoxib use as a prophylactic drug for POCD prevention.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, BMI = body mass index, BMI = body mass index, COX = cyclooxygenase, CRP = C-reactive protein, MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination, POCD = postoperative cognitive dysfunction, VAS = visual analog pain scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Y-ZZ and RY are co-first author.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Steinmetz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lund</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
