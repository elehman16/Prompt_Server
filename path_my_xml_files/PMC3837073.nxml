These abnormalities could lead to cardiovascular/renal complications. Interval hypoxia (IH) (5&#x02013;6 short periods of hypoxia each day over 1&#x02013;3 weeks) was successfully used to improve the adaptation to hypoxia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We tested whether IH over 1 day could initiate a long-lasting response potentially leading to better adaptation to hypoxia. In 15 patients with type 1 diabetes, we measured hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (HCVRs), ventilatory recruitment threshold (VRT-CO<sub>2</sub>), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), blood pressure, and blood lactate before and after 0, 3, and 6 h of a 1-h single bout of IH. All measurements were repeated on a placebo day (single-blind protocol, randomized sequence). After IH (immediately and after 3 h), hypoxic and HCVR increased, whereas the VRT-CO<sub>2</sub> dropped. No such changes were observed on the placebo day. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased, whereas blood lactate decreased after IH. Despite exposure to hypoxia, BRS remained unchanged. Repeated exposures to hypoxia over 1 day induced an initial adaptation to hypoxia, with improvement in respiratory reflexes. Prolonging the exposure to IH (&#x0003e;2 weeks) in type 1 diabetic patients will be a matter for further studies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Diabetes is closely related to impaired function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). As a consequence, autonomic dysfunction can worsen the prognosis of the disease and result in serious complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Assuming that ANS abnormalities such as sympathetic overactivity or reduced cardiorespiratory reflexes might at an early stage be attributed to a functional origin (as they can be favorably influenced by simple functional maneuvers) rather than organic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), they could possibly be reversible by an appropriate intervention. In diabetic patients, low oxygen content (hypoxemia) is common in most organ and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Hypoxia in the blood or tissues is known to induce sympathetic activation, hence, altering cardiovascular reflex tests regardless of neural damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Interval hypoxia (IH) could be a useful strategy to improve hypoxia, since IH has largely been implemented in the adaptation to high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Due to the improved adaptation to hypoxia, IH also improves exercise performance in athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and improves ANS function in various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). IH consists of repeated short periods of hypoxia (5&#x02013;6 min) interspersed by equal periods of normoxia, thus creating a sort of stress that in turn evokes a counterregulatory response by altering the preexisting homeostasis. If adequately administered, sufficient repetitions lead to a persisting supercompensatory (&#x0201c;training&#x0201d;) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and improved response to hypoxia. The use of IH in patients with chronic bronchitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) increased ventilation, oxygen saturation, and chemoreflex activity; reduced hypoxia-dependent sympathetic overactivity; and right shifted the lactate-load curve during exercise as an effect of improved aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). IH also modifies the number of circulating immune cells, due to the links between ANS, immune system, and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In patients with diabetes, abnormal activity of respiratory reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and reduced responses to hypoxia are frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and the immune defense is depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Altogether, these considerations suggest that IH could induce favorable results in diabetes.</p><p>However, as IH has never been applied in patients with type 1 diabetes before, we tested whether a single short bout of IH could elicit favorable changes that improve the hypoxia and the respiratory reflexes and could lead to improved ANS function. In addition, since the responses to hypoxia are multidimensional, we tested its initial effects on the immune system and on the aerobic/anaerobic metabolism at rest by monitoring the lactate production after IH. Finally, we assessed the possible effects of IH on lipid peroxidation and formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), which are markers for cell damage and oxidative stress, respectively, and are generally used when the effects of hypoxia interventions are to be evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the chain of events occurring after one single bout of IH in patients with type 1 diabetes. For this purpose, we examined cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and hematological responses before and at different times after 1 h of IH and followed the changes over the rest of the same day (6 h).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This placebo-controlled single-blinded study was carried out in fifteen patients with type 1 diabetes (2 females and 13 males) without clinical evidence of respiratory disease or definite autonomic abnormalities. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Helsinki, and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethics standards defined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects received extensive information of the study process, and written informed consent was obtained. Inclusion criteria were stable diabetes; absence of infections during the last month; absence of major cardiovascular complications such as coronary heart disease, unstable or stable angina, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and atrial fibrillation; therapy with &#x003b2;-blockers; severe hypertension (&#x0003e;180 mmHg systolic or &#x0003e;110 mmHg diastolic blood pressure); definite autonomic dysfunction; or proliferative retinopathy. Age limit for the selection of subjects was 20&#x02013;45 years. All patients were on insulin treatment. In addition, five patients received antihypertension medications (angiotensin receptor inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and ACE inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). The patients maintained the same therapy during IH and placebo day.

On 1 day, the patients underwent the intermittent hypoxic protocol (hypoxia day), whereas on the other day room air was administered using the same protocol (placebo day). Baseline data were obtained in the morning of each testing day at least 2 h after breakfast. Subjects were advised to abstain from caffeinated beverages for 12 h and from alcohol for 36 h prior to testing. For avoidance of possible learning effects from one day to the other, the sequence of hypoxia or placebo day was randomized. Hypoxic or placebo exposures occurred during 1 h in the morning under standardized conditions after completion of baseline (t1) measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). During the hypoxia day, each hypoxia session consisted of five hypoxic periods (13% O<sub>2</sub> inspired fraction of oxygen) each lasting 6 min, with five normoxic intervals of same duration. During the normoxia day, the breathing program was performed in the same way, but the subjects inhaled normoxic air. On both days, participants were breathing hypoxic or normoxic air through a facial mask during the 1-h protocol. In each session, blood pressure (Finapres; FMS Medical Systems, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (COSMOplus; Novametrix, Wallingford, CT) were continuously measured. In case of a decrease in oxygen saturation &#x0003c;80% or the occurrence of symptoms, hypoxia would have been discontinued until oxygen levels reached at least 80%. A technician regulated and controlled the breathing periods under supervision of a medical doctor in a way that the intervention could not be observed by any patient. Thereafter, three measurement sessions were performed: immediately after (t2), after 3 h (t3), and after 6 h (t4). After t2, each patient obtained an individual meal according to diet requirement that was equal on both testing days. Continuous acquisition of all signals to a personal computer was performed at 600 samples/channel.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Diagram of the study protocol, comprising measurements at t1, t2, t3, and t4.

The major new finding was that IH induces substantial increases in the ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. IH induced also a transient reduction in lactate levels, suggesting improved use of the aerobic pathway. Overall, our findings show potentially useful effects of an approach aimed at improving the adaptation to hypoxia in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>As we investigated the effects of IH in type 1 diabetes for the very first time, we excluded subjects with autonomic complications for safety reasons. In addition, because of the unknown effects of IH in these patients, we considered a single bout of IH an intervention adequate for testing &#x0201c;how&#x0201d; the patients would respond to an exposure to IH. In order to test the achievable response, one needs a full IH protocol (lasting several weeks). The observation that no differences were apparent at baseline during the control and hypoxia day verified the reproducibility of our tests. Altogether, based on the positive directional changes in this preliminary study, larger studies of prolonged duration are justified.</p><sec id="s14"><title>Presence of hypoxia in diabetes.</title><p>Different alterations in diabetes indicate that hypoxia, which may play an important role in the complications of diabetes, is present in type 1 diabetes. In fact, although SaO<sub>2</sub> may remain within normal range, oxygen saturation at rest in diabetic patients is slightly reduced compared with that in healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The importance of this finding should not be overlooked: due to the s-shape of the hemoglobin dissociation curve, a small reduction in SaO<sub>2</sub> in the normoxic range implies a much larger reduction in arterial oxygen pressure. Because the arterial oxygen pressure is the actual input to the peripheral chemoreflexes, any reduction in this variable will induce sustained sympathetic activation. Evidences of hypoxia stem from the evidence of glycosylation of basal membranes in the lungs, leading to lung diffusion abnormalities (reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Skin oxygenation (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) was found to be reduced (though interpreted as insufficient vascular control in several studies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and abnormal blood flow, evidenced by increased venous PO<sub>2</sub> compatible with arterio-venous shunting, was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The decrease in oxygen transport as a result of glycosylation of hemoglobin shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, thus making O<sub>2</sub> release to the tissue difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) is a frequent finding in diabetes. Finally, growing evidence in patients with diabetes indicates impaired responses to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure.</title><p>IH, a technique developed for adapting the body to the consequences of hypoxia, has been applied clinically by Russian physicians to elderly people and to patients with various diseases for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). We have reported improved exercise tolerance in different diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and improved cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Similarly, a positive effect of IH on peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity emerged in healthy people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>The term &#x0201c;intermittent hypoxia&#x0201d; is often linked to OSAS, leading to elevated sympathetic activity (due to diminished oxygen supply to the organs and tissues) and increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In contrast, IH can generate beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). OSAS is actually characterized by very short exposures to hypoxia (approximately 30 s) that arise many times (hundreds) during nighttime, leading to a stress response because of lack of time for a compensatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In contrast, IH is defined by exposures of longer duration (5 min&#x02013;1 h), with less repetitions per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and more time for recovery (&#x0003e;5 min). IH repeated over a few weeks induced an increase in parasympathetic activity and an improvement in BRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (similar to the effects of physical training), whereas OSAS induces sympathetic hyperactivity and reduces BRS (similar to a stress response).</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Alterations of respiratory control.</title><p>Although some investigations did not find alterations in HVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) or HCVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), many studies indicate that ventilatory responses to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) or hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) are decreased in diabetic patients, possibly increasing the risk for severe cardiovascular diseases. In the present investigation, the baseline hypercapnic response was subnormal and VRT-CO<sub>2</sub> was higher than normal. As a consequence, ventilation starts to increase only at higher CO<sub>2</sub>-levels, and the same respiratory stimulus, i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> levels, result in a lower respiratory activity, respectively.</p><p>In this study, IH resulted in an increased activity in both peripheral and central chemoreflexes. Our finding of an evident increase in HCVR initiated by IH concurs with the observation from a previous study evaluating the effects of IH in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), whereas the elevation in HVR is in line with previous findings from a study in healthy subjects, showing an increased HVR after a 2-week intervention of IH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In the present investigation, we were able to show that the first changes already appeared after only one single session of IH. These early changes are compatible with an early adaptation (training effect) of the respiratory system.</p><p>Interestingly, the increase in HVR was possible by virtue of the decrease in VRT-CO<sub>2</sub> observed after the intervention. If VRT-CO<sub>2</sub> remained elevated, then ventilation could not be sustained during hypoxia, due to the consequent hypocapnia. Therefore, a shifting to the left of the VRT-CO<sub>2</sub> enables an increase in the activity of the peripheral chemoreflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This same phenomenon is normally observed (to a greater extent) during the early phases of acclimatization to hypoxia induced by high altitude. Therefore, our findings seem to imitate an adaptive process normally occurring under exposure to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Alterations of the cardiovascular control.</title><p>Generally, impaired cardiovascular control (evidenced by blunted BRS or diminished heart rate variability in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]) is associated with increased morbidity in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Previous findings from our group showed a decreased BRS in patients with type 1 diabetes, which nevertheless increased above normal levels by interventions such as deep breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) or short-term oxygen administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), indicating that these autonomic impairments might be at least at an initial stage of the disease of a functional origin. Similarly, a full IH protocol improved a blunted BRS in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), although a reduction in BRS is normally seen in hypoxia. After one bout of IH, we did not find a reduction in BRS. We cannot exclude that this could be due to the relatively well-preserved autonomic status of our patients. Alternatively, a potential increase in BRS even after the hypoxia could have been suppressed by the insulin treatment in our participants. Insulin is known to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity in turn depressing the vagal arm of the BRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). We observed an increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure immediately after IH exposure. This might be the result of sympathetic stimulation or a direct initial effect of reoxygenation on the arterial endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The fact that we did not show other evidences of sympathetic activation after hypoxia remains compatible with an initial adaptation process and suggests that progression of the intervention might lead to an increased stimulation of the baroreflex and therefore increase the parasympathetic activity, with minor changes or even reduction in blood pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Metabolic and hematological effects of intermittent hypoxia.</title><p>Plasma glucose decreased similarly after intermittent hypoxic and placebo exposure. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find elevations of lactate levels after the IH intervention. Generally, acute exposure to hypoxia is known to increase lactate production owing to anaerobic metabolism and also owing to sympathetic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Conversely, the final effect of a complete IH protocol is a stimulation of the aerobic metabolism that shifts the lactate-load curve to the right during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that the aerobic metabolism could have already been stimulated by IH. According to the short duration of the intervention, erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin content, and hematocrit did not show an increase after the intervention. IH increased relative neutrophil count 3 and 6 h after IH and decreased relative lymphocyte count 6 h from intervention on hypoxia day, indicating a first physiological stress response of the body, an effect typically occurring after physical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and after acute exposure to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the rise in the ratio of neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (in relative values), a measure of physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), did not reach statistical significance over daytime. This might be ascribed again to the very short duration of the intervention performed in our study, and this trend should be confirmed over a full IH protocol. Moreover, sCRP did not change during daytime, suggesting no effect on inflammation. During the placebo day, there was a decrease in the level of MDA in LDL particles over the observation time. Similar reduction was not seen during the intermitted hypoxia. These findings suggest that during IH, there is a moderate increase in lipid peroxidation and formation of free radicals in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A moderate increase in free radicals was suggested to be an important trigger for a counterregulatory response, similar to what was described for physical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Therefore, if repeated a sufficient number of times, IH might induce physiological stress reactions that potentially might be supportive of an increase of the immune defenses of the body similar to that associated with moderate physical exercise training.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Limitations.</title><p>In the current study, we selected patients without clinical evidence of autonomic dysfunction, as this was the first time that IH was tested in type 1 diabetes. The responses to the intervention may thus vary in patients with more advanced disease. A marginal exposure to IH took place on the placebo day as well, as the testing of HVR was performed four times a day on the hypoxia and the placebo day. The oxygen applied to test HCVR might have contributed to the blood pressure changes observed in the present investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Conclusion.</title><p>In conclusion, in type 1 diabetes one single session of IH elicits an initial adaptation in the ANS, showing increased respiratory reflexes. Impaired function of the autonomic system is a common finding in diabetes and might be reversible, at least at an early stage of the disease if originating from a functional impairment. Our findings provide the basis for accomplishing further studies with daily repetitions of IH at a prolonged duration (the IH protocol implemented in our study normally lasts at least 2 weeks) that might strengthen the positive outcome observed with this initial study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The study was funded by the Academy of Finland, the Folkh&#x000e4;lsan Research Foundation, the Wilhelm and Else Stockmann Foundation, the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation, the Sigrid Juselius Foundation, Medicinska underst&#x000f6;dsf&#x000f6;reningen Liv och H&#x000e4;lsa, the Waldemar von Frenckell Foundation, and a special Finnish governmental grant for health sciences research (no. 7301).</p><p>P.-H.G. has received lecture fees from Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, Genzyme, Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, Novo Nordisk, and WebMD and is an advisory board member of Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, and Cebix.
