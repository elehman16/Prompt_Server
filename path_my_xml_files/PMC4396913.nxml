The number of port implantations is increasing due to the development of innovative adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapies. Currently, two different strategies are being routinely used: surgical cut-down of the cephalic vein (vena section) and direct puncture of the subclavian vein. The aim of this trial is to identify the strategy for the implantation of TIVAPs with the lowest risk of pneumothorax and haemothorax.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The PORTAS-3 trial is designed as a multicentre, randomised controlled trial to compare two implantation strategies. A total of 1,154 patients will be randomised after giving written informed consent. Patients must be over 18&#x000a0;years of age and scheduled for primary implantation of a TIVAP on the designated side. The primary endpoint will be the frequency of pneumothorax and haemothorax after insertion of a TIVAP by one of two different strategies. The experimental intervention is as follows: open strategy, defined as surgical cut-down of the cephalic vein, supported by a rescue technique if necessary, and in the case of failure, direct puncture of the subclavian vein. The control intervention is as follows: direct puncture of the subclavian vein using the Seldinger technique guided by sonography, fluoroscopy or landmark technique. The trial duration is approximately 36&#x000a0;months, with a recruitment period of 18&#x000a0;months and a follow-up period of 30&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PORTAS-3 trial will compare two different TIVAP implantation strategies with regard to their individual risk of postoperative pneumothorax and haemothorax. Since TIVAP implantation is one of the most common procedures in general surgery, the results will be of interest for a large community of surgeons as well as oncologists and general practitioners. The pragmatic trial design ensures that the results will be generalizable to a wide range of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial protocol was registered on 28 August 2014 with the German Clinical Trials Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/setLocale_EN.do">(DRKS00004900)</ext-link>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Following further refinement, the technique has been adopted worldwide to create a safe and permanent venous access for chemotherapy (CHT) and/or parenteral nutrition. TIVAPs last longer, have lower infection rates and are more suitable for active patients than external central venous catheters (such as the Hickman&#x000b4;s catheter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The number of TIVAP insertions is constantly increasing. In Germany, 480,176 new cases of oncological diseases were diagnosed in 2010. In 2008, 80,034 TIVAP implantations were performed on in-patients in German hospitals, and it is estimated that more than 101,000 TIVAP implantations were performed in an out-patient setting in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The techniques most often used for insertion of TIVAPs are surgical cut-down of the cephalic vein ((SCD) open strategy), accomplished predominantly by surgeons, and puncture of the subclavian vein ((PSV) closed strategy), performed by surgeons or interventional radiologists. The median primary success rates given in various retrospective studies and a small number of single-centre, randomised controlled trials range from 71 to 94% for SCD, and from 90 to 99% for PSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Common complications, such as kinking or dislocation of the catheter, subcutaneous haematoma, wound infection and nerve palsy, are observed with both techniques; however, specific risks are associated only with PSV, including the &#x02018;pinch-off&#x02019; phenomenon, pneumothorax and haemothorax, which in most cases requires further treatment and often admission to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the literature, the rate of pneumothorax and haemothorax after PSV is reported to be about 3%, ranging up to 6% in prospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, if SCD is successful there is no risk for pneumothorax or haemothorax; however, in some cases implantation via SCD is not possible, so PSV is required to implant the TIVAP. If SCD fails, a rescue technique (RT) can be executed using a guide wire, vein dilator and peel-away sheath through the cephalic vein to overcome narrow vessels or obstructions, thus avoiding PSV and its subsequent risks. Although TIVAP implantation is one of the top 50 (surgical) interventions in Germany, no multicentre trial comparing these two strategies has been performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of the trial</title><p>The PORTAS-3 trial, a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing complication rates of open and closed implantation strategies for insertion of a totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) in oncological patients, is a pragmatic trial that aims at comparing the open strategy (SCD and if necessary RT; if both fail, PSV) to the closed strategy (PSV) with regard to the frequency of pneumothorax and haemothorax.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p>A review of the previous literature, including our own randomised controlled trials, revealed a pneumothorax and haemothorax rate of about 3% for placement of a TIVAP by PSV; however, there is no risk if implantation by SCD is successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SCD was successful in 71 to 94% of cases (including the RT), therefore, about 17.5% of patients underwent PSV as a secondary implantation technique. Thus, the overall risk of pneumothorax and haemothorax for the open strategy is about 0.5% (0.175&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.03). Assuming a difference of 2.5%, a trial with a desired power of 0.9 and a type 1 error of 0.05 would need to include 577 patients per group to detect this difference in pneumothorax and haemothorax frequency when applying a chi-square test. No missing values for the primary endpoint are assumed, so a total of 1,154 patients have to be randomised into the two intervention groups.

In order to achieve comparable intervention groups for known and unknown risk factors, patients will be allocated randomly to the two treatment groups in balanced permuted blocks, and stratified by centre using the central web-based software &#x0201c;Randomizer&#x0201d;, provided by the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation of the Medical University of Graz. To avoid any potential for predicting the group allocation of future patients, the block length is fixed in a separate document that is withheld from the study site. In addition, persons in charge of randomisation procedures as described above will not be able to read or edit the randomisation design chosen within the software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Minimisation of treatment bias</title><p>Prior to study start, staff at all participating centres will be personally trained and introduced to all study-specific procedures during a collaborative investigator meeting. In addition, all procedures will be predefined in a study-specific monitoring manual. Participating centres will be updated on a regular basis to ensure comparable treatment of patients. All centres will use the same TIVAP device (Celsite&#x000ae; Epoxid Port, B Braun Medical, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). Antibiotic prophylaxis will be given to patients at risk of endocarditis according to the local standards and guidelines. In other cases, peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics can be administered at the discretion of the operating surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Minimisation of measurement bias</title><p>Blinding of patients and surgeons is not possible due to the nature of the surgical procedures to be evaluated. However, the chosen primary endpoint is not expected to be prone to measurement bias, as pneumothorax and haemothorax are defined exclusively and can be assessed objectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial treatment</title><p>Since the PORTAS-3 trial is a pragmatic trial comparing two surgical strategies, only the key features of the compared trial treatments will be predefined by the protocol. Apart from these key features, the interventions can be performed according to the individual centre&#x02019;s routine and the surgeon&#x02019;s standard practice. The side for TIVAP implantation will depend on surgeon&#x02019;s or patient&#x02019;s preference. Factors that may influence the choice of implantation side include the following: breast cancer on one side, left- or right-handedness, left or right subclavian vein is occluded by a thrombosis, patient&#x02019;s wish, previous insertion of port catheter and dialysis shunt on the left or right arm.</p><p>All patients will be placed in a 5&#x000b0; reverse Trendelenburg position. Each patient&#x02019;s neck, chest and shoulders will be prepared and draped in the customary sterile manner. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be given to patients at risk of endocarditis according to the local standards and guidelines. In other cases, peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics can be administered upon the decision of the operating surgeon. A study nurse will be present to document the intervention. The intervention will be continued in compliance with the randomisation result.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Intervention group A (open strategy)</title><p>Following the infiltration of local anaesthesia in sterile fashion into the skin and subcutaneous layer, a cutaneous incision will be made over the deltopectoral sulcus region to expose the cephalic vein. The cephalic vein will be ligated distally and encircled cranially with an resorbable suture. The vein will be transected ventrally (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and the catheter, flushed with heparinised saline, will be introduced. If simple SCD is not successful, the RT will be used as a second step. Therefore, catheter insertion will be supported by use of a guide wire (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c), vein dilator and peel-away sheath through the cephalic vein (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The guide wire and dilator will be removed, and the catheter easily introduced through the peel-away sheath, which can be removed afterwards (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

The catheter will be connected to the port chamber. Using the same incision, a subcutaneous pocket will be prepared by blunt preparation on the pectoral fascia. The port chamber will be fixed on the fascia of the pectoral muscle with three single non-absorbable sutures. Wound closure will be performed in accordance with the local standards of the trial centres. Flow for blood withdrawal and infusion will be tested via cutaneous puncture (Huber needle). To complete the procedure, the system will be blocked by means of saline with or without heparin, according to the local standards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Intervention group B (closed strategy)</title><p>Guidance for the puncture by means of sonography, fluoroscopy or the landmark technique is permitted. For fluoroscopy guidance, patients receive a peripheral venous catheter on the side of the planned puncture location to administer the contrast agent and check that the subclavian vein is not obstructed by a thrombosis (roadmap technique). For sonography guidance, a standard ultrasound device can be used to visualise the subclavian vein. The landmark technique uses anatomical landmarks (clavicle, jugular fossa, and so forth) to identify the right position for PSV. Local anaesthesia will be infiltrated in sterile fashion into the skin and periosteum of the clavicle. The location of the puncture will be marked between the proximal and medial third of the clavicle. A skin incision can be performed above the puncture location.</p><p>After that, the subclavian vein will be punctured using the Seldinger technique and a guide wire will be introduced. An introducer sheath will be passed over the guide wire into the vein. The guide wire will be removed and the port catheter introduced through the introducer sheath. Correct position will be checked by X-ray, fluoroscopy or intraatrial electrocardiogram. A subcutaneous pocket will be prepared by blunt preparation on the pectoral fascia through the same incision. Alternatively, a second skin incision can be performed and a subcutaneous pocket will then be prepared bluntly on the pectoral fascia. The port chamber will be fixed on the fascia of the pectoral muscle with three single non-absorbable sutures. Wound closure will be performed in accordance with the local standards of the trial centres. Correct position of the port catheter will be checked again through X-ray or fluoroscopy (tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava just at the level of bronchial bifurcation). Flow for blood withdrawal and infusion will be tested via cutaneous puncture (Huber needle). To complete the procedure the system will be blocked by means of saline, with or without heparin, according to local standards.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Primary and secondary endpoints</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The primary endpoint will be the frequency of post-interventional pneumothorax and haemothorax. Pneumothorax and haemothorax will be defined as the presence of air or blood in the pleural space, respectively. The rate of pneumothorax and haemothorax will be assessed two hours post-implantation by means of a chest X-ray (in inspiration) by the responsible physician if PSV was performed. In the event that SCD with or without RT is successful, a chest X-ray will be performed only in patients with suspicion or symptoms of pneumothorax or haemothorax (for example dyspnoea), since SCD has no associated risk of these conditions.

Any amendments will be submitted to all of the IEC. The IEC will also be informed of the end of the trial.

However, only few randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and no multicentre trials compared these techniques for their potential risks and benefits. The aim of the PORTAS-3 trial is to compare a primary open strategy (SCD with RT if necessary; PSV if the aforementioned fail) to a primary closed strategy (PSV; SCD if PSV fails) in regard to the frequency of post-operative pneumothorax and haemothorax, with the hypothesis that the open strategy is able to significantly reduce the risk of pneumothorax and haemothorax occurrence.</p><p>The PORTAS-3 trial is designed as a pragmatic trial, since the objective is to depict the real medical treatment situation. Therefore, just some key steps of the interventions are predefined, and the rest can be performed according to local practice of the centres. For instance, in PSV either sonography, fluoroscopy or anatomical landmarks can be used for guidance of the puncture. Some authors suggested that sonographic guidance should be the method of choice for vascular cannulation due to improved safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Even though ultrasound is widely available nowadays, this still does not represent comprehensive clinical practice in a lot of hospitals, and a recent Cochrane review on ultrasound guidance for subclavian vein catheterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] could only show a reduced risk of arterial cannulation, and no reduction for other complications like pneumothorax and haemothorax.</p><p>The results of the PORTAS-3 trial will be applicable to a wide range of patients and could influence future guidelines and decision-making. Healthcare costs might be reduced by the reduction of complications and necessary treatment and hospitalization for these complications. Furthermore, required treatment of patients (for example, with CHT) will not be delayed by potential complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>The PORTAS-3 trial has already started recruitment of patients in November 2014 and recruitment is currently ongoing and is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2016.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec37"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_643_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
