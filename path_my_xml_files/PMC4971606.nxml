Treatment assignment was generated via a permuted-block randomization algorithm; eligible patients were randomized on the day of surgery (day 1) prior to TTP. All external auditory canals and middle ears were liberally irrigated with saline prior to drug treatment and TTP.

For younger patients, the caregiver were willing to comply with the protocol and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act documents before initiation of any trial-related procedures and provided written informed consent. Key exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) designation for any other concurrent surgery; (2) history of mastoid surgery, sensorineural hearing loss, chronic or recurrent bacterial infections (not including recurrent OM), tympanic membrane perforation, or known immunodeficiency disease; (3) abnormality of the tympanic membrane or middle ear; (4) topical nonsteroidal otic agents within 1 day of randomization; (5) topical or otic corticosteroid within 3 days of randomization or a systemic corticosteroid within 7 days of randomization; (6) topical or systemic antimicrobial or antifungal agents prior to approximate washout intervals; (7) concurrent use of oral anti-inflammatory agents; (8) history of allergy to ciprofloxacin or any of the components of OTO-201; and (9) menarcheal or postmenarcheal female.</p><p>An MEE culture specimen was tested at a central laboratory, and the remaining middle ear fluid was aspirated from each ear.
