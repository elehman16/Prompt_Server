Routinely, postoperative nasogastric decompression was performed until the nasogastric drainage is minimal, reoccurrence of bowel sounds, and passing flatus. However, prolonged nasogastric intubation is associated with complications such as basal atelectasis due to poor cough reflux, loss of electrolytes, and increased patient morbidity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In the recent decades, many studies conducted found that prolonged postoperative nasogastric decompression does not have benefits in terms of patient recovery and postoperative complications and started to believe that NT is used unnecessarily and is kept <italic>in situ</italic> for too long. A number of studies conducted with or without tube showed that there is no change in the recovery period and postoperative morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the need for routine use of nasogastric decompression in patients undergoing elective bowel surgery and to compare this practice with a group of patients in whom similar operative procedures had been performed but who did not receive routine nasogastric decompression in terms of time for return of auscultatory bowel sounds, acceptance of first oral feed, duration of hospital stay, and incidence of complications associated with both methods.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim</title><p>To evaluate the need for routine use of nasogastric decompression in patients undergoing elective bowel resection and anastomosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Objectives</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Methods</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in this study. All patients who underwent elective bowel resection and anastomosis in our hospital were randomized by serial randomization. The study group mandated NT removal at immediate postoperative period or in the recovery room. Patients were stratified by age, sex, and type of procedure, and serial randomizations were performed by taking every alternate case into study and control groups. The control group required NT removal based on traditional criteria. This criterion included that the patient pass flatus, return of bowel sounds by auscultation in the right iliac fossa, absence of emesis, and no increasing abdominal discomfort. All patients were preoperatively inserted with a 16-Fr NT and secured by plaster to the nose after documenting position in the stomach by auscultation. All patients were given liquid diet after removal of NT and were advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Descriptive statistics: The descriptive procedure displays univariate summary statistics for several variables in a single table and calculates standardized values (<italic>Z</italic>-scores).

The mean age of the patients recruited in the different groups was comparable. There were 19 male and 31 female patients in the study group and 18 male and 32 female patients in the control group. The age ranged from 18 to 75 years in our study, which was statistically comparable between the two groups. The surgical procedures were stratified into three groups, which included small bowel resection, large bowel resection, and other procedures [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Other procedures included choledocojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis. The time of removal of NT in the study group was constant, whereas it varied in the control group depending on auscultatory finding of bowel sounds and passage of flatus. The time of removal of NT in the control group ranged from 2 to 6 days.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics and general considerations of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JSTCR-7-37-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The postoperative day when the first bowel sound was heard was noted in the patients of two groups.

Four patients in our study group and one patient in the control group required reinsertion of NT due to persistent vomiting, anastomotic leak, and abdominal distension.

The time of first bowel sound heard by auscultation was 2.02 days in the study group and 2.96 days in the control group. The time of first heard bowel sound was earlier in the study group. Similar results were found with Cheadle <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] where patients were randomized into four groups. Group l had NT and received placebo, Group 2 had NT and received cimetidine, Group 3 had no NT and placebo, and Group 4 had no tube and received placebo. The first bowel sounds were heard 3.20 days in no tube group and 3.6 days in tube group. The study group tolerated oral feeds earlier, i.e. 3.12 days (1&#x02013;4 days) when compared to the control group 3.70 days (2&#x02013;6 days). When compared to a meta-analysis published by Key and Sawyers,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] where selective nasogastric decompression (NT placed only when required) versus routine nasogastric decompression, the selective group accepted oral feeds 3.52 days and 4.59 days, respectively. Tanguy <italic>et al</italic>. has concluded routine gastric decompression neither hastens the return of bowel function nor diminishes the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Wolff <italic>et al</italic>., though reported an increase in the incidence of nausea and vomiting in their patients, concluded that routine nasogastric decompression is not warranted.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The duration of hospital stay was less in our study group (15.26 days) compared to control group (17.04 days).</p><p>All the patients were discharged when the surgeon felt that the patients were fit for discharge. In some patients, the hospital stay was prolonged due to postoperative wound or pulmonary infections. Most of the patients in our control group complained of discomfort and unpleasant sensation due to the tube in the nose, and they also complained of inability to bring out the sputum and difficulty in coughing due to the tube <italic>in situ</italic>. The tube <italic>in situ</italic> also causes lax lower esophageal sphincter which in turn results in increased reflux and higher chances of aspiration. Perhaps, this was the main reason for increased incidence of complications. In the control group, four patients had pneumonia, one had vomiting, one patient ended with anastomotic leak, one patient developed septicemia, and two had an electrolyte imbalance. Only three patients had vomiting, one anastomotic leak, and two patients had abdominal distension which leads to postponement of oral feeds. In Cheadle <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] study with similar group of patients, five patients in no tube group and eleven patients in the tube group had pneumonia. Colvin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Racette <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported significant increases in gastric distention over the intubated control group, and Wolff <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a similar increase in the incidence of nausea and vomiting in their patients. In the study group patients, the expenditure during hospital stay was also reduced due to less intravenous drugs and fluids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, our findings indicate that the prophylactic use of NT decompression offers no patient benefit that would offset the discomfort and potential morbidity associated with its use, and it can therefore be safely omitted as a routine adjunct to bowel surgery. Decompression can be reserved only for patients who require treatment for persistent symptoms postoperatively, thereby sparing the vast majority this unpleasant treatment measure.</p><sec
