periodontal disease during the second trimester of gestation on adverse pregnancy
outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Pregnant patients during the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> trimesters at
antenatal care in a Public Health Center were divided into 2 groups: NIG &#x02013; "no
intervention" (n=17) or IG- "intervention" (n=16). IG patients were submitted to a
non-surgical periodontal treatment performed by a single periodontist consisting
of scaling and root planning (SRP), professional prophylaxis (PROPH) and oral
hygiene instruction (OHI). NIG received PROPH and OHI during pregnancy and were
referred for treatment after delivery. Periodontal evaluation was performed by a
single trained examiner, blinded to periodontal treatment, according to probing
depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI) and sulcular
bleeding index (SBI) at baseline and 35 gestational weeks-28 days
<italic>post-partum</italic>. Primary adverse pregnancy outcomes were preterm
birth (&#x0003c;37 weeks), low birth weight (&#x0003c;2.5 kg), late abortion (14-24 weeks)
or abortion (&#x0003c;14 weeks). The results obtained were statistically evaluated
according to OR, unpaired t test and paired t test at 5% significance level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No significant differences were observed between groups at baseline examination.
Periodontal treatment resulted in stabilization of CAL and PI (p&#x0003e;0.05) at IG
and worsening of all periodontal parameters at NIG (p&#x0003c;0.0001), except for PI.
Significant differences in periodontal conditions of IG and NIG were observed at
2<italic>nd</italic> examination (p&#x0003c;0.001). The rate of adverse pregnancy
outcomes was 47.05% in NIG and 6.25% in IG. Periodontal treatment during pregnancy
was associated to a decreased risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes
[OR=13.50; CI: 1.47-123.45; p=0.02].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Periodontal treatment during the second trimester of gestation contributes to
decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Periodontal diseases</kwd><kwd>Preterm birth</kwd><kwd>Low birth weight</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Infections may play an important role in prematurity<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. After establishing
that ascending genitourinary infections are associated to 50% of preterm birth<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, other infections remote from
fetal-placental unity were regarded as a potential role for preterm birth as
well<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>Recently, periodontal disease was associated to preterm birth or low birth weight
(PLBW)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> by bacterial translocation through blood circulation or
production of inflammatory mediators<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> associated with the onset of delivery<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. However some studies observed no
influence of periodontal disease on PLBW based on clinical findings<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Most of these were undertaken in low
social-educational level patients, and predominantly blacks, who are at increased risk
for both periodontal disease and preterm birth<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Offenbacher, et al.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (2006) reported
that an increased risk of preterm or low birth weight would be related to the
progression of periodontal disease during pregnancy or to the prior existence of severe
periodontal lesions. These findings confirmed the results of other clinical<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and laboratorial studies<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, suggesting that patients with severe
and generalized periodontal disease or progressive disease during pregnancy would be
more susceptible to develop adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>In an attempt to establish a clear correlation between periodontal disease and PLBW,
some studies evaluated the effects of controlling periodontal infection during early
phases of pregnancy on pregnancy complications outcome, resulting in a decrease of
PLBW<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>The Brazilian Health Department has recently proposed a protocol that should be followed
by all public Health Care Units aiming at a better attention to the pregnant and the
newborn during ante-natal care and immediately after birth, in order to reduce the high
rates of mother and newborn mortality and morbidity<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, oral health was not contemplated in this protocol. In
spite of improvement in antenatal care in well developed countries, no significant
changes in preterm birth or low birth weight could be observed<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Considering that, the aim of this study was to evaluate
if the treatment of periodontal disease during early stages of pregnancy would
contribute to a reduction in the rate of PLBW in a Brazilian sample population
participating of an experimental antenatal health care program that included periodontal
treatment and education in oral health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Bauru School of Dentistry-USP Ethics Committee
prior to commencement and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior
to participation (#102/2002). The clinical trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT 00893802). All pregnant women participating at an
Antenatal Care Program at Jardim Redentor I Public Health Center from August 2001 to
August 2002 were invited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were confirmed
singleton gestations between 9 and 24 weeks in healthy women 16-39 years old. Exclusion
criteria included non-confirmed pregnancy, age inferior to 16 years or superior to 39
years, multiple gestations, smoking, alcohol or drugs abuse, history of congenital heart
disease, current use of corticosteroids or antibiotics, and the presence of systemic
conditions that would pose a risk for the mother or the baby, such as diabetes,
hypertension, or genitor-urinary infections.</p><p>Sample size was initially established at approximately 150 patients, based on the number
of pregnant women regularly attending the Public Health Center. However, from this
total, 65 patients refused to participate in the study or did not return for baseline
examination. From the remaining 85 patients, 52 were at the third trimester and could
not be included in the study, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>, resulting in 33 patients allocated to the different groups.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the controlled clinical
trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-19-02-0130-g01"/></fig><sec><title>Obstetrical and maternal data</title><p>Patients filled out a health questionnaire in order to evaluate general health
conditions, past and current medical and dental history, and obstetric conditions, in
order to control for most of the known risk factors for preterm delivery. Demographic
data, such as age, marital status, and educational level, as well as history of
previous preterm birth, abortion, late abortion, number of children born alive, and
current pregnancy information were recorded. Prenatal care included a minimum of 6
visits during pregnancy up to delivery, blood pressure measurements, dietary
consultation, evaluation of weight gain, laboratorial tests to investigate anemia,
white blood cell and platelet counting, infectious diseases (e.g., HIV,
tuberculosis), urine tests and ultra-sound examinations performed at the
12<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup> and 32<sup>nd</sup> weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>All patients (n=33) entering the study at the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
trimesters were invited to participate in an oral health program included in the
ante-natal care program. This oral health program included community lectures to
inform the mother about oral diseases, such as caries lesions and periodontal
disease, and the possible role of periodontal disease in preterm birth and low birth
weight. Other measures included personal oral hygiene instruction, caries diagnosis
and treatment, and evaluation and treatment of periodontal conditions during the
second trimester. Patients that agreed in receiving non-surgical periodontal
treatment before 28 weeks of pregnancy composed the <italic>"intervention
group"</italic> or IG (n=16). Patients who did not agree in receiving non-surgical
periodontal treatment during pregnancy composed the <italic>"no intervention
group"</italic> or NIG (n=17).</p><p>Patients included in IG received a non-surgical periodontal treatment consisting of
scaling and root planning (SRP), professional prophylaxis (PROPH) and oral hygiene
instruction (OHI). Patients included in NIG only received PROPH and OHI and were
referred for caries and periodontal treatment after discharge. Periodontal treatment
for those who needed was performed by a single trained periodontist and consisted of
mechanical supra and subgingival SRP with Gracey curettes (Hu Friedy, Chicago, IL,
USA), PROPH and OHI. Treatment of caries lesions was performed by restorative
dentistry specialists at Bauru School of Dentistry, after referral.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical examination</title><p>Patients were evaluated by a previously trained single examiner, different from the
one who performed periodontal treatment and unaware of this condition, according to
pocket probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), sulcus bleeding index
(SBI) and plaque index (PI). All patients were examined using good illumination and
standardized conditions. PD, CAL and SBI were recorded from four sites
<italic>per</italic> tooth (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal and lingual) with a
15 mm periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy), except for third molars. The occurrence of
bleeding on probing was observed until 15 s after removal of the probe from sulcus
and recorded as present (1) or absent (0), as proposed before<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The presence of plaque in the
incisal/occlusal, buccal, lingual, mesial and distal aspects of each tooth except for
3<sup>rd</sup> molars was recorded as (1) and its absence as (0)<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. SBI and PI were obtained by the sum
of all measurements divided by the number of sites investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Periodontal reevaluation</title><p>Reevaluation of periodontal clinical parameters was performed by a single blinded,
previously trained examiner, according to the criteria defined at baseline
examination. Reevaluation periods were defined by the consults established by the
physician, which took place at the day of delivery and at first<italic>
post-partum</italic> visit, which took place after 7-15 days after birth.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of pregnancy outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome measures recorded were preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery
&#x0003c;37 weeks; low birth weight (LBW), defined as &#x0003c;2,500 kg birth weight; preterm
birth and low birth weight (PLBW); late abortion (14-24 gestational weeks); and
abortion (&#x0003c;14 gestational weeks). Gestational age was calculated based on the
first day of the last period by the physician and nursery staff, followed by
confirmation with ultra-sound and physical examinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) of preterm (&#x0003c;37 weeks), low birth (&#x0003c;2.5
kg) or preterm and low birth weight in IG and NIG were statistically evaluated using
the PACOTICO software (Discipline of Biostatistics, Bauru School of Dentistry, USP,
Bauru, SP, Brazil). Comparison of the periodontal conditions between groups at
baseline and post-operative examination, birth weight and duration of gestation was
performed by unpaired <italic>t</italic> test for PD and CAL and Mann Whitney for SBI
and PI by using GraphPrism 5.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA), at a 95% confidence level. Intra-group analysis of treatment effects was
performed by paired t-test, at a 95% confidence level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 33 patients were included in the study. IG was composed by 16 patients

PLBW<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, recent studies failed to find this
association<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Some studies associated periodontal disease with
adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as late abortion<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> or
preeclampsia<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>The control of periodontal disease during pregnancy, as in this study, would contribute
to a decrease in adverse pregnancy outcomes, which has been established in other
large<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and small<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> sample population
clinical trials already described in the literature, conferring the best risk
indicator<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. However, a very
recent study including 757 patients randomly assigned to active treatment (scaling and
root planning; n=378) and control (polishing; n=379) suggested that non-surgical
treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy did not significantly reduced the risk
of spontaneous premature delivery (SPTD) at &#x0003c;35 weeks of gestation, but rather
increased the risk of SPTD in patients receiving active treatment<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, other reports<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> in literature have suggested that
treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy, although not hazardous to the mother,
does not reduce the rates of premature delivery.</p><p>These conflicting results may pose a question if active treatment of periodontal disease
during pregnancy is beneficial to both mother and baby, and would really contribute for
a decrease in the rates of premature birth and low birth weight. Vettore, et
al.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (2006) concluded, in a
systematic review on periodontal disease as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy
outcomes, that there is a clear heterogeneity between studies concerning measurement of
periodontal disease and selection of type of adverse pregnancy outcome. In addition to
that, most studies did not control for confounders, thus raising serious doubts about
their conclusions.</p><p>One possible reason for misleading results in case-control and controlled clinical
trials could be attributed to the existence of multiple risk factors for preterm birth
or low birth weight, many of which are common to periodontal disease<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Because of that, it was proposed that large sample population
studies should be performed to investigate the influence of periodontal disease in
preterm low birth weight, excluding the influence of other recognized risk factors, such
as infection of ascending urinary tract or preeclampsia<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>A limitation of this study is related to the small sample size. Although 150 patients
were initially assessed as eligible, 65 refused to participate and 52 were at the third
trimester, when periodontal treatment should not be performed<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The main
reasons for refusal or exclusion were: necessity of taking care of the children (60%),
getting back to work (20%), and fear of being treated during pregnancy or missing
scheduled visits (20%). The allocation of patients to IG or NIG was based on the
agreement of patients in receiving non-surgical periodontal treatment before 28 weeks of
pregnancy, after oral information of its importance and reading of the informative
letter. Those who did not agree in receiving non-surgical periodontal therapy during
pregnancy constituted the NIG, meaning that no treatment was performed during pregnancy.
Those who agreed in receiving non-surgical periodontal treatment constituted IG, meaning
that periodontal treatment was performed before 28 weeks of gestation. Sadatmansouri,
Sedighpoor and Aghalloo<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (2006) also
conducted a clinical trial in 30 pregnant women from 18-35 years presenting moderate or
severe periodontitis who were randomly assigned to a "no treatment" (n=15) or
"treatment" group (n=15), showing a 26.7% rate of PLBW in untreated patients and no
preterm birth or low birth weight at treatment group.</p><p>In the antenatal care program attended by the patients, risk factors that could result
in preterm birth or low birth weight were under control by an interdisciplinary team,
including the physician, dietary consultant, psychologist, and nursery staff. The
innovation of our study was introducing a specialized dental treatment during pregnancy,
contributing to improve health conditions of the mother. Considering that, the possible
influence of periodontal disease in adverse pregnancy outcomes could be evaluated
independent from other risk factors, which may be considered as a positive aspect of our
study.</p><p>When performing small-size clinical trials, the general features of test and control
groups should be strictly the same in order to warrant that a specific risk factor is
under evaluation without the influence of other recognized variables<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, such as maternal height and weight, age
&#x0003c;15 years or &#x0003e;39 years, low economic and educational level, stress, anxiety,
excess of physical activity, smoking, alcohol or drugs abuse, absence of antenatal care,
number of previous children born alive, number of previous abortion, late abortion or
preterm low birth weight. In the present study, general characteristics of the sample
were strictly the same at baseline examination, being in agreement with those
requisites.</p><p>A worsening of periodontal conditions in both treated and untreated groups was observed
in this study. However, statistically significant differences were observed at IG in PD
and SBI, with no significant changes in CAL and PI. The facts that periodontal
conditions of NIG at the second examination were significantly worse than those of IG
and had worsened from baseline measurements, suggest that a worsening in periodontal
conditions is expected as pregnancy develops<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, especially in low
educational and economic level patients<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, periodontal
care during pregnancy could limit this worsening.</p><p>Other large sample population research have also suggested that periodontal treatment
result in improvement or stabilization of periodontal conditions and a decrease in PLBW
rates<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Periodontal
treatment consisted of non-surgical therapy performed at the second trimester along with
mouthwashing with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution decreased PLBW rates<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, while the association of non-surgical periodontal therapy and
metronidazole resulted in no improvement<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The absence of periodontal treatment in patients showing inflamed
sites during pregnancy, as suggested in the present study, can be considered as a risk
factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes [OR=13.50, CI: 1.47-123.75; p=0.02], since
untreated patients showed a significant worsening of periodontal conditions during
pregnancy.</p><p>This is especially important if one assumes that periodontal disease progression during
pregnancy is strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Bleeding on probing reflects ulceration
of periodontal pocket epithelium, which could in turn reflect a systemic marker that
represents tissue invasion and systemic dissemination of periodontopathic
bacteria<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a temporal relation
between exposure measures and outcome should be considered, meaning that clinical
attachment level represent cumulative history of periodontal disease of the individual
throughout life, influencing development of systemic diseases that requires prolonged
exposure to risk factors, such as cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. On the other hand, probing depth measurements and
bleeding on probing reflects current disease status and would be more informative of
recent consequences, requiring acute exposition to the risk factor, such as adverse
pregnancy outcomes<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In the
present study, IG showed significantly less bleeding sites and shallower periodontal
pockets close to delivery or shortly after birth along with a 6.25% rate of adverse
pregnancy outcomes, while NIG showed a 47.05% rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, as in
other studies<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although these findings seem to be relevant, especially because other risk factors for
preterm birth and low birth weight were controlled, larger sample populations should be
evaluated in order to establish a treatment protocol for pregnant women. The inclusion
of specialized dental treatment during antenatal care should be considered in order to
improve health conditions of the mother and the baby.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>These findings suggest that performing periodontal treatment during the second trimester
of gestation would decrease the risk of development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, which
could imply that periodontal disease can be considered as a risk factor for adverse
