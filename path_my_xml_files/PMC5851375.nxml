amenorrhea resulting from permeant cessation of ovarian function, the last of life after
menpouse tearmed as postmenpoausl period in female life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean age of the menopause in Egyptian females is 46.7<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The premenopausal stage in which there is a
change in ovarian function begin before the final menses by several years, some symptom
begin before menopausal stage and persist for up to 5&#x02005;years in post-menopausal period. These
symptoms affect cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system and produce
vasomotor changes and metabolic disturbances<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some women experience no symptoms at all, other than the cessation
of the menses. Hot flushes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, occur
in about 80% of the menopausal females, hot flushes can lead to insomnia, irritability,
fatigue, and mood swings<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hot flushes defined as transient, recurrent periods of heat sensation and redness, often
associated with sweats, increase in skin temperature, the most affected areas of the face,
neck, head or breast these symptom may result from decline in estrogen concentration and
high gonadotrophin levels<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used as a
medical treatment for alleviating menopausal symptoms, but many women report adverse side
effects when taking HRT, common side effects include breast tenderness, bloating, bleeding
and breast cancer in some cases<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Non-pharmaceutical treatment as exercises, acupuncture, reflexology are progressively used
to treat menopausal symptom as hot flushes insomnia, psychological upset. They may be
perceived as natural and safe methods of treatment than medications<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aerobic exercise has been used in management of a variety
of medical disorders associated with menopausal women as hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,
fibromyalgia, and diabetes, hot flushes and depression<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, continues aerobic activites improved female&#x02019;s quality of life,
decrease sensation of fatigue, less incidence of depression and irritability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Laser acupuncture is form of phototherapy considered as a simple noninvasive alternative to
metal needles for the stimulation of acupuncture or musculoskeletal trigger points and
recommended as a treatment method of menopausal symptoms and other gynecological
conditions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is commonly termed
&#x0201c;Laser Acupuncture&#x0201d; to distinguish it from the wider therapeutic applications of laser<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> No study has yet compared between the
effect of aerobic exercise and laser acupuncture in treatment of hot flushes. Thus, the aim
of this study was to investigate which modality gives better results in treating hot
flushes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, single-blind, pre&#x02013;post-test,
controlled trial. A convenient sample of 48 postmenopausal females were recruited from Kafr
el sheikh university hospital, outpatient clinic of obstetrics and gynaecology department.
They were enrolled and assessed for their eligibility to participate in the study. Their age
ranged from 45 to 55&#x02005;years. After a brief orientation session about the nature of the study
and the tasks to be accomplished, they were randomly assigned into two equal groups (group
(A) and group (B)) by a blinded and an independent research assistant who opened sealed
envelopes that contained a computer generated randomization card. No subjects dropped out of
the study after randomization. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
before the baseline evaluation. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review
board at Faculty of physical therapy, Cairo University before study commencement with number
P.T.REC/012/001650. The study followed the Guidelines of Declaration of Helsinki on
conduction of human research. The study was conducted between October 2015 and December
2016. The inclusion criteria were participants age ranged from 45 to 55&#x02005;years old; complain
from recurrent hot flashes, and had body mass index (BMI) ranged from 30 to
32&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were excluded if they had diabetes, hypertension,
cardiac diseases and no history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorder. Participants
were randomly assigned into 2 equal groups, groups (A) received aerobic exercises 3 sessions
per week for two months. Each session were 40 mins walking, (divided into 10 mins warming
up, 20 mins exercise and 10 mins cooling down). Exercise was at 60&#x02013;70% HR max as HR max=220
&#x02212; Age<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Group (B) received laser
acupuncture on of laser acupoints The patient was in a comfortable, supine position. After
the skin was routinely disinfected and the acupoints were carefully localized, (Sanyinjiao
(sp6), Hegu (LI.4), Quchi (LI.11), Fengchi (GB.20.), Guanyuan (CV 4.) and Fuliu (KI7)) of
both sides, Infrared laser diode will be applied 90 sec/each point, with wave length 904&#x02005;nm
and power output 5 mill watts. Three sessions per week for two months<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The level of Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured by lab analysis of blood as primary outcomes before
and after treatment in both groups. As well as, the severity of hot flushes recorded by
patient in hot flushes dairy card and calculated as the mean of three days record before
treatment and three days record after the end of the treatment period. The responses were
subjectively assessded and classified into: None (disappearance of hot flushes): no symptoms
remain after treatment and no recurrent by the following up visit, mild (very few hot
flushes): symptoms have improved, but a few mild hot flushes each lasting less than one
minute, moderate: symptoms are largely alleviated but the patient may still have frequent
attaches hot flushes each lasting 1&#x02013;4 minutes, and severe: the symptoms remain
unchanged<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) program version 22 for
Windows. The sample size (48 patients) was calculated to yield an 90% power, effect
size=0.827 calculated from unpublished pilot study on 12 participants (6 in each group)
considering FSH and LH as a primary outcomes and &#x003b1;=0.05. Prior to final analysis, data were
screened for normality assumption and presence of extreme scores. This exploration was done
as a pre-requisite for parametric calculation of the analysis of differences and of
relationship measures. Normality test of data using Shapiro-Wilk test was used, this ensures
that the data is normally distributed for FSH and LH and not normally distributed for
menopausal daily hot flush scale (MDHS). Therefore, 2 &#x000d7; 2 Mixed design MANOVA was used to
compare the FSH and LH at different tested groups and training periods. Also, non-parametric
statistical tests in the form of Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests was used to compare MDHS between
pre and post treatment for each group and Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare it between
both groups at both measuring periods. The alpha level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05) between subjects in both

which affect the psychological state of females and make difficulties of managing them
during day-to-day activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main
cause is the decline in oestrogen concentrations, leading to instability of the hypothalamic
production<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. At menopause the ovary
stops to produce the ova and there is no secretion of estrogen and progesterone, the
pituitary gland secretes more FSH and LH to stimulate the ovary, which consider as one of
causes of hot flushes<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In present study, the results showed significant reduction in FSH, LH and improvement of
hot flashes dairy card in both groups after treatment in relation to before treatment values
and statistically significant lower values of FSH, LH and hot flushes daily card at group A
after treatment in comparison to group B. This study results came in accordance with
Moilanen et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, who examined the
impact of aerobic exercises on 176 post-menopausal women with hot flushes, anxiety, and
changes in mood. Aerobic activity for 6 months showed improvement in menopausal symptoms.
The superior improvements that were recorded in the aerobic exercise group may be
attributable to the exercise increase hypothalamic &#x003b2;-endorphin production, which play role
in normalize thermoregulation which disturbed during menopausal hot flushes<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the exercises were preferred by
many women as a natural method without side effects<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elavsky et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
stated that regular and long-term aerobic training improve the vasomotor symptoms and
physical fitness. Also, Fox<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> has shown
that active individuals have higher basal levels of &#x003b2;-endorphins than those who with
sedentary life because; exercise may stabilize the thermoregulatory center and decrease the
risk of hot flushes, also exercise improve mental health outcomes by providing a distraction
or decrease anxiety and enhance psychological feeling. In addition, there is evidence that
as increase level of endorphins, the frequency and amplitude of LH hormone decreases, which
regulate gonadotropin releasing hormone levels<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, aerobic training has the potential to increase
serotonin in the brain<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Serotonin is an
important neurotransmitter for emotional correction<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results agree with Mohamed et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, who stated that regular aerobic exercise assisted with
soy products appears is an effective, safe and successful alternative method to decrease hot
flushes and improves quality of life in postmenopausal women. Despite the intergroup
superior effect of aerobic exercises, the laser acupuncture group also exhibited significant
intragroup improvements. These improvements are attributable to acupuncture stimulate and
release neurochemicals, such as &#x003b2; endorphins, enkephalins, and serotonin Thus, it is central
to the production and treatment mania-depression, dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder,
pre-menstrual syndrome and anorexia<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Also, acupuncture alters the opioidergic neurotransmission activity in the brainstem,
thalamus, hypothalamus, and/or pituitary<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, acupunctures regulate the autonomic nervous system.
According to the site of stimulation, acupuncture can alter sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous system response<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results
agree with Elshamy<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> who concluded that
that laser acupoints are effective and can be used as an alternative treatment to decrease
the frequency and severity of postmenopausal hot flushes. The findings of the study may be
limited by psycho physiological and cultural issues and the the lack of follow-up for
postmenopausal hot flushes in both groups for several months&#x02019; after rehabilitation program
to evaluate the long lasting effect. In conclusion this study shows that a 8-week program of
an aerobic exercises yields improvement in FSH, LH, and decrease in severity of hot flushes
assessed by hot flush dairy card than laser acupuncture in the treatment of postmenopausal
hot flashes.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chattha</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Raghuram</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Venkatram</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Treating the climacteric symptoms in Indian women with an
