In this proof of principle study, using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design, we explored the effects of intranasally administered insulin (40IU) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and perfusion in older (60-69 years, n=11) and younger (20-26 years, n=8) adults. Changes in CBF through the major cerebropetal arteries were assessed via phase contrast MR-angiography, and regional cortical tissue perfusion via pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling. Total flow through the major cerebropetal arteries was unchanged in both young and old. In the older participants, intranasal insulin compared to placebo increased perfusion through the occipital gray matter (65.2&#x000b1;11.0 mL/100g/min vs 61.2&#x000b1;10.1 mL/100g/min, P=0.001), and in the thalamus (68.28&#x000b1;6.75 mL/100g/min versus 63.31&#x000b1;6.84 mL/100g/min, P=0.003). Thus, intranasal insulin improved tissue perfusion of the occipital cortical brain region and the thalamus in older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intranasal insulin</kwd><kwd>cerebral blood flow</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>phase contrast MR angiography</kwd><kwd>continuous arterial spin labelling (CASL)</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral blood flow is pivotal for providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain to maintain brain function. The brain is a highly metabolically active organ but has only limited possibilities for energy storage. Thus, cerebral blood flow is important because the brain depends on constant and regulated blood supply to function properly. With aging, pathophysiological changes occur in large arteries causing decreased ability of large arteries to absorb and dampen pulsatile blood flow, eventually leading to pulsatile stress and arterial stiffness [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Transmission of increased pulsatile stress to the brain microvasculature is thought to lead to increased microvascular brain damage via altered dampening of pulsatile blood flow in cerebral arteries, and is considered a contributing factor for some cerebrovascular diseases [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Insulin influences all aspects of human physiology, including central regulation of energy homeostasis, cognitive functions and neuronal activity [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The central regulation of energy homeostasis involves a complex neuronal network, which comprises the hypothalamus, the thalamus as well as cortical brain structures. Insulin and its signaling have been consistently linked to aging, lifespan and longevity [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Aging is associated with reduced insulin action in peripheral tissues and possibly in the brain. Reduced insulin action in the aging brain may relate to age- associated cognitive defects and anomalies of metabolic homeostasis and an accelerated pace of aging [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent data suggest that insulin is also a vasoactive modulator that regulates peripheral and cerebral blood flow, possibly via a direct vasodilatory effect [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Reduced insulin action has been associated with vascular impairment possibly via impaired insulin- mediated augmentation of endothelium- dependent vasodilation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and/ or excessive free fatty acids release from adipose tissue [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>When administered in humans via the nasal route, insulin has been shown to distinctly alter brain functions, without being absorbed into the blood stream or having direct systemic effects on peripheral blood glucose or insulin levels [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, the nasal route provides a safe and effective way of conveying insulin to the brain to specifically modulate brain insulin action and exert beneficial effects.</p><p>In this proof of principle, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effects of intranasal insulin administration on cerebral blood flow and perfusion in healthy older and young adults.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

We found no effect of intranasal insulin application on total quantitative flow, or on flow in the basilar, left or right carotid arteries, in either young nor older adults. However, region specific analysis indicated that intranasal insulin application increased perfusion in the occipital gray matter region and in the thalamus in older adults.</p><p>Due to the presence of direct pathways from the nasal cavity to the CNS, insulin can be delivered non- invasively rapidly to the CNS through the intranasal route without spilling over to the periphery. The intranasal route of insulin administration thus bypasses uptake into the bloodstream and so circumvents the risk of systemic hypoglycemia that is associated with peripheral administration. We found that blood glucose and insulin levels did not change after intranasal administration. This is in line with previous studies that show that plasma glucose concentrations remain unchanged after intranasal application of 40IU insulin [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It further strengthens the fact that intranasal administration can safely be used for selectively increasing cerebral insulin levels.</p><p>One of the regions where insulin becomes readily available is the cerebral cortex, which is bathed by CSF, to which intranasally administered insulin has direct access [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There is evidence of bulk flow transport of peptides through extracellular pathways from the nasal cavity to the CNS, including cerebral cortex, gray matter and other parts of the CNS, via both olfactory and trigeminal pathways [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the upper nasal cavity, olfactory neurons are exposed such that their axons project through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb. When inhaled, insulin accesses the CNS parenchyma either through the cribriform plate along the olfactory neurons or through perivascular channels associated with the olfactory or trigeminal systems [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In literature, different studies have used varying doses (10, 20, 40, 60 IU or 160IU) of insulin to elicit effects on CBF. In our study, we used 40IU of insulin. This dose was chosen based on the instrument that we used for insulin delivery. We used the ViaNase intranasal insulin device, which had been specifically designed to maximise drug transport to the central nervous system after delivery to the olfactory region. This device has been used extensively in literature, usually at a dose to of 20IU or 40IU of insulin, and has been shown to elicit beneficial effects on various endpoints, both in healthy persons and patients with Alzheimer's disease [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have been performed to study the effect of intranasal application of insulin on regional blood flow in the brain. A recent study done in eight healthy young adults found no effect of 160IU intranasal insulin application on cerebral blood flow in the visual cortex, neither at baseline nor when cerebral blood flow was measured after specific tasks [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, another study that was performed in a larger group of participants (25 lean, 10 overweight and 23 obese persons) of unspecified age found that 160IU intranasal insulin led to CBF decrease in the hypothalamus [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, we found no effect of intranasal insulin application on flux in the major vessels, neither in young healthy men, nor in older men. It is possible that we missed a small effect of insulin on CBF because of the limited number of subjects in our study. Furthermore, since the positive finding in the aforementioned study was after administration of 160IU of insulin, it is possible that our dose of 40IU did not increase insulin concentration in the CNS sufficiently enough to effect changes in CBF.</p><p>While quantitative flow in the major arteries did not increase after intranasal application of insulin, we found that after intranasal insulin application, tissue perfusion was increased in the thalamus and in the occipital cortex (by 6.5%) in older adults. An increase of 4.3% was also found in parietal cortex in older adults, but which did not reach significance after strict correction for multiple comparisons. The occipital lobe is the visual processing center. It contains mainly the visual cortex and the ventral stream of vision that enables ability to focus on motor actions in response to outside stimuli. Next to the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including proprioception, mechanoreception, and visuospatial processing. The posterior parietal cortex, also referred to as the dorsal stream of vision, receives somatosensory and/or visual input that can be transmitted to motor signals. In a previous study done in 48 subjects with a mean age of 24 years, perfusion was increased in the insular cortex, an area closely related to the parietal cortex, after intranasal insulin administration [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Somewhat similar to the parietal cortex, the insular cortex also integrates information from other sensory modalities and contains topographically organized visceral sensory representation. We also observed that intranasal insulin application increased perfusion of the thalamus. The thalamus receives information from almost all sensory systems and relays the information to associated cortical areas. From literature, increased cerebral blood flow has been linked to vasodilatation around the active area due to increased energy demand [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Also, insulin has been shown to be a vasoactive modulator that regulates peripheral and cerebral blood flow possibly via a direct vasodilatory effect [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Taken together, our finding of increased perfusion in some brain areas would support the hypothesis that intranasal insulin application might restore energy demand and neuronal activity in these regions [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>This exploratory study is the first placebo-controlled, cross- over study in older and young adults showing that intranasally administered insulin increased regional perfusion in the occipital brain region and in the thalamus of older adults, as measured with a non- invasive ASL technique. Strength of our study is the cross-over design in which the participants were their own controls, thus minimizing the confounding effects of between- person differences. Moreover, both the young and older participants were included with strict in- and exclusion criteria. Thus, the characteristics of adults in both the young and older participant groups were homogenous, making them comparable within the group. On the other hand, this study has some limitations. It is limited by its sample size, especially of the younger age group, and the inclusion of males only. Thus, we cannot rule out that insulin has effect on many other brain areas, since several previous studies have demonstrated that insulin had beneficial effects on brain function including memory, cognition [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and brain mediated functions such as postprandial thermogenesis and other metabolic profiles [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, other brain regions could have gone undetected because of the small sample size. We also cannot exclude the possibility that effects of intranasal administration of insulin may be sex specific. Indeed, sex-specific effects of intranasal administration of insulin have been observed for other endpoints, including reduction of body weight [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is also a limitation that the clinical significance of the observed increases in CBF remains to be determined. Taken together, larger sufficiently powered studies are needed to delineate the exact effects of insulin on cerebral blood flow and perfusion in both the cortical brain regions and in subcortical structures in both males and females and in both young and older adults and to relate these to clinically significant outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study titled &#x0201c;Maintaining health in old age through homeostasis: Switchbox Phase II&#x0201d; was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Leiden University Medical Center under protocol P13.164 and the Dutch competent authority (Centrale Commissie Mensengebonden Onderzoek (CCMO)) with protocol code number NL45043.058.13.

This study was aimed at examining the effects of intranasal insulin on circulatory metabolic and endocrine parameters, as well as on resting and functional brain activities using MRI, in older and young adults. Fourteen elderly and nine young relatively healthy men (age criteria 60-85 years for older adults and 18-35 years for young adults), with a body mass index (BMI) between 20 kg/m2 and 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited from the general population. Exclusion criteria included fasting plasma glucose above 7 mmol/l, anemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c; 7.1 mmol/l), presence of anatomic deviations of the nose, any significant endocrine, neurological and cardiovascular diseases, or use of medication known to influence lipolysis, thyroid function, glucose metabolism, GH/IGF-1 secretion or any other hormonal axis. Furthermore, persons with a current smoking or alcohol addiction or history of substance abuse were excluded. Of the 23 participants that were contacted via telephone, three (older) participants were excluded after screening. The reasons for exclusion were uncontrolled high blood pressure (n=1) and renal insufficiency (n=2). Of these, all participants except for one (young) successfully completed the study. The reason for the drop-out was phobia for cannulas/ blood withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Randomization, masking and intervention</title><p>Randomization was carried out by the pharmaceutical trial coordinator, while the researchers were blinded to what the participants received. Concealment of treatment allocation was ensured by delivery of trial medication in a standard plain vial (same for all treatment groups) that had been prepared and re-labelled by the hospital pharmacy. De-blinding was done at the end of the study.</p><p>The study interventions consisted of intranasal application of 40 IU insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Mainz, Germany) or placebo (Sterile saline), delivered using the ViaNase Electronic Atomizer (Kurve Technology inc.). The ViaNase device had been specifically designed to deliver drugs to the olfactory region to maximize drug transport to the central nervous system. The device released a metered insulin (40 IU) or saline dose directly into the subject's nostrils. A total volume of 0.4 mL (0.2 ml per nostril) was administered, which was inhaled by breathing evenly over a 2-minute period. In both right and left nostril, two doses each were delivered resulting in a total insulin dose of 40 IU. This method allowed administration of smaller particle sizes to increase drug deposition in the upper nasal cavity without transporting the drug to the lungs [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>For the current study, results from two study visits, spaced apart by a week, on one of which they received insulin and on the other placebo, in a randomized manner were compared.

A catheter was placed in a vein of the forearm of the non-dominant hand. First, a baseline venous blood sample was collected in a serum-separator (SST)-tube. Thereafter, every 10 minutes, 4 ml of blood was collected into a SST-tube and 2 ml into K3-EDTA tube. Ten minutes after the first blood withdrawal, the trial medication (placebo or 40 IU of insulin) was administered intranasally, under the supervision of the experimenter, with a ViaNase Electronic Atomizer. Participants were asked if they noticed a specific smell or noticed something about the applied treatment. However, participants were not informed that the smell could be associated with the treatment and therefore would remain unaware of the applied intervention. We checked this by questioning the participants of the awareness of the treatment condition and this did not coincide with the actual applied treatment after de-blinding of the study. About 20 minutes after the intranasal application, participants were transferred into the MRI for the scanning procedure (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
