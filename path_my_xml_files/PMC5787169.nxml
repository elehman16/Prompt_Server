None of the dogs had received any prior treatments with drugs affecting platelet function for a minimum of 2 weeks before to the start of the study. The health status of the dogs was confirmed by physical examination and CBC, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and coagulation profile (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen concentration) using standard methods in the Animal Health Laboratory, University of Guelph. Dogs were housed at a laboratory facility and transported by motor vehicle to the Ontario Veterinary College on testing days. Dogs were fed a dry canine maintenance food twice daily and had free access to water. Animal use was approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee.

Drugs were compounded to individual doses based on body weight by the Pharmacy of the Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Center. Drugs were administered at approximately the same time each morning. Dogs were observed at the time of dosing for any abnormal behaviors, which were recorded on individual forms. The investigators and the technicians administering the drugs were blinded to the intervention received by each dog until the end of the study. Drugs were administered in a randomized crossover design. A washout period of 14 days occurred between phases.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0011"><title>Blood Sample Collection</title><p>Blood collection was performed after a 12&#x02010;hour overnight fast. For each phase of the study, blood samples were collected before treatment (T0) and after 7 consecutive days of treatment (T7), which began the following day (T1). The order of blood collection was randomized at the first visit (toss of a coin), and that order was maintained throughout the study. At every visit, 2 blood samples were collected. Before blood collection, the hair was clipped over venipuncture sites, and topical lidocaine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1010">8</xref> was applied. The first sample was collected by left jugular venipuncture using a 20&#x02010;ga Vacutainer<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1011">9</xref> set and vacuum tubes. Blood was collected into tubes in the following order: 1 &#x000d7; 3&#x02010;mL serum tube (for biochemistry profile on the first visit only, discarded on the following visits), 4 &#x000d7; 1.8&#x02010;mL 3.2% citrate tube (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen on the first visit only, PFA&#x02010;200), 1 &#x000d7; 4&#x02010;mL heparin tube (MP, clopidogrel and aspirin drug metabolite concentrations), and 1 &#x000d7; 2&#x02010;mL EDTA tube (CBC, baseline platelet count for PW). Every tube was agitated 4 times by inversion and then allowed to rest until analysis. A second blood sample was collected by right jugular venipuncture using a 6&#x02010;mL plastic syringe and 20&#x02010;ga needle. The needle of the syringe was removed, and 1 mL of blood was transferred into each PW agonist tube (which does not contain a vacuum) in the following order: ADP tube, collagen (COL) tube, and AA tube. The tubes were agitated by inversion following the manufacturers&#x02019; recommendations: 15&#x02013;20 times for all tubes, followed by rest until analysis for the ADP tube; 5 times every minute until analysis for the COL tube, and 1 time every 8&#x02013;10 seconds for 2 minutes followed by rest until analysis for the AA tube. For all venipunctures, quality (graded 1&#x02013;3; 1 = no redirection, 2 = 1&#x02013;2 redirections, 3 = 3&#x02013;4 redirections) and stoppage of blood flow (graded 1&#x02013;3; 1 = no stoppage, 2 = very brief stoppage, 3 = substantial stoppage) were recorded. A blood smear prepared from the EDTA sample was examined for platelet clumping. A maximum of 20 mL of blood was collected from each dog at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0012"><title>Platelet Function Testing</title><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0013"><title>Multiplate</title><p>The agonists ADP,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1012">10</xref> COL,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1013">11</xref> and AA<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1014">12</xref> were used. Agonist solutions were prepared according to the manufacturers&#x02019; recommendations by adding 1 mL distilled water to a lyophilized agonist stock. The agonists were stored at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C for a maximum for 4 weeks (ADP and AA) or at 4&#x000b0;C for a maximum of 7 days (COL). The test was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 300 &#x003bc;L of 0.9% NaCl solution preheated to 37&#x000b0;C was added in the test channel. The heparin tube was agitated 4 times, and 300 &#x003bc;L of blood was added in the test channel. After 3 minutes incubation and stirring at 37&#x000b0;C, 20 &#x003bc;L of agonist was added to the diluted sample to a final concentration of 6.5 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP, 3.2 &#x003bc;g/mL COL and 0.5 mmol/L AA. The aggregation was measured for 6 minutes, which resulted in the generation of 2 curves (measured by 2 independent sensor units), and results were displayed as area under the curve (AUC) and expressed in units (U). If Pearson's correlation coefficient was &#x0003c;0.98 or if the difference of each curve from the mean was &#x0003e;20% (both automatically calculated by the MP), the analysis was repeated. Following the manufacturers&#x02019; recommendations, all samples were analyzed between 30 minutes (min) and 3 hours (h) after venipuncture.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0014"><title>PFA&#x02010;200</title><p>The cartridges P2Y,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1015">13</xref> COL/ADP<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1016">14</xref> (CADP), and COL/Epinephrine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14886-note-1017">15</xref> (CEPI) were used. The cartridges were stored at 4&#x000b0;C and allowed to warm to room temperature in their pouches before usage. The citrate tubes were agitated 4 times before each analysis, and 800&#x02013;900 &#x003bc;L of blood was pipetted into the different cartridges. At the beginning of the study, 800 &#x003bc;L was used, following the manufacturer's recommendations. However, during the course of the study, it was noted that a &#x0201c;no closure, maximum syringe travel&#x0201d; message was sometimes generated before reaching the limit of measurement of the analyzer, which is 300 seconds. Examples of such results would be &#x0003e;270 and &#x0003e;280 seconds. This was thought to be due to an insufficient amount of blood in the cartridge, and following additional manufacturer's recommendations, the amount of blood was increased to 900 &#x003bc;L during the last phase of the study. For results that reached &#x0201c;no closure&#x0201d; before reaching the upper limit of 300 seconds, the maximum number reached was used for analysis (e.g, 270 seconds if &#x0003e;270 seconds was obtained). The A Channel was used for all analyses; the order of analysis was as follows: P2Y, CADP, CEPI. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate; duplicate analyses were performed sequentially. The time required to close the aperture was recorded as the closure time (CT). For CADP, a reference interval of 45&#x02013;109 seconds previously had been determined at our institution's laboratory using PFA&#x02010;100.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> If a sample error message was recorded (e.g, flow obstruction), the sample was analyzed a third time.

The order of analysis was as follows: COL tube, AA tube, ADP tube, and EDTA tube. Platelet count in each tube was obtained in duplicate before the next tube was analyzed. Because of the longer time of analysis with the impedance&#x02010;based hematology counter, the platelet count was first measured once with that machine, then in duplicate with the optical&#x02010;based hematology counter, and finally a second time with the impedance&#x02010;based hematology counter. Platelet aggregation (% Agg) was calculated as follows: (EDTA platelet count &#x02212; agonist platelet count)/EDTA platelet count &#x000d7; 100. All samples were analyzed within 30 minutes of venipuncture.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0016"><title>Drug Metabolite Concentrations</title><p>Heparinized blood obtained on days 0 and 7 of each phase was centrifuged within 10 minutes of blood collection, and serum was kept frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Using a more strict definition for treatment response and considering the stronger criteria only for each classification (&#x0003e;50% decrease in baseline for MP and PW; CT &#x0003e; 300 seconds for PFA), the tests that detected drug response most consistently were as follows: for aspirin, PW AA (6/6); for clopidogrel, MP AA (4/6), MP ADP (6/6), PFA P2Y (6/6), PFA CADP (4/6), PW AA (6/6), and PW ADP (5/6); and for combination therapy, MP COL (4/6), MP AA (5/6), MP ADP (6/6), PFA P2Y (6/6), PW AA (6/6), and PW ADP (6/6).</p></sec><sec id="jvim14886-sec-0025"><title>Drug Metabolite Concentrations</title><p>In the aspirin and combination treatment groups, the median salicylate concentration was 0 &#x003bc;g/mL for dogs before receiving aspirin (range, below the limit of quantification of 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL to 1.11 &#x003bc;g/mL) and 1.33 &#x003bc;g/mL for dogs after receiving aspirin (range, below the limit of quantification to 3.69 &#x003bc;g/mL).

Results obtained with both hematology counters were similar for PW. Although the manufacturer's recommendations are to use impedance&#x02010;based platelet counts, our study shows that it is valid also to use optically based platelet counts in dogs, as has been previously reported in cats.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>
</p><p>Although significant results were obtained for several tests when examining mean values obtained at T0 compared to T7, results were variable for individual dogs for some of those tests. Tests for which every dog's individual results followed the changes in the mean result included MP ADP with clopidogrel and combination therapy; PFA P2Y with clopidogrel or combination therapy; PW ADP with clopidogrel or combination therapy; and PW AA with all treatments. Drug metabolite concentrations were assessed to evaluate if individual differences could have been due to problems with drug administration or decreased absorption of the drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, or if they were truly due to individual differences in platelet response to those drugs. Drug metabolite concentrations confirmed that all dogs received and absorbed the drugs. However, drug metabolite concentrations could not explain the variation observed in platelet function test results. This finding may be a consequence of individual differences in response to those drugs, individual responses to platelet agonists, or because the inactive metabolites are not good surrogate markers of the active drugs.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>
</p><p>The true definitions of aspirin or clopidogrel resistance in humans are not well described. Different definitions of resistance have been proposed, including clinical resistance (defined as the occurrence of thromboembolism despite antiplatelet medication) and laboratory resistance (defined as the failure of antiplatelet medication to inhibit platelet function as assessed by in vitro methods).<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> None of the 6 dogs in this study had laboratory resistance, because response to therapy could be confirmed in all cases by changes in at least 1 test result (i.e, all dogs had a decrease % Agg &#x0003e; 50% with PW AA regardless of treatment group). However, some dogs&#x02019; test results were inconsistent. For example, for dog 5, postaspirin AA % Agg decreased &#x0003e;50%; but this dog's PFA CEPI postaspirin CT did not reach &#x0201c;no closure&#x0201d;. For dogs 4 and 5, postclopidogrel AA % Agg and ADP % Agg decreased by &#x0003e;50%, their PFA P2Y CT reached &#x0003e;300 seconds, and their MP ADP decreased by &#x0003e;50%; but both dogs&#x02019; PFA CADP post&#x02010;treatment CT did not reach &#x0201c;no closure&#x0201d; nor did their results go above the upper limit of the reference interval. Some of the tests that detected a treatment response consistently for all dogs, such as PW AA, or PFA P2Y for clopidogrel, may be too sensitive and may reach the upper limit of that test with clinically subtherapeutic drug concentrations in the animal. Such a test may only be useful to confirm owner compliance with administration and absorption of the drug. Such a test also may be useful to suggest risk for clinical aspirin or clopidogrel resistance if that test fails to detect a response. Alternatively, some of the tests that detected a treatment response infrequently, such as MP ADP for aspirin and MP COL and PFA CEPI for clopidogrel, may be too insensitive. The most useful test may be 1 that shows a graded response, which then can be correlated to clinical therapeutic response in future longitudinal studies. A combination of different tests, with different sensitivities to detect antiplatelet drug effect may be required to predict an acceptable decrease in risk for thrombosis.</p><p>Drug metabolite measurements were used as surrogate markers of plasma drug concentrations. For aspirin, salicylate was used because aspirin itself has a very short plasma half&#x02010;life, which made its measurement logistically unfeasible for our study, and a validated assay was not available. Two of the dogs had measurable salicylate concentrations at T0. Laboratory, pharmacy, and animal facility records were reviewed in an effort to identify clerical, analytic, or medication errors, and none were identified. However, the platelet function test results for these dogs at T0 were not consistent with aspirin effect; therefore, it is believed that the salicylate concentrations are erroneous. For clopidogrel, the inactive metabolite SR 26334 was measured as a surrogate marker. This was done because the parent drug and active metabolite usually are not detectable in plasma with currently available assays.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> However, the metabolic pathway for clopidogrel activation has not been characterized in dogs, and it is possible that plasma concentrations of SR 26334 do not correlate with concentrations of the clopidogrel active metabolite.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Recently, stabilization of the clopidogrel active metabolite and quantification using high&#x02010;performance liquid chromatography in cats have been described.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> If developed in dogs, this technique may better assess clopidogrel concentrations in the future.</p><p>For most of these tests, no reference interval has been established in dogs. This makes it more challenging to assess a dog's response to therapy. Previous studies have used different ways to assess response to therapy, such as a significant change in the mean from baseline,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> a CT &#x0003e; 300 seconds for PFA,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> or a CT &#x0003e; upper limit of the reference interval.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> For PFA CADP, a reference interval of 45&#x02013;109 seconds previously had been determined at this institution's laboratory using PFA&#x02010;100,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> and was used in our study to help classify responders versus nonresponders. No reference interval was available for any of the other platelet function tests evaluated. A previous study<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> performed at our institution evaluated biologic variability of different platelet function tests, including MP (COL, AA, ADP agonists) and PFA (CAPD, CEPI cartridges), and indicated that use of population&#x02010;based reference intervals was inappropriate for most platelet function tests because of high biologic variability. Based on that study, the authors suggested that subject&#x02010;based reference intervals may be more appropriate. This is consistent with what was observed in our study. Baseline results obtained with PFA CEPI, for example, ranged between 78 and 295 seconds. In the study that evaluated biologic variability, results obtained with PFA CEPI ranged between 54 and 300 seconds,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> and in another study performed at the same institution, results obtained with that same platelet function test ranged between 62 and 300 seconds.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>
</p><p>The aspirin dosage chosen for our study is a common antiplatelet dosage.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> A previous study performed at this institution indicated that 1 mg/kg/d was the lowest dosage that inhibited platelet function as assessed by PFA&#x02010;100 and optical aggregometry.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> However, a recent report suggested that an aspirin dosage of 2 mg/kg may be more reliable for platelet inhibition.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> In that study, the 2 mg/kg dosage resulted in a mean decrease in maximum amplitude of 81.3% with turbidimetric aggregometry and a CT &#x0003e;300 seconds in 62.5% of dogs with PFA&#x02010;100, compared to 41.3% and 25%, respectively, for an aspirin dosage of 1 mg/kg. Therefore, the dosage used in our study may have been insufficient to cause maximal inhibition of platelet function.</p><p>The agonist concentrations for MP used in our study were those recommended by the manufacturers. Several studies have optimized MP impedance aggregometry and have described different agonist concentrations.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Analyses performed using a wide range of concentrations showed that a maximum attainable aggregation response was obtained with 10 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP, 5 &#x003bc;g/mL COL, and 1 mmol/L AA.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> However, maximum aggregation response is not necessarily desirable because it can lower diagnostic sensitivity.<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> For this reason, the agonist concentrations used in our study were those currently recommended by the manufacturer for human platelets.</p><p>The PW manufacturer recommends that all agonist tubes be analyzed within 10 minutes of venipuncture. This could not be achieved in our study because the samples had to be agitated in a precise manner and then physically transported to the laboratory (about 6 minutes), then analyzed in duplicate using 2 different hematology counters. Samples were analyzed at a median of 10 minutes for COL, 16 minutes for AA and 23 minutes for ADP, with no sample being analyzed &#x0003e;29 minutes after venipuncture. A previous study in cats<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> showed that the ADP % Agg was stable up to 30 minutes after venipuncture, but decreased significantly between 30 and 60 minutes. Pilot studies performed at our institution (data not shown) suggested that the same was true for dogs, with a significant drop in ADP % Agg observed between 30 and 45 minutes postvenipuncture. However, further data obtained after completion of this study indicated that in some dogs significant spontaneous disaggregation may occur after 10&#x02013;15 minutes (data not shown). No data are available for COL or AA in dogs or cats. Because COL is considered by the manufacturer to be the most susceptible to spontaneous disaggregation, it was decided to analyze the COL sample first, which allowed obtaining a median time to analysis of 10 minutes. However, some results were analyzed up to 18 minutes after venipuncture. This may explain in part why results obtained with this agonist were less consistent both among dogs and duplicate samples. Because AA is considered by the manufacturer to be a weaker agonist than ADP, the AA samples were analyzed before the ADP samples. The times to analysis for AA also were longer than recommended by the manufacturer. It is not known how much the delays in time to analysis for AA and ADP affected magnitude of responses, but they did not decrease the ability of the AA assay to detect aspirin or clopidogrel effects (100%) and of the ADP assay to detect clopidogrel effect (100%) and did not appear to decrease the precision of the assays. It is not known if the delay in analysis decreased the ability of ADP to detect aspirin effects. Further studies are warranted to determine the maximum time to analysis that can be used for the different agonists, but such a time constraint may render this test less usable in some clinical settings. Pending such studies, it is recommended that the time to analysis be as short as possible and consistent pre&#x02010; and post&#x02010;treatment.</p><p>A slight change in protocol was adopted for PFA during the third phase of the study after it was noted that a &#x0201c;no closure&#x0201d; message was sometimes generated before reaching the maximum of 300 seconds. The amount of blood loaded in the cartridge was increased to 900 &#x003bc;L, which allowed the acquisition of more precise data. However, several results obtained before this change of protocol lacked precision because the analyzer stopped measuring the CT before complete closure and before the limit of 300 seconds was reached. Examples include results such as &#x0003e;270 seconds, where the actual result is known to be above 270 seconds, but a more precise result could not be obtained. For some or all of those results, the limit of 300 seconds may have been obtained if the blood sample volume had been sufficiently large to allow completion of the analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the maximum number reached (e.g, 270 seconds if &#x0003e;270 seconds was obtained) but also was repeated after all results that reached no closure before attaining 300 seconds were converted to 300 seconds to investigate if this would have impacted our results. No difference was noted in the significance of results.</p><p>Consideration needs to be given to the small number of dogs included in this study. Because of the strong treatment effect, which was expected with MP, PFA, and PW with some agonists based on previous studies,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> a power calculation showed that 4 dogs would be enough to detect a significant difference with a power of 0.8. This proved to be accurate, but it is possible the study was underpowered to detect more subtle effects.</p><p>Dogs used in our study were all healthy Beagles. As described previously,<xref rid="jvim14886-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> platelet function test results may vary among different breeds, and results obtained in our study may not directly apply to different breeds or to dogs with clinical diseases that may affect platelet function.</p><p>In conclusion, all 3 platelet function tests were useful to detect aspirin and clopidogrel effect in some dogs. More dogs receiving clopidogrel showed an increase in PFA CT using the P2Y than the CADP cartridge. Plateletworks using AA was the only test that detected all drug effects in all dogs. Results obtained with both hematology counters were similar for PW. All platelet function tests used in our study may be useful for monitoring antiplatelet response in dogs treated with aspirin or clopidogrel, but additional studies are needed to determine the optimal tests and agonists for use in dogs with different diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim14886-sec-0027"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>
