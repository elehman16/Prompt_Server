Sildenafil is well-tolerated drug and is readily available as an oral preparation. This is helpful to the patients of PAH as their symptoms do not warranty continuous IV infusions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In our institution, sildenafil is routinely used postoperatively; therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the efficacy of sildenafil in controlling post-operative pulmonary hypertension in children undergoing cardiac surgeries for ventricular septal defect (VSD) correction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval by the hospital ethical committee and parental consent, we recruited 60 paediatric patients with VSD with PAH due for corrective surgery from October 2012 to March 2014 in this randomized control trial. The presence of VSD and PAH was confirmed by a two-dimensional echocardiography, and the value of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was assessed by cardiac catheterization. Patients included in the study were those who had systolic PAP &#x0003e;35 mmHg or mean PAP &#x0003e;25 mmHg with large VSD and low Qp:Qs (pulmonary blood flow:systemic blood flow) along with high pulmonary vascular resistance. Attempts were made to determine the reactivity of pulmonary vasculature by administering 100% oxygen in patients with mean PAP &#x0003e;35 mmHg. Patients with associated congenital heart defects other than VSD and any genetic syndrome were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Group 1 (placebo) received pre-operative placebo and post-operative sildenafil while Group 2 (sildenafil group) was administered pre- and post-operative sildenafil. The nurses administering the drugs were blinded to the intervention for either group. Sildenafil (0.5 mg/kg) or equivalent volume placebo was administered 6 hourly orally or by nasogastric tube for 1 week before surgery. Postoperatively, sildenafil was administered at 0.5 mg/kg 6 h and increased to 1 mg/kg 6 hourly over the next 2 days and further continued till 15 days during which the patients were followed for complications after the surgery. Drug was prepared by one of the coinvestigators. In the post-operative period, sildenafil was administered intravenously (0.5mg/kg every 6 hrs) for the first 24 h and then switched to orogastric route through the Ryles tube and this was common for both the groups. Measurements such as systolic, diastolic and mean PAP, systemic arterial pressures (SAPs) (systolic/diastolic/mean) and oxygen saturation were recorded during intraoperative period, and PAP/SAP ratios were calculated before and after the correction of the VSD (within 10 min of the correction). Pressure monitoring device was set-up similar to the arterial line (invasive blood pressure) setup device, and a sterile pressure monitoring line was handed over to the surgeon who then inserted a needle in the pulmonary artery and attached it to the pressure monitoring line. The Pulmonary Artery pressures were measured pre- and post-repair of Ventricular Septal Defect (Primary Outcome being the mean PAP). The technicians noting down the pressures and nurses in the ICU were blinded to the intervention. Demographic data, type of congenital heart disease (CHD), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), aortic cross-clamping, duration of surgery, duration of ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, sepsis and mortality (30-day mortality) were also noted in the two groups (Secondary Outcomes). Pulmonary hypertensive crisis was diagnosed when any patient experiencing pulse oximetry desaturation (&#x0003c;70%), hypotension (&#x0003c;60/30 mmHg), tachycardia followed by bradycardia (&#x0003c;30/min) and ST-segment changes on ECG in the post-operative period, in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography:[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Institutional anaesthetic protocols along with all necessary monitoring were used. The surgery was conducted on CPB using moderate hypothermia (core body temperature of 32&#x000b0;C). Cardioplegic arrest was achieved with St. Thomas cardioplegic solution. After completion of surgery, patients were weaned off CPB, with inotropic and vasoactive drug support, so as to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 50 mmHg. The patients were shifted to the cardiac ICU with endotracheal tube <italic>in situ</italic> and electively ventilated. The trachea was extubated when the patient met the extubation criteria.</p><p>All statistical analysis was done using SPSS 17.0(IBM- USA). For comparing non-parametric categorical data between groups, Chi-square test was used. To compare means between two groups, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no difference in the demographic variables such as age, gender, height and weight in the two groups as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The post-CPB pulmonary artery pressure difference was highly significant between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) which means that the use of sildenafil in patients in the pre-operative period along with post-operative period reduces pulmonary artery pressures much more than in patients where it is used in post-operative period only. Few studies have proved the beneficial effects of sildenafil in reducing PAH.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>One of the main challenges to deal with in paediatric cardiac surgery is pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease. The conventional management requires the need of special delivery systems for the administration of iNO, the need to maintain continuous IV drug infusions and inadequate response to conventional therapy, is costly and not barred of side effects. In contrast, sildenafil is available in oral forms, is well tolerated with no patient withdrawal and limited side effect profile.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The study also aimed at evaluating mortality, morbidity and ICU stay in the two different groups.</p><p>Many studies have proved the effectiveness of sildenafil in the treatment of PAH of different aetiologies in adults. It lowers PAP and PVR, and it improves cardiac output, exercise tolerance and functional capacity.</p><p>The efficacy of sildenafil in controlling PAH in paediatric age group with CHDs was reported by many authors. Zeng <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] determined a significant improvement in exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics in terms of PVR and pulmonary blood flow in patients with PAH secondary to atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus. These findings were compatible with many other studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Based on so many encouraging results, we began our study on two groups, sildenafil and control group in both preoperative and postoperative period in the Indian population. Because there is no recommended dose schedule in the paediatric age group, we based our doses on the current available literature.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Both groups were similar in terms of clinical features, demographics, baseline pulmonary artery pressures, CPB time and aortic cross clamp time. El Midany <italic>et al</italic>. in 2013, while doing a similar study, found no significant difference in CPB and aortic cross-clamp time.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The pre-CPB intra-arterial pressure difference between the two groups is statistically significant for the mean arterial pressure values. This is can be explained by the effect of sildenafil on systemic pressures where it can lead to some amount of hypotension as seen in another study, and also explains the use of pulmonary artery/aortic ratio for the comparison.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Incidences of post-operative pulmonary hypertensive crisis were present but similar in both the groups. In Group 1, only one patient had three episodes of pulmonary artery hypertensive crisis whereas, in Group 2, two patients had two episodes each of pulmonary artery hypertensive crisis. Although the difference was not statistically significant, there were a fewer number of pulmonary hypertensive crisis episodes in sildenafil group. Chaudhari <italic>et al</italic>. reported a case in 2005 in which sildenafil helped in recovery from pulmonary hypertension crisis episode in a neonate with severe PAH. Long-term sildenafil also leads to complete resolution of PAH.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>No sepsis was reported in any of the patients in either of the two groups. Mortality difference in between the two groups was also not found significant.</p><p>In our study, difference of post-operative duration of ventilation in between the two groups remained statistically insignificant. However, post-operative ICU stay was significantly longer in Group 1 patients than in Group 2 patients. A similar study was performed by Palma <italic>et al</italic>. on 38 children with moderate-to-severe PAH who underwent cardiac surgery, and they reported shortened CPB time, mechanical ventilation time and lengths of ICU and hospital stay.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Our study has demonstrated a marked effect of pre- and post-operative sildenafil administration on mPAP as reflected by the progressive significant decrease of the mPAP from baseline to pre-CPB to post-CPB in both the groups. These results are similar to the study conducted by Nemoto <italic>et al</italic>., who demonstrated the efficacy of sildenafil in lowering pulmonary artery pressure and preventing crisis in the post-operative course after various types of congenital cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Our study fills the gap in the current literature by adding more positive results of sildenafil in reducing pulmonary artery pressures effectively when used both pre- and post-operatively.</p><p>Evidence exists for the association between sildenafil and various systemic adverse effects, which have included the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, visual and central nervous systems.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, in our study, we did not encounter side effects of sildenafil therapy. Similar results were reported by many studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Like all studies, our study also has some limitations that include relatively fewer patients, limited resources, no long term follow up and no PAP measurements in the postoperative period by echocardiography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
