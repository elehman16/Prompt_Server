Measurements of inflammatory factors [Hs-CRP, sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM, and interleukin 6 (IL-6)] and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were made at baseline, 4 hours after first juice consumption and after one month of juice consumption.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The percent changes of FMD were significant in both groups in the short- and long-term.

This setting of cardiovascular risks contributes to early atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction and has been recognized as a marker for this process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Because weight loss is difficult, alternative low risk strategies for intervention to improve this setting are needed. For example, exercise improves endothelial function in the absence of or only with modest changes in body mass index.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> It is well documented that some natural antioxidants such as polyphenols have acute beneficial effects on endothelial function. However, all previous studies have confirmed such effects among elderly patients with chronic diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Studies among children with hyperlipidemia have documented improvement of endothelial function by antioxidant therapy using supplementation of vitamins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the effects of natural antioxidants on surrogate markers of early stages of atherosclerosis in children. This study was designed to determine the acute and chronic effects of fruit juices, rich in anti-oxidants (grape juice and pomegranate juice), on endothelial dysfunction as well as circulating markers of inflammation and endothelial function in adolescents with MetS.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Research &#x00026; Ethics Council of the Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. After full explanation of the study protocol, the whole program was offered free of charge. We have previously reported the results of this trial on vascular reactivity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> and here we report the effects on biochemical markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subjects and design</title><p>This non-pharmacologic randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted among 30 adolescents, aged 12-15 years, with MetS as defined by the International Diabetes Federation for the pediatric age group. Accordingly, MetS was diagnosed in the case of central adiposity &#x02265; 90<sup>th</sup> percentile waist circumference (WC) or adult threshold if lower than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile plus at least two of the following criteria: 1) triglycerides (TG) &#x02265; 150 mg/dL, 2) HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) &#x0003c;40 mg/dL, 3) blood pressure (BP) &#x02265;130 mmHg systolic or &#x02265; 85 mmHg diastolic, and 4) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x02265; 100 mg/dl or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Participants were randomly selected from those who met the diagnostic criteria, and were referred from health care centers, schools, public and private clinics to the Farhanguian Medical Clinic,Isfahan,Iranclinic. Those children with signs or symptoms of secondary obesity, endocrine disorders, presence of any physical disability, and history of chronic medication use, smoking, or chronic infection during the two weeks before the study were not included to the trial. The allocation was conducted from computer generated random numbers using the children's record numbers in the clinic. All measurements were made by a trained team of general physicians and nurses under the supervision of the same pediatrician, and used calibrated instruments and standard protocols. Height, weight, and WC were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by height in meters squared (m<sup>2</sup>). BP was measured after 5 minutes of rest in the sitting position. All measurements were taken in triplicate using appropriate size cuffs on the right arm. The readings at the first and the fifth Korotkoff phase were considered as systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. The average of the last two BP measurements was recorded and included in the analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Blood analyses</title><p>Participants were instructed to fast for 12 hours before screening. The compliance with fasting was determined by interview on the morning of examination. While one of the parents accompanied his/her child, blood samples were taken from the left antecubital vein between 8:00 and 9:30 am for measurement of FPG, lipids and adhesion molecules. The blood samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm within 30 minutes of venipuncture. FPG, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, TG and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured by autoanalyzer. Serum adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using standard kits (Bender Med Systems, GmbH, Vienna, Austria).</p><p>The same cardiologist conducted all studies for measurement of brachial arterial reactivity in the abovementioned clinic. Using the method previously described,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> the diameter of the brachial artery was measured from highresolution B-mode ultrasound images (ALOKA 5000 system, 7.5 megahertz transducer) at rest as basal brachial dimension, 90 seconds after cuff deflation to assess reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent dilation or flowmediated dilation), again at rest, and 3 to 4 minutes after administration of 400 micrograms sublingual nitroglycerin which led to endothelium independent dilation. The percent change of flow-mediated dilation was calculated as the ratio of the brachial artery diameter after reactive hyperemia to the baseline diameter; a similar calculation was done for nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilatation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>After baseline measurements, adolescents were assigned into two groups of equal number using computer-based randomization.

Compliance with regular drinking of the recommended type and amount of juice was determined by weekly phone calls to participants, and visiting participants at 2-week intervals.</p><p>The baseline survey measurements including physical examination, measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, and biochemical analyses were repeated 4 hours after initial juice consumption and 1 month later.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for Windows software (version 15; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Descriptive data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). We verified the normality of the distribution of variables with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical analyses of BMI, WC, TG and hs-CRP were performed using log-transformed values because the distribution was skewed. To compare continuous at different stages of the trial between the two groups under study, age- and sex-adjusted analysis of variance (ANOVA) with <italic>post hoc</italic> Bonferoni test, as well as chi square tests for categorical variables were used. Spearman correlation was used to find the association of continues variables. Age and gender-adjusted linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between changes in biochemical parameters and changes in FMD90 after 4 hours and 1 month. P-value &#x0003c; 0.05 considered as statistically significant level.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>This trial was comprised of 30 adolescents (46.7% girls) with a mean (SD) age of 13.4 (1.1) years.

Moreover, in the group drinking pomegranate juice, significant declines in these three inflammatory markers were observed from baseline to the 4-hour-measurements and after one month follow up.
