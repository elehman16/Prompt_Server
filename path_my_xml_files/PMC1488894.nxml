<bold>Background:</bold> It is already known from observational studies that people with high concentrations of homocysteine (an amino acid) in the blood are at increased risk of disease involving the heart and blood vessels, known as cardiovascular disease. Some randomized trials have also shown that lowering homocysteine levels decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, but not all trials show this. The mechanisms linking homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease are not well understood. Olthof and colleagues wanted to explore further the mechanisms linking homocysteine levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The investigators did a trial in healthy volunteers in which homocysteine concentrations were experimentally raised, then lowered, over short periods of time. The volunteers took a methionine supplement (an amino acid that is converted to homocysteine in the body) to raise homocysteine levels and either betaine (a dietary nutrient), serine (an amino acid), or folic acid (a B vitamin) to lower them. During the trial, the researchers then looked at how well the volunteers' arm arteries functioned, as a surrogate for measuring cardiovascular disease risk.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> The investigators found that functioning of the volunteers' arteries, as measured through flow-mediated dilation (FMD), was not affected by the changes in homocysteine levels that were brought about in the experiment.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Although the number of participants analyzed in the trial was small (<italic>n</italic> = 39), it was large enough to adequately test the researchers' hypothesis. The vast majority of participants received the experimental treatment, with only one participant dropping out of the study. However, the observations were made over a short period of time, within 6 h of the experimental treatments being given. The investigators did not look at clinical outcomes, such as heart disease or stroke. Therefore, this trial does not provide evidence on whether altered homocysteine levels cause, or could be manipulated to prevent, such clinical outcomes.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This trial adds information on the short-term effects of changes in homocysteine levels.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Olthof MR, Bots ML, Katan MB, Verhoef P (2006) Acute effect of folic acid, betaine, and serine supplements on flow-mediated dilation after methionine loading: A randomized trial.

Both fasting homocysteine and the increase of homocysteine concentrations after a methionine-loading test predict the risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, it remains uncertain whether a high concentration of homocysteine itself or whether a low folate status&#x02014;its main determinant&#x02014;is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some clinical trials of homocysteine lowering through B-vitamin treatment support the hypothesis that homocysteine is a culprit factor in cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but others do not [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To shed light on this issue, we assessed whether supplementation with homocysteine-lowering nutrients, e.g., folic acid, betaine, and serine, similarly affect the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Betaine is a methyl donor for remethylation of homocysteine into methionine. Serine is the methyl donor for formation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate from tetrahydrofolate. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is subsequently used in remethylation of homocysteine into methionine. Furthermore, in the first step of transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine, serine condenses with homocysteine to form cystathionine [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We previously showed that a single dose of betaine and of serine together with a methionine load reduces the increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations following a methionine load [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>High homocysteine concentrations might increase risk of cardiovascular disease through impairment of vascular function, an early marker of the atherosclerotic process. Vascular function can be assessed noninvasively through flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. FMD is considered a good alternative for assessing cardiovascular disease risk. FMD is associated with endothelial function in coronary arteries of patients [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both coronary endothelial function [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and FMD [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] are associated with increased mortality and morbidity risk in patients, as well as in low-risk populations. Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia have impaired vascular function relative to healthy controls [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy participants also has been shown to lead to impairment in vascular function [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>One study showed that a high dose of 20 mg of folic acid prevents the impairment in FMD following methionine loading, whereas this same dosage did not affect the increase in plasma homocysteine following methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, another study showed no effect on FMD of a 5-mg folic acid dose together with methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, supplementation with folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the naturally circulating form of folate, without methionine loading has been shown to acutely improve vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], in hypercholesterolemic patients [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and in patients with diabetes type II [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These studies suggest that folic acid affects FMD through mechanisms largely independent of homocysteine lowering [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There are no data on effects of betaine and serine supplementation together with methionine loading on vascular function.</p><p>In an attempt to identify whether or not homocysteine itself is involved in cardiovascular disease etiology, we tested the effect of the homocysteine-lowering supplements folic acid, betaine, and serine together with methionine loading on vascular function, as measured through FMD, in healthy participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the pool of volunteers registered at Wageningen University.

Of those volunteers, 99 participants were assessed for eligibility. Out of 69 eligible participants, 40 participants (19 males) with the highest plasma total homocysteine concentrations were included in this placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010004-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The supplements were (a) 5 g of lactose (placebo); (b) 10 mg of folic acid mixed with 5 g of lactose; (c) 3 g of betaine mixed with 2 g of lactose; and (d) 5 g of <sc>l</sc>-serine. For each participant, we measured the effects of each supplement on two separate days to get a more precise estimate. Participants came to the university on 8 d divided over 4 wk (two different days per week, i.e., Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday). Participants were randomly assigned to a unique treatment order. They received four supplements together with a methionine load, each on a different day in random order spread over the first 2 wk. Subsequently, they again received all four supplements in random order on four different days spread over the second period of 2 wk. There was always at least 1 wk in between the repeat treatments with the same supplements. The study supplements were dissolved in yoghurt or custard and ingested together with the methionine. We chose doses of 3 g of betaine and 5 g of serine because we found in previous studies that these doses considerably lower plasma homocysteine concentrations following a methionine load (by 23% and 37%, respectively) [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objectives</title><p>We investigated whether reducing post-methionine homocysteine concentrations via folic acid, betaine, and serine treatment affects vascular function, as measured through FMD in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>FMD and plasma homocysteine concentrations were the primary outcome measures.

The within-participant coefficient of variation (CV = {SD/mean} &#x000d7; 100%) for FMD was 57% in our study, and this corresponded well to previous measurements in our laboratory [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>At the start of each measurement day, participants rested on a bed for 15 min in a temperature-controlled room (20<sup> o</sup>C&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C). Subsequently, we measured FMD of the brachial artery using a 7.5 MHz linear-array transducer of an ATL Ultramark 9 HDI duplex scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington, United States). The measurements were done at the brachial artery of the right arm, at the site of the antecubital crease, with an inflatable cuff around the forearm. Arm and ultrasound transducer were held in position with a specially designed fixture (TAF, developed by Meijer, Vascular Imaging Center, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands) [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We chose a segment of the artery of at least 10 mm in length with clear lumen and distinctive vessel walls. All images were 10&#x000d7; zoomed and electronically focused. We first obtained an optimal two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound image of the brachial artery at rest and recorded three baseline images to measure baseline diameter. We then either inflated the cuff around the lower arm to a pressure of 200 mmHg or we inflated the cuff 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure in cases in which the systolic blood pressure was &#x0003e;150 mmHg. The pressure was kept constant for 5 min to induce ischemia in the forearm and hand, and then the cuff was deflated and image recording was started. In the next 5 min, images of the brachial artery were frozen every 15 s. All measurements were done at the end-diastole by the use of the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. All images were recorded on super-VHS videotape for offline analysis.</p><p>The offline reading of ultrasound examinations was done using Brachial Tools, Version 3.2.6 (Medical Imaging Applications, Coralville, Iowa, United States) as has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. One reader, who was unaware of treatment allocation, read all images at the Vascular Imaging Centre of the University Medical Center Utrecht. Each scan was read in duplicate, to limit reading variation. The coefficient of variation (CV = {SD/mean} &#x000d7; 100%) in calculated FMD% between readings was 27%. The reader traced the trailing edge of the adventitia&#x02013;media interface at the near wall and the leading edge of the media&#x02013;adventitia interface at the far wall of the brachial artery over a length of at least 3 mm. The distance between these interfaces reflects the lumen diameter. FMD was computed as the percent increase in arterial diameter: FMD% = {(maximum minus baseline)/baseline} &#x000d7; 100%. For reasons of clarity we use &#x0201c;FMD%&#x0201d; as a unit of FMD measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Blood sampling and laboratory analyses.</title><p>Venous blood was taken from the antecubital vein following an overnight fast and 6 h following methionine loading on each treatment day.

The participants and all others involved in this study were unaware of treatment allocation. The principal investigator performed unblinding of the treatment allocation after the study had ended and laboratory analyses were complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For each FMD measurement, we averaged the duplicate readings of the ultrasound images. For FMD, plasma homocysteine, serum folate, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> concentrations, we calculated per participant and per measurement day the difference between fasting values and values at 6 h after methionine loading. Subsequently, we calculated the mean of the duplicate measurements per participant for each treatment. We compared the treatments' effects on FMD, plasma homocysteine concentrations, and B-vitamin concentrations with analysis of variance with repeated measurements (following the General Linear Models procedure in SPSS, Version 12.0). If the analysis of variance indicated a statistically significant overall treatment effect, comparisons of means were performed using the Bonferroni correction, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) corresponding with the differences in means between the treatments were calculated. The 95%CI for the differences in means between fasting and 6 h following methionine loading (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010004-t002">Table 2</xref>) were calculated from the observed differences assuming a normal distribution. We did not test for carryover effects since every participant had a unique treatment order. Moreover, we did not expect carryover effects in our study. Previous studies have shown that the effects on homocysteine concentrations of methionine loading alone [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or with betaine [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or with serine [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] all return to baseline within 24 h. Folic acid does not affect homocysteine concentrations following methionine loading, but effects of folic acid supplementation on FMD also return to baseline within 24 h [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Non-serious adverse events occurred 30 times in 15 participants. The adverse events were diverse and unlikely related to the treatment.

We found that methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia did not impair FMD in healthy elderly volunteers. In addition, we found that the reduction in the increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations following methionine loading, by means of several supplements, did not affect FMD. This suggests that homocysteine, if involved in early pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, does not exert its action through a mechanism related to vascular function in healthy individuals.</p><p>We are confident that we designed and performed our study well.</p><p>First, we selected participants with elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations, who are expected to have a greater response to the homocysteine-lowering interventions than randomly selected individuals.</p><p>Second, we standardized the FMD measurement to the maximum of what is possible in a free-living situation. In order to reduce the variation in the FMD measurement due to diet, we provided all foods and standardized coffee and tea consumption on the days preceding the FMD measurements and on the mornings of methionine loading until the last FMD measurement that day. We standardized the timing of eating and smoking on the evening before measurements and on the days of the methionine loading. During the entire study we asked the volunteers to keep physical activity, smoking, and dietary patterns as usual. The supplements were ingested under our supervision, and thus noncompliance could not explain the outcome.</p><p>Finally, in order to limit the influence of variation in FMD between participants, we chose a crossover design, so that each participant was his or her own control. Furthermore, in order to reduce the within-participant variation of the FMD measurement and the variation in offline analysis of the ultrasound images [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], we performed duplicate FMD measurements in each participant on each treatment and we did the offline analysis in duplicate. The FMD measurement itself was performed similar to previous studies done in our laboratory. In one study FMD was not acutely impaired after test meals with saturated or trans fatty acids [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Overall Evidence and Generalizability</title><p>The authors are not aware of published systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the effect of homocysteine lowering following a methionine load on FMD. Most previous studies show that vascular function is impaired after methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], although some do not [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. An explanation for the fact that we did not find an impairment in FMD following methionine loading could be that we used a lower dose of methionine (50 mg of methionine per kilogram of body weight) than most other studies do (100 mg of methionine per kilogram of body weight). We chose this lower dose of methionine because it is more in the physiological range of dietary methionine intake. Moreover, other studies have shown that methionine doses in the range of 10&#x02013;50 mg/kg effectively increase plasma homocysteine concentrations and impair FMD [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that the lower dose of methionine explains the lack of an effect on FMD in our study.</p><p>Similar to previous supplementation studies, betaine and serine supplementation together with methionine loading effectively reduced the increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, there was no effect on FMD. We are not aware of other published studies that have investigated effects of betaine or serine supplementation on FMD following a methionine load.</p><p>Although folic acid has no acute homocysteine-lowering effect following methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], previous studies have shown that folic acid might acutely affect vascular function via mechanisms independent from homocysteine lowering [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Contrary to our expectations, FMD was not affected by folic acid treatment in our study. This is in line with one other study in healthy volunteers that finds no acute effect on FMD of coadministration of 5 mg of folic acid together with the methionine load following methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, most studies show that supplementation with folic acid together with a methionine load [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or folic acid [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] alone can acutely improve vascular function. We would like to raise the point that publication bias might have resulted in underrepresentation of studies that did not find impairment in FMD following a methionine load or of studies that did not find an improvement of FMD following folic acid treatment.</p><p>The results of this study are also in line with the findings of our study on chronic effects of homocysteine lowering on FMD after an overnight fast [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>However, it remains possible that homocysteine affects vascular function in specific high-risk populations. For example, vitamin C improved FMD in homocystinuric patients, but it did not in control participants [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, our study leaves open the possibility that homocysteine is related to vascular function in specific populations, e.g., patients with cardiovascular disease or patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>We note in passing that fasting homocysteine levels were lower during the trial than during the screening (on average 9.6 versus 11.1 &#x003bc;mol/l). This could be due to regression to the mean or other causes. Whatever the cause, it did not affect our outcomes because it occurred on all treatments. Moreover, we always used the differences between treatments and placebo as our outcomes. Therefore, we do not expect that possible regression to the mean affected the interpretation of our results.</p><p>Although we have performed the FMD with utmost care, there are some methodological issues to discuss. First, we did not perform a nitric oxide (NO)-independent vasodilation test, usually done with sublingual nitroglycerine (NTG). The rationale for such a test is to show whether or not the artery is capable of responding to NO given directly to participants (endothelium-independent vasodilation). Since we selected healthy participants in our study, we assumed that all participants would have an FMD response and we therefore did not confirm this with an NTG test. Moreover, treatment effects on the NTG test were not expected [<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010004-b064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As we have seen an FMD response in all of our participants, we do not think that the lack of NTG measurements affects the validity of our findings.</p><p>Second, we did not perform Doppler measurements after the cuff release. The Doppler measurements reflect the stimulus (i.e., the blood flow) that elicits the FMD response, and through these measurements one may examine whether the differences between participants and between visits are due to differences in exposure to increased blood flow. We did not perform the Doppler measurements in order to optimize the measurements of the B-mode imaging. The time window to switch between B-mode and the Doppler mode in the ultrasound machine was too short to perform valid Doppler measurements and at the same time capture reliable images for lumen diameter measurements within the first period after cuff release, which is the most important phase in which dilation occurs. However, it is highly unlikely that the stimulus will differ between visits, as the measurements were done in a standardized manner, by the same technicians using an identical protocol. Moreover, the FMD was measured in duplicate on each treatment, which minimized variations in the FMD responses that were not due to the treatments. Therefore, the validity of our findings is not severely hampered by the lack of the Doppler measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We showed that changes in plasma homocysteine concentrations through methionine loading with placebo did not acutely affect vascular function in healthy elderly volunteers. Furthermore, methionine loading together with a high dose of folic acid, betaine, or serine did not affect FMD either. This may indicate that the potential adverse effects of high homocysteine on the cardiovascular system are not mediated through changes in vascular function. However, homocysteine or folate may affect cardiovascular disease risk through mechanisms other than impaired vascular function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010004-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010004.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(56 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010004-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010004.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(142 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010004-sd003"><label>Alternative Language Abstract</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010004.sd003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the abstract into Dutch by Margreet R.
