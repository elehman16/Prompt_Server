Enhancement of the local anesthetic effect is produced by a decrease in temperature to 4&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Temperature may thus be an interesting physical variable in the study of nerve blocking mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Several studies had reported that cooling a local anesthetic leads to an increase in the duration of the induced block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Local anesthetic alone for nerve block provides good operative conditions but has short duration of action and limited postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Different additives have been combined with local anesthetics to improve block quality, prolong the postoperative analgesia, and decrease the postoperative narcotic consumption, but none of them is without side effects.</p><p>The most common additives are fentanyl, midazolam, epinephrine, and magnesium sulfate (MgSo<sub>4</sub>).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated the effect of intraoperative MgSo<sub>4</sub> on improving the postoperative analgesia. Mg has antinociceptive effect due to its antagonistic effect on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Its analgesic effect is based on its inhibitory properties on calcium channels.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>This study was carried out to compare cold bupivacaine (4&#x000b0;C) and MgSO<sub>4</sub> added to room temperature bupivacaine (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) in sonar-guided combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks. We compared the onset of sensory and motor block, quality of anesthesia, duration of analgesia and motor block, success rate, postoperative analgesia, and incidence of side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was performed in Tanta University Hospitals, Tanta, Egypt. Ninety adult patients aged between 25- and 40-year-old with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II classification scheduled for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery under sonar-guided combined femoral and sciatic nerve block were included in this study. Patients&#x02019; informed consent was taken and ethical committee approval was obtained. The present study was performed from August 2015 to February 2016.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients&#x02019; refusal, myasthenia gravis, peripheral vascular disease, bleeding disorders, chronic renal or liver diseases, drug allergy, and infection at the site of injection.</p><p>Patients were randomly classified using computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes into 3 equal groups, thirty patients each. Group I was control group and received 20 ml room temperature (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) solution composed of 17 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 3 ml normal saline for each nerve block. Group II was cold bupivacaine group and received 20 ml solution composed of 17 ml of cold bupivacaine 0.5% to 4&#x000b0;C plus 3 ml of cold normal saline to 4&#x000b0;C for each nerve block. Group III, the Mg group, received 20 ml solution composed of 17 ml of room temperature (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) bupivacaine 0.5% plus 3 ml of MgSo<sub>4</sub> 5% for each nerve block. Cold solution to 4&#x000b0;C was obtained by putting it in the refrigerator until its use. The room temperature in our pharmacy is between 20&#x000b0;C and 25&#x000b0;C at the time of the study. An anesthesiologist who was not involved in the data collection or intervention prepared the drug syringes.</p><p>Preoperatively, the patients were assessed as regard to both medical and surgical histories and routine laboratory data were evaluated including complete blood picture, prothrombin time and activity, liver and renal function, and neurologic and physical examination. Sites of injections were examined to exclude any infection.</p><p>Routine intraoperative monitoring was used in all cases, including electrocardiography, oxygen saturation, and noninvasive blood pressure measurements. Intravenous access was obtained. The patients were given oxygen via a facemask at 2&#x02013;3 L/min, with midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg given intravenously for sedation.</p><p>For femoral nerve block, the inguinal region was exposed and disinfected, the wide band transducer 5&#x02013;10 MHz (Sonosite, Titan, Sonosite Inc., 21919, 30<sup>th</sup> Drive SE Bothell WA 98021 USA) was placed on the inguinal region to allow visibility of the femoral artery and vein. After identifying the femoral nerve, a skin wheal of lidocaine 1% 2&#x02013;3 ml was made on the lateral aspect of the thigh 1 cm away from the lateral edge of the transducer. A 22G isolated needle 5 cm long (Stimuplex A50<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, B. Braun, Germany) was inserted in-plane in a lateral-to-medial orientation and advanced toward the femoral nerve. It was introduced longitudinally to the ultrasound beam (in-plane technique) until the site of the nerve. When the needle tip had crossed fascia lata and fascia iliaca and into the femoral nerve compartment, aspiration was attempted with the syringe to check blood to ensure against accidental vascular puncture.</p><p>Once positioning was confirmed by imaging, injection was performed in boluses of 5 ml after aspiration to guard against intravascular injection and any resistance or pain on injection necessitated repositioning of the needle to avoid intraneural injection.</p><p>After the femoral block, the patient was placed in the lateral decubitus for the sciatic nerve block. The image was obtained by an ultrasound of the transgluteal region to identify the nerve structure. At this transgluteal level, the sciatic nerve is visualized in the short axis between the two hyperechoic bony prominences of the ischial tuberosity and the greater trochanter of the femur. Once positioning was confirmed by imaging, the needle was introduced after a skin wheal was performed with lidocaine 1% 2&#x02013;3 ml and the site of injection was confirmed. Once positioning was confirmed by imaging, injection was performed in boluses of 5 ml after aspiration to guard against intravascular injection and any resistance or pain on injection necessitated repositioning of the needle to avoid intraneural injection.</p><p>For each block, onset of nerve blockade was evaluated every 5 min and continued for 30 min by independent anesthesiologists who were not involved in the study. If no block was present before induction of anesthesia, patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>Adequate femoral nerve block was defined as complete loss of pin-prick sensation in the anteromedial thigh with complete inability to elevate the foot of the operated limb from the operating table.</p><p>Sensory evaluation of the sciatic nerve was assessed by evaluating the presence or loss of pin-prick sensation in the lateral aspect of the calf and plantar aspect of the foot.</p><p>Motor blockade was evaluated simultaneously for the two main branches of the sciatic nerve, the common peroneal and tibial nerves (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot against manual resistance, respectively).</p><p>The onset time of the sensory block and the motor block was defined as the interval between end of injection of local anesthetic and a complete block. Block resolution was defined as complete recovery when both sensory and motor blocks in all distributions returned to baseline. The nurse or resident in charge of the patient tested the resolution of sensory (pin-prick test) and motor block (movement) every hour after surgery until complete regression. Duration of analgesia and motor block is the time between the onset and complete resolution of sensory and motor block.</p><p>Intraoperatively, an independent investigator assessed the patient satisfaction which was scored as 3 - &#x0201c;perfect,&#x0201d; 2 - &#x0201c;minor problems not requiring sedation or analgesia,&#x0201d; 1 - &#x0201c;need for sedation and analgesia,&#x0201d; and 0 - &#x0201c;insufferable pain, general anesthesia required.&#x0201d; Surgical satisfaction was scored as 2 - &#x0201c;satisfactory,&#x0201d; 1 - &#x0201c;acceptable,&#x0201d; and 0 - &#x0201c;not acceptable.&#x0201d; The presence of side effects, additional drug requirements, and the presence or absence of nausea and vomiting were also recorded.</p><p>If needed, midazolam was used first for tactile discomfort during surgery at incremental doses with 1 mg. To attenuate pain, 50 &#x000b5;g fentanyl was available to be administered alternatively as needed.</p><p>Hemodynamics (heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) were recorded before block and every 15 min intraoperatively and every 30 min for 2 h postoperatively.</p><p>Postoperatively, patients were given morphine 3 mg intravenously and then when needed.</p><p>Postoperatively, the duration of both sensory and motor block, the time to first analgesia, the analgesic consumption and the occurrence of any complications associated with nerve blockade (venous puncture, paresthesia), and the use of local anesthetics (signs of toxicity) were also recorded by an independent anesthesiologists who were not involved in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The statistical software, namely, SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) were used for the analysis of the data.</p><p>Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and numbers (percentage).</p><p>For comparison of groups regarding quantitative variables, multiple analysis of variance test was used for independent samples and Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for qualitative variables.

The quality of both anesthesia and analgesia, which was studied in this, work included the onset of both sensory and motor block, intraoperative anesthesia, intra- and post-operative hemodynamic changes, duration of sensory and motor block, patient numeric rating scale for pain assessment, time of first analgesic request, consumption of analgesics, and incidence of possible side effects of both technique and drugs used.</p><p>In this study, we have rapid onset of both sensory and motor block in both groups as compared to control group with nonsignificant difference between each other.</p><p>As regards to the quality of anesthesia in all groups, there was good anesthetic condition as none of the patients required either midazolam or fentanyl supplements with stable hemodynamic changes and good patient and surgeon satisfaction.</p><p>In this work, we have used a multimodal approach to have high success rate and increase the quality of the nerve block with highest intra- and post-operative analgesia. This approach included the use of sonar-guided nerve block, use of combined femoral and sciatic nerve block with resultant analgesia of both anterior and posterior knee sides, and use of either cold bupivacaine or additive of MgSo<sub>4</sub> to normal temperature bupivacaine. The use of ultrasound facilitates accurate needle placement and drug delivery is the key to achieve success in nerve blocks with resultant more rapid block onset, lesser complications due to intravascular or intraneural injection of the local anesthetic,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] prolonged block duration,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] with the added advantages of a decrease in drug dosage and a reduction in the incidence of local anesthetic toxicity.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Reduction in procedural pain and better patient satisfaction has also been demonstrated with ultrasound-guided nerve block.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The onset time in the three studied groups was more rapid than the study of Beaulieu <italic>et al</italic>., in which the onset time ranged between 18 and 22 min for sensory and between 25 and 28 min for motor block.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The use of cold bupivacaine in Group II resulted in a rapid onset of both sensory and motor block, adequate quality of anesthesia, and longer duration of the combined femoral and sciatic nerve block with good postoperative analgesia manifested by long time to first analgesic and lower analgesic consumption.</p><p>This is in agreement with previous results which revealed that cooling of local anesthetic to 4&#x000b0;C resulted in increasing its potency with rapid onset and longer duration of anesthesia.

Also, Ekmekci <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found a good beneficial effect of Mg added to levobupivacaine for femoral nerve block on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.</p><p>On the other hand, Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that the addition of Mg to bupivacaine and epinephrine in interscalene brachial plexus block increased the analgesic duration but without decreasing the postoperative analgesic consumption. Systemic,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] neuraxial[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] administration of Mg, or its use for peripheral nerve block (PNB)[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] is associated with a reduced analgesic requirement and less discomfort in the postoperative period. This analgesia is produced by a mechanism of action which is not clear. The antagonism of the NMDA receptors leading to loss of central sensitization from peripheral painful stimulation and decrease in tissue injury painful sensation can explain the analgesic effect of systemic and neuraxial Mg administration. For action of Mg, during PNB, another mechanism is involved. This mechanism is the theory of surface charge in which external Mg concentration bathing a nerve bundle resulted in enhancement of the nerve blockade due to local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Also, a high concentration of divalent ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) attracted by the negative charges of the outer membrane surface affected Na<sup>+</sup> channel gating and could cause hyperpolarization during which it is more difficult to achieve the threshold level, and it results in nerve conduction block.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In this study, none of the patients had any complications related to the drugs or the technique either intraoperative or postoperative. This is in agreement with the work of Zaric <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who found very low side effects in PNB group compared to epidural group; Fowler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] who observed that continuous 3-in-1block induces nearly 4 times fewer side effects than epidural analgesia; Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that PNB may provide effective unilateral analgesia with lower incidence of opioid-related and autonomic side effects and fewer serious neurological complication compared with epidural analgesia; and Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also found no complication intraoperative or postoperative.</p><p>The safety of perineural adjuvants has recently been the subject of debate that centers on the potential for neurotoxicity of the adjuvant drug itself or any co-administered preservatives.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no studies had compared cold bupivacaine to 4&#x000b0;C 0.5% with MgSo<sub>4</sub> added to room temperature bupivacaine (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) for sonar guided combined femoral and sciatic nerve block. In this study, we tried to use only cold bupivacaine to 4&#x000b0;C alone without additives and test its efficacy for both anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Our results should be considered in light of several limitations including the need of larger number of patients, different types of surgeries, another types and techniques of nerve block, and the lack of data on patient feedback; all these are needed to mitigate the shortcomings of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>From this study, it can be concluded that either cold bupivacaine to 4&#x000b0;C or Mg sulfate 150 mg added to room temperature bupivacaine injected for sonar-guided combined femoral and sciatic nerve block during arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery succeeded comparably in having a good quality of intraoperative anesthesia with regard to sensory and motor block with good patient and surgeon satisfaction.</p><p>Good postoperative analgesia manifested by longer time of first analgesia request, lower total analgesic consumption, and minimal self-limited side effects was obtained in both groups.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
