bearing. Therefore, the spine is faced with risky situations at all times, and lumbar
herniated intervertebral disc occurs easily. This in turn causes weakened muscle strength,
imbalanced muscle strength, and unstable joints and chronically worsens, affecting the whole
spine<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>From the posture-balance point of view, the pelvis supports the abdomen and connects the
spine to the lower limbs. When standing, the pelvis is an important part, as it supports
weight from the spine to the lower limbs, allowing the trunk to be a stable foundation, and
allows smooth movement of the upper limbs through maintenance of an upright posture. We can
maintain an upright posture when the pelvis is located in a neutral position. Maintaining an
upright posture also allows us to improve everyday movements and walking ability by
adjusting the upper and lower limbs in dynamic postures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The lower limbs are connected to the acetabulums in the pelvis. Therefore, the pelvis
affects lower limb movements. The location of the pelvis is also related to gait. When a
person takes a step, the pelvis generates a biomechanical reaction as weight is loaded onto
the lower limbs and saves energy consumed by gait<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most pelvis exercises would have different intensity compared with the therapeutic
exercises prescribed for low back pain patients based on symptoms and pain. However, most
exercises prescribed are a mixture of McKenzie exercises. Recently, more people are
interested in Swiss-ball exercise, which is related to improvement of posture control
ability and suitability of muscle activation. Swiss-ball exercise is easily accessible by
all people, has wide range of applications using a Swiss ball, and has a high level of
utility as a home exercise program. Exercise with a Swiss ball is used as a method of
improving dynamic stabilization. It can improve muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility.
Instability induced by a Swiss ball is reported to strengthen reflexes, perception ability,
sense of balance, and proprioception comprehensively<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In particular, the shift of the center of pressure (COP) is utilized as an evaluation tool
for diagnosis and treatment of balance disability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Force platform, pressure plate, and in-shoe pressure measurement
can be used to measure foot pressure. They can detect pressures from various points on the
foot in various forms and provide timely and quantitative data.</p><p>In this we study, we assumed that an abnormal posture habit of a normal adult can cause
problems in trunk muscles and affect posture alignment, foot base pressure, and balancing
ability. Therefore, we examined the effect of a pelvis-concentrated exercise program and
walking on the changes in body shape and foot base pressure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study utilized 30 male and female students in their 20s and 30s from K University,
Busan, Republic of Korea. The subjects were divided into a Swiss-ball exercise group and a
McKenzie exercise group. Each group exercised for 40 minutes a day 3 times a week for 6
weeks. The subjects satisfied the following conditions: 1) they did not exercise, 2) they
had not had any accidents or continuous damages on lower limbs in the last 6 months, 3) they
had no history of neurological diseases, decreased coordination capability, or damage to
motor sensation, 4) they had no history of musculoskeletal diseases, and 5) they did not
have any lesions or skin diseases on their feet. All the subjects understood the purpose of
this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEG</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.9&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.1&#x000b1;1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">172.6&#x000b1;5.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.56&#x000b1;4.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.1&#x000b1;10.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.9&#x000b1;9.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean&#x000b1;SD.

they put their two hands on the back of their head, touched the ball with their back,
forming a bridge position, and pulled and pushed the ball with their feet. 2) They put their
arms on their chest, fixed the trunk as steady as possible, and drew a circle by spinning
their pelvis. 3) They put their calves on the ball in a lying position and repeatedly bent
and stretched the knee joints and hip joints.</p><p>The McKenzie exercise group performed the following movements: 1) They put one side of
their head on the floor, put their arms at their sides, and took a deep breath 3 to 4 times.
2) In a prone position, they pulled their knees without applying too much pressure. 3) Again
in a prone position, they extended their upper body with their weight on their elbows and
forearms. 4) Again in a prone position, they extended their upper body with their weight on
their arms and their arms straight. 5) In a standing position, they leaned backwards as far
as possible. 6) They sat on a chair, bent at their waist, put their palms on the ground, and
then returned to the original position.</p><p>This study used a global postural system (GPS, LAXTHA) to measure changes in the anatomic
alignments related to the baseline set for pelvis tilting and the change in the distribution
of foot base pressure (Alfoots, Seoul, Republic of Korea). All the results of measurement
are expressed as the mean&#x000b1; standard deviation. PASW Statistics for Windows (version 18.0)
was used for data analyses. The paired t-test was used to analyze the difference between

lowered proprioceptive function. This is reported to be a cause of recurrence of low back
pain, as problems occur in spinal stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Overload of passive systems such as the lumbar herniated
intervertebral disc especially increases the rate of active system load as a compensation
for stress. In this case, strengthening of the active system is very important for
maintaining spinal stability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many clinical studies suggest that there are problems with pelvic floor muscle exercise
therapy. Since the pelvic floor muscle is not a muscle that we use every day, it is reported
that pelvic floor muscle contraction exercise cannot be performed properly by some patients
only based on a therapist&#x02019;s explanation. Therefore, it is important to develop various
pelvic floor muscle exercise programs with accurate contraction methods based on a thorough
understanding of the role of pelvic floor muscles for effective waist stabilization<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The swiss ball is a very good exercise tool for therapeutic rehabilitation exercise and
reeducating exercise nerves in neurological way. Swiss-ball exercise is an interesting
exercise, and anyone can perform the necessary exercises safely. It can develop flexibility
and stability of the spine, as it is possible to train muscles, joints, and sense of
equilibrium with tens of postures, including sitting and lying downward on the ball.</p><p>In this study, the subject groups performed pelvis-concentrated exercise. Comparison of the
pre- and post-exercise measurement results in each group showed that foot base pressure in
both groups decreased to close to the normal level. In this study, the Swiss-ball exercise
group had a slightly higher correction rate compared with the other group. This is because
the Swiss-ball exercise has detailed goals such as improving muscle strength, endurance,
coordination, movability, and flexibility in addition to maintenance and improvement of
joint range of motion.</p><p>As the pelvis-concentrated exercise was included in intensive training, the contacting and
bearing surfaces were increased. Therefore, movement of trunk and pelvis increased, which in
turn reduced the distribution of the foot base pressure in the standing position.</p><p>As the distribution of the foot base pressure is stabilized by a stable trunk, body balance
improves, which in turn distributes the right-side and left-side weight more
effectively.</p><p>It has been reported that pressure on certain parts of the foot can be observed when
performing various daily motions and functional activities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this is one of the subjects that should be investigated in the
field of sports science.</p><p>According to the results concerning posture alignment and foot base pressure distribution,
both exercise programs had a positive effect on posture change and foot base pressure. Of
the two programs, Swiss-ball exercise had a better effect. Therefore, a pelvis-concentrated
exercise program is effective in maintaining a correct posture as well as in improving
balance and exercise ability. It can also be utilized as an abnormal posture prevention
program. More clinical application and continuous research are expected so that it can be
standardized and studied more in depth.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group>: Lumbar Disc lesions: Pathogenesis and Treatment of Low Back Pain and
