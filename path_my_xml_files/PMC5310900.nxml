The 6-PACK falls prevention program includes a fall-risk tool; &#x02018;falls alert&#x02019; signs; supervision of patients in the bathroom; ensuring patients&#x02019; walking aids are within reach; toileting regimes; low-low beds; and bed/chair alarms. This study explored the acceptability of the 6-PACK program from the perspective of nurses and senior staff prior to its implementation in a randomised controlled trial. A mixed-methods approach was applied involving 24 acute wards from six Australian hospitals<bold>.</bold> Participants were nurses working on participating wards and senior hospital staff including: Nurse Unit Managers; senior physicians; Directors of Nursing; and senior personnel involved in quality and safety or falls prevention. Information on program acceptability (suitability, practicality and benefits) was obtained by surveys, focus groups and interviews. Survey data were analysed descriptively, and focus group and interview data thematically. The survey response rate was 60%. Twelve focus groups (n = 96 nurses) and 24 interviews with senior staff were conducted<bold>.</bold> Falls were identified as a priority patient safety issue and nurses as key players in falls prevention. The 6-PACK program was perceived to offer practical benefits compared to current practice. Nurses agreed fall-risk tools, low-low beds and alert signs were useful for preventing falls (&#x0003e;70%). Views were mixed regarding positioning patients&#x02019; walking aid within reach. Practical issues raised included access to equipment; and risk of staff injury with low-low bed use. Bathroom supervision was seen to be beneficial, however not always practical. Views on the program appropriateness and benefits were consistent across nurses and senior staff. Staff perceived the 6-PACK program as suitable, practical and beneficial, and were open to adopting the program. Some practical concerns were raised highlighting issues to be addressed by the implementation plan.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council (AU)</institution></funding-source><award-id>APP1007627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barker</surname><given-names>Anna L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia (APP1007627).

There is limited high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of prevention interventions in the acute setting [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The 6-PACK is a nurse-led falls prevention program designed for acute wards [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It includes a fall-risk tool [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and individualised selection of a &#x02018;falls alert&#x02019; sign; bathroom supervision; ensuring patients&#x02019; walking aids are within reach; a toileting regime; a low-low bed; and a bed/chair alarm. The program involves nurses assessing their patients&#x02019; falls risk each shift and applying a &#x02018;falls alert&#x02019; sign and one or more of the remaining 6-PACK interventions to high risk patients. A single-centre study suggests the program is feasible to implement and may reduce fall injuries [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to provide robust estimates of effect and generalisability [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Prior to the RCT, assessment of the program acceptability was considered important to inform development of a plan to optimise implementation effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Acceptability studies facilitate implementation tailored to local needs and context. There are several components of acceptability including suitability, practicality and benefits. <italic>Suitability</italic>, relates to underlying demand [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or matching of the program to opportunity (underlying problem) [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It can be referred to as &#x02018;appropriateness&#x02019; of a program and explores the program&#x02019;s alignment to needs of patients and likelihood of being used. <italic>Practicality</italic>, relates to the extent to which the program can be implemented efficiently within existing resources [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. <italic>Benefits</italic>, relate to the program&#x02019;s potential to achieve intended outcomes&#x02014;for example, reduce fall-related injuries, and relative advantages above existing care models such as reducing work load for hospital staff. It is also referred to as the &#x02018;potential effectiveness&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Three prior studies have sought to explore the acceptability of hospital falls prevention programs [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The first used a survey to obtain information on barriers and enablers to implementation of a falls prevention guideline from 1,467 nurses in five Singaporean hospitals. High levels of acceptability were reported. However, 25% of nurses reported delivery of the guideline as too time consuming, and 20% that it had limited flexibility with respect to clinical judgement and tailoring for individual patients [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The second involved a survey of health care professionals, patients and their relatives (N = 200) at a U.K. general hospital. High levels of acceptability were reported for observation beds, identification bracelets, bed/chair alarms, bed rails and &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; labels by the bed [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The last study in one sub-acute ward used a survey (N = 12) and focus group (N = 9) of nurses and reported high acceptability of an electronic sensor bed/chair alarm system for patients with cognitive impairment from the perspective of nurses [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the above mentioned studies provide insights, the small sample sizes and single centre designs highlight further studies are required.</p><p>This study aimed to explore the acceptability of the 6-PACK program from the perspective of nurses and senior staff prior to implementation of the program as part of a RCT [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Specific study objectives were to assess perceived suitability, practicality, and benefits of the program components (fall-risk tool, interventions and integrated care plan) and protocol (nurses to review and update the tool and required interventions each shift). This information would inform development of an implementation plan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design</title><p>A multi-centre mixed methods pre-implementation study done in accordance with COREQ guidelines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172005.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). This study was part of the 6-PACK project that incorporated a three-year research plan: 1) Studies of current falls prevention practice and moderators (pre-implementation) [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; 2) A cluster RCT testing 6-PACK effectiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172005.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>), including economic [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and program evaluations (implementation); and 3) a longitudinal assessment of sustainability of practice change and outcomes (maintenance).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>Nurses and senior staff from 24 acute wards (16 medical; 8 surgical) recruited to participate in the RCT were the study participants. Ward recruitment procedures are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172005.s003">S3 Appendix</xref>). Nurses were eligible to participate in the survey and/or focus group if they had worked on wards for &#x02265;7.5 hours per week two months prior to survey administration. Staff who did not meet this criteria were excluded as they might have limited knowledge of ward prevention practices and falls. Interviews were conducted with 24 senior staff nominated by the hospital Director of Nursing (DON) and invited by letter from the research team. These included Nurse Unit Managers (NUMs); senior physicians; DONs; and senior personnel involved in quality and safety or falls prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Nurse survey</title><p>A 43-item survey was developed by the research team that included 15 acceptability items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172005.t001">Table 1</xref>). The survey was piloted at the hospital that developed and implemented the 6-PACK program to test dissemination approach and comprehension [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The length of the survey was the main issue raised by pilot participants, however, it was deemed difficult to further reduce items without losing important content. Formal construct validity of the survey was not undertaken. Survey scores were not intended to be summed or analysed with parametric statistics. Participants rated their agreement to items on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The survey was administered to all eligible nurses over two-weeks at each hospital. The researchers described the study purpose, privacy issues and instructions for completion. Completed surveys were placed into a sealed box that was collected by the researcher at the end of the dissemination period.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0172005.t001" orientation="portrait"

each hospital. Focus group and interview question guides were developed by researchers experienced in the development, implementation and evaluation of hospital based patient safety programs and informed by relevant literature [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Questions related to beliefs about falls; current falls prevention practice; 6-PACK program components; best practice guidelines and key recommendations; and falls reporting practices, and were mapped to the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). The TDF includes 12 domains: knowledge; skills; social/professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; motivation and goals; memory, attention and decision making processes; environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion; behavioral regulation and nature of the behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Question guides differed slightly between focus groups and interviews. For example, focus groups were with nurses and therefore questions focused on their experiences with falls and preventing falls. Interviews with senior staff included questions that were more operational in nature for example the expected outcomes from the 6-PACK program and how these will be measured. Sessions were led by AB, were 1hr in duration and explored the perceived acceptability of the 6-PACK program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172005.t001">Table 1</xref>).

Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consultation with the investigator team as required. All interviews and focus groups were transcribed verbatim and uploaded into Nvivo 11 for data management and analysis. DA coded and recoded transcripts as actions, processes and themes emerged to test applicability and consistency in relation to acceptability of the 6-PACK program. Three rounds of coding were conducted: open, axial and thematic. Deductive theory-driven codes were used to identify overarching acceptability themes based on the survey, FG and interview questions [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AB and MB checked the coding framework for the open and axial coding to ensure that coding was consistent.

This study extends prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] by seeking information not only from nurses but also senior staff providing a detailed understanding of falls prevention practice in acute hospitals. This is the first multi-centre, mixed methods study of the acceptability of many commonly used falls prevention interventions. Staff perceived the 6-PACK program is suitable and for the most part practical and beneficial. Some practicality concerns were raised highlighting targets to be addressed by the implementation plan.</p><p>Staff highlighted need for a new falls prevention approach. Falls are perceived as prevalent and deleterious, and existing prevention practices have numerous limitations. The 6-PACK was perceived to offer advantages over existing practice. Staff believed it was practical&#x02014;a short, simple risk tool, integrated care plan, and focus on only a few interventions&#x02014;and was appropriate for the needs of their patients&#x02014;risk factors on the tool were considered relevant and the interventions were considered useful in local context. Others have also identified a need for simple programs with nurses reporting <italic>&#x02018;too many must do's are daunting&#x02019;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that integration into exiting work practices facilitates practice change [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Staff agreed with the program focus on nurses and identified falls as a nursing sensitive outcome, consistent with prior literature [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The program was considered easy to integrate into existing care and able to be used with minimal training.</p><p>Staff perceived many benefits to both themselves and patients with implementation of the 6-PACK program. Benefits included more frequent review of patients&#x02019; risk status, a more consistent falls prevention approach across staff and reduced time spent on documentation. Signs were considered an effective means of communicating falls risk amongst staff that would increase use of interventions, consistent with U.K. studies [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Low-low beds were believed to be effective for reducing injuries from bed falls, and bathroom supervision an effective way to prevent bathroom falls.</p><p>The perceived suitability and benefits of the 6-PACK program suggests a high likelihood of the program being used by nurses and use supported by senior staff. A perceived lack of time, access to equipment, and patient privacy issues may compromise the use of the program. Time constraints and access to equipment have been identified by prior falls prevention studies as factors limiting uptake [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The implementation plan must ensure there is appropriate access to signs, low-low beds and alarms. This includes adequate provision of equipment to meet patient demand, storage of equipment in patient rooms, and clear labelling so it is easily identifiable. Access to equipment was identified in a large study of U.S hospitals as a factor reducing opportunity to provide safe care [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Staff time, workload and resource constraints are the most commonly reported barriers to implementing nursing practice guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Education sessions should address privacy issues with bathroom supervision. Use of dignity gowns and avoiding direct eye contact while patients are voiding could be promoted.</p><p>Consistent with others [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we identified that nurses perceived bed/chair alarms as a useful way to prevent patient falls. However, nurses raised alarms were often not in working order, are less effective when used in isolation or when too many are used at once. This highlights the need for regular maintenance audits, education that promotes the use of alarms in combination with other interventions and guidelines about prioritising use to only 1&#x02013;3 patients on a ward at a time.</p><p>Some staff also identified risks associated with the use of the 6-PACK. &#x02018;Partner&#x02019; nursing was identified as a strategy to mitigate the risk of leaving patients unattended when providing bathroom supervision. While there is evidence that increased levels of nursing (higher nurse-patient ratios) are associated with fewer falls [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172005.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], there is an absence of evidence regarding associations between &#x02018;partner&#x02019; nursing and falls. A Canadian study reported nurses were concerned about the fall hazard created by keeping walking aids within reach especially when bedside space is limited [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Education should include recommendations on ensuring the bedside area is clear of clutter to minimise patient injury. Education should also recommend the patient&#x02019;s bed is raised to an appropriate height during transfers and care activities.</p><p>In this study, perspectives from both nurses and senior staff provided a detailed understanding of falls prevention in acute hospitals, contributing to knowledge of how to enhance implementation fidelity of programs. Focus groups and interviews provided more comprehensive information on beliefs about effectively preventing falls, compared to survey only methods [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This study was conducted as part of the 6-PACK RCT [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which introduced bias as participants were recruited from hospitals that had volunteered to participate in the RCT.</p><p>The 6-PACK program is nurse-led and therefore our focus was to seek the perspectives of nurses. Doctors, pharmacists and allied health professionals are also important falls prevention stakeholders and may have different perspectives. Further research to explore this is warranted. Patient and family perspectives would also be important to consider. Additional publications present the findings of the other pre-implementation studies conducted as part of the 6-PACK project [<xref rid="pone.0172005.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] including a profile of safety climate, review of current falls prevention practice, in-hospital fall epidemiology, and investigation of implementation barriers and enablers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While the 6-PACK program remained fixed in the RCT, implementation was tailored to local context to optimise implementation and effects. This study confirmed the acceptability of the 6-PACK program to nurses who are the program end-users and senior staff who are executive sponsors. Staff believed the program to be a suitable, practical and beneficial way to assist them to reduce falls. Information obtained from this study was incorporated with that from other pre-implementation studies to develop the implementation RCT plan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172005.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>COREQ checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172005.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172005.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>6-PACK programme to decrease fall injuries in acute hospitals: Cluster randomised controlled trial (published article).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172005.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172005.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Development of an implementation plan for the 6-PACK falls prevention programme as part of a randomised controlled trial: Protocol for a series of preimplementation studies (published article).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172005.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Jeannette Kamar and the Injury Prevention Unit, The Northern Hospital, Northern Health, Melbourne, Australia who developed the 6-PACK Program.
