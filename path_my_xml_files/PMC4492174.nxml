The study population is innovative as it is focused on preschool-aged, Latino children from low-income families; this population has not typically been targeted in obesity management assessments. The home-based intervention is linked to clinical care through update letters and assessment of the program&#x02019;s impact to the child&#x02019;s medical providers. Informing primary care providers about a child&#x02019;s accomplishments and challenges, allows the clinician to support the health weight effort when seeing families during subsequent clinical visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02024360?term=nct02024360&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02024360</ext-link> Registered December 21, 2013</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Childhood obesity</kwd><kwd>Low-income</kwd><kwd>Latino</kwd><kwd>Patient navigator</kwd><kwd>Home-based obesity intervention</kwd><kwd>Preschool</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Childhood obesity in the United States has reached an alarming prevalence rate, affecting all age groups including preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Obesity in children aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years has increased from 5&#x000a0;% in 1971&#x02013;1980 to 10.4&#x000a0;% by 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to 12.1&#x000a0;% by 2009&#x02013;2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] describe improving obesity trends, Colorado rates continue to increase with the nation&#x02019;s second highest rate of childhood obesity increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2010, 14.1&#x000a0;% of Colorado&#x02019;s children aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years were overweight and 9.1&#x000a0;% were obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Poverty, an important social determinant of health, correlates significantly with obesity. In 2014, 18&#x000a0;% of children in Colorado lived in poverty, with Denver County having an even higher rate (29&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite high preschooler obesity prevalence, evidence to support particular treatment strategies is lacking and convenient access to community-based treatment is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While previous treatment studies often excluded children younger than 6&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], recent data suggest greater treatment success among preschool aged children than older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) has recommended that primary care providers screen for and then refer obese children over 6&#x000a0;years of age to high quality treatment programs; no obesity screening recommendations were made for children younger than 6&#x000a0;years due to relatively limited treatment offered to this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Testing treatment protocols for preschool children may build evidence for future screening recommendations for young children. Ideal protocols would be feasible, cost-effective, and reach low-income and minority children, who are at greatest risk for persistent obesity.</p><p>Research suggests that patient navigators and lay health workers can improve outcomes for chronic disease in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and are effective in facilitating behavior change in various settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The intervention targets children aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years within a predominantly Latino population. The primary goals are to examine the effect of the intervention in reducing the BMI z-score in the patient and the changes in health behaviors using the &#x0201c;5-2-1-0&#x0201d; daily targets (i.e., 5 fruits and vegetables, less than 2&#x000a0;hours screen time, 1&#x000a0;hour or more of exercise and 0 sweetened drinks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] using a home-based, patient navigator-mediated childhood obesity intervention.</p><p>COOPT is delivered by patient navigators at a family&#x02019;s home. By focusing the program on the family unit, the parent sets goals for the child taking into account family dynamics around nutrition and physical activities. Primary care providers often lack the time to offer intensive weight counseling to families since the average well child visit is less than 20&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and many providers do not feel they have the tools or knowledge to provide adequate weight management counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This intensive 25-hour program provides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] a home-based platform for patient navigators to offer hands-on opportunities for skill-building, provide detailed education and counseling to families, reinforce learned concepts throughout the intervention, and offer opportunities for families to set, evaluate, and modify goals, as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview and hypotheses</title><p>Overweight or obese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years (target <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;300) receiving medical care at one of eight community health clinics of an urban safety net medical system are randomly selected from a population of greater than 2000 eligible overweight or obese children to participate in this 16-session, home based, family-centered curriculum around nutrition, physical activity, and parenting skills. All participants are recruited at baseline and individual children and families are randomized to begin treatment in one of several sequential 25-hour stepped wedge cohorts. Children enrolled at inception but not receiving the intervention until a later start date are considered a control group for the period from recruitment until the intervention begins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of Children into the Study: Randomization, Recruitment, Enrollment, and Intervention Processes, Denver Health, 2012-2015</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1833_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The primary outcome measure is BMI z-score over time in children receiving the intervention compared to waitlist controls (delayed intervention). We hypothesize that children receiving the intervention will have a greater reduction in BMI z-scores than children in the waitlist control group. We will compare the change in BMI z-score slope of the two groups from baseline to follow-up period. The follow-up period of the intervention group is from the start through the end of the intervention. The follow-up period for the delayed intervention group is from recruitment to the start of the intervention.</p><p>The secondary outcome is change in health behaviors using the &#x0201c;5-2-1-0&#x0201d; daily targets (i.e., 5 fruits and vegetables, less than 2&#x000a0;hours screen time, 1&#x000a0;hour or more of exercise, and 0 sweetened drinks). We hypothesize that children receiving the intervention will experience a greater improvement in &#x0201c;5-2-1-0&#x0201d; measures from baseline to post-intervention compared with children in control group.

DH provides services to 25% of Denver residents, 35% of Denver&#x02019;s children, and a large proportion of indigent and minority populations (58% Latino, 21% Caucasian, 17% African American; 4% other races). Among DH primary care patients, 98% are below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines and most (87%) are publicly insured or uninsured patients. In 2013, among 42,521 children 2&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years old seen at DH, 32% (13,944) were overweight or obese; of whom, nearly 11,000 (79%) were Hispanic or Latino.</p><p>Eligible participants for the study are children aged 2 to 5&#x000a0;years who have been receiving well-child care at a Denver Health Community Health Service clinic for at least 12&#x000a0;months, had two or more visits with the most recent visit within 18&#x000a0;months, and have a BMI &#x0003e;85th percentile-for-age, recorded at least 9&#x000a0;months prior to the effort to recruit. Children with a physical or developmental disability/condition that precludes measurement of standing height, or a chronic (i.e., greater than 1&#x000a0;month) physical or developmental disability/condition that precludes age-appropriate participation in routine physical activity are excluded.</p><p>This study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (Protocol 11&#x02013;1700).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>Participant recruitment is performed from a randomized list of overweight or obese patients who had a BMI measure recorded at least 9&#x000a0;months prior to study initiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Biologically implausible values for height or weight are excluded using a CDC-developed algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A research assistant contacts potential enrollees from the randomized list. Prior to the call, families are mailed a postcard with a brief description of the program and informed that they will soon be contacted. Once called, a bilingual English-Spanish research assistant explains the study to the family over the phone. If the family agrees to participate, the research assistant reads a verbal consent and documents consent. After oral consent is obtained, a baseline set of behavioral questions is administered. The survey is re-administered if more than 30&#x000a0;days have lapsed between the administration of the baseline survey and the start of the intervention. These baseline pre-intervention behaviors are compared with post-intervention and 6-month post-intervention behaviors recorded on subsequent questionnaires.</p><p>Study participants are told they will be scheduled to begin patient navigator visits in a staggered manner, using a stepped-wedge design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with individuals assigned to an intervention cohort to start the intervention. Those not enrolled in the initial intervention cohort are sent quarterly newsletters with information and resources unrelated to the intervention to keep participants connected to the study, during the delayed period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>At the beginning of the intervention, the patient navigator contacts a cohort of previously recruited families to schedule the first home visit. The first home visit is aimed at creating a positive rapport between the caregiver and the patient navigator and to set program expectations and goals. At this visit, the patient navigator sets lifestyle change and weight goals with families. The following talking points are used to explain the program&#x02019;s goals to families: 1) program goal is to help your preschooler grow at a healthy rate which means your child&#x02019;s weight will be matched well for height; 2) pre-school children who carry too much weight for good health can gradually become healthier by slowing the rate of weight gain and then holding their weight steady; 3) as your child grows taller the weight will better match the height and the risk of illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are expected to be lower than if the child remains obese into adulthood; 4) rarely should we expect preschoolers to lose weight, if they do, losing no more than one pound per month can be healthy and weight loss is usually not needed unless preschoolers are severely overweight; and 5) the best way to help preschoolers grow healthier is to practice healthy eating and exercise habits as a whole family. At this initial visit, the patient navigator administers a written consent, and a copy of the consent forms are provided to each family.</p><p>At each subsequent home visit, the patient navigator delivers a portion of the curriculum focused on parenting styles, nutrition, and/or physical activity to guide parents and children in selecting one goal for behavior change in each of the three areas to work on the following week. Families report progress towards these goals at the following session. Patient navigators exercise flexibility to change the order of the sessions, spending more or less time on a topic tailored to the family&#x02019;s level of understanding or mastery of skills. The full curriculum content is delivered regardless of the order of the sessions. Home visitation sessions usually occur on weekdays before 7:30&#x000a0;pm; occasionally the visits occur on Saturdays to accommodate the families&#x02019; schedules. The entire family, including siblings 3&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years of the index overweight or obese child, is invited to participate in the sessions.</p><p>A nurse-practitioner, leader of clinical obesity services for the Denver Health Community Health Services, is liaison to facilitate interactions between patient navigators and clinicians. Health care providers of the children participating in the program receive three letters throughout the program: 1) at enrollment, informing that the child started the program, 2) at mid-intervention, listing the child&#x02019;s progress and goals, and 3) at completion, summarizing the child&#x02019;s accomplishments, future goals and challenges in achieve current goals. These letters inform the provider during subsequent clinical visits to engage in discussion to support the family&#x02019;s achieving goals set with the patient navigators during the program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Curriculum</title><p>The curriculum used in this program was extensively adapted from a family-centered, telephone-delivered, childhood obesity treatment program developed by Kaiser Permanente &#x0201c;Family Connections&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The curriculum was roughly doubled in intensity and translated into 16 home/community visits that occur over a 25-hour period. The choice of curriculum components and mode of delivery was purposeful. To ensure cross-cultural acceptance of the intervention, the American Diabetes Association Latino Outreach Program was consulted during program adaptation. With assistance from the Latino Outreach Program, two focus groups with mothers and grandmothers of preschool aged-children were conducted. Based on feedback from the focus groups, curriculum tracks on parenting skills, helping preschoolers accept healthy foods, and hands-on cooking and shopping skills were added to the &#x0201c;Family Connections&#x0201d; curriculum by clinical experts who are part of the COOPT program.</p><p>The program curriculum focuses on nutrition, physical activities, and parenting skills delivered in the participant&#x02019;s home (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Topics include parenting styles (e.g. limit setting, conflict resolution) and skills for facilitating healthy behavior change (e.g. goal setting, troubleshooting, positive reinforcement) for parents of preschoolers. Nutrition education focuses on selecting healthy foods and healthy portions for the entire family. During family visits children participate in discussions designed to educate them about healthy foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins), at their developmental level.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Community Outreach Obesity Prevention Trial: Curriculum learning objectives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session no.</th><th>Theme</th><th>Learning objectives:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">1</td><td rowspan="7">Develop Rapport, Baseline Measurement; Explain 5-2-1-0 and Track Behaviors</td><td>1.

Primary care providers ideally would provide counseling for families with overweight and obese children, but clinicians have: 1) competing demands, 2) limited time, knowledge and resources, and 3) lack of in-depth nutrition and physical activities counseling skills. Culturally competent patient navigators trained in supporting lifestyle change may be an effective adjunct to clinically-based obesity management services for preschoolers.

This childhood obesity management program is delivered by patient navigators in a home setting. Patient navigators have a unique opportunity to develop a trusting relationship with families over a detailed 16-session curriculum around nutrition, physical exercises, and parenting skills, to assess the home food/exercise device environment, and to offer healthy recommendations for the families.</p><p>The study targets a low-income population who often experience social and environmental obstacles precluding a caregiver&#x02019;s ability to make healthy changes for their child. For families with limited budget, the patient navigators work with the families to choose alternative healthy and affordable foods. When family and environmental chaos (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]) is observed during home visits, the patient navigators have the opportunity to address them with the families or to provide resources to assist the families. At the end of each session, the patient navigators assess the parent&#x02019;s level of understanding of the session, the importance of the topic, and their confidence in making the proposed changes. At three points during the program (i.e., first session, mid-intervention, and last session), patient navigators assess parental readiness for change. Assessments at the end of each session, in conjunction with parental readiness to change, guide patient navigators to develop goals and objectives tailored to individual families&#x02019; needs and more likely to be achieved.</p><p>The study is innovative in its focus on preschool-aged, Latino children from low-income families; this population has not been typically targeted in obesity management programs. The study is also novel in the home-based intervention venue, which provides rich data about acceptance and characterization of barriers and facilitators of healthy change within the home. The home-based intervention links to clinical care through update/outcome letters and program impact assessments shared with medical providers. By informing primary care providers about a child&#x02019;s program accomplishments and challenges, the clinician may personalize messages with families during subsequent clinical visits.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COOPT</term><def><p>Community Outreach Obesity Prevention Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USPTF</term><def><p>US Preventive Services Task Force</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LY: Drafted, revised, and finalized manuscript; collaborated in the analysis of the results.
