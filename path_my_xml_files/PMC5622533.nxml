Persons living in these areas seem to face a variety of barriers accessing primary care service as they have low cancer screening rates, are least likely to have a regular primary care provider, and have the lowest average number of primary care visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Ontario, primary care providers (PCPs) typically provide screening for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer, and assessment and screening for cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. Despite increased funding for Patient Enrollment Models of primary care, and financial incentives to PCPs for cancer screening, access to primary care and participation in cancer screening in Ontario have not improved, particularly not in low imcome areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Two notable strategies have been previously implemented: 1) community health centres, targetting those with multiple morbidities in low income areas, and 2) incentive payments to primary care providers for cancer screening participation by their patients. However neither of these have had an impact on screening rates among low income areas overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The BETTER cluster randomized trial (BETTER&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Building on Existing Tools To Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening) intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] focused on evidence-based Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening (CDPS) activities identified by systematic literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A prevention practitioner (a new role undertaken by allied health professionals within a primary care practice) met in a personalized, one-on-one visit with participants to improve their uptake of CDPS activities. This intervention was demonstrated to be effective in a cluster randomized trial among primary care clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">This paper presents the plans for adaptation of the BETTER intervention for delivery to persons aged 40&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years living in low income communities by a public health unit, staffed by public health nurses who have experience in addressing social determinants of health, and who have received prevention practitioner training. Public health units in Ontario are focused on the prevention of acute and chronic diseases and have mandates to promote healthy lifestyles and activities as well as chronic disease screening; these units work alongside primary care providers and community health centres, but do not provide primary care services. The adaptation of BETTER will be evaluated qualitatively, and the effectiveness of the adapted intervention will be tested in a cluster randomized trial, among low income areas in Durham Region, Ontario. The rationale for adapting BETTER in the community and public health setting for residents of low income neighbourhoods is that their burden of chronic diseases and mortality is higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], participation in chronic disease screening is lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and primary care visits are fewer in such neighbourhoods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The rationale for the cluster randomized design is to account for the variable opportunities for CDPS actions among low income communities.</p><p id="Par19">The BETTER intervention was originally designed with several goals: to integrate the approach to CDPS actions, to optimize participation in evidence-based CDPS actions in primary care practices, and to create a feasible, evidence-based intervention to motivate participants to undertake CDPS actions for which they are eligible but not currently undertaking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The first BETTER cluster randomized trial compared the outcomes of the BETTER prevention practitioner intervention at the individual patient level within allocated clusters of PCPs, to outcomes within clusters of PCPs allocated to a six-month wait list control group.</p><p id="Par20">For each participant in the original BETTER trial, their status for each of 28 CDPS activities was determined at baseline. CDPS included process measures derived from the electronic medical record (EMR) such as the presence or absence of (1) biometrics (body mass index and blood pressure), (2) record of screening for alcohol, smoking, exercise and nutritional status, (3) uptake of glucose and lipid testing, (3) calculated Framingham score, and (4) results cancer screening (cervical, colorectal and breast). Eligibility for other CDPS actions, and their presence or absence, were determined from the information collected by a baseline health survey (e.g. family history, treatments for hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, cancer screening history, nutrition, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption). Six months after study entry, the status of each participant regarding each CDPS for which the participant was eligible was determined from the EMR and a followup health survey, capturing updated information for all of the above plus any referrals for, or participation in lifestyle-modifying behaviours that occurred during the previous six months.</p><p id="Par21">The BETTER intervention consisted of a one-on-one personalized meeting between a specially trained prevention practitioner and the participant. The prevention practitioner reviewed the status of all CDPS actions with the participant, using the Better Program visual aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and summarizing all CDPS actions for which the individual was eligible. Using principles of Brief Action Planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], shared decision making, and health coaching, the prevention practitioner empowered the individual to set a limited number of feasible, self-prioritized short term goals for accomplishing a limited number eligible CDPS actions during the following one or two weeks, summarized on a Goal Sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Even though the Brief Action Planning focuses on a limited number of short term goals, the longer term impact of the visit with the prevention practitioner was demonstrated by the large difference seven months later in the percentage of completed CDPS actions between those who received the intervention immediately and those who had been randomized to the wait-list control arm. The main outcome measure, a composite index score, consisted of the ratio (multiplied by 100) of the number of eligible CDPS actions at baseline (denominator) that have been accomplished at follow-up (numerator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the adjusted analysis, participants in the wait-list control clusters met 23.1% (95% CI: 19.2% to 27.1%) of target actions, compared to 55.6% (95% CI: 49.0% to 62.1%) met by those in the immediate intervention clusters <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This result was replicated in an implementation study (BETTER 2) among primary care practices in communities in Newfoundland; contextual factors, such as the health services environment, availability of resources, attributes of the individual prevention practitioners, and stakeholder engagement were found to have a strong influence on the success of implementation of the BETTER intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Training of prevention practitioners</title><p id="Par23">The BETTER intervention is supported by a training program for prevention practitioners, based on the BETTER tools including baseline and followup patient questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and visual aids for explaining CDPS activities and assisting the patient to set goals for accomplishing CDPS activities as prioritized by the participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. After their training, prevention practitioners discuss their experience with the BETTER intervention and Brief Action Planning among themselves, and with investigators or supervisors. Individuals may apply for certification in Brief Action Planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but there is no method for ongoing quantitative assessment of fidelity to the principles of Brief Action Planning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims of BETTER HEALTH: Durham</title><p id="Par24">The goal of &#x02018;BETTER HEALTH: Durham&#x02019; is to improve participation in CDPS actions in low income areas, by adapting the &#x02018;BETTER&#x02019; intervention for delivery by the Durham Region Health Department (public health unit), and testing the effectiveness of the adaptation in a cluster randomized trial.</p><p id="Par25">The specific objectives of BETTER HEALTH: Durham are:</p><p id="Par26">(1) To detect a 30% improvement in adherence to evidence-based CDPS actions among individual participants in intervention clusters, 6&#x000a0;months after the BETTER intervention, compared to individual participants in wait-list control clusters, as observed in the first BETTER cluster randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The 30% increase is measured by the composite BETTER index score and reflects eligible CDPS actions met within six months following enrollment, between the immediate intervention clusters compared to the &#x02018;wait-list&#x02019; control clusters (as achieved in the original BETTER cluster randomized trial).

What are the benefits and disadvantages of BETTER HEALTH: Durham?, and 5) How can the implementation of BETTER HEALTH: Durham be sustained?</p><p id="Par41">We will use a qualitative approach based on grounded theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to evaluate the adaptation and implementation of BETTER (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Grounded theory is a well-known qualitative method suited to examining processes, such as the adaptation of BETTER and the implementation of BETTER HEALTH: Durham in the context of a public health unit in low income areas.

Data collection strategies will include focus groups and one-to-one, semi-structured interviews with a range of participants: 1) members of the public eligible for BETTER who live in low income clusters that will not be participating as well as clusters that will be participating; 2) prevention practitioners who are providing the BETTER intervention; 3) Medical Officer of Health (MOH) and public health unit; 4) primary care providers; and 5) other community stakeholders. Interview guides will be based on the study objectives and revised periodically to seek contrasting and supporting data. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim and field notes will be created to document non-verbal and contextual information.
