The first insulin pen injector was introduced in the 1980s and was conceived combining insulin vial and syringe into a single component [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Advantages of insulin pens over syringes for outpatient care have been confirmed by numerous studies and are represented by ease of use, discretion of employ in public, ease in transport, reduction of time of therapy administration, reduction in fear of injection, greater accuracy in insulin dosage [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These benefits are associated with patient preference, treatment satisfaction, betterquality of life so as to improve adherence to insulin treatment and achieve better glycemic control [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite these arguments and the wide availability of pen devices, vial/syringe for subcutaneous insulin injection is still the preferred system for in-hospital insulin delivery, mainly due to direct costs [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and safety concerns both on the patients [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and on the healthcare professionals [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] sides.</p><p>In the light of the recent introduction on the market of more advanced safety features for pen devices, potentially reducing needlestick injury rates among healthcare professionals, new researches are needed to investigate the potential of insulin pens in the hospital setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2.</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The SANITHY (SAfety Needles and Insulin pens at Treviglio Hospital - ItalY) prospective study was designed to compare the use of prefilled insulin pens and novel safety needles with disposable traditional or safety syringes and insulin vials for the administration of insulin therapy in hospitalized patients with diabetes, in terms of costs, safety and satisfaction. In this paper, we report on economic outcomes, differentiating direct and indirect costs, as well as on patients&#x02019; safety and satisfaction. Patients on multiple daily injections according to &#x0201c;Basal Bolus&#x0201d; (which includes an injection of long-acting insulin and a rapid-acting analogue at each meal, to roughly emulate how a non-diabetic person's body delivers insulin) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or &#x0201c;Basal Plus&#x0201d; (<italic>i.e.</italic> an injection of long-acting analogue and correction with one pre-meal short-acting insulin) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were consecutively enrolled from three medical Units at medium/high level of care (<italic>i.e.</italic>: from standard to highly specialized intensity of medical care being provided by the physician or health care facility), Department of Internal Medicine, Treviglio General Hospital, Northern Italy, from October 2012 to April 2013, and from October to December 2013. All the enrolled patients received their personalized insulin treatment according to the study period, as follows. During the first three-month period (Phase I), conventional disposable syringes and 10mL insulin vials were used. Lyspro (Humalog<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was the rapid acting analogue, while Glargine (Lantus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was the basal one. In the successive three months (Phase II), prefilled insulin pens (Humalog KwikPen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Lantus SoloSTAR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and novel needlestick prevention devices (safety needles BD AutoShield Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were introduced. Finally, from October to December 2013 (Phase III) the same rapid acting or basal analogues were used with disposable safety-engineered insulin syringes with permanently attached needle (BD-Safety Glide Insulin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TNT: Tiny Needle Technology, 1 mL, 29 Gx1/2), recently introduced in Italy, in accordance with European Legislation 2010/32/UE [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At the beginning of the study the involved nurses received a specific training which included three theoretical-practical meetings, with interactive sessions, related to the use of the pen and the safety needle, with individual &#x0201c;mastery&#x0201d; testing of novel devices. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles, was approved by the Independent Ethical Committee of the Treviglio Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from every patient.</p><sec><label>2.1.</label><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec><title>Economic Outcomes</title><p>We collected information on direct and indirect costs related to in-hospital insulin treatment for each inpatient enrolled in the study. Direct costs included insulin, insulin administration devices (traditional syringes, pens with safety needles or safety syringes, according to the study phase), and blood glucose self-monitoring costs (test strips and lancets). Indirect costs included the costs of 4 days of insulin treatment supply at discharge, according to current Regional law which aims to ensure the continuity of care between hospital and territory [<italic>Delibera Regione Lombardia, DGR n&#x000b0; 5/12317 del 30/7/1991</italic>]. For each patient discharged alive, costs of discharge were referred to insulin vials (10mL; 1,000 insulin units each; 1 bran new vial of rapid acting analogue, and 1 of basal insulin) with 16 traditional disposable syringes for patients discharged in Phase I and III (in order to allow a maximum of 4 injection a day, at least for 4 days), and pre-filled pens (3mL; 300 insulin units each; pens were already individually &#x0201c;in use&#x0201d; during hospital stay; in few occasions, bran new pens were supplied: 1 of rapid acting analogue, and 1 of basal insulin), with 16 standard needles in Phase II (coverage of 4 days insulin treatment, as above indicated). Insulin wastage costs were estimated from the number of insulin units each patient was not likely to use at home, due to change in insulin delivery method or discontinuation of insulin treatment, before insulin expiration date (28 days). Given the lack of a European standardized price list, direct and indirect costs were taken from the official price list of the study Hospital. Finally, we added indirect costs related to nurses&#x02019; injuries. During the study period, we observed two needle-stick injuries, both in Phase I, corresponding to an injury rate of 0.31 per 1,000 injections with traditional syringes. Injury cost was fixed at &#x020ac; 850 from Italian available literature [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The total cost was the sum of direct, indirect, and injury costs.</p><sec><title>Patient Safety</title><p>Patients safety was defined in terms of mistakes in insulin administration (any error associated with insulin therapy, such as wrong dose, or wrong patient, or wrong insulin, or missing doses), and frequency of hypoglycemic (glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dl) and hyperglycemic (glucose &#x0003e;300 mg/dl) events occurred during the 3 study periods. These episodes were defined on the basis of fingerstick blood glucose monitoring, confirmed by plasma assay and reported on the nursing diary.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Satisfaction</title><p>Patient satisfaction degree to therapy was assessed through a questionnaire delivered to each patient (or care-giver) at discharge. For this purpose, the Italian version of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used. The questionnaire included 8 questions about the degree of satisfaction to insulin treatment performed during hospitalization, treatment safety in terms of correctness of the administered dose, injection aching, convenience of the used device, satisfaction in continuing at home with the device used during hospitalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The distribution of main demographic and clinical features of patients at hospital admission, and the length of in-hospital insulin treatment (in days) was summarized by means of descriptive statistics. We tested the null hypothesis of no difference among patients enrolled in the three study periods using F-tests, chi-square test, or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank test, for mean, prevalence and median values, respectively [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Direct costs are reported as median (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentile) cost per patient (&#x020ac;/patient) for a 10-day in-hospital insulin treatment (median length). A common length was chosen since it differed among the three study periods (see Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Differences between insulin pens and traditional or safety syringes were tested using the Wilcoxon rank test. A total median cost for 10-day insulin treatment was the sum of direct, indirect and injuries costs. Patient safety was defined as the prevalence of patients reporting episodes of hypo- or hyperglycemia; differences in the three study phases were tested using a chi-square test. The patient satisfaction questionnaire was distributed to all enrolled patients in a given study period, only once in case of repeated admission in the same study phase (n=12 patients). N=5 patients were lost at discharge, while n=40 patients did not complete the questionnaire due to either medical conditions (Alzheimer's, dementia, encephalopathy, stroke or coma; n=37), or to poor Italian knowledge (n=3). For this analysis, phase I and III patients were considered together, as both received insulin via syringes. The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha metric [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was 0.76 and 0.82 in the syringe and pen groups respectively, suggesting a satisfactory internal consistency of compilation. For each item, we compared the prevalence of patients answering &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; in the syringe/insulin pen groups, by means of a chi-square test adjusting for age, sex and diabetes duration. In a sensitivity analysis, we replicated the analysis by considering only those patients who did not use syringes or pens at hospital admission. All the analyses were conducted using the SAS software, 9.2 release.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><label>3.</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 363 patients were enrolled: 122, in Phase I (usual treatment group, receiving vial/traditional syringe system); 112, in Phase II (prefilled pen/safety needle group); and 129, in Phase III (vial/safety syringe system). Three patients were dropped out either in Phase I (use of insulin pens, n=2) or in Phase II (pen refusal, n=1), leaving a total size of 360 patients for the analyses. Table <bold>1</bold> shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients, according to the study phase. Age (mean 75.6 years), gender (55% men), duration of diabetes (57% more than 10 years) and treatment at admission (60% insulin users, only 3% on traditional syringes) did not differ among the study periods (all p-values &#x0003e;0.1). However, patients enrolled in Phase III had a better glycometabolic control at admission (lower HbA1c, p-value &#x0003c;0.0001, and reduced fasting plasma glucose, p=0.002); 75% of them were enrolled in the internal medicine unit, vs. 48% and 46% in Phase I and II, respectively (p-value&#x0003c;0.0001). Nevertheless, in-hospital death prevalence did not change significantly in the three periods (p=0.3), nor did the distribution of the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs), a proxy of comorbidities (data not shown). Finally, the median length of in-hospital insulin treatment was 12 days in Phase I, significantly longer than in the remaining two periods (p=0.01).</p><sec><title>Economic Outcomes</title><p>Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold> reports the median direct and indirect costs per patient of 10-day in-hospital insulin treatment, according to insulin delivery device, as well as two p-values testing the difference in median costs between pen devices with traditional and safety syringes, respectively. Direct insulin costs were higher in the group of pens (20.1 &#x020ac;/patient) compared to the groups treated with syringes (traditional syringe: 6.5&#x020ac;/patient; safety syringe: 5.1&#x020ac;/patient; both p-values &#x0003c;.0001). Direct costs of insulin pen devices were 22.9&#x020ac;/patient, higher than both costs of traditional syringe (11.5&#x020ac;/patient, p&#x0003c;.0001) and safety syringe (16.4&#x020ac;/patient, p&#x0003c;.0001). In contrast, indirect costs at discharge were higher in the two syringe groups, with a median cost of 50.9&#x020ac;/patient vs. 0.8&#x020ac;/patient in the insulin pen group (both p-values&#x0003c;0.0001). Of note, the estimated costs of insulin wasting cover about 50% of the supply in the syringe groups. Total costs (direct + indirect) for 10-days of in-hospital treatment were significantly lower for insulin pens vs. traditional syringes (45.8&#x020ac;/patient vs. 68.2&#x020ac;/patient, p=0.02), while the difference in median costs with safety syringes was not significant (45.8&#x020ac;/patient vs. 71.4&#x020ac;/patient, p=0.08). Finally, when injury costs were taken into account for the traditional syringe group, the median saving for 10-days insulin treatment with insulin pens was as high as 31.8&#x020ac;/patient (p&#x0003c;.0001).</p><p>p-value testing the difference in the prevalence of episodes of hypo- or hyperglycemia among the three groups, adjusted for age, sex and diabetes duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Safety</title><p>No insulin-related medication errors, no &#x0201c;missing doses&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;near-miss&#x0201d; events were reported in all groups, during observational study time. A total number of 36 patients (10%) reported at least one episode of hypoglycemia during hospital stay, with no significant differences according to the treatment group (p-value 0.3; Table <bold>3</bold>). The prevalence of patients with at least one episode of hyperglycemia was 27% (98/360), but no significant differences were reported among the three study phases (p=0.3; Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Satisfaction</title><p>Table <bold>4</bold> reports the prevalence of &#x0201c;satisfied&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; answers to each of the 8 items of the satisfaction questionnaire, according to insulin treatment device. After adjustment for age, gender and diabetes duration, statistically significant differences emerged for almost all of the answers given by patients between the 2 groups. In particular, patients in the pen group were more satisfied with the treatment received (94.7% vs 61.7%, p&#x0003c;.0001), considering the method used for insulin therapy easier/comfortable (85% vs 40.7%, p&#x0003c;.0001); they were more satisfied to continue at home with the devices used in hospital (74.2% vs 12.4% p&#x0003c;.0001), and would recommend the insulin administration method used during hospitalization to other patients with diabetes (89.3% vs 38.9%, p&#x0003c;.0001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to the answers to question about the correctness of the administered dose (p=0.1) or aching at the injection&#x02019;s site (p=0.3). These findings were largely confirmed also in the subgroup of newly insulin users: satisfaction for insulin pens was still as high as 92%, and 56% of patients would likely continue using pens at home, vs. 7% in the vial/syringe group (p-value &#x0003c;0.0001).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><label>4.</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the SANITHY study, the direct costs of in-hospital insulin therapy with the innovative needlestick prevention devices (pre-filled pens/safety needles, and vial/disposable safety syringes) were higher than with the traditional system (vials/disposable syringes). Both safety needles and insulin pens impacted the direct costs quite equally. Conversely, the vial system (either with or without safety syringes) allows the use of a single vial for multiple patients (in accordance with Italian legislation), with a considerably saving of costs. In addition, pens not completely used (and not given to patients at discharge) may be considered a cause of a relative &#x0201c;wastage&#x0201d; of insulin during hospitalization which, although small, should be taken into account: this is true for all those patients who discontinue brief insulin treatment (therapeutic choice, deaths, etc.). In contrast, the use of vial system does not always involve any waste, if we consider departments with a high turnover of diabetic patients. In a similar study, conducted by Davis in 2008 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which aimed to compare the use of insulin pens to syringes in a hospital setting, it was found a savings of $ 36 per patient using pens compared to syringes, but it should be noted that in their experience, risk management did not allow the use of the same vial for more than one patient. Insulin pens had considerably lower costs at discharge, leading to an overall saving of 20 &#x020ac;/patient if these were taken into account. At discharge, the use of vials and syringes is not reasonable because of higher costs (for the Hospital) in supplying bran new vials to released patients, in accordance to local Regional laws. In contrast, in-hospital pen utilization provides the greatest savings at discharge, because each subject received his own pen, with no additional costs for the hospital.</p><p>Thus our findings suggest that a selective use of insulin pens for diabetic patients who are likely to continue insulin treatment at home may lead to a reduction of in-hospital costs. These patients were as frequent as more than 75% of our diabetic in-patients, in medical Units at medium/high level of care, but differences may be considered in other Units, depending on the percentage of &#x0201c;critically&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;non-critically&#x0201d; ill patients.</p><p>In-hospital use of pen/safety needle devices resulted in a greater satisfaction for patients (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref></bold>), confirming the findings from the out-patient setting [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In particular, patients in the pen group were more satisfied with the treatment received, considered the method easier/more comfortable, retained the injections less aching, would recommend other diabetic patients to receive the same treatment, and were more satisfied to continue at home with the devices used in the hospital. These findings were largely confirmed in the subgroup of newly insulin users, <italic>i.e.</italic> with no previous familiarity with the insulin delivery method, and could therefore be generalized to different contexts where the prevalence of insulin pen users in the out-of-hospital setting is lower than in our study population. Since satisfaction is related to compliance [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the use of pens at discharge may enhance adherence to treatment.</p><p>Safety is a major concern for insulin pens in hospital. The use of pens/safety needles in hospital setting was found to be safe, avoiding the risk of needlestick injury, allowing workers' health safeguard, being cost saving without any related adverse event. In fact, in case of accidental injury with a contaminated sharp, even in the case in which the injured operator did not contract any disease, the management cost of each individual injury is valued about &#x020ac; 850 (analysis on the source patient, monitoring of the operator, any prophylaxis, etc..) for a total costs, in Italy, of &#x020ac; 72 million a year: resources that could be reasonably invested in preventing needlestick injuries rather than groped to limit damage [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This issue is clearly of great interest in diabetes: both patients and care-givers are exposed daily and several times a day to the risk of unexpected needlestick injury with contaminated needles, and therefore potentially infectious. A relatively higher risk of needlestick injuries, for example, was reported among acute care nurses caring for diabetic patients and injecting insulin with a disposable syringe; additionally, it was revealed a significant derived emotional distress, suggesting possible under-reporting of needlestick injuries to hospital officials, so demonstrating the need for a more effective needle safety device [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the UK, the economic burden of needlestick injuries costs the National Health System approximately &#x000a3; 600,000 per annum; many of these injuries and associated costs could be avoided through increased adoption of safety devices [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to an Italian study, in 2006 with the adoption of appropriate prevention plans, training and introduction of secure devices could have saved up to 53,000 accidents in biohazard, up to 550,000 hours and nearly 16,000 lost work days of illness [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Regarding diabetes related safety devices, pen needles should be equipped with a double interlock, one that covers the portion of needle in contact with the patient (patient end), and the other that covers the back of the needle (cartridge end). Non safety pen needles, indeed, may cause needlestick injuries, and insulin pens were considered the major instrument involved with unsafe needle-handling practices in nursing homes [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, to fully protect patients and health workers, adequate nurses training is essential to eliminate the risk of transmission of infectious diseases associated with pens misuse. In fact, more than 700 patients in New York hospitals may have been exposed inadvertently to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C because of reuse of insulin pens on multiple patients after changing the disposable needle [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Patient notification events resulting from multipatient use of insulin pens in U.S. health care settings were recently summarized [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is unquestionable that each pen is absolutely for personal usage only, and it must be labeled with the name of the patient; in fact, in the final phase of insulin delivery, an aspiration of material occurs: this may contaminate the pen, as shown by several observations, and also in a recent study who demonstrated trace of biological contamination (hemoglobin, squamous epithelial cells, macrophages and RBC) in the pen after use [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As recommended by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, all the study nurses performed a training period before using pens, which also included a hands-on individual testing of devices. Even a low number of un-trained nurses is enough to generate serious damage [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Finally, dosing accuracy, in particular at low-doses, is another point to be taken into account [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. About 77% of the study nurses felt more confident about correct dose using pens than using syringes, and several aspects of dose preparation and administration were a key factor for nurses&#x02019; satisfaction [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Among the points of weakness of our study, we underline that only Internal Medicine Units were involved, and we recognize that a larger portion of patients from Phase III were discharged from Internal Medicine/Urgent Care group. It would be interesting to extend such an experience to other Emergency Units as well as to Surgical Units, where diabetic patients usually have a shorter length of hospitalization. Besides, we performed short observational periods (a quarter each Phase). Finally, this study findings (related to Lombardia Region) are difficult to be generalized, even in Italy and, moreover, in other Countries. However, as points of strengths, we performed, first in Italy, a complete study of a model for introducing prefilled pens in hospital settings, with a complete study organization and design, based on education and training for all the involved nurses. We were also able to record a full customer satisfaction (both for nurses and for patients), and we took into account a complete costs description (direct costs: in-hospital and at-discharge insulin utilization and wastage, treatment and blood glucose monitoring devices; indirect costs: needlestick injuries). Finally, we were aware of errors in insulin therapy and near miss events, which should have importance (if any) in total cost evaluation.</p><p>In conclusion, in our study the use of insulin pens with dual-ended safety needles was found to be safe for both nurses and patients. In-hospital use of vial/syringes with safety needles in diabetic patients who are likely to dis-continue treatment at home should be preferred, as it does not involve wastage during hospitalization. These re-presented about 25% of hospitalized patients in the investigated hospital units. For the remaining patients, the use of insulin pens may reduce total hospital costs. Finally, the use of insulin pens at discharge for all insulin-treated patients involves considerable savings, increases compliance and satisfaction, enhancing adherence to treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The Authors are deeply in debt with all the nurses involved in the study, as well as with Colleagues and healthcare professionals of the Department of Medical Science, Treviglio Hospital.
