The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the immunophenotyping and efficacy of lower dose ATG in low immunological-risk kidney transplant recipients. In this prospective study, 45 patients were randomized (1&#x02236;1) to our standard dose ATG (total dose 3.75 mg/kg)(sATG) vs. lower dose 2.25 mg/kg (lowATG). All patients underwent early steroid withdrawal within 7 days. The primary end point was biopsy-proven acute rejection at 12 months. Prospective immunophenotyping of freshly isolated PBMCs was performed at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months post-transplant. The rate of acute rejection was 17% and 10% in the sATG and lowATG, respectively. Effector memory T cells, Tregs and recent thymic emigrants T cells had similar kinetics post-transplant in both groups. No statistically significant differences were found in graft survival, patient survival or infections between the two groups, though there was a non-significant increase in leukopenia (43%v s. 30%), CMV (8% vs. 0) and BK (4% vs. 0) infections in sATG group vs. lowATG. In sum, in low immunological risk kidney recipients undergoing steroid withdrawal, low dose ATG seems to be efficacious in preventing acute rejection and depleting T cells with potentially lower infectious complications. A larger study is warranted to confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00548405">NCT00548405</ext-link>

Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG or Thymoglobulin) is the most common induction agent used in renal transplantation and is used in more than 55% of kidney transplants in the USA, despite not being FDA-approved for this use <xref rid="pone.0104408-Matas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ATG causes T-cell depletion by inducing complement-dependent cell lysis. It also modulates cell surface and adhesion molecules that regulate T-cell function and leukocyte endothelial interactions, respectively <xref rid="pone.0104408-Halloran1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Kirk1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Thiyagarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Induction therapy with ATG results in a lower acute rejection rate, but is also associated with a higher risk of infections and malignancies <xref rid="pone.0104408-MeierKriesche2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104408-Thibaudin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. An ATG dosage of 6&#x02013;10 mg/kg has traditionally been the standard of care in most transplant centers in the USA <xref rid="pone.0104408-Thiyagarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104408-Karen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. ATG has been widely studied in the cyclosporine and low-dose steroid maintenance era, however the optimal dosage of ATG in the setting of tacrolimus use and steroid withdrawal has not been determined.</p><p>Our transplant center utilizes 3.75 mg/kg of ATG as induction in both deceased and living donor renal transplantation. Because of drug acquisition costs, risks of malignancies and infections, it is imperative to find the minimum effective dose of ATG that still allows for minimization of maintenance immunosupression. Moreover, the expansion of steroid withdrawal regimens urges a reassessment of optimal ATG dosage. Our hypothesis is that lower ATG dose is effective and safe in non-sensitized renal transplant recipients undergoing steroid withdrawal. Herein, we report an open-label, single-center prospective randomized pilot study comparing two lower dosage ATG regimens (3.75 mg/kg vs. 2.25 mg/kg) in low immunological risk recipients who underwent steroid withdrawal and maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patient selection</title><p>This is a prospective, open-label, single center randomized pilot study in adult renal transplant recipients at Lahey Clinic Medical Center, Burlington, MA.

Despite more than 20 years of clinical use, its optimal dose is still controversial, in particular in the setting of steroid withdrawal.</p><p>For the evaluation of efficacy and safety, multiple trials have been conducted to optimize ATG dosage <xref rid="pone.0104408-Hardinger2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The initial trials used relatively high cumulative doses of ATG of 10.5 mg/kg with cyclosporine and low-dose steroids maintenance regimen <xref rid="pone.0104408-Brennan2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Vincenti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, followed by efforts to reduce the dosage of ATG. Recently published observational study using ATG induction registry of 2,322 living donor kidney transplants from 49 different centers reported that the mean cumulative dose was 5.29 mg/kg, with 93.6% rejection free survival at 5 years. The registry consisted of a heterogeneous group of patients and the majority of them were receiving low dose steroids long-term <xref rid="pone.0104408-Gaber1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, leading to difficulties in extrapolating the results to this specific subgroup of patients. Another recent 10-year follow-up study using an early steroid withdrawal reported the use of a total dose 6.25&#x02013;7.5 mg/kg of thymoglobulin <xref rid="pone.0104408-Rizzari1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Wong <italic>et al</italic>. compared different cumulative dosages of thymoglobulin (3.0 mg/kg vs 4.5 mg/kg), and showed no statistically significant difference in acute rejection rate and graft function up to 24 months post transplantation <xref rid="pone.0104408-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Though it was relatively small study (7 vs. 9 patients in each arm) and all patients were continued on steroids, this encouraged us to further reduce thymoglobulin dosage in our transplant program.</p><p>Our study showed that a lower dose of 2.25 mg/kg of ATG was safe and effective in preventing acute rejection in combination with early steroid withdrawal in our non-sensitized kidney transplant cohort. This dose was about 1/3 of the commonly used dose of ATG in most centers. Two cardiovascular deaths with functioning grafts in the lowATG group were likely to have occurred by chance despite randomization, and were unlikely related to difference in ATG dose given. The barely significant increase in CAD history in the low ATG group also supports this hypothesis. In addition, we observed a non-significant reduction in the incidence of leukopenia, CMV and BK infections in lowATG arm, suggesting possible benefit from lower dose ATG. In contrary, DGF was more common in the lowATG group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). Reviewing <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104408-t001">Table 1</xref>, we observe a non-significant trend towards higher proportion of ECD kidneys and greater mean cold ischemia time in the lowATG group (30% vs 17% and 433 vs 378 min, p&#x0003e;0.05). Since prior data from larger randomized trials did not show lower DGF in ATG compared to other induction therapies (18), it is hard to conclude the significance of these findings in this smaller cohort. Despite that, the absence of primary graft losses on both groups and the good renal function at 12 months are reassuring. Although this report is an exploratory data with small number of cases, these are encouraging results that must be further validated in a larger trial. Since study conclusion, Lahey Clinic has now adopted the lower dose ATG as standard of care in non-sensitized transplant recipients.</p><p>Aside from ATG, other induction agents such as basiliximab (anti-IL2 receptor mAb, Novartis) or alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 mAb, Berlex Laboratories) have been used in combination with tacrolimus maintenance and steroid withdrawal. One of the largest prospective trials on steroid withdrawal reported that the rejection rate was higher with basiliximab compared to ATG (24.2% vs 14.4%), though long-term graft outcomes were similar <xref rid="pone.0104408-Woodle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Alemtuzumab has been tested on a recent randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing steroid withdrawal and was found to be associated with lower rates of acute rejection when compared to basiliximab in low-risk recipients, though late rejections were more common in the alemtuzumab group (1&#x02013;3 years after transplant) <xref rid="pone.0104408-Hardinger3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This is a concern since the follow-up of transplant recipients tends to be less frequent after the first year of transplantation and a rejection episode may go unnoticed for few months.</p><p>In face of the increased budget constraints that transplant centers and hospitals are undergoing and the huge expense that ATG accounts for, reduction of ATG dose could have an important financial benefit and a possible cost-reduction of &#x0223c;U$3,000/patient could be obtained by reducing the ATG dose from our standard protocol (3.75 mg/kg total) to the study dose of 2.25 mg/kg total. Although basiliximab is less expensive (&#x0223c;$4,000 per patient) than ATG, it is a relatively less potent immunosuppressant and is associated with a higher rate of rejection in patients that undergo steroid withdrawal <xref rid="pone.0104408-Woodle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Alemtuzumab costs less as well ($1,689 for the recommended single dose of 30 mg) and requires shorter hospital stay, given its use as a one-time dose at the time of transplant. However, alemtuzumab is associated with significantly more prolonged T cell depletion, which may require years to recover <xref rid="pone.0104408-Hardinger2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Kirk2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, Alemtuzumab may promote the development of donor-specific antibodies through its significant effect on B cells subsets <xref rid="pone.0104408-Todeschini1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Nevertheless, thymoglobulin and alemtuzumab had similar patient and graft outcomes in recent randomized trials <xref rid="pone.0104408-Farney1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Hanaway1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In sum, ATG seems to be the preferred induction agent for patients undergoing steroid withdrawal.</p><p>Immune reconstitution after administration of T-cell depletion by thymoglobulin is also of great interest, in particular with experimental evidence suggesting that it may promote tolerance through the induction and expansion of Tregs <xref rid="pone.0104408-DAddio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Gurkan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In children, thymopoiesis plays an important role in the reconstitution of T cells after ATG depletion, while in adults, homeostatic proliferation is dominant due to the progressive atrophy of thymus with age <xref rid="pone.0104408-Gurkan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104408-Tchao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This homeostatic proliferation is predominantly an IL-7 mediated process, enabling T-cell clone which survived depletion to expand. Recent thymic emigrants (RTE) are a subset of T cells that proliferates in response to IL-7 in the apparent absence of other stimulation and may play an important role in the lymphocyte reconstitution after T-cell depletion <xref rid="pone.0104408-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our findings suggest that both higher and lower dose ATG significantly reduce the RTE subset and this subset remains lower than at baseline even 12 months following transplantation, though there was a trend towards greater reduction in the sATG group. This may allude to some long-term consequences of ATG in the homeostasis of T cell subsets and using a lower dose may have potential to limit that. It is clear that immunosuppression has this cumulative effect and once given, it is not possible to take it back and long-term consequences in the immune system are seeing decades to come. In face of our overall prolongation of survival, it is critical to minimize the life-immunosuppression dose.</p><p>The limitations of our study include the small number of patients, the predominance of Caucasians, the lack of blinding, the absence of protocol biopsies and the exclusion of sensitized recipients. A longer follow up would also be necessary to fully elucidate the impact of ATG dose on the malignancy rate.</p><p>In conclusion, low-dose ATG (2.25 mg/kg) is a promising option as an induction therapy in low-risk patients with no significant differences in acute rejection or graft function when compared to sATG (3.75 mg/kg), and with possibly less leukopenia and infectious complications. In addition, our peripheral blood cell analyses showed similar T cell depletion efficiency with the lower dose ATG. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104408.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
