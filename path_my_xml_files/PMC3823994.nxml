In China, hypertension accounts for 40% of the deaths and 23% of the health care costs <xref rid="pone.0078963-China1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Meta-analysis has indicated the causal link between salt intake and high blood pressure. A meta-analysis of randomized trial demonstrated that a reduction of salt intake to 6 g/day would lower BP by 7/4 mmHg in hypertensives and 4/2 mmHg in normotensives <xref rid="pone.0078963-He2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In another meta-analysis, a reduction of 100 mmol in daily urinary sodium excretion, that is a reduction of 5.9 g in daily salt intake, would decrease systolic blood pressure by an average of 3.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 0.9 mmHg in hypertensive subjects <xref rid="pone.0078963-Holbrook1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Population-based intervention studies have also shown the effect of salt intake on blood pressure, among which, the most successful one conducted in Portugal achieved a difference of 13/6 mmHg in BP between two groups after two years&#x02019; salt-reduction intervention <xref rid="pone.0078963-Forte1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>However, the current situation of salt intake is not satisfactory. According to a survey conducted in Beijing, the estimated average daily salt intake in 2008 was 9.70 for urban residents and 13.28 for rural residents <xref rid="pone.0078963-Yuqing1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A recent study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association stated that the mean sodium intake of Chinese was 3991 mg/person/day (equivalent to mean salt intake of 10.15 g/person/day), and the mean northern sodium intake was 4733 mg/person/day, notably higher than southern 2491 mg/person/day (equivalent to mean salt intake of 12.04 g/person/day and 6.34 g/person/day, respectively) <xref rid="pone.0078963-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A study conducted in Beijing shown the median salt intake of residents aged over 6 to be 12.1 g, higher than the national level <xref rid="pone.0078963-Jun1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Another survey conducted in Beijing stated that the salt intake was 165.79 mmol for urban residents and 226.80 for rural residents <xref rid="pone.0078963-Yuqing1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast with western countries, most (76%) dietary sodium was from the salt added in home cooking <xref rid="pone.0078963-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, so a public campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt <xref rid="pone.0078963-He2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The Chinese government has taken some measures to reduce the average salt intake from home cooking, among which, salt-restriction spoon is a commonly adopted one. With a 5 cm handle, a 1.1 cm caliber, and a volume to hold 2 g salt, the salt-restriction-spoon was designed to help people calculate the amount of salt they used. For example, a family with four members should eat no more than 24 g salt per day, equal to 12 spoons of salt. So the housewife should use 4 spoons of salt per meal.</p><p>Unfortunately, many people who have received the salt-restriction spoons do not use them or cannot use them correctly. A survey conducted in Beijing indicated that the owning rate, using rate and correctly using rate of salt-restriction spoon were 61.8%, 47.7% and 17.1% respectively, and that 69.7% of those who did not use a salt-restriction spoon considered the current spoons to be inconvenient for use <xref rid="pone.0078963-Wenlan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The previous survey conducted by our research group shown that the receiving rate and using rate of salt-restriction spoon were 72.1% and 32% respectively, and 77.5% of the respondents did not know the right usage of salt-restriction spoon <xref rid="pone.0078963-Peoples1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. According to these two surveys, the first three reasons for not using a salt-restriction spoon were: (1) the spoon was not convenient for use, (2) citizens did not realize the importance of salt reduction and (3) citizens were not willing to abandon the habit of eating salty food <xref rid="pone.0078963-Wenlan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078963-Peoples1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The features that made the salt-restriction spoon so unwelcome included: (1) the diameter of the spoon was too small, (2) the handle of the spoon was too short, and (3) the unbent handle made it not pleasing to the eyes <xref rid="pone.0078963-Wenlan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078963-Peoples1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078963-Na1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. According to our previous analysis, objective barrier of salt-reduction, such as the design defects of a spoon, was the most important determinants of salt-restriction-spoon using behavior <xref rid="pone.0078963-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Since that people&#x02019;s unwillingness to use the salt-restriction spoon can be largely attribute to the design defects that make it inconvenient for use, and that rural residents&#x02019; salt intake situation is more worrying as compared to urban residents, this study was designed to improve the current salt-restriction-spoon, and to evaluate the effect of the improved salt-restriction spoon on the attitude of salt-restriction, the using rate of salt-restriction-spoon, the actual amount of salt intake, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (24HUNa) of rural residents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Written informed consent from all the participants was obtained at enrolment, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee on Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects of the Health Science Center, Peking University.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>Conducted during JUN 2012 and JAN 2013 in the suburban area of Beijing, this community intervention study lasted for 7 months, with 1 month to collect the baseline information and 6 month to evaluate the effect of intervention.

The participants were entitled with the right to withdraw from the study whenever and for whatever reason. &#x0201c;Salt weighting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;urine collecting&#x0201d; were not compulsory, so data on salt and 24HUNa were not collected for all the participants, and the number of people participated in &#x0201c;salt weighting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;urine collecting&#x0201d; differed at each visit. At each follow-up visit, only those who had their salt weighted can have their urine collected and finish the questionnaire (at final survey), therefore, the number of participants in corresponding groups who had their salt weighted was more than those who had their urine collected and those who finished the final questionnaire survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078963-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Neither salt tracking nor 24-hour urine collecting is an easy work, especially for such a long time. In order to make the data as accurate as possible, we tried to help the participants to comply with our work by giving them a user-friendly record, reminding them to record the right information, and calling them before the day of urine collection in case that they forget to collect 24-hour urine. Previous study in 2008 has shown that the 24UHNa for people in urban areas, suburban areas and rural areas of Beijing were 165.79 mmol, 200.43 mmol and 226.80 mmol <xref rid="pone.0078963-Yuqing1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our survey site was located in the suburban area of Beijing, and the baseline 24HUNa for our participants was near to that in the previous study, indicating that the data collected in this study was reliable. The baseline daily salt intake was 7.65 g for the intervention group and 7.49 g for the control group, equal to a sodium intake of 130.77 mmol and 128.03 mmol. The reason that the amount of sodium intake was less than the amount of sodium excretion is because that only salt, the main source of sodium, was weighted in our study, but there are still other sources of sodium such as soy sauce, sodium bicarbonate, salted eggs, monosodium glutamate, and so on <xref rid="pone.0078963-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>At the level of perception, it&#x02019;s not surprising that only the scores of objective barriers and cues to action were significantly increased for the intervention group as compared to the control group, since that our intervention measures focused on reducing the objective barriers of salt reduction by giving the participants in the intervention group an improved salt-restriction-spoon and teaching them how to use it. Previous studies have found barriers to be one of the most important predictors of health behaviors, so reducing barriers of salt-reduction would bring us closer to the success in promoting people&#x02019;s health behavior <xref rid="pone.0078963-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with the reduced objective barrier and increased cues to action, more participants in the intervention group used the improved salt-restriction-spoon frequently and correctly, indicating that the intervention measures were effective in changing one&#x02019;s behavior. It could be considered to popularize the improved salt-restriction-spoon in other places, as well as other countries where the salt intake of people comes mainly from home cooking, such as those located in Africa <xref rid="pone.0078963-Cappuccio1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It should be noted that nearly half of those who used a salt-restriction-spoon frequently used it correctly after intervention, which means that our health education was far from enough.</p><p>The salt intake mentioned in this paper refers to the salt added in home cooking, not including that from other sources, such as pickles, soy sauce, monosodium glutamate etc. The increase in salt intake from summer to autumn and the decrease in salt intake from autumn to winter may be attributed to the seasonal factors. In summer, Chinese people like to eat porridge with pickles. In autumn, large amount of salt may be used to preserve vegetables for people to eat in winter, which is especially true for rural areas in Northern China, because it&#x02019;s inconvenient for people there to grow or bur fresh vegetables in winter. Based on the above-mentioned factors, it&#x02019;s reasonable that the salt used in summer and winter was less than that in autumn. Ruling out the influence of the seasonal factors, the more obvious salt reduction for the intervention group supported the effect of the intervention measures.</p><p>As to the results of 24HUNa, the most probable reason for the baseline 24HUNa in the control group being quite high compared to the intervention group would be that participants in the control group were relatively younger than those in the intervention group. As mentioned in the result, 24HUNa was negatively correlated with age. This may be attributed to the better health awareness of the older people who have received large amount of health education and experienced the pain of illnesses. The lower baseline salt intake for the control group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078963-g002">Figure 2</xref> does not mean that participants in the control group took less sodium, because only the kitchen salt added in home cooking was weighted. Younger people may eat more condiment as compared to the older ones, therefore, it is not surprising that the baseline 24HUNa was obviously higher but the baseline salt intake was slightly lower for the control group than for the intervention group.</p><p>Although no significant difference was observed in the change of 24HUNa between the two groups, it does not mean that our intervention measures were ineffective. Because the participants in the intervention group and the control group lived in the same village, there would be information contamination between the two groups. In addition, even if no intervention measures were given to the control group, the fact that our investigators went to their home to weight salt and collect urine every one or two months would make them more conscious of the role of salt in one&#x02019;s health, and thus inevitably remind them to seek for more information on salt, and consequently change their salt-reduction behavior. In addition, some participants in the control group who asked about the laboratory report were also informed of their 24HUNa, which is another factor that may reduce their salt intake. Another survey in which the net intervention effect was a non-significant change in sodium excretion also mentioned these possibilities <xref rid="pone.0078963-Tuorila1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that the results of salt intake and 24HUNa over the duration of study were discrepant. The measured salt intake increased but the 24HUNa decreased from September to November, and similarly, the measured salt intake decreased but the 24HUNa didn&#x02019;t from November to January. As mentioned above, this may probably because that some salt was used to preserve vegetables in autumn, and the preserved vegetables were eaten in winter. Since that a large part of the preserved vegetables had not been eaten in autumn, the amount of salt that had been eaten during autumn was actually less than that had been used during this period of time. In winter, less fresh and more preserved vegetables would consumed, leading to a reduction of salt added in home cooking, but not a reduction in 24HUNa. In consideration of these factors, the results of 24HUNa would be more reliable. Assuming that similar proportions of salt were used to preserve vegetables between the two groups, the more obvious reduction in the intervention group compared to the control group at least indicated that the salt added in home cooking was reduced as compared to the control group.</p><p>The results that the participants in the intervention group used significantly less salt but did not excrete significantly less urine salt suggested that the improved salt-restriction-spoon did reduce the salt added in home cooking, but did not reduce the salt from other sources. Although an exchange table for calculating the amount of salt in other sources was printed on the side surface of the salt shaker, the print problem make it difficult for the residents to read these information, In addition, we did not emphasized enough on reducing the salt from other sources. Before the improved salt-reduction-spoon was promoted in larger geographic areas, it should be made to be with higher quality, and with a corresponding instruction for use.</p><p>Changing one dietary habit is not an easy work <xref rid="pone.0078963-Tuorila1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Salt-reduction-spoon is just a tool for helping people calculating the amount of salt and reminding them the importance of salt reduction. Based on the results of this study, the improvements on the spoon did enhance the using rate and correctly using rate, and reduce people&#x02019;s salt intake, but it&#x02019;s far from enough to just rely on this simple tool. Even if the residents added less salt in home cooking, they will eat more salt in other ways if their taste keeps unchanged. Therefore, other combined approach, such as low-sodium salt and health education, should be carried out simultaneously with the improved salt-restriction-spoon. What&#x02019;s more, the change in taste needs long-term intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This is the first attempt of tracking the salt consumption of so many people for such a long time, including the first months to collect the baseline salt intake and the later six months to collect the salt intake during the intervention period. In addition, the 24HUNa was collected at four time points. This program was complex and beset by many practical difficulties, but efforts were made to overcome these difficulties and important findings were produced. The evaluation at four levels, namely the awareness of salt reduction, the salt-reduction behavior, the actual salt intake and the 24HUNa, could reflect the interventional effect more comprehensively.</p><p>There were several limitations to our study. First, the participants in the intervention group and the control group lived in the same place, causing information contamination to this study, which is probably a reason for the reduction of 24HUNa in the control group. For the sake of ethics requirements, the participants in the control group could be informed of the result of 24HUNa if they took the initiative to ask about it, which may be another reason for the reduction of 24HUNa in the control group. The above-mentioned two points may underestimate the intervention effect. Second, the salt added in home cooking was used to represent the salt intake of people, leaving the salt from other sources uncalculated, such as soy sauce, monosodium glutamate. People&#x02019;s eating habits in different seasons were not comprehensively considered before conducting the survey, making the evaluation of salt intake not accurate enough. Third, the intervention period was not long enough to change people&#x02019;s taste, so longer intervention should be carried out in practical context.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the feasibility of using improved salt-restriction-spoons in general population was found to be good, and their use for six months produced a significant reduction in the objective barriers of salt-restriction, a significant increase in the cues to actions of salt-restriction, a significantly higher using rate and correctly using rate of salt-restriction-spoon, a daily salt reduction of 1.42 g, and a 24HUNa reduction of 34.84 mmol. Therefore, the improved salt-restriction-spoon could be considered as an alternative for salt reduction strategy in China and other countries where salt intake comes mainly from home cooking.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the respondents who have cooperated with us for such a long time, and the local villagers who have helped us find the residence of each respondent.
