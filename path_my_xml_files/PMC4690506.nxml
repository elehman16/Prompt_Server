The patients were randomized 1:1 to either 1000&#x000a0;mg intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000 administered perioperatively by infusion or placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean preoperative haemoglobin in the active treatment group was 14&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl vs. 14&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;g/dl in the placebo group. At discharge 5&#x000a0;days after surgery, haemoglobin levels were reduced to 10&#x000b7;7 and 10&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g/dl, respectively. One month after surgery, haemoglobin concentration had increased to an average of 12&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;g/dl vs. 11&#x000b7;8&#x000a0;g/dl (<italic>p&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0&#x000b7;012) and significantly more patients were non-anaemic in the intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000-treated group compared to the placebo group (38&#x000b7;5% vs. 8&#x000b7;0%; <italic>p&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0&#x000b7;019).

More than 800&#x000a0;000 patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery worldwide each year <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Perioperative anaemia in surgical patients is well documented and has been associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Perioperative blood loss and low erythropoiesis commonly increase the risk of postoperative anaemia and the risk of blood transfusion <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Though blood transfusion helps to increase the haemoglobin (Hb) levels and avoid the deleterious effects of acute anaemia, several studies have suggested that blood transfusions may increase the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Oral iron does not seem to be effective as demonstrated in a recent study <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. This has prompted a need for a safe alternative treatment <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Besides the fact that preoperative anaemia is associated with a worse outcome for the patients, it has also been found that patients with a normal Hb level may become anaemic during the surgery. A recent evaluation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, showed that there was a decrease in mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation (SD) Hb level presurgery of 14&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl to 10&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl 2&#x000a0;days after surgery and 9&#x000b7;8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl 4&#x000a0;days after surgery. To date, no prospective randomized clinical study in cardiac surgery assessing the effect of iron supplementation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery has been reported.</p><p>This placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effect of perioperative administration of intravenous (IV) iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer&#x000ae;; Pharmacosmos, Holbaek, Denmark) in preoperative non-anaemic patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized comparative, single-centre trial was conducted in Denmark from December 2012 to August 2013 in non-anaemic patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof. The trial protocol and other related documents were approved by competent authorities and the local ethics committee (The Committees on Health Research Ethics for the Capital Region of Denmark, approval date: 15 March 2011, approval number: H-4-2011-010). The trial was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained in writing prior to any trial-related activities.</p><p>The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01563367).</p><p>The patients attended 4 visits: screening visit (visit 1), baseline visit/start of therapy (day before surgery or same day) (visit 2), day 5 postoperative (&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;day) (visit 3) and week 4 postoperative (&#x000b1;4&#x000a0;days) (visit 4) during the 4-week trial period. The assessments performed at each trial visit included physical examination, adverse events and laboratory assessments. All assessments performed are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S1</xref>. All the enrolled patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either iron isomaltoside 1000 as an IV infusion of 1000&#x000a0;mg (treatment group A) or placebo (0&#x000b7;9% saline) as IV infusions (treatment group B).</p><p>Permuted block randomization with a block size of 4 was used to randomize the patients. The randomization list was prepared centrally by a contract research organization, Max Neeman International Data Management Centre, using a validated computer program (Statistical Analysis Software [SAS] 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) PROC PLAN procedure. An interactive web response system method was used to randomize the eligible patient to the treatment groups. When the patient data had been entered into the interactive web response system, a unique randomization number was generated for the patient, identifying which treatment the patient was allocated to. The screening and enrolment of the patients were performed by the investigator at the site, whereas the entering of the patient data into the interactive web response system generating the randomization number was typically performed by the trial nurse or trial co-ordinator.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof, with a Hb &#x02265;12&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;g/dl (7&#x000b7;45&#x000a0;mmol/L) for women and a Hb &#x02265;13&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;g/dl (8&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;mmol/L) for men, and who were willing to provide written informed consent were considered eligible to participate in the trial.

Four patients in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group and three patients in the placebo group were included in the FAS and received blood transfusion. Due to the fact that blood transfusions influence the primary end-point and for medical reasons need to be allowed and anticipated to occur in some of the patients, the primary end-point &#x02018;change in Hb concentration from baseline to 4&#x000a0;weeks postoperatively&#x02019; was conducted on the FAS (<italic>N&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;51) as well as on the PP (<italic>N&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;43) analysis set (the PP analysis set included all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol deviation and had not received blood transfusion during the study). Since similar results were shown in both the FAS (including the blood-transfused patients) and PP (excluding the blood-transfused patients) populations, it seems reasonable to presume that the transfused patients included in the FAS did not have a substantial impact on the results.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Response profile of the change in haemoglobin (g/dl) concentration from baseline to 4&#x000a0;weeks with respect to LS mean estimate by treatment group and absolute values (a) Full analysis set, absolute values of haemoglobin.

A recent evaluation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, showed that there was a decrease in Hb level presurgery of 14&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl to 10&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl two days after surgery and 9&#x000b7;8&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;g/dl 4&#x000a0;days after surgery. To date, no prospective randomized clinical study in cardiac surgery assessing the effect of iron supplementation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery has been reported. This placebo-controlled, randomized trial evaluated the effect of perioperative IV iron isomaltoside 1000 in non-anaemic patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof.</p><p>Post-cardiac surgery, patients tend to experience a downward drift in Hb and anaemia which often leads to a need for blood transfusion <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In this trial, we also observed a decline in Hb concentration from baseline to week 4 in both treatment groups; however, this decline was significantly less in the iron isomaltoside 1000-treated group compared to the placebo group. The proportion of anaemic patients was significantly lower in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group compared to the placebo group at week 4 (92% of the placebo group patients were anaemic vs. 61&#x000b7;5% in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group). In the study by Garrido-Martin and colleagues, they concluded that the use of IV or oral iron supplementation proved ineffective in correcting anaemia after cardiopulmonary bypass and did not reduce blood transfusion requirements <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. One possible reason for this finding is that the patient might have received a lower dose of IV iron compared to our study. The patients received 3 doses of 100&#x000a0;mg IV iron (III)&#x02013;hydroxide sucrose complex per 24&#x000a0;h during pre- and postoperative hospitalization (the cumulative doses are not mentioned), whereas the patients in our study received 1000&#x000a0;mg IV iron isomaltoside 1000.</p><p>The significant increase in reticulocyte count with iron isomaltoside 1000 vs. placebo at day 5 shows that the erythropoietic effect of iron isomaltoside 1000 has a rapid onset. Our results on Hb were in line with a previous trial where oral iron supplementation as a four-week course of ferrous sulphate prior to surgery in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement protected the patients against a fall in Hb during the immediate postoperative period <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. On the other hand, oral iron did not increase preoperative Hb in patients scheduled for hip or knee arthroplasty <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and often a 4-week preoperative course is not achievable or tolerated in surgery patients. In another trial, preoperative IV iron administration in anaemic patients undergoing major elective surgery also resulted in significant increase in Hb levels and a high rate of anaemia correction <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>The present trial demonstrated a statistically significant higher increase in <italic>s</italic>-ferritin and TSAT concentration from baseline to week 4 in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group as compared to the placebo group, suggesting that perioperative IV iron supplementation maintains iron store after cardiac surgery. Similar results were reported in a previous trial where perioperative IV iron with or without erythropoietin preserved the iron stores after knee replacement surgery <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of transfusions between the two treatment groups. This pilot trial was not powered for this, and the numerical differences indicate that such eventual clinical effects may take a larger trial powered for such outcomes and other clinical outcomes. Iron isomaltoside 1000 showed a good safety profile in non-anaemic patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof. All the TEAEs reported in this trial were not related to the trial drug, and the majority (87%) was either recovered or recovering. SAEs were reported in 26&#x000b7;7% of the patients in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group and in 30% in the placebo group. The majority of the SAEs were mild or moderate and were recovered.</p><p>No patient reported hypophosphataemia (defined as a phosphate level &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;mg/dl), which is consistent with two interim analyses of other studies where no clinically significant hypophosphataemia was observed in 25 patients with cancer (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT 01145638) and in 50 patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT 01102413) <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>The present trial was an exploratory trial with the sample size of 60 patients. Hence, clinical studies of a larger scale would be of interest to further investigate whether the demonstrated treatment effect on Hb results in a possible beneficial clinical effect of iron isomaltoside 1000 administration to non-anaemic patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG, valve replacement or a combination thereof.</p><p>In conclusion, the present trial demonstrated that iron isomaltoside 1000 can be used safely and effectively to prevent anaemia after open-heart surgery. The haemopoietic response is already evident at day 5. The safety profile of iron isomaltoside is very favourable. In the present trial, no adverse drug reactions were reported and the number of adverse events reported was at placebo level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all the investigators and trial personnel for their contribution to the trial, the statistical support from Jens-Kristian Slott Jensen, Slott Stat, and the medical writing assistance of Eva-Maria Damsgaard Nielsen in editing the manuscript.
