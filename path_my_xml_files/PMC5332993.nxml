postural asymmetry. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence for its effectiveness.
[Subjects and Methods] In a randomised controlled trial, the effect of Vojta therapy
versus Neurodevelopmental treatment is assessed in infants with postural asymmetry. 65
infants with postural asymmetry were recruited. 37 infants aged six to eight weeks (mean
7.38) were found to be eligible and randomly assigned to two groups, with 19 receiving
Vojta and 18 Neurodevelopmental treatment. Using a standardised and blinded video-based
assessment, we documented restriction in head rotation and convexity of the spine in prone
and supine position before and after therapy. A reduction of at least four points (range
of scale 20 points) in postural asymmetry was regarded as a clinically relevant change.
[Results] On average a four-point reduction was achieved in both groups within eight
weeks. A mean difference (pre-post) between the groups of &#x02212;2.96 points in favour of Vojta
therapy was observed. [Conclusion] While both Neurodevelopmental treatment and Vojta are
effective in the treatment of infantile postural asymmetry and comparably well applied by
the parents, therapeutic effectiveness is significant greater within the Vojta group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Congenital muscular torticollis</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Non-invasive therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Infantile postural asymmetry (far better known as congenital muscular torticollis) is
characterised predominantly by asymmetric movement patterns, such as trunk convexity and
unilateral restriction in head turning<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To
direct the focus on the trunk, the designation &#x0201c;infantile postural asymmetry&#x0201d; is used
hereafter. The expected cause of infantile postural asymmetry is an intrauterine-acquired
asymmetric fixation, possibly modified by mechanisms throughout birth<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of
this idiopathic form of infantile postural asymmetry is estimated to be 15&#x02013;25%<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since 1992 infantile postural asymmetry and plagiocephaly have become more frequent<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> due
to the launch of the back to sleep campaign to reduce the risk of sudden infant death. An
incidence of 0.4&#x02212;1.3% for European countries is published<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The symptomatic form due to neuromuscular and skeletal disorders is
fairly rare<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Infantile postural asymmetry occurs frequently with additional asymmetric features, such as
hip dislocation, subluxation of the atlanto-axial joint, shortening of the
sternocleidomastoid muscle, strabism and deformational plagiocephaly<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To allow for unrestricted symmetric movements and to prevent a fixed torticollis, scoliosis
and head deformity, most infants with postural asymmetry are treated early. There are
different methods with are based largely on empirical evidence and supported by few studies;
they include stretching, positioning, handling, physical, manual and microcurrent
therapy<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is also a
randomised trial which supports the therapeutic efficacy of osteopathic treatment<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In many countries Neurodevelopmental
treatment (NDT) and Vojta therapy are used for the treatment of infantile asymmetry<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there have not yet been any
therapeutic trials in infants with postural asymmetry for these approaches.</p><p>To evaluate the efficacy of Vojta therapy versus NDT in infants with postural asymmetry, we
performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) using a standardised video-based asymmetry
scale<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was carried out from 2008 to 2012 at the Centre of Developmental Neurology,
Frankfurt, Germany. All local paediatricians were asked to refer infants with postural
asymmetry and a post-term age of six to eight weeks. Eligible for study participation were
otherwise healthy infants who had an asymmetry score of at least 12/24 points diagnosed by a
paediatrician, had not yet been treated for their asymmetry and had had a pregnancy duration
of at least 32 weeks<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, their
parents had to provide written informed consent and had to have basic knowledge of the
German language. Infants with an extreme pelvic obliquity (ICD-10&#x02005;M 95.5), which does not
allow evaluation of the spine in the supine position, were excluded from the study.
Furthermore infants were excluded from this study if they had significant underlying
diseases or a treatment before or during the study according to other concepts.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Martin Luther University
(MLU) Halle-Wittenberg and the Hessen state chamber of physicians, Germany (approval number
MC 95/2008).</p><p>A comparative study of Vojta therapy against placebo was not allowed for ethical reasons
because Vojta therapy is an officially recognized treatment modality for infant asymmetry in
Germany and paid by health insurance.</p><p>After written informed consent was obtained and the caregivers agreed to publication, the
eligible infants were assigned to two groups using block randomisation. The sealed and
sequentially numbered envelopes were not opened by the study coordinator until the family
came to the first therapy session.</p><p>Infants of the first group were treated according to the Vojta method, whereas infants in
the second group received elements of NDT, such as handling and positioning. Both groups
were treated for 45 minutes twice a week for eight weeks at the Centre of Developmental
Neurology, Frankfurt by experienced and certified Vojta and NDT physiotherapists. The
parents were trained to treat their children at home. The home treatment recommended was for
20 minutes four times a day<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Developed by Vaclav Vojta, the Vojta method is well known as reflex locomotion and can be
divided into reflex crawling and reflex rolling (phases 1 and 2). By stimulating special
reflex points, the physiotherapist can trigger these motor patterns. Reflex crawling is
performed in a prone position, whereas reflex rolling is induced from a supine (phase 1) and
side-lying (phase 2) position. During this stimulation of motor patterns, both sides of the
paravertebral muscles are activated and the spine is elongated. The motor patterns can be
repeated as often as needed<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The NDT group of infants received techniques opposing their preferred posture with the aim
of activating synergistic muscles. Parents were shown how to massage an infant to harmonise
muscular imbalance and how to initiate special positioning during sleep, thereby
antagonizing asymmetry. They were also trained to increase the prone position time during
daytime (4 &#x000d7; 5 minutes). Further exercises in the NDT group comprised handling according to
the Bobath concept, which includes recommendations for a specific positioning of the infant
during everyday procedures, such as washing, feeding, picking up and laying down, in
addition to the accommodation of the baby and the parental carrying<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary outcome was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the two methods and to test
if Vojta therapy might be superior to NDT in reducing infant postural asymmetry.</p><p>Before and eight weeks after intervention, postural asymmetry was quantified using a
standardised video-based asymmetry scale developed by Philippi et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore a
tripod with the video camera was set up at the end of treatment mat, exactly two meters
above the infants. On the treatment mat, a cross was painted, in order to assess the
longitudinal axis (spine) and a horizontal axis (shoulder girdle). Philippi et al.
(2006:159) described: &#x0201c;Recording commenced with the infant&#x02019;s head being held for a brief
period of time in the middle supine position. A head turn was then induced by presenting
noises, toys or the physiotherapist&#x02019;s face, and moving them from one side to the other.
After at least two turns to each side, the infant was put in the prone position with its
head held for a brief time in the middle prone position, and the same procedures were
repeated&#x0201d;<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. That means, the four items
of this assessment comprise convexity of the trunk and restriction in head rotation in the
prone and supine position during a maximal head turn induced by optic and acoustic stimuli
to the right and left side of the infants. The range of the scale is set with a maximum of 4
&#x000d7; 6 = 24 points for maximum asymmetry and a minimum of 4 &#x000d7; 1= 4 points for symmetry. For
each infant, this procedure was videotaped and analysed by three experienced and trained
physical therapists (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the physical therapists</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PT 1</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PT 2</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PT 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">female</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">female</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">female</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experience from getting the physio license</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 years</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 years</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 years</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Receive Vojta certification</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2001</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">---</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1999</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Receive NDT certification</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1997</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2008</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1995</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other certification</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Castillo Morales</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systemic family therapy</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>), who were blinded to the therapeutic method used. The three video scorers had
contact neither to the treating physical therapists nor to the parents throughout the whole
study. The scorers analysed 74 videos. They did not know if the video was recorded before or
after treatment and which treatment was used. The treating physical therapist and the
parents were not blinded for the therapy method. The infant may be considered blinded.</p><p>The secondary outcome was the compliance of the parents, which was ensured through two
appointments a week at the treatment centre and supervision of their manual therapy skills.
The parents had to be present at 12 of the 16 possible appointments at the treatment centre
to avoid elimination from the study. In addition, the frequency of therapy at home and the
behaviour of the infants during these treatments were evaluated with a structured parent
questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by the parents every 14 days. With this
questionnaire parents were ask if the crying of their infants affected the duration and
frequency of their exercises at home and if crying and behaviour changed over time.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> 18.0 and an
intention-to-treat-model used for the evaluation. The main thesis is tested on a statistical
significance of 0.05 using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) within all three
scorers over all four items. An increase or decrease of four points (out of 24) was
determined to be the minimum for clinical relevance.</p><p>The changes in an infant&#x02019;s behaviour were evaluated with the questionnaire through a
four-point Likert scale every two weeks. A correlation analysis between therapy and
screaming behaviour was performed using a contingency table and Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
distribution.</p><p>The intraclass correlation coefficient for the three blinded scorers was 0.77. The
estimation of the number of subjects needed for this therapy study was performed with the
software nQuery Advisor and SAS/IML.</p><p>A previous study about osteopathy and infantile postural asymmetry was used as the
reference for the estimation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The group
difference in the asymmetry reduction before and after treatment should be at least four
points on the asymmetry scale. Based on a power of 80, a significance level of 5%, an
estimated treatment effect of 4 points and a standard deviation (SD) of 3.5 points, 15
infants were needed for each group. A list of block randomisation was created with a
computer-based random number generator at the Institute of Medical Epidemiology, Biometry
and Informatics at MLU. An independent person sent the order of allocation in closed, opaque
and numbered envelopes to the investigator, who opened them after receipt of parental
consent. Because the envelopes were kept in a locked cabinet until opening, confidentiality
was ensured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Sixty-five infants were recruited and 28 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two parents

day, parents in the Vojta group treated their infants on average 2.21 times/day for 10.5
minutes. They attended on average 15.63 from 16 possible appointments with their children at
the treatment centre. Parents in the NDT group treated their infants on average 2.44
times/day for 10.9 minutes. They attended on average 14.94 from 16 possible appointments at
the treatment centre. Thirty-four of 37 parents (91.9%) reported similar or less frequent
crying of their infant after eight-week treatment, whereas three parents (8.1%) noticed more
frequent crying (one of the NDT group, two of the Vojta group).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Infantile postural asymmetry in seven-week-old infants both in the NDT group and the Vojta
group showed clinically relevant improvement after an eight-week treatment interval
consisting both of home treatment carried out by the parents twice a day for 10 minutes on
average and the therapy at the treatment centre, which was performed twice a week for 30
minutes on average. With the same duration and frequency of treatment, there was
statistically significant improvement in the Vojta group.</p><p>This study is the first RCT to show the effects of Vojta therapy and NDT on infantile
postural asymmetry. The significant effect achieved through Vojta therapy compared to NDT
may be explained by its more intensive muscle activation due to relatively precisely guided
movement responses to triggered reflexes. In contrast, NDT allows for more variation of
muscle activation; as a result, muscles which need activation may be missed because stronger
muscles take over the work of weaker ones.</p><p>A further strength of our study is that outcome was measured objectively by a standardised
video-based score evaluated by independent raters, who were blinded for treatment and
clinical data.</p><p>Although infants cry during Vojta treatment, the acceptance of the parents in this study
was good and did not influence compliance. It is assumed that crying during Vojta therapy is
more likely an expression of the infant&#x02019;s unwillingness to activate weak muscles rather than
an expression of pain. This assumption is supported by the fact that crying stops as soon as
the training ceases and by the report of parents that crying caused by pain sounds
different. Parents who cannot bear the baby&#x02019;s crying under Vojta therapy obtained with NDT a
second, effective method but during the study period reached slightly less symmetry.
Compared with other measures<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> both methods
show very good results.</p><p>In physical therapy, there is an ongoing discussion about the appropriate treatment
intensity at home. Usually parents do less home therapy than recommended; this was also the
case in our study. Nevertheless, in our study physical therapy performed twice a day for ten
minutes by the parents was sufficient in order to be effective. Parents also have to perform
home therapy if they apply other recommended approaches for torticollis like stretching<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, stretching is sometimes a
difficult experience for both parents and infants as it is often rather painful. A novel
therapy, kinesiology tape<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, seems to be
a promising treatment option according to a first pre-post study. This approach is soft and
needs no home therapy.</p><p>A limitation of our study was the restricted intervention period. It cannot be proven in
the end that the natural course would not have achieved the same effect over time. A further
limitation is the missing placebo group, which could not be implemented for ethical reasons.
From two historical study groups (n=12 and n=16) of infants with postural asymmetry who were
not be treated for 4 weeks at the age of 6&#x02013;12 weeks, we know that there was a minimal change
of their postural asymmetry score (&#x000b1; 1 point on average)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may indicate that initiating physical therapy is more
beneficial than waiting. In the treat-or-not-to-treat debate, there are two further
important clinical aspects which might offer a good argument to treat those infants early.
Infants with fixed movement restriction in cervical rotation are limited in their
age-related participation because they cannot explore the environment as they would like to
and need to.</p><p>In untreated infants, torticollis and spine convexity may become more fixed over time and
the risk of scoliosis and headaches increases. With early treatment we have the chance to
relax the asymmetrically tensed-up spine muscles more easily and quickly; later on, however,
the treatment of fixed torticollis, scoliosis and headache will be more extensive.</p><p>Our study supports the beneficial effect of physical therapy on infants with infantile
postural asymmetry and indicates that physical therapy may be a good complement to
stretching and other treatments. Our data suggest that effectiveness can be attained by ten
minutes of home therapy twice a day and one 30-minute-treatment per week by the physical
therapist. Our results show that therapy compliance was comparable in NDT and Vojta therapy;
however, the total effect was greater in the Vojta group.</p><p>This good result of physiotherapy measures in the treatment of infantile postural asymmetry
should now be examined with a greater numbers of participants, maybe in multicentre
studies.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was partially funded by Physio Germany (German Association of Physical Therapy
