Currently, the use of a resorbable collagen membrane (RCM) as a guided tissue regenerative material is one of the highly sought treatment modalities. The present study aimed at evaluating the clinical outcome of RC in the treatment of Miller's Class I and II recession defects in maxillary anteriors and premolars by coronally advanced flap (CAF) with and without RCM.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This split-mouth study (bilateral buccal recession defects) was randomized to include 15 test (CAF + membrane) and 15 control (CAF alone) sites.

The present study showed that mean improvement in RD was 1.60 &#x000b1; 0.507 and 1.53 &#x000b1; 0.64 mm in both test and control groups, respectively.

Usually, patients seek corrective treatment for root hypersensitivity and esthetic problems.</p><p>A root coverage (RC) that is predictable can be seen by several perio-plastic procedures, namely, the free gingival graft technique, pedicle flaps, coronally advanced flap (CAF) technique, and subepithelial connective tissue technique. However, in spite of achieving predictable RC by these procedures, there was formation of a long junctional epithelium during healing. The other limitations associated with these procedures are discomfort to the patient, it takes a long duration of time, another surgical site, inadequate supply of donor tissue, and bleeding after surgery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) that is one of the commonly sought treatment modalities aims at guiding the proliferation of the epithelial cells and at the same time makes sure that they do not proliferate into the areas that is desirous of achieving periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As per Leknes <italic>et al</italic>., connective tissue repair to the exposed root surface is not achieved by GTR as RC procedure provides only periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Collagen is semipermeable, allowing nutrient passage and gas exchange. Collagen tissue due to its property of semipermeabilty enables the passage of nutrients and exchange of gases and aids in the augmentation of the entire tissue volume as it gets absorbed naturally and thereby getting replaced by host tissue.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The present study aimed at evaluating the clinical outcome of RC in the treatment of Miller's Class I and II recession defects in maxillary anteriors and premolars CAF with and without resorbable collagen membrane (Novabone RCM<sup>&#x02122;</sup>).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 15 pairs of bilateral buccal recession defects from 15 patients with bilateral gingival recession defects and in good general health were recruited for the study.

The main advantage of collagen when used as a GTR-based RC procedure is its hemostatic function and apart from that, collagen has a chemotactic function for fibroblasts that aids in cellular migration and attachment to facilitate primary wound closure, an important requirement for successful GTR outcomes.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Considering the above-mentioned facts, the aim of this randomized, controlled, split-mouth clinical study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of RC in the treatment of Miller's Class I and II recession defects in maxillary anteriors and premolars CAF with and without RCM (Novabone RCM<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>]).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The CAF design used in this study was similar to that described by de Sanctis and Zucchelli that involved the use of vertical releasing incisions and a split-full-split-thickness flap design.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A split-full-split-thickness flap design includes the partial thickness of the surgical papillae that facilitates the nutritional exchanges between them and the underlying de-epithelized anatomical papillae, and it also improved the blending (in terms of color and thickness) of the surgically treated area with respect to adjacent soft tissues; the periosteum in the central portion of the flap so as to maximize soft tissue thickness over the avascular root surface. To increase the predictability of achieving adequate coronal positioning and complete defect coverage, vertical incisions were used. In similar studies by Felipe <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Papageorgakopoulos <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] a CAF with releasing incisions was compared to an envelope flap without releasing incisions. The procedure with releasing incisions resulted in achieving a significantly greater percentage of defect coverage (95%) than the procedure without releasing incisions (78%).</p><p>The more coronal level of the gingival margin after suturing, the greater the probability of complete RC as per a study done by Pini Prato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Similarly, in the present study, the membrane was covered completely by the flap and was coronally positioned and sutured.</p><p>There were reductions in RD and PPD both in the test and the control groups in the present study. Hence, the decrease in PD suggested that the gain in CAL was associated with new connective tissue attachment. In both the groups, the mean KTH showed a significant increase. The KTH gain should be correlated with tissue maturation following healing and the fact that the mucogingival junction tends to be located at its genetically determined position. An increase in KTH may be because of granulation tissue formation from periodontal ligament tissue with the potential to induce keratinization of covering epithelium.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These findings were in accordance with Praveen <italic>et al</italic>.

The results of the study found no significant difference between two groups with regard to the outcome of the treatment.</p><p>More studies are required in future to compare the results obtained by the proposed technique with other perio-plastic surgical techniques with longer follow-up, and involving larger sample size is warranted to evaluate whether RCM provides better and stable results. Furthermore, histological evaluation is necessary to assess the type of attachment obtained with the use of RCM.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Glossary of Periodontal Terms (GPT).
