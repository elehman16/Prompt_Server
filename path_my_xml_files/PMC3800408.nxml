It influences calculus formation and periodontal disease. Different studies have been done to find exact correlation of salivary biomarkers with periodontal disease. With a multitude of biomarkers and complexities in their determination, the salivary pH may be tried to be used as a quick chairside test. The aim of this study was to analyze the pH of saliva and determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Study Design:</title><p>The study population consisted of 300 patients. They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested.

Changes in microbial and environmental dynamics in microbial ecosystems may increase the potential for pathogenicity within a microbial ecosystem and subsequently initiate and promote oral diseases. These successional changes have recently and tentatively been referred to by Marsh as the ecological plaque hypothesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Thus, the properties of the environment determine, which microorganisms can occupy a site while the metabolic activities of those microbial communities subsequently modify the properties of the environment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>It is known that periodontal diseases in humans and other mammals are predominantly associated with Gram-negative anaerobic organisms and that, before destructive periodontal diseases are initiated, these microorganisms must colonize tooth surfaces at and just below the gingival margin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Strong evidence exists to consider <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> as etiologic agents. There is moderate evidence for the association of the following with periodontal disease: <italic>Campylobacter rectus</italic>, <italic>Eubacterium nodatum</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, <italic>Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus micros</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic>-complex, <italic>Treponema denticola</italic> and spirochetes. <italic>Eikenella corrodens</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and yeasts associated with human immunodeficiency virus periodontitis and peri-implantitis have shown weak association.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] A study by Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] on the effect of pH on the growth of microorganisms showed that P. gingivalis grows at a pH of 6.5-7.0, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> grows at a pH of 5.0-7.0 and <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> grows at a pH of 5.5-7.0.</p><p>The diagnosis of active phases of periodontal disease and the identification of patients at risk for active disease represents a challenge for both clinical investigators and clinicians. In general, clinical parameters including probing depth, attachment level, bleeding on probing plaque index (PI) and radiographic loss of alveolar bone are used to assess disease severity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Occasionally, monitoring of the microbial infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and analysis of the host response in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) are utilized in an attempt to identify individuals at risk for future breakdown.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Compelling reasons exist to use saliva as a diagnostic fluid. It meets the demands for being inexpensive, non-invasive and easy-to-use diagnostic methods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] As a clinical tool, saliva has many advantages over serum, including ease of collection, storing and shipping and it can be obtained at low cost in sufficient quantities for analysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] For patients, the non-invasive collection techniques dramatically reduce anxiety and discomfort and simplify procurement of repeated samples for monitoring over time. Saliva also is easier to handle for diagnostic procedures because it does not clot, thus lessening the manipulations required.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Saliva exerts a major influence on plaque initiation, maturation and metabolism.</p><p>Saliva and crevicular fluid play a decisive role in the prevention of periodontal disease and indeed paradoxically in the induction of periodontal pathology. Thus, both of these factors have been the object of much study. There is scanty literature regarding the use of salivary pH as a diagnostic marker in periodontal disease.</p><p>This study is aimed at evaluating the pH of saliva, determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease and thus evaluate its suitability as a diagnostic marker of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>The study was conducted in the out-patient department of Department of Periodontology and Implantology, M.A. Rangoonwala College of Dental Sciences and Research Centre, Pune, India.

Group A had 100 subjects of who had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B had 100 patients who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C had 100 subjects who had generalized chronic periodontitis.</p><p>All patients were verbally explained the nature of the study and an informed written consent was obtained (as per Helsinki declaration).</p><p>Patients with history of systemic diseases or conditions that may adversely affect periodontal health or the composition of saliva were excluded from the study.

The subjects were asked to refrain from talking and drop down the head and let the saliva run naturally to the front of the mouth. The subjects were also asked not to cough up mucus as saliva is collected. The subjects spit into the collection tube about once a minute for up to 10 min. 5 ml of saliva was collected in sterile 10 ml beakers.

Whole saliva collected from the mouth is a complex mixture. Apart from secretions of all the glands it also contains desquamated oral epithelial cells, microorganisms and their products, leucocytes, serum constituents, fluid from gingival crevice and food remnants. The concentrations of dissolved solids (organic and inorganic) are characterized by wide variation, both between individuals and within a single individual. Of the approximately 750 ml of saliva secreted daily, submandibular glands[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] account for 60%, parotid for about 30% and sublingual glands for 5% or less. About 7% of saliva is derived from minor salivary glands.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The saliva that basically forms the environment of the oral cavity is the resting or pooled saliva.</p><p>Saliva has a pH normal range of 6.2-7.6 with 6.7 being the average pH. Resting pH of mouth does not fall below 6.3. In the oral cavity, the pH is maintained near neutrality (6.7-7.3) by saliva. The saliva contributes to maintenance of the pH by two mechanisms. First, the flow of saliva eliminates carbohydrates that could be metabolized by bacteria and removes acids produced by bacteria. Second, acidity from drinks and foods, as well as from bacterial activity, is neutralized by the buffering activity of saliva.</p><p>The present study included 300 patients from the Department of Periodontology an Implantology at M. A. Rangoonwala Dental College, Pune, India. Participants below 20 years were excluded from the study due to the possible effect of physiological metabolic growth changes on Ca and PO<sub>4</sub> levels of saliva consequently affecting its pH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Inflammation of the gingival tissue results in gingivitis, which if not resolved leads to inflammation of the periodontium called as periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The induction and progression of periodontal tissue destruction is a complex process involving plaque accumulation, release of bacterial substances and host inflammatory response. It is characterized by pocket formation and bone loss. Pockets are caused by microorganisms and their products, which produce pathologic tissue changes that lead to deepening of the gingival sulcus.</p><p>The saliva that basically forms the environment of the oral cavity is the resting or pooled saliva. Henskens <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on the protein composition of whole and parotid saliva. Significant changes in salivary protein composition including that of albumin occurred only in whole saliva, after treatment. Concentrations of parotid cystatin S were unchanged during the periodontal treatment process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Salivary levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin, C-reactive protein, cathepsin G and elastase levels are directly related to an individual's periodontal status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The gingival sulcus contains a fluid that seeps into it from the gingival connective tissue through the thin sulcular epithelium and is called as GCF. Thus, it is contributory to the pH of saliva. For this reason, unstimulated whole saliva was collected from the subjects.</p><p>A saliva pH of 7.0 usually indicates a healthy dental and periodontal situation. At this pH, there is a low incidence of dental decay combined and little or no calculus. Therefore, stable conditions should basically be found in this environment.</p><p>A saliva pH below 7.0 usually indicates acidemia (abnormal acidity of the blood). If a chronic condition exists, the mouth is more susceptible to dental decay, halitosis and periodontitis. Chronic acidemia can be a causative factor for a multitude of diseases affecting the whole body.</p><p>A saliva pH above 7.0 usually indicates alkalinity. Excessive alkalinity can bring about the same anaerobic conditions as acidemia, but it is much rarer condition.</p><p>Plaque bacteria take calcium compounds in the environment and use the minerals to protect them from the high pH. The two key factors to plaque formation are first there must be oral bacteria to attack food particles and elevate the pH. Second the pH must elevate above 7.6 to grow dental plaque crystals that cause periodontal disease.</p><p>Thus, alkaline pH is essential for plaque growth suggesting the mildly alkaline pH of the saliva obtained from the subjects with generalized chronic gingivitis.</p><p>As the gingival crevice deepens; the environmental factors in the subgingival site become more stable, i.e., neutral pH and anaerobic. Under these conditions, asaccharolytic and anaerobic and/or proteolytic bacteria such as <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> are found. Proteolytic bacteria can degrade nitrogenous compounds into small peptides and amino acids by cell membrane-bound and/or extracellularly secreted proteases for subsequent use as metabolic substrates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p><italic>Fusobacterium</italic> species also utilize glutamic acid as a nutrient and produce acetic and butyric acids. <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> and <italic>C. rectus</italic> metabolizes aspartic acid to succinic acid but requires formic acid as a reducing agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Oral <italic>Treponemal</italic> species are strictly dependent on isobutyric acid for growth. Thus, we can see that, with a few exceptions, most of the subgingival microbiota responsible for chronic periodontitis either utilize or create end products that are mild to moderately acidic in nature.</p><p>Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] concluded in their study that the periodontopathogens grow in a mildly acidic pH. This is in accordance to our result for pH of chronic periodontitis.</p><p>Fujikawa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] studied the correlation between the pH level and the microflora in periodontal pockets in the various stages of periodontal disease. A change in pH level was seen in deep pockets or severe gingival inflammation. A close correlation was seen between salivary and crevicular pH. The pH level was significantly positively related with the proportion of coccoid forms, but was negatively correlated with the proportion of motile organisms that are reported to be related with periodontal disease.</p><p>Galgut[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] conducted a study to investigate any possible correlations between pH and gingivitis and periodontal pockets. Correlations between pH and gingivitis were not identified, but significant correlations between pH and periodontal pockets were evident.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Saliva is a fluid that can be easily collected, contains locally-derived and systemically derived markers of periodontal disease and hence may offer the basis for a patient specific diagnostic test for periodontitis.</p><p>Saliva can be used as an indicator of prognosis during periodontal treatment. Within the limitations of this study, it has been observed that there is a correlation between pH of saliva and periodontal diseases when compared with healthy groups. Salivary pH in patients with chronic generalized gingivitis was more alkaline than that in patients with clinically healthy gingiva. In patients with chronic generalized periodontitis, the salivary pH was more acidic than the control group. This may be of diagnostic value in the future, but further elaborate studies with larger sample size, microbiological analysis and ions in the salivary sample are needed to draw definite conclusions.</p><p>A study closer to the seat of periodontal disease such as within plaque is necessary to establish the nature of the exact role in the induction and the progression of periodontal disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Microbial ecology of dental plaque and its significance in health and disease</article-title><source>Adv Dent Res</source><year>1994</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>263</fpage><lpage>71</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7865085</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loesche</surname><given-names>LV</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The bacterial etiology of periodontal disease: The specific plaque hypothesis</article-title><source>Clinical Dentistry</source><year>1987</year><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Harper and Row</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ranney</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Smibert</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Burmeister</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Schenkein</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The microflora of periodontal sites showing active destructive progression</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1991</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>729</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1752997</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Socransky</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Haffajee</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The bacterial etiology of destructive periodontal disease: Current concepts</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1992</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>322</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1573546</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Schachtele</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of pH on the growth and proteolytic activity of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides intermedius</italic></article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>1990</year><volume>69</volume><fpage>1266</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2191980</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Schachtele</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamada</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic></article-title><source>Oral Microbiol Immunol</source><year>1997</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>323</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9573805</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Polson</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodson</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal diagnosis.
