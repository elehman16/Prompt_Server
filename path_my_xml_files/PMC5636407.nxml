The scar (at least 4.5&#x02009;cm long) was divided into 3 equal segments (at least 1.5&#x02009;cm long). Each segment was randomized to either treatment modality A (purpuric: 1.5ms), B (non-purpuric: 10ms), or no treatment (control). Treatment sessions were performed at day 1, 30 and 60. Fluences were delivered according to Fitzpatrick skin type. Follow up visits were at 3 and 6 months. Standardized pictures were taken at each visit and patients were blindly assessed by a physician using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). At baseline and each visit a series of parameters (hemoglobin and melanin concentration, skin texture) were recorded by means of multispectral analysis (Antera 3D<sup>TM</sup>). Patients were excluded if their scars were on the genitals, hands, or feet; they were &#x0003c; 18 year old; they had a history of light sensitivity. Written informed consent was obtained.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> There was a statistically significant improvement in the mean values of the VSS in the non-purpuric group; the purpuric group showed a trend towards improvement (although not significant); the control group did not show any improvement. Hemoglobin concentration decreased significantly in the treated groups, as opposed to the control group. Skin texture varied significantly in the non-purpuric group.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Hypertrophic and keloid scars often result in patient dissatisfaction, functional impairment and decreased quality of life.<sup>1</sup> The abundance of treatments in the literature indicates that no available treatment produces a reliable improvement<sup>1</sup>. The PDL appears to benefit recent scars of various etiologies: improvements in erythema, pliability, thickness, and pruritus were reported in a number of studies, with only minor adverse reactions.<sup>1&#x02013;3</sup> A recent controlled study demonstrated non-purpuric long pulse parameters to yield better results than purpuric impulses in recent scars.<sup>4</sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the use of non-purpuric long pulse durations (&#x0003e;6&#x02009;ms) and non-purpuric short pulse durations (0.450&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;ms) in aged hypertrophic and keloid scars. We demonstrated that PDL is effective in improving hypertrophic and keloid scars, and that non-purpuric pulses are superior to purpuric ones in this indication.</p><sec><title>Reference Citations:</title><p>1.
