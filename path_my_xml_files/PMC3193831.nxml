CQ-resistant <italic>P. vivax</italic> was first described in 1989 in Papua New Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]. For several years, reports of reduced CQ efficacy were limited to the island of New Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. The degree of CQ resistance in Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea has now become so severe that local antimalarial treatment policies have been revised to adopt artemisinin combination therapy for both <italic>Plasmodium</italic><italic> falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections. More recently, CQ-resistant <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> has been documented across the Indonesian archipelago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>] and in Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>], South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>], Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>], the Horn of Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>], and South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>].</p><p>In Thailand, malaria remains a problem along the borders with Cambodia and Myanmar, where multidrug-resistant <italic>P</italic><italic>. falciparum</italic> is endemic. In 1996, in camps for displaced persons of the Karen ethnic minority on the Northwestern border of Thailand, we found that CQ was a highly effective treatment for <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> malaria<italic>,</italic> with &#x0003c;3% of patients having a recurrence (relapse, reinfection or recrudescence) by day 28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>]. However, in a study conducted 7 years later in neighboring Myanmar, almost 35% of treated patients had a parasite recurrence by day 28, raising the possibility that resistance was spreading along the Thai-Myanmar border [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. In addition, in vitro sensitivity testing on fresh parasite isolates collected between 2003 and 2007 in the same region indicated a decreased susceptibility to CQ in some isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>]. Patients with CQ-resistant <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> can be treated effectively with the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination (DP) as well as other artemisinin combination therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]. To reassess the efficacy of CQ in the treatment of <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> infections on the Northwestern border of Thailand and study the efficacy of DP, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients with <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> monoinfections.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The study took place in the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit clinics on the Thailand-Myanmar border, an area of low (entomologic inoculation rate, &#x0003c;1) and seasonal malaria transmission[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>]. Patients &#x0003e;1 year old and with a body weight of &#x02265;5 kg were eligible for enrollment if they had a microscopically confirmed monoinfection of <italic>P.</italic><italic> vivax</italic> (parasitemia, &#x02265;5/500 white blood cells), if they were febrile (axillary temperature, &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C) or had a history of fever, and if they or their guardians gave fully informed consent. Patients were excluded if they had a known hypersensitivity to the study drugs; had intercurrent illness or were pregnant, lactating, or severely anemic (hematocrit, &#x0003c;20%); or had received mefloquine treatment in the previous 60 days or DP in the previous 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were allocated to the treatment arms based on a pregenerated randomization list in blocks of 20. The individual allocations were concealed in sealed envelopes and opened only after enrollment by the field team. Although patients and clinic workers were not blinded to the treatment arm after allocation, laboratory technicians were unaware of treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Drugs</title><p>Chloroquine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization, Thailand) was given once a day for 3 days, with a target dose of 25 mg base/kg with a glass of water. DP (Duocotexin; Holley People's Republic of China) was administered once a day for 3 days with milk, with a total target dose of 7 mg/kg for dihydroartemisinin and 55 mg/kg for piperaquine. All patients with a normal G6PD test result were offered a course of 14 days of primaquine (0.5 mg base/kg/d) at the end of the follow-up period. This delay was instituted because primaquine itself is active against asexual stages of <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>] and its administration earlier would have compromised the analysis of the efficacy of CQ and DP.</p></sec><sec><title>Enrollment Procedures</title><p>A case-record form was completed for all patients documenting symptoms before clinic attendance, concomitant illness, drug history and physical examination. Capillary blood was collected for malaria thick and thin films, hematocrit, and G6PD deficiency testing. Patients &#x0003e;1 year of age presenting with parasitemia of &#x0003e;100 <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> trophozoites/500 white blood cells were asked to provide 5 mL of venous blood for in vitro sensitivity testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Patients were seen daily from admission until they were afebrile and aparasitemic and then weekly until day 63. At each visit, temperature was measured and a symptom questionnaire was completed. Capillary blood was taken for malaria blood smear and hematocrit weekly. Any concomitant medication taken during the study period was recorded. Patients presenting to the clinic within the follow-up period with microscopically confirmed <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> had capillary blood sampling for measurement of CQ and desethylchloroquine plasma concentrations. Patients with <italic>P</italic><italic>. falciparum</italic> infection diagnosed during the follow-up period were withdrawn from the study and treated with the standard 3-day treatment of mefloquine and artesunate.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug Measurements</title><p>CQ and desethylchloroquine plasma concentrations were measured in patients &#x0003e;10 years old at the time of recurrent malaria. Plasma drug concentrations were quantified using solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>]. The limit of detection was 1 ng/mL for both drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Malaria blood films were stained with Giemsa, and parasite counts were expressed as the number of parasites per 1000 red blood cells or, if the parasitemia was &#x0003c;1% packed red blood cells, as the number of parasites per 500 white blood cells. G6PD deficiency was assessed by the fluorescent spot test SQMMR500 (R&#x00026;D Diagnostic). In vitro samples for drug susceptibility were processed and analyzed as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study End Points</title><p>The analysis of efficacy was conducted using a modified intention-to-treat analysis that included all patients who fulfilled the enrollment criteria. The primary end point was the overall risk of recurrence with <italic>P. vivax</italic> during the 63-day follow-up period. Secondary end points included the risk of reappearance of <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> the parasite and fever clearance times, and the adverse events reported by the patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The original sample size of 500 patients had 80% power and 95% confidence to detect a 15% difference in the primary end point, assuming a 50% recurrence rate in the CQ group, allowing for up to 15% loss to follow-up by day 63.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were double entered into Microsoft Access software and analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (version 16; SPSS). The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for nonparametric comparisons, and Student <italic>t</italic> test or 1-way analysis of variance for parametric comparisons. Proportions were examined using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> with Yates' correction or by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Efficacy end points were assessed by survival analysis, in which the cumulative risk of failure was calculated by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier product limit formula and compared by the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel log-rank test. In addition, treatments were compared and the hazard ratio (HR) calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Data were censored for patients who were unavailable for follow-up or, in the case of secondary end points, presented again with a different outcome and not regarded as treatment failures. Those patients with recurrent vomiting or adverse drug effects, which required early termination of treatment and the administration of rescue therapy, were regarded as therapeutic failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (MUTM 2006-029), and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, Oxford University (OXTREC 027-05). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ISRCTN87827353).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>Between January 2007 and December 2008, 500 patients were enrolled in the study. Eight of these patients did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The baseline characteristics of the 492 patients in the evaluable population (modified intention-to-treat analysis) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; there were no differences in baseline characteristics between treatment arms. Follow-up to day 63 or day of failure (per-protocol analysis) was achieved in 86.7% of patients (215/248) treated with DP and 87.3% (213/244) given CQ (<italic>P</italic> = .95). Nonadherence to follow-up was more likely in adults (16%; 47/291) than in children (8.5%; 17/201; <italic>P</italic> = .01), but these patients otherwise had similar baseline characteristics as those who were adherent to follow-up. With the exception of a 3-year old boy who vomited CQ repeatedly, there were no other early treatment failures. In patients receiving a complete course of treatment, the median dose of CQ administered in the CQ arm was 24.8 mg base/kg (range, 21.3&#x02013;29.4), and patients in the DP arm received median doses of 6.7 mg/kg (range, 5&#x02013;10) of dihydroartemisinin and 53.3 mg/kg (range, 40&#x02013;80) of piperaquine.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Patient Characteristics at Baseline<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">a</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DP treatment (n = 248)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CQ treatment (n = 244)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asexual parasitemia, geometric mean (95% CI), &#x003bc;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3776 (3111&#x02013;4582)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4406 (3637&#x02013;5339)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gametocytemia, geometric mean (95% CI), &#x003bc;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">214 (178&#x02013;257)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">280 (236&#x02013;333)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gametocytemia present</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85 (210)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84 (205)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Schizonts present at enrollment</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 (79)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (74)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male sex</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70 (173)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64 (155)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">G6PD deficiency</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1 (15/247)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3 (13)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, median (range), kg</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 (7&#x02013;74)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 (9&#x02013;61)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, median (range), years</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (1&#x02013;57)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (1&#x02013;63)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x0003c;5</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (34)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (30)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;5&#x02013;14</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (67)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (70)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x0003e;14</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59 (147)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59 (144)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fever &#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42 (94/225)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42 (97/229)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of febrile illness, median (range), days</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0&#x02013;8)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0&#x02013;5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hematocrit, mean (SD), %</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.2 (5.0)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.6 (5.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anemia (hematocrit &#x0003c;30%)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5 (11/247)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.8 (14/242)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Splenomegaly</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (34/243)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (29/237)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatomegaly</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (57/247)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (63)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval;

This significant difference had already emerged by day 28 of follow-up and was confirmed at both day 28 and day 63 in the per-protocol population (Table 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By day 28, recurrent infections had emerged in 8.7% CQ recipients (18/207) compared with 2.2% (5/230) treated with DP (relative risk, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.51&#x02013;10.58; <italic>P</italic> = .005).

The efficacy of CQ, the drug used to treat vivax malaria for &#x0003e;50 years, has fallen in some areas, and resistance seems to be spreading. The assessment of treatment efficacy in <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> is more difficult than in <italic>P</italic><italic>. falciparum,</italic> because there are no genotyping methods that reliably distinguish relapses from new infections, and long-term cultures of <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> cannot be maintained, thereby confining in vitro testing of drugs to assays on fresh isolates. This means that it is difficult to document unequivocal cases of treatment failure in areas where resistance is emerging, but any <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> infection that occurs within 28 days after the start of CQ treatment, whether recrudescence, relapse, or new infection, has grown through residual CQ concentrations in blood. If these concentrations are adequate, then the infection is resistant, by definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study we assessed the in vivo efficacy of CQ and compared it with that of DP, an artemisinin combination therapy with documented efficacy against CQ-resistant <italic>P. vivax</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>]. More than 8% of patients treated with CQ had a recurrent infection within 28 days, and this rate rose to 22% in young children. Parasite and fever clearance times were both significantly faster after DP treatment. The artemisinin derivatives are the most rapidly acting drugs against <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>], so this difference is expected. The artemisinin component of DP contributes significantly to the initial therapeutic response but would not be expected to affect subsequent relapses or reinfections. Parasite clearance time was prolonged after CQ treatment, with 16% of patients still parasitemic at 48 hours and 2% at 76 hours. Delayed parasite clearance, as defined by parasitemia on day 2, increased the subsequent risk of recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection within 28 days by almost 4-fold after CQ treatment. Interestingly, patients who had schizonts in the peripheral blood on admission had significantly slower parasite clearance after CQ treatment. This presumably reflects uninterrupted schizogony and is consistent with in vitro observations showing marked reduction in activity of CQ against these stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>]. As expected, children who have less natural immunity against malaria were more at risk of parasite recurrence independent of the above-mentioned risk factors. During follow-up, the risk of recurrence of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection was significantly greater after CQ than after DP treatment (AHR, 2.3), a difference that was already apparent by day 28.</p><p>Recurrences can result from recrudescence, reinfection, or relapses from dormant liver stages, although we were unable to distinguish between these. Both CQ and DP have long elimination phases and therefore persistent blood concentrations, delaying the time to the first relapse. In areas where CQ sensitive parasites predominate, the prolonged posttreatment prophylaxis of CQ usually affords a minimum of 28 days without recurrence. In the current study the main difference in the parasitologic response between CQ and DP was evident within this period, with nearly 9% of patients treated with CQ having a recurrence by day 28. This figure is 3 times higher than in our previous study in 1996, but one-third of that reported from neighboring Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. In addition, in 1 of these early recurrences (day 21) the combined CQ plus desethylchloroquine plasma concentration (15.5 ng/mL) was higher than the MEC of 12 ng/mL, demonstrating recurrence through drug levels that would be expected to inhibit CQ-sensitive parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>]. In the latest published study in the same area, primaquine was administered with CQ, which may have masked the emergence of recurrences by day 28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>]. In the present study, the confounding effect of primaquine asexual stage activity was avoided by administering the drug at the end of the follow-up period, to focus solely on evaluating the main schizontocidal drugs. Associated in vitro results highlight the fact that whereas the IC<sub>50</sub> values for CQ were generally low (median, 27.4 ng/mL), some isolates exhibited relatively high values. Drug susceptibility testing was performed only in a small proportion of patients, and hence our study was underpowered to assess the in vivo&#x02013;ex vivo correlates. However, in the parasites that could be tested, 13% of isolates had reduced susceptibility to CQ (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e;100 nmol/L), in keeping with the overall 9% risk of recurrence within 28 days.</p><p>In conclusion our results suggest that CQ efficacy on the Northwestern border of Thailand is declining. DP is a suitable alternative in the treatment of <italic>P</italic><italic>. vivax</italic> infections in this area, although further studies are needed to define how best to combine this treatment with appropriate antirelapse therapy (primaquine).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><sec><title>Acknowledgments.</title><p>&#x02003;We thank all the patients and staff at all the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) clinics who participated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial support.</title><p content-type="financial-disclosure">&#x02003;Holley Pharm provided financial support for the study and donated the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine but had no role in the planning, design, and conduct of the study, nor in the analysis and interpretation of results or writing of the manuscript. <funding-source>The SMRU is attached to the Faculty of Tropical Medicine</funding-source>, <funding-source>Mahidol University</funding-source>.
