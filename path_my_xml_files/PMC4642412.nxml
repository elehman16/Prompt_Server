For individuals advised to increase PA, we also observed greater improvements in those two self-reported indices (<italic>P</italic>=.006 and <italic>P</italic>=.008, respectively) with increased personalization of the advice (L2 and L3 vs L1). However, there were no significant differences in accelerometer results between personalized and control groups, and no significant effect of adding phenotypic or genotypic information to the tailored feedback at month 3 or 6. After 6 months, there were small but significant improvements in the objectively measured physical activity level (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05), moderate PA (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.01), and sedentary time (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001) for individuals advised to increase PA, but these changes were similar across all groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Different levels of personalization produced similar small changes in objective PA.

Thus, it is crucial to measure PA objectively in any PA intervention study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01530139; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01530139 (Archived by WebCite at: http://www.webcitation.org/6XII1QwHz)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>eHealth</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>personalized nutrition</kwd><kwd>genotype</kwd><kwd>phenotype</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical inactivity is one of the major risk factors for noncommunicable diseases [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been estimated that in 2008, approximately 7.3% of the 9.2 million deaths occurring in Europe were attributed to physical inactivity compared with 3.7% attributed to obesity [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Increasing physical activity (PA) continues to be a public health priority. Although public knowledge of the health benefits of regular PA is good and the recommendation of &#x0201c;30 min per day of activity most days of the week&#x0201d; is recognized widely, recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that 35% of European adults do not meet PA recommendations [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Finding effective ways to increase PA is challenging. The limited success of "one size fits all" PA promotion programs may be partly due to the fact that inactive individuals are unaware that their current PA is inadequate [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, providing personalized PA feedback may be more effective in increasing PA than a nonpersonalized conventional approach. Internet-based interventions for PA may have potential to increase levels of PA because large numbers of physically inactive individuals can be reached. However, it has been pointed out that positive effects were quite small, and might not be sustained in the long term. Furthermore, objective PA measurements and greater sample sizes are required [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies have used self-reports, such as the Baecke questionnaire or the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], objective measurements of PA are more reliable [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Developments of PA measurement devices in the last decade have improved quantification of PA in free-living subjects. Accelerometers, for instance, have become popular because they can be worn without major inconvenience, require little effort by the user, and are compatible with most daily activities. Because they can record data for up to several weeks and measure PA accurately [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], they are useful research tools. In spite of this, few studies comparing tailored PA advice with nontailored or no advice have included these objective measures of PA [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Whether personalized PA feedback promotes behavioral change remains unclear. We used data collected during the Food4Me Study, which was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01530139), to investigate the impact of different levels of personalization on PA change, using phenotypic and genotypic information to tailor the PA advice (see also <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). We hypothesized that individually tailored advice would lead to greater and more sustained changes in PA, and that the intervention would be more effective as the level of personalization increased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Full details of the study protocols have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, the Food4Me proof-of-principle study was a 6-month, 4-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted across seven European countries to compare the effects of three levels of personalized advice with standard population advice on health-related outcomes. The intervention was designed to emulate an Internet-based service [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and aimed to answer the following primary questions: (1) does personalization of dietary and PA advice result in bigger improvement in diet and PA compared with nonpersonalized, conventional guidelines? And (2) is personalization based on individualized phenotypic or genotypic information more effective in assisting and/or motivating participants to make and sustain appropriate healthy changes than personalization based on analysis of baseline diet and PA alone? To answer these questions, participants were randomized to a control group (Level 0) or to one of three personalized intervention groups with increasingly more detailed personalized advice (Levels 1 to 3) for 6 months. The levels are described in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Textbox 1</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><caption><title>Description of control and intervention groups and their levels of personalization in the Food4Me Study.</title></caption><p>Levels of personalization</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Level 0 (L0; control group): nonpersonalized advice based on (European) general guidelines for diet and PA</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level 1 (L1): personalized advice based on individual dietary intake and PA alone</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level 2 (L2): personalized advice based on individual dietary intake, PA, and phenotypic data</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level 3 (L3): personalized advice based on individual dietary intake, PA, and phenotypic and genotypic data</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><p>In the personalized groups, personalization of the PA advice was greater in L2 and L3 compared with L1: it was linked to phenotypic data (waist circumference, blood total cholesterol; L2 and L3) and genotypic data (fat mass- and obesity-associated gene, <italic>FTO</italic>; L3).

The device is small (3.2 &#x000d7; 3.2 &#x000d7; 0.5 cm), light (12.5 g), waterproof to a depth of 30 m, has a battery life of 3 weeks, and can record data for up to 22 weeks.</p><p>Participants activated the TracmorD accelerometer by creating an account online, installing an app on their computer, and connecting the device to the computer using the USB adapter provided. Upon activation, men could choose between three wearing positions&#x02014;pocket, belt, or necklace&#x02014;and women between four wearing positions&#x02014;pocket, belt, necklace, or bra. Participants could change their wearing position after informing the research team, who would update the position in the online system. Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer every day during waking hours, except when taking a shower, for the entire duration of the study. Participants uploaded data every 2 weeks by connecting their monitor to their computer. Researchers checked this regularly and sent reminders to participants, if necessary. The data were transferred in real time and stored on a secured server.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective Physical Activity Data Processing</title><p>Data were recorded with a time-sampling interval of 1 minute. A day was considered valid if the participant had worn the TracmorD for at least 10 hours but not longer than 18 hours. Wear time was defined as 24 hours minus nonwear time. To define nonwear time, we adapted the recommendations of Choi et al [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to the TracmorD. Physical activity level (PAL)&#x02014;the ratio of total energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate&#x02014;data per minute were estimated from activity counts [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nonwear time was defined by an interval of at least 90 consecutive minutes of PAL per minute values below 1.3889, allowing for 2-minute intervals of values above the threshold, with the upstream or downstream 30 consecutive values below the threshold (for detection of artifactual movements). R software version 3.1.2 [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used for all data handling.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective Physical Activity Variables</title><p>Daily PAL, activity energy expenditure (AEE), and time spent in different PA intensities were derived from the accelerometer.</p><p>PAL-per-day calculations were based on the work by Bonomi et al [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]:</p><p>PAL = 1.354 + (256 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9</sup>) &#x000d7; counts<sub>day</sub> (1)</p><p>where counts<sub>day</sub> are the sum of minute-by-minute activity counts over 24 hours.

Sedentary time and time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA were determined by summing the time during which AEE per minute met the criterion for the appropriate intensity. Finally, moderate-equivalent PA was defined as follows:</p><p>Moderate-equivalent PA = MPA + 2 &#x000d7; VPA (3)</p><p>to account for the fact that 1 minute of VPA is equivalent to 2 minutes of MPA [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moderate-equivalent PA duration data were also calculated for activity occurring in modified bouts of 10 minutes (ie, with allowance for interruptions of &#x02264;2 minutes at a lower PA intensity) [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>PA estimates at baseline, month 3, and month 6 were calculated over a 2-week period at each time point. This 2-week assessment period occurred before any feedback was given to participants. Sufficient PA data at each time point was defined as having at least 3 valid weekdays and 2 valid weekend days of accelerometer wear during the 2-week assessment period. For individuals with sufficient PA data, mean data per day were calculated for all objective PA variables using all valid week and weekend days of the assessment period as follows:</p><p>Mean = (mean for weekdays &#x000d7; 5 + mean for weekend days &#x000d7; 2) / 7 (4).</p><p>For sedentary time and time spent in LPA, MPA, VPA, and moderate-equivalent PA, weekly estimates were also calculated as follows:</p><p>Mean = (mean for weekdays &#x000d7; 5 + mean for weekend days &#x000d7; 2) (5).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Self-Reported Physical Activity</title><p>At baseline, month 3, and month 6, participants completed the Baecke questionnaire online [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] based on their PA during the last month.

Participants in personalized groups (L1, L2, and L3) received personalized feedback based on accelerometer data (or self-reported data if accelerometer data were not available), whereas controls (L0) received a PDF containing general guidelines (see the following section). At each time point, researchers calculated the average PAL based on 2 weeks of accelerometer data collection for each participant and used it in the derivation of the PA feedback for personalized groups (L1 to L3). The feedback report was sent 1 to 2 weeks after this 2-week measuring period. For L0, the same generalized advice was sent at months 0 and 3. After completing the study, all participants received a personalized report based on the 6-month intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Cutoffs Definition</title><p>PA was defined as adequate if objective PAL was &#x02265;1.8. A value of PAL &#x02265;1.5 and &#x0003c;1.8 was considered low and a PAL of &#x0003c;1.5 was considered very low. If accelerometer data were not available at the time of feedback, the total activity index of the Baecke questionnaire was used instead of PAL with the following cutoffs: &#x02265;8.5 (adequate PA), &#x02265;5.5 to &#x0003c;8.5 (low), and &#x0003c;5.5 (very low).</p></sec><sec><title>Derivation of Feedback Messages in Relation to Physical Activity</title><sec><title>Level 0 (Controls)</title><p>Participants in the control group received the nonpersonalized advice that they should be physically active at least 150 minutes per week.</p><p>Feedback reports in personalized groups contained specific messages, selected according to standardized algorithms, based on subjects&#x02019; characteristics and their allocated group.</p></sec><sec><title>Level 1</title><p>In the PA section of the personalized report, current level of PA was indicated with a mark on a three-color line, based on the cutoffs defined above: red area (very low PAL), amber (low PAL), and green (adequate PAL).

For example, an inactive obese L3 participant with <italic>FTO</italic> risk (AA or AT genotype), high waist circumference, and high total cholesterol would receive the following advice:</p><disp-quote><p>Your BMI is greater than the recommended healthy range (...). Your waist circumference is also higher than recommended (...).

Also, your physical activity level is too low; improving your physical activity level will help you to reduce your weight. Your fasting cholesterol level was above the recommended level and we advise you to go to the G.P. [general practitioner] to get this re-checked (...). Become more physically active; to maintain weight loss, 60-90 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activities, such as brisk walking, swimming or cycling, on most days of the week, is recommended. This will also help to lower cholesterol levels.</p></disp-quote><p>PA feedback for L3 participants not carrying the risk for <italic>FTO</italic> was similar to that of L2 participants.

More details of the feedback reports and the Food4Me website are given in the supplementary material (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>) and elsewhere [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. We defined 3 orthogonal contrasts to answer our research questions: first comparing L0 with L1 to L3, then L1 with L2 and L3, and finally L2 with L3. More specifically, to answer the first research question&#x02014;Is personalized advice more effective than the conventional one size fits all?&#x02014;intervention effects on PA variables were assessed. We used robust multiple linear regression analysis, based on computation of SMDM estimates [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to account for violation of the normality assumption, with baseline PA variable, sex, age, country, smoking, baseline BMI, baseline season, and change in body weight as covariates. For accelerometer-derived PA variables, change in accelerometer wear time was included as an additional covariate. The principal assessment of intervention used Contrast 1 comparing L0 with the mean of L1 to L3. First, a generic approach was used where intervention effects for the total cohort were investigated. Second, a targeted approach was used in which the intervention effects on PA, only for participants who received advice to increase their PA, were investigated. For the second part, outcomes for those who received tailored advice targeting PA were compared with the subset of matched L0 (control) participants (ie, controls who would have received personalized advice to increase PA if they had been in a personalized group instead of L0). These matched L0 participants were selected by applying the same algorithm used for individuals in personalized groups.</p><p>The second research question&#x02014;"Is personalization based on individualized dietary, phenotypic, or genotypic information more effective in promoting changes in PA than personalization based on diet and PA alone?&#x0201d;&#x02014;was tested using two other contrasts. For Contrast 2, comparison of L1 with L2 and L3 tested whether personalization based on phenotypic and/or genotypic information differed from that based on dietary and PA assessment only. For Contrast 3, comparison of L2 with L3 tested whether the addition of genotypic information promoted a greater increase in PA than when using phenotypic, dietary, and PA information only. The analyses outcomes were the same PA variables as for Contrast 1 and both generic and targeted approaches were used.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were performed to compare dropouts with completers and noncompliant (ie, those with too few valid days) with compliant participants. These analyses were performed using robust multiple linear regression for continuous variables and logistic regression for categorical variables, adjusting for sex, age, and country as well as baseline accelerometer wear time and season for accelerometer variables. When examining differences in BMI between dropouts and completers, screening data were used rather than baseline data because 38% of dropouts had no baseline data. R software version 3.1.2 [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used to perform all analyses and the significance level was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title> Study Participants</title><p>Of the 5562 individuals who expressed an interest in the Food4Me Study between August 2012 and August 2013, 4044 (72.71%) completed the whole screening process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).

In addition, after 6 months of intervention, including phenotypic and/or genotypic information in the derivation of personalized PA advice led to bigger changes in self-reported PA than personalization based on diet and PA alone. However, these findings were not confirmed when PA was assessed objectively using accelerometers. Although we found some small significant improvements in objectively measured PA over the 6-month intervention, these changes were similar in all interventions groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Previous Work</title><p>Most studies that have investigated the effectiveness of eHealth computer-tailored PA interventions have relied on self-reports [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and their findings should be interpreted with caution. Few studies were identified that used objective PA outcome measures based on accelerometry [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Godino et al [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] noted that personalized PA feedback increased awareness of PA but did not promote change in PA after 2 months of follow-up. However, Hurling et al [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found that participants who had access to a fully automated Internet, email, and mobile phone behavior change system&#x02014;which included feedback on activity level and modules designed to help participants identify their perceived barriers and offered tailored solutions&#x02014;had significantly higher objectively measured PA during the 9-week intervention compared with controls, who received verbal recommendations on PA but had no access to the behavior change system and received no feedback. Self-reported leisure PA was also significantly higher and time spent sitting significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the controls, but overall self-reported PA was similar in both groups [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a study of older adults, Wijsman et al [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed that participants in an Internet program aiming to increase PA by monitoring and feedback by accelerometer and digital coaching had a significant increase of 11 minutes per day in moderate and vigorous PA after 3 months, whereas the wait-listed controls showed no change in PA. Ashe et al [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found significant increases in PA, as well as group differences at month 6, but their sample was small&#x02014;13 participants in the intervention group and 12 in the control group&#x02014;and group-based education and social support was included in addition to their Web-based intervention. Finally, Wanner et al [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported some improvements in self-reported PA after 6 weeks and 13 months of follow-up, but no differences between individuals in tailored and control groups, and no improvement in objectively measured PA for any group. These discrepancies between self-reported and objectively measured PA results are in line with our study. However, we found greater improvements in self-reported PA in tailored groups as compared with the controls. It could be that participants desired to comply with recommendations and that receiving more personalized feedback (Levels 2 and 3) increased this desire further in our study. It could also be that participants truly believed that they became more active when they actually did not. Contrary to Wanner et al, objective PA also improved, slightly but significantly, after 6 months of intervention, especially in participants who were inactive at baseline, in line with the results of Wijsman et al and Ashe et al. Yet in our study, those changes in objective PA were similar across all groups.</p><p>The number of studies testing the effectiveness of personalized feedback versus conventional population-based guidelines is limited. However, most authors stress the need for new ways to increase compliance and engagement of participants to ultimately successfully improve PA. Of those who started the Food4Me Study, 85.81% (1270/1480) completed the trial, indicating that our Web-based intervention was effective in retaining participants. However, only 49.32% (730/1480) of the starters had sufficient valid accelerometer data after 6 months. Thus, compliance with the study protocol in wearing the accelerometer remains a major issue, especially because those who were less compliant in our study had significantly lower baseline PAL.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The Food4Me Study is the largest Internet-based RCT to date to test the effects of personalized feedback on PA, using objectively measured PA with accelerometers. To our knowledge, it is also the first study to assess the effects of different levels of personalization including tailored phenotypic and genotypic information. Another strength is the inclusion of seven European centers that delivered the intervention with the same standardized protocol [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>An important limitation is the relatively low compliance after 6 months with respect to accelerometer wear, which is lower than in other studies [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, participants were asked to wear their accelerometer every day for the entire duration of the study, which may have been too demanding. Most participants did wear the accelerometer but not enough (ie, fewer than 3 valid weekdays and 2 valid weekend days). In other studies, participants received a PA monitor, were asked to wear it for the measurement period only (typically, 7 days), and to return the device immediately after to the researchers [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Better compliance in wearing the monitor may be obtained by having coaches motivating participants regularly [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but this is not always feasible in a large-scale study. Advertisement for the study was primarily focused on personalized nutrition (ie, improving nutritional intakes) and not on PA. Moreover, the Food4Me Study was a multiple-behavior intervention including a large amount of information with extensive feedback, and many individuals may have felt they did not have time to try to make changes in both PA and diet concurrently [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>A potential explanation as to why participants in personalized groups did not do better than controls could be that the TracmorD PA monitor used in the study constituted a basic, yet personalized, feedback by itself. That is, when the monitor is set on a flat surface at any time (eg, a table), lights on the monitor turn green depending on how much activity has been registered during the day. The more activity, the more lights turn green, for all participants including controls. Ideally, there should be no feedback on PA at all in the control group. This may explain the small but significant improvement in the control group. One could argue that providing feedback every 3 months might not be sufficiently frequent. In our study, half of the participants in the personalized groups received additional feedback based on measurements after 1 and 2 months (ie, high-intensity feedback: four feedback reports at months 0, 1, 2, and 3) but changes in objectively and self-reported PA at 3- and 6-month follow-up were similar to the other half of participants (ie, low-intensity feedback: feedback reports at months 0 and 3 only). Compliance in wearing the monitor did not differ between high- and low-intensity participants (data not shown). Furthermore, we cannot exclude the fact that phenotypic and genotypic characterization, and therefore feedback to participants in Levels 2 and 3, may not have been optimal for PA-related outcomes. For example, our only PA-related genotypic variant was in the <italic>FTO</italic> gene and perhaps just one gene variant would be insufficient to motivate participants in Level 3 to increase PA beyond those in Level 2.</p><p>Finally, although accelerometry is an objective measure of PA, it can underestimate certain activities, such as carrying heavy loads and when the torso remains relatively static (eg, during cycling). Accelerometry cannot (easily) distinguish PA when ascending (eg, walking uphill) from movement on the flat yet there could be large differences in energy expenditure between the two types of movement. Our monitor was waterproof and could be worn during swimming, but underestimation of activity intensity is common. Nevertheless, the TracmorD has been validated against the doubly labeled water method and several publications show that it is a reliable and accurate monitor [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although devices may not capture all types of PA, questionnaires have been shown repeatedly to be inaccurate, often overestimating PA [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The Baecke questionnaire, although extensively validated [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], is no exception [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our results support the position adopted by others that self-reported measures of PA should be interpreted with caution and preferably not be used to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of PA interventions [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, it is better for personalized feedback to have objective measures of PA such as accelerometry. Such technologies are becoming very relevant tools for both surveys and interventions to promote public health. They are developing rapidly and are commonly available for download to mobile phones and watches, allowing greater accessibility for the general population, which may help with noncompliance. However, these new apps will need to be rigorously tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We observed small but significant improvements in objectively measured PA after 3 and 6 months of intervention, although changes were similar across all groups. Personalized advice on PA did not promote larger and more sustained improvements in objective PA as compared with a conventional &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; approach delivered via the Internet. Furthermore, increasing the degree of personalization using phenotypic or genotypic information had no effect on changes in objectively measured PA compared with personalized feedback based on diet and PA alone. Based on self-reports, however, PA improved significantly more with higher degrees of personalized advice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Food4Me Study was supported by the European Commission under the Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology Theme of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (grant number 265494).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors' Contributions: JCM was the Food4Me intervention study coordinator.
