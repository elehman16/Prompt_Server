Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives have been available outside the United States for several decades. However, their use has been restricted to small, low-tension lacerations and incisions by the inferior mechanical properties of the butyl-cyanoacrylate, such as poor tensile strength and brittle nature. The development and introduction of the stronger and more flexible octyl-cyanoacrylate in 1998 has been a major advance in the wound closure field and has been used widely. Along with increased flexibility, it has 4 times the breaking strength of the older type cyanoacrylate. Therefore, it is indicated for use on a wider variety of wound types and ideal for study.</p><p>Diagnostic or operative laparoscopy as a minimally invasive procedure is one of the most common operations in gynecologic surgery. The benefits of minimally invasive surgery as opposed to the traditional open surgical approach are reduced pain, quicker return of oral intake, shorter hospitalization, and improved cosmetic results due to decreased scarring. There are several methods for skin closure of trocar wounds. The choice of material is often based on a surgeon's personal experience. Common procedures include closure with simple, transcutaneous, or subcuticular sutures and more recently, the tissue adhesive OCT. In addition to the above advantages of laparoscopic surgery, acceptable wound cosmetic appearance and complication are also considered important outcomes following laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>The advantages and disadvantages of these different methods have been studied to some degree.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Methods for closure of laparoscopic port sites vary in published series and are largely the result of surgeons' need for a rapid, economic, and reproducible technique of skin apposition. Based on previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> advantages of skin adhesives may include less time to apply and potentially good cosmetic outcomes.</p><p>The present study was designed to compare the postoperative wound characteristics of octyl-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (OCT) with common suture techniques for the closure of 5-mm abdominal laparoscopic port sites in the same patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>From March 2007 to June 2008, 40 patients who had 2 lateral lower abdominal wall 5-mm ports for elective advanced laparoscopic procedures were enrolled in this prospective, randomized controlled trial. The study was IRB approved (ClinicalTrials.gov indentifier: NCT00466648). Detailed informed consent was obtained from all patients preoperatively. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery with at least two 5-mm ports in the lower abdomen were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included previous abdominal surgery, allergy to skin adhesives, and intraoperative enlargement of port sites.</p><p>The closure technique was randomized in each patient with one side port closed using OCT (Dermabond, Ethicon, Commerville, NJ) and the opposite port closed with single transcutaneous suture with 4&#x02013;0 monofilament delayed absorbable suture. All sites were covered with a self-adhesive bandage (Bandaide, Ethicon, Commerville, NJ).</p><p>Subjects were instructed to remove the bandage after 72 hours. Postoperative wound evaluations were performed 2 weeks to 4 weeks after the procedure by the patient and a clinic physician. Signs of inflammation, such as erythema, warmth, tenderness, drainage, and wound infection, were evaluated. The Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES) was used for cosmetic evaluation. Neither the patient nor the clinic physician was informed of treatment assignment.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the chi-square test was used to compare infection, signs of inflammation, and individual components of HWES. Total HWES score was compared with the <italic>t</italic> test, and P value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. A sample size estimate indicated that 38 subjects (76 wounds) would be needed to detect a 10% difference in the HWES score. The study was approved for 40 subjects anticipating some drop outs, but no subject was lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 40 eligible patients returned to the office 2 weeks to 4 week after the surgery for postoperation wound evaluation. Age ranged from 20 years to 68 years. Ethnicity included 40% Caucasian and 60% other minorities (Asian, Africa American, and Hispanic). BMIs ranged from 19 to 25 with an average of 22.

With each of the 40 patients serving as their own control, this unique experimental design allowed us to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic port closure more effectively and precisely. All possible confounding variables were controlled for by this study design. This study demonstrates that laparoscopic ports closed with OCT had less erythema, tenderness, and drainage. Closures with OCT also had less margin separation and higher overall HWES scores.</p><p>Transcutaneous suture of laparoscopic port sites has been a standard procedure for wound closure for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Since absorbable sutures have been developed, subcuticular suturing of laparoscopic skin incisions has become more popular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Due to the additional work and expense for removal of nonabsorbable sutures, some surgeons may prefer the use of absorbable material. Other studies have found no differences with respect to wound infection, wound dehiscence, and development of hyperplastic scars or keloid between the applications of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures in intradermal repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Another prospective randomized trial of closing laparoscopic trocar wounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> indicated that transcutaneous suture had fewer postoperative complications and pain compared with subcuticular suture. Therefore, transcutaneous suture was used in closing laparoscopic trocar wounds in our study instead of subcuticular suture.</p><p>Recently, multiple studies have sometimes demonstrated that wound closure with OCT is comparable to closure with other standard wound closure devices and potentially offers additional benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> Generally, OCT is indicated for any low-tension surgical incision or laceration whose edges are easily approximated with the operators' fingers or forceps, regardless of their length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup></p><p>An earlier randomized clinical trial comparing OCT with sutures for closing 136 facial lacerations in adults was reported by Quinn et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> in 1997. No differences were found between the groups in the visual analogue cosmetics scores or the percentage of wounds receiving optimal wound evaluation scores, but wound closure with the adhesive was found to be faster and less painful than suture. Dey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> performed a clinical trial in which 55 women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy or laparotomy through a transverse skin incision were randomized to skin closure with either a running subcuticular stitch or OCT. Skin closure times using OCT were significantly shorter in patients undergoing either laparoscopy or laparotomy. Pain was significantly less on postoperative day 1 in the laparoscopic patients whose wounds were closed with OCT. Our study design is consistent with previous studies, demonstrating decreased pain in OCT closures.</p><p>Additional studies have also demonstrated the successful use of OCT for closure of pediatric surgical incisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> and neurosurgical incisions of the scalp, back, and torso<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> with lower rates of infection and dehiscence. Our study had similar results and showed that abdominal laparoscopic ports closed with OCT had fewer inflammatory reactions, such as erythema and drainage compared with suture.</p><p>Interestingly, a smaller study from the Greene group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> compared the surgical efficacy and wound healing characteristics of OCT with traditional suture in bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty, where each of 20 patients served as their own control. They found no differences in wound complications, inflammation, or final incision appearance. However blepharoplasty may not be relevant to abdominal wall surgery. Different skin tension and blood supply of the different body areas may explain differences between our results and Greene's.</p><p>Previous studies also showed that surgical incisions closed with OCT had lower dehiscence rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> Our study showed that laparoscopic ports closed with OCT had less margin separation and better overall HWES scores. On the other hand, laparoscopic ports closed with OCT had slightly more contour irregularity compared with ports closed with suture. Most contour irregularity in the OCT group was observed in the early part of our study. After the technique for applying OCT changed, only one contour irregularity was observed. Using tissue forceps with a fine tooth to approximate the wound was better than using the operator's hand and resulted in less contour irregularity. It seems that the technique for applying OCT plays an important role in contour irregularity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study demonstrates that 5-mm laparoscopic port sites in the lower abdominal area closed with OCT had fewer complications and better cosmetic results in women undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Given this and previous randomized clinical trials, our practice has changed to preferentially use OCT for 5-mm laparoscopic port-site closure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
