Recent safety concerns, however, have prompted changes to ESA product information. In the European Union and United States, ESA therapy initiation for CIA is now recommended at a Hb level &#x02264;10 g/dL. The present exploratory analysis examined how ESA initiation at this Hb level may impact patient care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data from a phase 3 randomized trial were retrospectively reanalyzed. CIA patients with nonmyeloid malignancies were randomized 1:1 to 500 mcg darbepoetin alfa every three weeks (Q3W) or 2.25 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa weekly (QW) for 15 weeks. A previously published report from this trial showed Q3W dosing was non-inferior to QW dosing for reducing transfusions from week 5 to end-of-the-treatment period (EOTP). In the present analysis, outcomes were reanalyzed by baseline Hb &#x0003c;10 g/dL and &#x02265;10 g/dL. Endpoints included transfusion rates, Hb outcomes, and safety profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>This study reanalyzed 351 and 354 patients who initiated ESA therapy at a baseline Hb of &#x0003c;10 g/dL or &#x02265;10 g/dL, respectively. From week 5 to EOTP, the estimated Kaplan-Meier transfusion incidence (Q3W vs QW) was lower in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group (14% vs 21%) compared with the &#x0003c;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group (36% vs 41%). By week 5, the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group, but not the &#x0003c;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group, achieved a mean Hb &#x02265;11 g/dL. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of percentage of patients (Q3W vs QW) who achieved Hb &#x02265;11 g/dL from week 1 to EOTP was 90% vs 85% in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group and 54% vs 57% in the &#x0003c;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group. Both baseline-Hb groups maintained mean Hb levels &#x0003c;12 g/dL and had similar safety profiles, though more patients in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group reached the threshold Hb of &#x02265;13 g/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this exploratory analysis, darbepoetin alfa Q3W and QW raised Hb levels and maintained mean Hb at &#x0003c;12 g/dL in both baseline-Hb groups. The &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had fewer transfusions and faster anemia correction. Additional studies should prospectively evaluate the relationship between Hb levels at ESA initiation and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00118638.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Patients with cancer who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy may develop chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA), which can be a debilitating condition resulting in increased morbidities and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are recombinant therapeutic agents (such as darbepoetin alfa and Epoetin alfa) that are used to treat anemia. Another method used to treat anemia is red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which have only a transient effect and are associated with risks, such as exposure to infectious agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the more common risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, a retrospective cohort study recently observed that transfusions were associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events and increased mortality in hospitalized cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There are also safety concerns with ESAs, including the established increased risk of venous thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, ESAs are currently the only therapeutic alternative to transfusions.</p><p>Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of ESAs for reducing the incidence of transfusions and raising hemoglobin (Hb) levels in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some studies have also indicated that ESAs can reduce fatigue in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as recognized by evidence-based guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ESAs are currently approved in both the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for treating anemia in cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Though ESAs appear to have an established efficacy profile and favorable adverse-event profile in adult cancer patients, recent findings from several individual studies conducted in off-label ESA settings have raised concerns regarding the potential for ESA-associated adverse survival and disease progression outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Information from eight individual studies reporting increased mortality and/or disease progression with ESA use have been added globally to all ESA product information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although 4 of these 8 studies were conducted in the approved chemotherapy setting, 3 of the 4 were anemia-prevention studies that allowed inclusion of patients with high baseline Hb levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and all 4 studies targeted high Hb values (&#x02265;12 g/dL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The 4 studies not conducted in the chemotherapy setting were performed in off-label settings, such as patients not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (ie, anemia of cancer [AoC]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and patients receiving radiotherapy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In addition to describing information from these studies, the EU product information for all ESAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] also states that 1) ESA therapy should be initiated at a Hb level &#x02264;10 g/dL, 2) the Hb target range should be 10 to 12 g/dL, and 3) a sustained Hb level &#x0003e; 12 g/dL attained with ESA use should be avoided. The US ESA product information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] recommends that ESAs 1) not be used in the AoC or radiotherapy alone settings, 2) are not indicated for the treatment of anemia in the chemotherapy setting when the anticipated outcome is cancer cure, 3) be initiated in patients with Hb levels &#x0003c; 10 g/dL, and 4) be used to maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid transfusions.</p><p>Meta-analyses have been performed to examine the body of evidence available from controlled ESA studies performed in cancer patients. Fifty-nine randomized controlled ESA trials that reported mortality, conducted in both on-label and off-label ESA settings, were identified in a literature search conducted for a 2008 meeting between the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the companies that market ESAs in the US (Amgen Inc. and Centocor Ortho Biotech, which is a subsidiary of Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The meta-analysis of these data, along with three additional large meta-analyses, reported point estimates for mortality for which the confidence interval included 1 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.99-1.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], 0.90-1.45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], 0.95-1.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], 0.98-1.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Recently, two large meta-analyses (including a patient-level meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration) of ESA use in all oncology settings reported 95% confidence intervals for mortality risk where the lower limit was equal to or slightly above 1 (95% CI: 1.00-1.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>],1.01-1.20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). However, in the Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis, the 95% confidence interval of the overall survival hazard ratio observed in 38 controlled ESA studies in the chemotherapy setting with 10,441 cancer patients overlapped 1 (1.04, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Unlike the previous 2006 Cochrane meta-analysis by Bohlius et al (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], this more recent meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration also examined on-study deaths in the same set of 38 chemotherapy trials (hazard ratio = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.24) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Because of the new environment surrounding ESA use in oncology and because varying results have been reported in meta-analyses of ESA oncology trials, additional trial data are needed to inform treatment decisions. Here we present an exploratory analysis examining hematological outcomes in CIA patients treated with darbepoetin alfa who were categorized in two baseline-Hb strata of &#x0003c; 10 g/dL or &#x02265;10 g/dL. The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight into how changes in the approved ESA recommendations regarding the Hb level at which to initiate ESA therapy may impact patient care. The data for this analysis came from a pivotal, phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled darbepoetin alfa trial in CIA patients. This trial was chosen because it was a large randomized study that compared every-three-week (Q3W) and weekly (QW) darbepoetin alfa dosing schedules, which are the two schedules listed in the darbepoetin alfa product information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Results previously published from this trial by Canon et al (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] indicated that 500 mcg Q3W darbepoetin alfa was non-inferior to 2.25 mcg/kg QW darbepoetin alfa in reducing the transfusion incidence from week 5 to end of the treatment period (EOTP) (the trial's primary endpoint) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Q3W and QW treatment arms also produced similar results for the secondary endpoints, which included the percentage of patients achieving a target Hb &#x02265;11 g/dL from week 5 to EOTP, the change in Hb levels from baseline to EOTP, and safety outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present exploratory analysis from this trial, patients were analyzed according to baseline-Hb category (&#x0003c; 10 g/dL vs &#x02265;10 g/dL); outcomes examined included the effect of Q3W or QW darbepoetin alfa on transfusion rates, Hb levels, and safety endpoints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>The patient-eligibility criteria and study design for this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy study are described in the primary report by Canon et al (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This trial was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00118638). An ethics committee approved the protocol at each study center, and patients provided informed consent before initiation of study procedures. Eligible patients (&#x02265;18 years of age) with CIA (Hb level &#x0003c; 11 g/dL within 24 hours prior to randomization), non-myeloid malignancy, at least 12 weeks of planned cytotoxic chemotherapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were randomized 1:1 to receive 15 weeks of a fixed dose of 500 mcg Q3W darbepoetin alfa or a weight-based dose of 2.25 mcg/kg QW darbepoetin alfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Randomization was stratified by tumor type (lung or gynecologic vs others), screening Hb concentration (&#x0003c; 10 g/dL vs &#x02265;10 g/dL), and European region (Western vs Central and Eastern). The dose of blinded study drug was withheld if a patient's Hb level was &#x0003e; 13 g/dL; after Hb levels decreased to &#x02264;12 g/dL, study drug was reinstated at 60% of the previous dose. If Hb levels increased by &#x02265;1 g/dL over a 14-day period (in the absence of a RBC transfusion during the previous 14 days), the dose of study drug was decreased to 60% of that used previously. Any additional dose reductions proceeded in 40% dose decrements. Transfusions were recommended, but not mandated, for patients with a Hb concentration &#x02264;8 g/dL or &#x0003e; 8 g/dL with symptoms of anemia. All randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and remained in the study until at least day 29 were included in the analyses. Safety endpoints were evaluated according to treatment actually received in patients who received at least one dose of study drug.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was to examine if Q3W darbepoetin alfa was non-inferior to QW darbepoetin alfa for reducing transfusions from week 5 to EOTP (defined as the earlier of day 109 or end of study). This time period was chosen as ESA effects are often not apparent until the second month of ESA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This time period has been accepted by regulatory agencies as sufficient for drug approval. However, as some patients respond before that timeframe, a sensitivity analysis was also performed of transfusion incidence from week 1 to EOTP. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of patients with at least one RBC transfusion from week 5 to EOTP for the Q3W vs QW regimen. Non-inferiority of the Q3W regimen was determined if the upper limit of the 95% CI for this difference was &#x02264;12.5% (based on transfusion data from two placebo-controlled darbepoetin alfa trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A sample size of 705 patients was originally determined to provide 95% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Q3W schedule compared with the QW schedule in regards to the transfusion rate from week 5 to EOTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints and statistical methods for the exploratory analysis</title><p>For the exploratory analysis reported here, data from patients in the trial were analyzed by their baseline-Hb category: &#x0003c; 10 g/dL and &#x02265;10 g/dL. Efficacy outcomes examined in the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and further summarized here, included the percentage of patients with RBC transfusions and the Hb profiles over time. In the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group, this exploratory analysis also assessed the incidence of patients who achieved a Hb level &#x02265;10 g/dL and the time to first achievement of a Hb level &#x02265;10 g/dL. Patients in both baseline-Hb groups who had a baseline Hb value and at least one post-baseline Hb value were examined for the percentage achieving a Hb level &#x02265;11 g/dL, as well as for how long it took to achieve a Hb level &#x02265;11 g/dL. There was one patient with Hb &#x0003e; 11 g/dL at both screening and baseline (ie, protocol violation), as well as a second patient who had Hb &#x0003c; 11 g/dL at screening which then rose to 11 g/dL at baseline (screening and baseline measures could be up to 4 days apart). These two patients were included in the study and dosed per the protocol, although they were not included in the analyses of patients achieving Hb &#x02265;11 g/dL.</p><p>Safety endpoints examined in this exploratory analysis included the incidence of adverse events, the percentage of patients reaching a Hb level &#x02265;12 g/dL or &#x02265;13 g/dL at any time on study, and the proportion of patients with a rapid Hb increase of &#x02265;1 g/dL in a 14-day window or &#x02265;2 g/dL in a 28-day window.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 8.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics included frequencies with 95% CIs for categorical variables and means with standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to analyze the incidence of transfusions and the proportion of patients achieving a specific Hb level. Hb concentrations measured within 28 days of a RBC or whole blood transfusion were excluded from the analysis. Analyses were not adjusted by stratification factors used at randomization. Adverse events were grouped by primary system organ class and by preferred term with the primary organ system class according to a MedDRA dictionary (version 7.0).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics and disease state</title><p>This phase 3 trial included 705 patients at 110 centers in 24 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present exploratory analysis, the 353 patients randomized to the 500 mcg Q3W darbepoetin arm in the primary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were categorized into a baseline-Hb group of either &#x0003c; 10 g/dL (176 patients) or &#x02265;10 g/dL (177 patients). The 352 patients randomized to the 2.25 mcg/kg QW darbepoetin arm were also categorized into a baseline-Hb group of either &#x0003c; 10 g/dL (175 patients) or &#x02265;10 g/dL (177 patients). Thus, the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group contained 351 patients and the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group contained 354 patients. The overall mean (SD) baseline Hb level in the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group was 9.05 g/dL (0.71), ranging from 5.9 to 9.9 g/dL, while the mean (SD) in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group was 10.48 g/dL (0.30), ranging from 10.0 to 11.8 g/dL (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Other than the baseline Hb level, the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL and &#x02265; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb groups had fairly similar demographics and baseline characteristics; these characteristics were also similar across the two darbepoetin dosing schedules (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Common tumor types in both the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL and &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb groups included large intestine/colon, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Of note, slightly more patients in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had colon cancer. Most patients analyzed had stage III/IV disease and were &#x0003c; 65 years of age. In patients receiving Q3W darbepoetin alfa, slightly more patients in the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had stage III/IV disease. The majority of patients in this study had a performance status of 0 or 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient

The EU ESA product information states that ESA therapy be initiated in patients with baseline Hb &#x02264;10 g/dL and that the target Hb range should be 10 to 12 g/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, the EU ESA product information also states that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment made with the participation of the individual patient that takes into account the specific clinical context (eg, the type of cancer and disease stage, the degree of anemia, life expectancy, and the environment in which the patient is being treated) and patient preference; in some clinical situations, blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for anemia management in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The US ESA product information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] states that ESAs be used to maintain the lowest possible Hb level while still avoiding transfusions. This exploratory analysis examined how the baseline Hb level (&#x0003c; 10 g/dL vs &#x02265;10 g/dL) at which darbepoetin alfa administration was initiated in CIA patients affected response to darbepoetin alfa therapy. Overall, the results from this exploratory analysis indicated that darbepoetin alfa therapy corrected anemia in both baseline-Hb groups (though correction was faster in the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group), irrespective of the dosing schedule (Q3W or QW). In addition, the incidence of most adverse events was generally similar between the two baseline-Hb groups.</p><p>In both baseline-Hb groups, Hb levels could be effectively raised with either the Q3W or QW darbepoetin alfa administration schedule to achieve Hb levels between 10 to 12 g/dL. In this analysis, initiating darbepoetin alfa therapy in patients with baseline Hb &#x02265;10 g/dL (in both the Q3W and QW schedules) resulted in fewer transfusions compared with patients with a baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL. Further, patients with &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline Hb were more likely to achieve Hb levels between 11 and 12 g/dL (while still maintaining mean Hb levels below 12 g/dL) and to do so more quickly compared with patients with baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL. However, since the original study was not designed to compare results in patients with baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL with those seen in patients with a baseline Hb &#x02265;10 g/dL, additional studies are needed to examine this point.</p><p>It should be noted that among patients with baseline Hb &#x02265;10 g/dL, more achieved Hb levels &#x02265;12 g/dL or &#x02265;13 g/dL and more experienced a rapid rise in Hb than did patients with baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL. Rises in Hb of that degree have also been observed in patients in placebo groups in controlled trials of darbepoetin alfa for CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which makes interpretation difficult. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled darbepoetin alfa trials found no increased risk of death or disease progression in ESA-treated patients achieving higher Hb levels (&#x0003e;12 g/dL or 13 g/dL) or with a rapid rise in Hb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, it is possible that those patients who were more responsive to ESAs were generally healthier, as ESA response and improved survival could both reflect better heath status. Further, in a recent larger meta-analysis (53 trials), target Hb was not found to be associated with changes in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A particular concern is that in patients who start Q3W dosing, Hb levels will undergo transient excursions into concentrations that exceed the Hb level needed to avoid a transfusion or exceed the Hb range of 10 to 12 g/dL. In this study, the mean Hb concentrations remained below 12 g/dL for both baseline-Hb groups throughout the study, irrespective of the dosing schedule (Q3W or QW). With the dosing rules used in this study, the percentage of patients within each baseline-Hb group who reached a Hb concentration of &#x02265;12 g/dL or &#x02265;13 g/dL was comparable for both the Q3W and QW dosing groups, allaying concerns about Hb concentrations exceeding recommended levels with the Q3W schedule. Dose modifications in this study resulted predominantly from the dose reduction rule for patients with a Hb rise of &#x02265;1 g/dL in a 14-day period. In the EU, the currently approved product information for darbepoetin alfa indicates similar dose reduction and stopping rules as those used in this trial (darbepoetin alfa administration was withheld in this trial at a Hb concentration &#x0003e; 13 g/dL and was reinstated at 60% of the previous dose after Hb levels decreased to 12 g/dL or less). Using titration of ESA doses may be the best method to achieve the lowest Hb dose to avoid transfusions or to maintain Hb levels in a range of 10 to 12 g/dL.</p><p>Though the safety profiles were generally similar in the two baseline-Hb groups, more deaths occurred in the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group. One possibility is that the patients with a lower baseline Hb level may have had a worse prognosis. Of interest, though the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had more deaths, fewer thromboembolic events occurred in this group compared with the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group.</p><p>An inherent limitation of this analysis was that it was not pre-specified (ie, it was exploratory). The original study was designed as a noninferiority efficacy study, and thus was not prospectively designed to assess safety. In addition, as with any post hoc analysis, performing multiple analyses can increase chance fluctuations in the outcomes. Therefore, these results cannot be considered as robust as those from a pre-specified analysis plan. Additional limitations arise from the original study design and heterogeneous patient population, both of which could confound results. Specifically, as this was a noninferiority study, there was no comparator placebo arm. Likewise, as this study was conducted at 110 medical centers in 24 countries, there could well be variations in transfusion practices from site to site or country to country. These differences were allowed by the protocol, which recommended, but did not mandate, transfusions for patients with Hb level &#x02264;8 g/dL. For the patient population, other than having at least 12 additional weeks of planned cytotoxic chemotherapy, there were no limitations regarding chemotherapy type. Patients also had different stages of disease and a variety of tumor types, including lung, breast, colon, and hematologic. Patient populations with baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL or &#x02265;10 g/dL appeared generally well-balanced regarding stage and tumor type (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); however, that does not rule out subtle differences that could affect interpretation. Lastly, the proportion of patients in each group who died could be a possible confounding factor. To determine what role this last factor might have, we examined survival curves and performed additional analyses using death as a competing risk (data not shown, methodology described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). These analyses indicated that death or timing of death did not substantially affect the data.</p><p>Taken together, the data from this exploratory analysis indicate that patients with baseline Hb &#x0003c; 10 g/dL and &#x02265;10 g/dL may benefit from ESA therapy. However, given our evolving understanding of possible long-term safety issues related to ESA use, including the effect of the Hb level at ESA initiation as well as target and/or achieved Hb levels, these results should be interpreted with caution. Ongoing long-term safety studies are expected to provide more clarity on these and other issues. Therefore, while these initial results contribute to the ongoing discussion of how to best use ESAs in patients with CIA, there are a variety of limitations of this exploratory analysis. Additional prospective studies that examine outcomes in patients treated with ESAs according to the current ESA product information will be of interest to clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Recent changes have been made globally to the ESA product information, including changes in the recommended baseline Hb level at which ESA therapy should be initiated in CIA patients. To examine how these changes may affect patient care, this exploratory analysis retrospectively examined outcomes in darbepoetin alfa-treated CIA patients who were categorized into baseline-Hb strata of &#x0003c; 10 g/dL or &#x02265;10 g/dL at initiation of ESA therapy. In this analysis, darbepoetin alfa administered 500 mcg Q3W or 2.25 mcg/kg QW raised Hb levels in both baseline-Hb groups while still maintaining mean Hb levels below 12 g/dL as recommended by the EU ESA product information. However, patients with a baseline Hb level &#x02265;10 g/dL had fewer transfusions and faster anemia correction compared with patients in the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group. Safety profiles were generally similar in both baseline-Hb groups except that the &#x0003c; 10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had a slightly higher incidence of deaths while the &#x02265;10 g/dL baseline-Hb group had a slightly higher incidence of thromboembolic events and a higher incidence of patients reaching a Hb level &#x02265;13 g/dL. Since this was a retrospective analysis, additional studies are warranted to examine how baseline Hb levels at initiation of ESA therapy affect hematological responses and safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Johan Vansteenkiste has research support from the Amgen Chair in Supportive Cancer Care held at the University of Leuven.</p><p>Michael Hedenus has been and is a member of temporary advisory boards for Amgen Sweden and has also received minor honoraria from Amgen Inc.</p><p>Pere Gascon has received honoraria from Amgen Inc. for lectureships.</p><p>Carsten Bokemeyer has received honoraria from Amgen Inc. for seminars and has been on advisory boards for Amgen Inc., Centocor Ortho Biotech, and Roche.
