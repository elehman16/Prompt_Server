There are many ways to estimate the amount of pain in such patients who cannot communicate verbally with their caregivers. Most of these tools are simple and offer a rapid way to measure and monitor the amount of pain in these patients during hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There are enormous pharmacological and nonpharmacological ways to manage pain. Morphine sulfate is the most popular medication of pain management in patients hospitalized to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Unfortunately, its use is accompanied with some complications such as central nervous system and respiratory suppression, nausea/vomiting, histamine release, and consequent fall in blood pressure (BP) level.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Its use can induce hyperalgesia too[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and as all of the other opiates, it can decrease the protective reflexes of the airway in addition to the level of consciousness and respiratory drive and so it can induce dependency to mechanical ventilation and decrease the success rate of weaning from mechanical ventilator and extubation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Acetaminophen is an antipyretic and analgesic agent, and it is more commonly used to relieve mild to moderate pain caused by different etiologies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Considering the fact that in patients in need of critical care, intravenous (IV) acetaminophen has less complications while being injected and afterward compared to IV morphine sulfate, current study tries to evaluate the effect of acetaminophen on reducing the need for morphine sulfate in intubated patients admitted to ICU. Although there are many studies which have showed its effectiveness on decreasing the need to IV narcotics in pain management; to the best of our knowledge, none of them have been targeted intubated patients in ICU setting; our study is aimed to achieve it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Research design and ethics</title><p>Current study was done as a clinical trial in the ICU of Emergency Department (emergency ICU), on the patients supported by mechanical ventilator. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences; referral code number is 884. Written consent was obtained from every patient's first degree relative to enter the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Sample and setting</title><p>We enrolled forty patients who were intubated and being mechanically ventilated in the ICU of Hazrat Rasoul Emergency Department, Tehran, Iran.

It consists of three behavioral components, changes in facial expressions in favor of the fact that the patient suffers from pain, upper extremity movements, and tolerance of ETT and mechanical ventilator. Each component takes a score of 1 (no response) through 4 (strong response); so, BPS is measured 3 for no pain, through 12 for the most intense pain. In our study, BPS was measured in the maximally 6 h intervals and analgesic medication was prescribed for any patient having a score of 5 or more.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Procedure</title><p>Five milligrams of morphine sulfate was prescribed IV for any patient having a BPS score of 5 or more while monitoring his/her BP and heart rate. Morphine sulfate dose was decreased to 3 mg if the patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level was higher than normal (1.5 mg/dl). All of the patients received 1 g IV acetaminophen, dissolved in 100 mL normal saline (NS) over 15 min, q6 h during the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> days of admission. The patients received placebo (pure NS) in the same manner as acetaminophen, during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> days. Total dose of morphine sulfate needed, its complications, and the BPS score at the end of every 6 h interval were recorded and compared between the 4 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data recorded in datasheets were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The mean age of patients was 63.43 (95% CI, 56.60-69.52) ranging from 18 through 90. Sixteen of them (40%; 95% CI, 25-55) were female and 24 of them (60%; 95% CI, 45-75) were male. Each patient's level of consciousness was determined in the scale of AVPU (A: Awake, V: Responds to verbal stimuli, P: Responds to pain, U: Unresponsive). Twelve patients (30%; 95% CI, 17.5-45) were responsive to verbal stimuli (V) and 28 of them (70%; 95% CI, 55-82.5) were responsive to painful stimuli (P).

To the best of our knowledge, all of the studies already done, evaluated the positive effect of IV acetaminophen on the decrease of opiates use and its complications in a selected group of patients needing surgical interventions and acetaminophen was prescribed prior to or during the intervention; none of them was designed for intubated patients in intensive care setting. Hence, it seems that it is the first prospective double-blind controlled trial done. Kelly <italic>et al</italic>. studied 100 patients in need of knee surgery, retrospectively. They found that the case group (consisting of 25 patients who received IV acetaminophen perioperatively) had no statistically significant difference with the control group (75 patients who did not receive IV acetaminophen) in the rate of opiates used after surgery (<italic>P</italic> = 0.987).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Considering the controlled and prospective nature of our trial, it can be more capable of proving this fact.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized trial, Cattabriga <italic>et al</italic>. prescribed IV acetaminophen for 72 h to 56 patients after cardiac surgery, whereas 57 counterparts received no acetaminophen; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups from the point of cumulative morphine used (<italic>P</italic> = 0.273).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In another double-blinded prospective clinical trial done by Grundmann <italic>et al</italic>., cumulative opioid consumption was evaluated during the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> h after lumbar microdiscectomy.
