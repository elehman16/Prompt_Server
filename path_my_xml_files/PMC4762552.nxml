The World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates that in addition to being the leading cause of death, cardiovascular
disease is also cause of disability, loss of productive capacity and quality of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed as an effective treatment option
in different scenarios of CAD<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>
and aims to improve survival, prevent acute myocardial infarction (AMI),
reinfarction, improve ventricular function and relieve anginal symptoms<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Despite its effectiveness, CABG is a highly invasive procedure, often associated with
long time of bed rest, reduced cardiorespiratory capacity, loss of strength and
muscle mass, as well as physical deconditioning<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. To minimize
such deleterious effects, cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation programs
(CPMR) are crucial in the recovery process and must be started as soon as
possible<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Physical rehabilitation protocols often include ambulation and gait training.
However, it is difficult to be conducted in the daily practice due to patient's
physical limitations, increased risk of falls and insecurity from the patient and
the professional who apply the protocol<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Additionally,
it is harder to monitor vital signs, such as the blood pressure surveillance, and as
well as the exercise intensity, especially when walk training programs are applied
in corridors and stairways.</p><p>In this scenario, the cycle ergometer becomes a possible alternative. It is a
training equipment, already used in rehabilitation programs after AMI, that allows
to monitor heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and even cardiac electrical activity
through electrocardiogram (ECG). Such parameters are extremely important in the
first phase of CPMR programs<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, the
cycle ergometer rehabilitation program can be applied even in patients with physical
limitations due to orthopedic and/or neurological diseases<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of an alternative
exercise program using a cycle ergometer to a standard rehabilitation protocol
during the CPMR phase I, in the postoperative period of CABG, on the maximum
distance walked assessed by the six-minute walk test (6MWT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Design and study population</title><p>It is a pilot controlled clinical trial study, investigator-blinded to the
outcome. The individuals included were aged 50 or older of both genders who
underwent CABG at the S&#x000e3;o Lucas Hospital, from the Pontifical Catholic
University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), between December 2011 and October 2012.
The allocation to treatment was performed through a simple random sampling,
drawing to the treatment group the first individual included and respecting the
allocation to groups in alternating sequence.</p><p>Individuals with physical limitations (orthopedic and/or neurological disorders)
or who had complications in the perioperative or postoperative period (bleeding
requiring reoperation, sepsis, mediastinitis, prolonged mechanical ventilation
(&#x0003e;24 hours), reintubation, cerebrovascular accident, AMI, pulmonary embolism,
acute renal failure, unstable angina or malignant arrhythmias) were
excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of variables</title><p>Sociodemographic variables such as gender, age and smoking history were collected
through a questionnaire standardized for the study. Anthropometric measurements
(weight in kg and height in meters), variables related to the surgery and
clinical conditions in the postoperative period were collected by review of pre
and postoperative evaluation available in the patient record.</p><p>The 6MWT test was conducted by a physical therapist blinded to the intervention
according to the American Thoracic Society protocol<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The test was conducted in a level corridor
30 meters long with markings every 2.5 meters. Participants were oriented to
walk as long as possible during six minutes and were not allowed to run during
the test. HR (beats per minute - bpm), and peripheral oxygen saturation
(SpO<sub>2</sub> -%), were observed by pulse oximetry before and after the
6MWT. In addition, blood pressure (mmHg) and rate of perceived exertion, using
the Borg's perceived exertion scale, were also measured. The Borg's scale rates
from zero to ten the perception of fatigue due to effort. After the
3<sup>rd</sup> minute (during the test) and at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup>
minute, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub> and Borg were recorded. For the 6MWT execution, the
evaluator was standing immediately by the patient's side, guiding and
encouraging the participant to walk as fast as possible. The 6MWT was performed
on the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day and repeated on the 6<sup>th</sup> day
after CABG. During the test, any sign and symptom resulting from physical
exertion were recorded. The outcome chosen for the 6MWT was the maximum distance
continuously walked for both intra and inter-group comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Control - Standard Protocol (SP)</title><p>Patients in this group had physical therapy conducted by the hospital staff
and the standard rehabilition protocol was performed. In this protocol, on
the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day, position in bed was conducted as well
as chest clearance maneuvers and bronchial hygiene when needed. Pulmonary
re-expansion maneuvers, specific physical exercises (if indicated) and
ambulation were performed in the hospital room. In the 4<sup>th</sup> to the
7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, the same treatment was executed,
except ambulation which was made in the hospital corridor. From the
5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, participants had to climb and descend
stairs with supervision. The average duration of the standard physical
therapy protocol was 20 minutes and it was performed primarily during the
morning and also in the afternoon.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative Protocol (AP) - Cycle Ergometer</title><p>In this group, physical therapy techniques conducted with the participants
were similar to the standard group, except for the substitution of walking
and stairs exercises to cycle ergometer exercise, since the 3<sup>rd</sup>
postoperative day. Participants performed 20 minutes of exercise on a cycle
ergometer during the morning and another 20 minutes in the afternoon. HR
(calculated as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
and tolerated up to 30 bpm above the resting HR), BP, SpO<sub>2</sub> and
rate of perceived exertion through the Borg Scale, as described previously,
were monitored during cycling. The cycle ergometer training was monitored by
trained researchers.</p><p>Cycling was interrupted in the presence of signs and symptoms of effort
intolerance. The goal was to keep 20 minutes steadily, but depending on the
participant physical conditions, the first sessions were intermittently
held.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Operationalization and Implementation</title><p>Participants' identification started from checking the scale of heart surgery
at the hospital on the day of discharge from the postoperative care of heart
surgery, which usually happened on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after CABG. At
this moment, the medical team responsible to the patient contacted the
physical therapist researcher, allowing the patient's participation in the
research. Then, patients were informed about the protocol and after signing
the informed consent, the initial data collection was conducted, which
consisted of a questionnaire containing participants sociodemographic data
and their clinical characteristics. In both groups, the 6MWT was performed
on the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day and repeated on the day of discharge
or on the 6<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. The CPMR program also began on
the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day with the last training happening
between the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup> session (depending on the
day of discharge) and consisted of two sessions daily, one in the morning
and another in the afternoon.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis and Sample Calculation</title><p>To detect a statistically significant difference of 50 meters between the mean
maximum distance walked in the 6MWT in two-tailed test with 80% power and
possibility of type I error below 5%, it was calculated a sample size of 12
subjects to be included in each group.</p><p>The data collected were entered into a Microsoft Excel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
spreadsheet. Categorical variables were reported in percentage, and continuous
variables as means and standard deviation. Variables were tested for
distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Distribution of all variables tested,
in both groups, was normal. Thus, the comparison between the distance walked
before and after intervention in each group was performed by the t test for
paired samples and the comparison between groups was also done by the t test for
independent samples. Comparison of categorical variables was performed using the
chi-square test. For analyzes the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for Windows<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 16 - USA)
was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The research project was reviewed and approved by the Medical School Scientific
Committee and PUCRS Research and Ethics Committee (registration number
09/04813). All participants consented to participate after the presentation and
explanation of terms included in the Informed Consent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty-seven participants who underwent CABG were included in this study. However,
two patients were excluded due to early hospital discharge (less than three

after implementation of rehabilitation protocols after CABG. However, there was a
trend for superiority of the alternative protocol, which used a cycle ergometer to
replace walking and stair exercises. Furthermore, the cycle ergometer protocol
allowed participants to be monitored continuously for cardiorespiratory variables
during the rehabilitation program, favoring a better control of exercise
intensity.</p><p>It has been demonstrated, previously, that the distance walked during the 6MWT varies
according to body mass index (BMI)<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, being smaller in those individuals with grater BMI values,
result also showed in this present study which found that individuals with BMI &#x0003c;
25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> walked more than those with a BMI&#x0003e; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
(565.45101.56m <italic>vs.</italic> 457.3592.18m). However, even that the average
BMI was greater in the alternative protocol compared to the standard one, there was
a trend of superiority achieved in the MDW post-rehabilitation using the cycle
ergometer. Moreover, in the cycle ergometer protocol, MDW was shorter than in the
SP, suggesting a lower initial physical capacity in the AP. Even with these factors,
in this study, there was a tendency of improvement in the MDW post-intervention in
the cycle ergometer group, suggesting a conservative bias to the results. These
findings propose the possibility of even greater benefits using the cycle ergometer
in improving functional performance of these individuals compared to the SP.</p><p>Because this was an exploratory intervention not applied in a similar population yet,
there is no evidence available for direct comparison. However, a study with
hypertensive patients measured and compared the behavior of acute BP, HR and
perceived exertion during a circuit of resistance exercise <italic>versus</italic>
submaximal aerobic exercise using a cycle ergometer. The authors found that
participants allocated to the cycle ergometer group had a smaller increase in HR,
systolic blood pressure and perceived exertion, suggesting that the use of a cycle
ergometer offers safer responses to cardiac patients<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The goal of proposing an alternative rehabilitation protocol using a cycle ergometer
is to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged bed rest safely from the
cardiorespiratory view. An important advantage of this type of physical activity is
an effective increase in systemic circulation without excessive burdens on the
cardiopulmonary system, since muscle contraction is predominantly dynamic, when no
resistance to the pedal is added. Other advantages justify the use of this
ergometer: a potential reduction in the risk of falls, the possibility of performing
a constant and more lasting effort and the possibility of monitoring vital signs at
the metabolic demand peak caused by exercise<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Additionally, studies have shown that the early use of a cycle ergometer in intensive
care unit patients, even during ventilation, increases muscle strength, also
improving functional capacity, with similar cardiovascular benefits achieved in
treadmill rehabilitation<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Adding to the effectiveness of
the method, an important advantage is that the interruption of effort occurs in a
safer way, since the patient is already seated and supported with both hands.
Therefore, even if the interruption happens in an unexpected and abrupt way, the
physical therapist will be in a better position to handle the situation and ask for
support when needed. Another relevant point is the ease in having oxygen support, if
needed, even during the protocol implementation.</p><p>Some limitations of this study must be highlighted: (1) limited sample size,
reflecting reduced power to identify the significant differences; (2) simple random
sampling, in alternately sequence, which can enable the occurrence of heterogeneity
among groups. However, this is a new protocol, evaluated in a pilot study. As a
result, the power to identify differences between groups is limited and there was
uneven distribution of possible confounding variables between the control and
alternative groups. Nevertheless, the differences are possibly associated with a
conservative bias, as longer MDW in the 6MWT pre-intervention and lower BMI were
found in the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrated that both protocols were similarly effective in promoting
increased MDW in the 6MWT in patients who underwent physical therapy rehabilitation
after CABG, with a tendency of superiority in the cicloergometer group. However, a
phase III randomized clinical trial is needed to evaluate the significance of these
reported findings.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">
