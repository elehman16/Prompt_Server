Effective canine vaccines are therefore a highly desirable prevention tool. In this randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial, the efficacy of the LiESP/QA-21 vaccine (CaniLeish, Virbac, France) was assessed by exposing 90 na&#x000ef;ve dogs to natural <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection during 2 consecutive transmission seasons, in two highly endemic areas of the Mediterranean basin. Regular PCR, culture, serological and clinical examinations were performed, and the infection/disease status of the dogs was classified at each examination. The vaccine was well-tolerated, and provided a significant reduction in the risk of progressing to uncontrolled active infection (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025) or symptomatic disease (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.046), with an efficacy of 68.4% and a protection rate of 92.7%. The probability of becoming PCR positive was similar between groups, but the probability of returning to a PCR negative condition was higher in the vaccinated group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). In conclusion, we confirmed the interest of using this vaccine as part of a comprehensive control program for canine leishmaniasis, and validated the use of a protocol based on regular in-depth assessments over time to assess the efficacy of a canine leishmaniasis vaccine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Canine leishmaniasis is caused by uncontrolled infection with <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>. The dog is also the principle reservoir of this parasite which can infect humans. The key determinant of the outcome of infection is the ability of the dog's immune system to respond appropriately. This should be mainly cell-mediated immunity; the antibody responses often desired for viral or bacterial infections are not protective. Therefore, vaccines capable of inducing this cell-mediated immune profile are a desirable prevention tool. Previous studies with CaniLeish (consisting of the parasite's excreted-secreted proteins with an adjuvant) have demonstrated the ability of this vaccine to induce an appropriate immune profile and to protect against an intravenous challenge, as well as to reduce the risk of transmission of the parasite to the sandfly vector. This paper reports a study where vaccinated dogs were exposed to natural parasite transmission over two full seasons in two Mediterranean locations (one in Italy and one in Spain). Data from the unvaccinated control group confirmed that the levels of exposure were high. We demonstrated that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of progressive infections and disease confirming the interest of using vaccination as part of a comprehensive control program for this disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Several of the authors are employees of Virbac, which funded the study.

It is endemic in the Mediterranean basin, Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Alvar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> where the dog is considered to be the main reservoir host for zoonotic infection <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Guerin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In Europe, the infection is usually transmitted by members of the <italic>Phlebotomus (Larroussius)</italic> subgenus, although non-vectorial transmission is also rarely reported <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Rosypal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003213-Silva1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several topical insecticide preparations are licensed in Europe and provide a useful reduction in the frequency of infection <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Maroli1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However as these cannot prevent all potentially infectious bites there is still a need for further control measures <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Alvar2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and recent data suggest that although they have good potential efficacy when correctly used, in the hands of owners they are not sufficiently effective <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Cortes1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The outcome of infection with <italic>L. infantum</italic> is unpredictable and some dogs will completely resolve the infection, while others will go on to develop CanL after a highly variable incubation period <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, dogs that do go on to develop the disease also have a wide range of clinical presentations, ranging from mild papular skin disease or only mild clinicopathological abnormalities through to severe generalised disease characterised by renal failure and death <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Ordeix1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Even when dogs appear to be controlling the parasite, the situation may not be stable long term, and immunosuppression or other intercurrent diseases may permit subpatent infections to become progressive months or even years later <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Baneth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For these reasons it is important to note that infection is not equal to disease for this parasite <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The determining factor of the outcome of infection is the ability of the immune system to manage the parasite efficiently. It is now generally accepted that resistance to developing CanL is primarily dependent on whether or not the dog develops an appropriate T-helper (Th)1-dominated cell-mediated immune response against the parasite <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SantosGomes1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Carrillo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This appropriate immune response can reduce the parasitic burden in the macrophage by means of Nitric Oxide production after stimulation with Th1-type cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Holzmuller1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Zafra1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and thus prevent progression of the infection. Furthermore, much of the pathological impact of the disease is caused by the combination of an inappropriate, ineffective Th2-dominated response in the face of uncontrolled parasite growth <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Paltrinieri1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The development of the disease therefore correlates with increasing parasite burdens and a strong but ineffective humoral response <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It also correlates with a reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity response to intradermal <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen exposure which is a marker of a depressed cell-mediated immune response to the parasite <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Pinelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and to the level of infectivity of dogs to sand flies <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Travi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Bongiorno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; symptomatic dogs being more infective to insect vectors than asymptomatic dogs <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Molina1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, even after treatment, dogs can still harbour the parasite and remain infectious to sand flies <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Gradoni1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Mir1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, when the immune system can correctly manage the infection this will reduce the risk of progressive infections that result in disease or the death of the animal and should also reduce the contribution of the dog to the ongoing spread of the parasite in the local area. For these reasons several authors have expressed the opinion that an effective vaccine against CanL could be the best control strategy for both canine and human disease <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Alvar2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and there is a growing consensus that an ideal control program for CanL is likely to involve combined use of vaccines with repellent products to maximize the protection of the dog <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Gramiccia1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Otranto1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In recent years two CanL vaccines have been registered in Brazil. Both have a primary course consisting of three injections, followed by annual booster injections. Leishmune (Zoetis, Brazil) is based on the fucose-mannose ligand of <italic>L. donovani</italic> in association with a saponin adjuvant and demonstrated 76% efficacy against disease or death after natural infection in a field study with evidence of a type 1 immune response being provided by positive intradermal skin test results <xref rid="pntd.0003213-BorjaCabrera1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The other vaccine available in Brazil is LeishTec (Hertape Calier, Brazil) which uses the recombinant A2 antigen of <italic>L. chagasi</italic> in association with a saponin adjuvant, and demonstrated 43% protection against a culture positive state in an artificial challenge model <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, until recently no vaccines were available in Europe.</p><p>With the launch of the LiESP/QA-21 vaccine (CaniLeish, Virbac, France), such an option has been made available in Europe for the first time. Previous studies have demonstrated that vaccination with LiESP/QA-21 induces an appropriate Th1-dominated cell-mediated immune response within three weeks of completing the primary course and that this response remains effective for a full year and is capable of reducing the parasite load in pre-infected macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The immune profile induced by the vaccine is characterised by a significant increase in the specific cell-mediated immune response, and also the production of specific antibodies with a predominant IgG2 profile that are detected by conventional IFAT assays <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that LiESP/QA-21 vaccination reduces the parasite load and the risk of progressive infection in vaccinated dogs when they receive an intravenous promastigote challenge one year after completing the primary course <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, during natural transmission there is also a potential impact of sand fly salivary proteins <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Saridomichelakis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and so experimental challenge studies are unable to definitively determine the efficacy of such a vaccine.</p><p>In this paper, we report results of a randomised, double-blinded, controlled 2-season natural-challenge trial with the LiESP/QA-21 vaccine performed in highly endemic areas of the Mediterranean basin. The objective of the study was to assess the ability of the vaccine to reduce the incidence of active infections, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, in the face of intense exposure to natural challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All study procedures were approved by the National Authorities in Italy and Catalonia (Spain). The study design and technical protocol of investigations were approved by the Veterinary Board of the Italian Ministry of Health following the European Directive 86/609/EEC, adopted by the Italian Government with the Law 116/1992 and by the Department of Biodiversity and the Environment of the Government of Catalonia under number 6760 in accordance with Spanish law on the protection of animals used for experimentation and other scientific purposes (Royal Decree 1201/2005 and Law 32/2007). The Spanish legislation is a transposition of Directive 86/609/EEC.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Area, Population and Design</title><p>Two study sites in rural areas with seasonal transmission were selected based on historical records demonstrating extremely high natural transmission levels: one in the Naples province in southern Italy and one near Barcelona in northern Spain. The activity period of the main local phlebotomine vector, <italic>Phlebotomus perniciosus</italic>, ranges between the end of May and early October. In the Naples area, <italic>L.infantum</italic> infection rates in dissected sand flies were found to range from 2.8&#x02013;6.1% <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Maroli2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In cohorts of exposed na&#x000ef;ve dogs, the incidence of <italic>L.infantum</italic> infection and CanL clinical disease was reported to average about 40% and 20%, respectively, after exposure to 2 transmission seasons <xref rid="pntd.0003213-FogliaManzillo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In the Barcelona area, 0.5% of <italic>P.perniciosus</italic> females were found to be infected by <italic>L.infantum</italic> promastigotes, whereas seroprevalence in dogs was found to range from 2&#x02013;10% in random sampling studies and 7&#x02013;21% in kennels <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Ports1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In the interest of the &#x0201c;three Rs&#x0201d; of animal welfare (Replace, Reduce, Refine), the number of dogs was kept to the minimum consistent with significance of expected results. Sample size calculation was performed assuming the following parameters: 80% infection rate; 40% culture positivity rate; 75% vaccine efficacy at P&#x0003c;0.05. Hence, 90 conventional, <italic>Leishmania</italic>- and <italic>Ehrlichia</italic>-na&#x000ef;ve Beagle dogs (49 males and 41 females), aged 5 to 7.5 months were randomly split into two groups (46 vaccinees and 44 controls) according to sex, weight, age and litter. They had all previously received their routine conventional vaccinations (DHPPiLR) and deworming treatments. The dogs were born in non-endemic areas, and all were confirmed to be PCR negative (on bone marrow samples) and seronegative for <italic>Leishmania</italic> immediately before the vaccination phase commenced. The primary vaccination phase was performed under controlled and protected laboratory conditions (to avoid any potential contact with sand flies). Three to four weeks after the final dose of the primary vaccination course, the dogs were transferred to the study sites (late June for Barcelona and mid-July for Naples to ensure rapid exposure to challenge). The date of the transfer was designated Month 0 (M0). All dogs were once again confirmed to be PCR negative for <italic>Leishmania</italic> at M0. The groups were equally divided by sites to ensure the equivalent composition per group at each site (23 vaccinated and 22 control dogs per site, 24 males and 21 females for Barcelona and 25 males and 20 females for Naples). The dogs were kept in open kennels for 24 months. Regular deworming treatments were administered; the use of antiparasitic drugs or insecticides/repellents against sand flies was prohibited to allow maximum natural exposure of the animals to sandfly bites. The study followed the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All analyses and clinical examinations were performed in a blinded manner by professionals who had access only to the dog identification codes. Treatment group codes were only unblinded after all data had been entered into a data-management system and all decisions regarding the status of each dog had been taken.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Vaccine and Vaccination Protocol</title><p>The LiESP/QA-21 vaccine is commercially available in the European Union under the trade name CaniLeish (Virbac, France).

The occurrence of potential adverse reactions to the vaccine was particularly assessed by daily clinical examinations for three days post-injection with assessment of local and general clinical signs (local pain, pruritus, swelling or nodules, fever etc.), followed by a general examination once a week during the initial vaccination phase.

The repeated use of each test further increases confidence in the classification system used. There are no pathognomonic signs in CanL; clinical signs frequently seen in cases of CanL can also be seen in many other diseased conditions <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Hence, longitudinal follow-up using several parameters is required for confident interpretation of the status of the dog at the end of the study.</p><p>The addition of culture analysis to the longitudinal follow-up further increased our ability to detect the active progressive infections at an earlier stage. Culture is more sensitive than direct visualisation of the parasite in smears, and in this study we also observed that dogs consistently became culture positive in advance of significant rises above the 1/160 threshold in the IFAT titres in the control group. The IFAT titres could not be used for the classification system in the challenge phase due to the fact that vaccinated dogs may develop elevated IFAT titres due to vaccine-induced antibodies (as previously published <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and as seen in the vaccinal phase of this study). However in all cases the arrival of symptomatic disease was preceded by an obvious sharp increase in the IFAT titres. The sensitivity of the tests used in this study to detect infection were therefore PCR&#x0003e;Culture&#x0003e;IFAT (&#x02265;1/160)&#x0003e;Clinical signs.</p><p>In this study we observed that the patterns of progression of the infection behaved in a very similar manner to that which has been previously well described <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Oliva1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Gradoni2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and more recently confirmed in a large group of more than 300 na&#x000ef;ve dogs <xref rid="pntd.0003213-FogliaManzillo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In a highly endemic area, large numbers of dogs may be PCR positive and never progress to the clinical stages of the disease <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Dogs that were PCR positive only (subpatent) were able to revert to the <italic>Leishmania</italic>-free status on occasions during this study, and this was more frequently seen in the vaccinated group than the control group. Transient PCR positive states were not unexpected in the vaccinated group, and are consistent with the mode of action of a vaccine. While it is not the objective of the vaccine to prevent the initial infection, it was interesting to note that in the vaccinated group 41% (17/41) of dogs remained negative by PCR on each occasion, in contrast to only 28% (11/39) of control dogs. Although this does not reach statistical significance it could be interesting to follow this parameter in a larger number of dogs to assess if this effect may also be relevant in vaccinated dogs. In any future attempt to study this effect, it would also be important to use &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d; tissues such as bone marrow or lymph nodes, as we did in this study. This would avoid the potential confounding effects of <italic>Leishmania</italic> entry and immediate killing that may be seen when skin samples are examined.</p><p>However once a dog became culture positive in this study, it never regressed back to being culture negative, and once a dog developed clinical signs these did not resolve spontaneously, confirming the progressive nature of the disease. This is slightly different to what was seen in an artificial challenge model study previously performed with this vaccine <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In that study, some dogs that reached asymptomatic active infection in the vaccinated group did finally manage to resolve this and return to a culture and PCR negative state. The difference probably lies in the fact that in this study there was continued high level natural challenge in contrast to a single time-point intravenous challenge. It is still possible that with large numbers of dogs in the field there could be the possibility of occasional reversion from an actively infected state in vaccinated dogs.</p><p>The serological profile of the response to primary vaccination with LiESP/QA-21 was also in line with previously published studies performed with this vaccine <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. There was a consistent seroconversion, and a predominant IgG2 profile against both ESP and PSA. However, as there was no obvious difference in the antibody profile between resistant and susceptible vaccinated dogs, it is not possible to use such assays to assess the response to vaccination and to predict the success of vaccination in any given dog. The seroconversion detected with IFAT after vaccination and before exposure to infection confirms previously published results <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Moreno2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003213-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and also confirms that care must be taken in the interpretation of IFAT results in vaccinated dogs.</p><p>The sites were chosen specifically to maximise the probability of achieving the elevated <italic>L. infantum</italic> transmission levels required for a strong natural challenge. Indeed by the end of the natural challenge phase, 72% of the control dogs had demonstrated infection, and 90% had demonstrated serological evidence of <italic>Leishmania</italic> exposure, thus confirming the expected high infection pressure in the study sites. In a conventional population around 1/3 of the dogs can be assumed to be susceptible to developing the disease over the course of their lives <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and in this study we already had 1/3 of the control dogs in a state of active infection within 2 years of the first exposure. It is of course possible that beagles are slightly more susceptible to developing the disease than other breeds, and this is one potential limitation of the study, in common with most other canine vaccine studies. However as the dogs had the same characteristics in both groups this will have no impact on the efficacy data obtained. Furthermore, the randomisation of the dogs by sex and litter will have reduced to the minimum the impact of the dog as a variable. This is important in a study performed in a reasonably restricted number of dogs.</p><p>Having a restricted number of dogs is a potential limitation for any study such as this. We saw that several parameters had p-values close to the threshold of significance, and the limited number of dogs is almost certainly a factor in this. However for welfare reasons it is important not to use excessive numbers of dogs, especially when there are repeated sampling procedures and no treatment is given to infected dogs.</p><p>The results obtained in this study also confirm the general consensus that even if low IFAT titres (one or two dilution steps below the laboratory threshold) are highly specific (especially in an area where trypanosomes are absent) and can be used as evidence of exposure to the parasite <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Paltrinieri1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, they are not correlated with infection. Several animals had such low titres, but were never demonstrated to be infected by PCR. It is quite probable that these are naturally highly resistant animals that were capable of rapidly killing the parasite before any spread to &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d; tissues such as bone marrow.</p><p>The efficacy of the vaccine can be expressed in several ways. It is possible to describe the percentage efficacy and percentage of protection found in a given study. However these results are tied to the particular conditions of the study. In this case the high challenge rates mean that the vaccine was being tested at the upper end of the range of possible challenge levels.</p><p>It is also important to note that due to the major differences in the way in which the three vaccines available on the market have been studied, it is not possible to draw any meaningful comparisons about the relative effectiveness of the products available. In the case of the two vaccines available in Brazil, the available efficacy data was obtained under very different conditions, and with study designs that also differed significantly <xref rid="pntd.0003213-BorjaCabrera1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This is also the case for the prototype vaccine LiESAp/MDP for which a successful efficacy study was published <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Lemesre2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This inherent complexity in the study of vaccinal prevention of CanL suggests that for the future it could be interesting to have a more standardised accepted protocol for vaccine efficacy investigations. Unfortunately, while use of a standardised protocol allows a reduction in variable factors to permit a more confident interpretation of the results, it also represents a key limitation when applying the results to the general population with variable use of repellent products, living conditions, and breeds.</p><p>The use of the odds ratio is an attempt to describe the effects of the vaccine in terms that allow a degree of extrapolation of the effects found in this study to areas with different initial risk levels. In addition, the individual level of risk for any given dog is virtually impossible to determine as even within local areas the level of risk is not homogeneous due to the varying presence of other infected animals and annual variations in climatic factors that impact the vector populations.</p><p>While it is clear that vaccination is not able to prevent all cases of the disease, the fact that when the disease developed in vaccinated animals it was generally slower and with milder initial signs is also useful. The majority of deaths due to this disease are the result of progressive, severe, irreversible kidney damage <xref rid="pntd.0003213-SolanoGallego1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. If the development of the disease can be slowed in cases where it cannot be prevented, this increases the possibility of applying early treatment with better longer term results.</p><p>These results have clearly shown that the studied vaccine, when used according to the recommended protocol, conferred protection by reducing the risk of active infections and clinical disease. This is important in terms of the primary objective of vaccination: reducing the incidence of a potentially fatal disease in immunised dogs. However, as the dog's level of infectivity to the vector is also correlated with the development of the later stages of the disease <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Bongiorno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, any reduction in the number of dogs suffering from these more advanced, progressive forms of the disease could have a beneficial impact on an epidemiological scale in areas with widespread use of the vaccine. To balance this statement, it must also be noted that despite the very strong correlation between earlier stages of the disease and the lack of ability to infect sand flies, it is not always the case and rarely even subpatent dogs could potentially transmit the parasite. This was seen in a previously published study which nevertheless confirmed a decrease in the infectivity of those LiESP/QA-21 vaccinated dogs that progressed to active infection stages <xref rid="pntd.0003213-Bongiorno1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As the vaccine does not provide complete protection to 100% of dogs in the conditions tested here, it seems wise to combine the use of the vaccine with measures such as anti-feeding repellent/insecticide products. This will increase the ability of the immune system to control any infection received while decreasing the level of challenge that it must control. It is rational to assume that this combined approach is likely to provide the maximum possible level of protection currently available.</p><p>While it was essential to minimise the number of variables that could interfere with an accurate assessment of the vaccine efficacy, it will also be important in the future to follow the impact of the vaccine in a large number of dogs of various breeds and ages over a longer period of time. It would also be interesting to follow this work with an assessment of the benefit of a combined vaccination plus insecticide approach, and to assess further the impact of the vaccine when used on a large scale in areas where the zoonotic risk is extremely high.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this natural challenge trial demonstrate that the LiESP/QA-21 vaccine, when administered according to the recommended protocol (a primary vaccination course of three doses at three-week intervals followed by annual booster vaccinations) provides a significant reduction of the number of actively infected animals and a significant reduction of the probability of developing symptomatic disease. In those animals developing the disease despite vaccination, the progression is generally slower and the disease is generally less severe. The use of a natural challenge study design involving regular in-depth assessments of each dog over time to assess the efficacy is also validated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0003213-Baneth1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
