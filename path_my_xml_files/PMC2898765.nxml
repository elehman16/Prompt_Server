The best time to use a PD catheter after its insertion is not clear from the literature. Complications such as dialysate fluid leaks and infection at the exit site or peritonitis can occur if PD is initiated too soon after insertion of the catheter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Bridging hemodialysis (HD) may be required if PD is delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Morbidity and expense could be saved by earlier initiation of PD post Tenckhoff catheter insertion that would limit the requirement for bridging HD. Current practice varies widely. Studies reported in this area have been observational and mostly compare immediate with delayed use[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some studies support delayed use but do not test different delay intervals and can not tell us the optimal time to initiate PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent studies report a very low leak incidence after short break in period, attributed to tight catheter securing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, there is a lack of control groups in all these studies. A single centre retrospective and subsequent prospective audit found less complications when dialysis was initiated two weeks after Tenckhoff catheter insertion compared with immediate use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Delay in starting PD results in the need for bridging HD in patients who require immediate dailysis. Bridging HD usually requires temporary HD catheters, with attendant risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and is also more expensive than PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Guideline bodies, such as Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairemnt (CARI) recommend, based on Level III and IV evidence, starting PD two weeks post Tenckhoff catheter insertion and advocate randomised controlled trials and further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. International guidelines (European Dialysis and Transplant Association-European Renal Association and International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) also suggest a two week delay and state that there is insufficient evidence to formulate a "guideline".</p><p>Comparing lag periods of one, two and four weeks after insertion of Tenckhoff catheters will enable us to determine how much effect the duration of the delay has, if any, on PD complications while determining any advantage that earlier start may have in terms of limiting HD during the bridging period.</p><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The primary purpose of this study is to find out the optimum time required to initiate PD after Tenckhoff catheter insertion. This will be done by measuring the incidence of PD complications in a period post PD commencement as well as the HD associated problems during the same period if bridging HD is performed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomised controlled trial to determine the optimal time to initiate PD after insertion of a Tenckhoff catheter.</p><p>Patient population: All patients undergoing PD catheter insertion at Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital(RBWH) and Rockhampton Base Hospital (RBH), with the intention to use the catheter as soon as possible, will be invited to participate in the study.</p><p>Intervention: The interventions will comprise three groups. The first group will start PD at one week, the second group at two weeks and the third group at four weeks after the insertion of a Tenckhoff catheter.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The Department of Renal Medicine, RBWH and RBH service populations of approximately 1.2 million and 200,000 respectively.

The patients will then be block randomised in equal proportions to the three treatment groups using randomly varying blocks of size three and six. The randomisation sequence was generated using Stata 11 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Group 1 will start dialysis one week after Tenckhoff catheter insertion, group 2 at two weeks and group 3 at four weeks. A research nurse independent of study nurses and physicians will undertake randomisation process.</p><p>Patients will initiate dialysis in equivalent fashion apart from the study variable of delay period before initiation. The patients will be trained by the PD nurses in their respective centres. The PD exit site and tunnel will be examined according to the usual clinical practice at each site to detect any complications.

A prospective study conducted in a single centre (RBWH) showed a complication rate of 38% with immediate use and 2.56% with a two week delay period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unpublished data of complication rates with four weeks delay period were quoted as 1-2 in 30 cases. To obtain 80% power with an overall 1-sided significance level of 0.05, approximately 105 patients are required per group to establish non-inferiority, defined as a difference in complication rates less than 10% between two groups. It was assumed that the expected complication rate was 3% as estimated from the preliminary data, and the significance level was adjusted for multiple comparisons. Sample size calculations were performed using ACCorD (Analysis of Censored and Correlated Data, Version 1.6.9, 2010).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The outcome variables, both primary and secondary, are binary. Hence the outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression to compare the three arms of time to dialysis, adjusting for diabetes or not. Outcomes will be analysed using the statistical program SPSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The Human Research and Ethics Committee of the RBWH (HREC/2007/171) and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Rockhampton Base Hospital (HREC09/QCQ29) approved this study</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal from Study</title><p>Participants may withdraw from the study anytime without prejudice, as documented and explained at the time of consent.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study targets patients with end stage kidney disease who choose PD for maintenance therapy. Current practice at some centres and at the RBWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is to wait four weeks after a Tenckhoff catheter is placed before starting PD. A few centres start PD immediately after insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or after a week. Several Australian centres wait for two weeks and the CARI guidelines suggest a two-week delay. There is no consensus in the literature on optimal time interval between peritoneal catheter insertion and start up of dialysis. This is a randomised study to compare the complication rates in one, two, and four weeks delay in initiating PD from the time of insertion of PD catheter. Safety will be measured by assessing adverse events as a consequence of starting PD. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in complication rate between one, two and four weeks delay. If non-inferiority is demonstrated between one, two and four weeks delay in this trial then we could justifiably decrease the duration of delay significantly. The benefit to future patients would be fewer HD episodes, shorter duration of HD catheter placement, fewer HD catheter infections and fewer HD catheter replacement requirements. Results showing more complications in the one or two week delay groups will influence the current international guidelines, based on an appropriate risk/benefit analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>IP: Intraperitoneal; ISPD: International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis; PD: Peritoneal dialysis; CARI: Caring for Australians with Renal impairment; ESRD: End Stage Renal disease; HD: Hemodialysis</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RB, HH, DR designed the study and wrote the protocol.
