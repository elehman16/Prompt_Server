Alive &#x00026; Thrive was implemented over a period of 6 y (2009&#x02013;2014) and aimed to improve breastfeeding practices through intensified interpersonal counseling (IPC), mass media (MM), and community mobilization (CM) intervention components delivered at scale in the context of policy advocacy (PA) in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh, IPC was delivered through a large non-governmental health program; in Viet Nam, it was integrated into government health facilities. This study evaluated the population-level impact of intensified IPC, MM, CM, and PA (intensive) compared to standard nutrition counseling and less intensive MM, CM, and PA (non-intensive) on breastfeeding practices in these two countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>A cluster-randomized evaluation design was employed in each country. For the evaluation sample, 20 sub-districts in Bangladesh and 40 communes in Viet Nam were randomized to either the intensive or the non-intensive group. Cross-sectional surveys (<italic>n</italic> ~ 500 children 0&#x02013;5.9 mo old per group per country) were implemented at baseline (June 7&#x02013;August 29, 2010, in Viet Nam; April 28&#x02013;June 26, 2010, in Bangladesh) and endline (June 16&#x02013;August 30, 2014, in Viet Nam; April 20&#x02013;June 23, 2014, in Bangladesh). Difference-in-differences estimates (DDEs) of impact were calculated, adjusting for clustering. In Bangladesh, improvements were significantly greater in the intensive compared to the non-intensive group for the proportion of women who reported practicing EBF in the previous 24 h (DDE 36.2 percentage points [pp], 95% CI 21.0&#x02013;51.5, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001; prevalence in intensive group rose from 48.5% to 87.6%) and engaging in early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) (16.7 pp, 95% CI 2.8&#x02013;30.6, <italic>p =</italic> 0.021; 63.7% to 94.2%). In Viet Nam, EBF increases were greater in the intensive group (27.9 pp, 95% CI 17.7&#x02013;38.1, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001; 18.9% to 57.8%); EIBF declined (60.0% to 53.2%) in the intensive group, but less than in the non-intensive group (57.4% to 40.6%; DDE 10.0 pp, 95% CI &#x02212;1.3 to 21.4, <italic>p =</italic> 0.072). Our impact estimates may underestimate the full potential of such a multipronged intervention because the evaluation lacked a &#x0201c;pure control&#x0201d; area with no MM or national/provincial PA.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>At-scale interventions combining intensive IPC with MM, CM, and PA had greater positive impacts on breastfeeding practices in Bangladesh and Viet Nam than standard counseling with less intensive MM, CM, and PA. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document implementation and impacts of breastfeeding promotion at scale using rigorous evaluation designs.

The studies reviewed, however, are generally implemented at small scale and under relatively controlled conditions. The reviews highlight the need to rigorously test the effectiveness of these and similar strategies when implemented at large scale. Although one study reports on the results of at-scale programs [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the adequacy design used [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] does not provide irrevocable evidence that shifts in practices were attributable to the intervention strategies promoted by the program. A new review [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] provides evidence that combinations of interventions delivered through different platforms are more effective than single interventions, and recommends incorporation of combined strategies using complex adaptive systems for scaling up. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies, that combine at-scale programming with a rigorous evaluation using a randomized study design. Therefore, public health evidence on whether the magnitude of impacts on breastfeeding practices seen in efficacy studies and synthesized in systematic reviews can be achieved when programs operate at scale under real-life conditions is lacking [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>This paper reports on findings from cluster-randomized impact evaluations of two at-scale programs, in Bangladesh and Viet Nam, that provided intensified interpersonal counseling (IPC) to pregnant women and mothers of children up to 2 y of age, combined with mass media (MM), community mobilization (CM), and policy advocacy (PA) intervention components, to improve breastfeeding practices [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The two program models that were evaluated reached large scale through distinct delivery platforms. In Bangladesh, IPC and CM were delivered by the community-based health platform of a large non-governmental organization (BRAC) through its network of field officers, community-based frontline workers (FLWs), and volunteers.

In both countries, a nationwide MM campaign was implemented, as well as PA, to create a supportive environment for optimal infant feeding practices.

The questionnaires administered at each survey round were the same, with the exception of a detailed set of questions to measure program exposure included at endline. Within a large rollout of the intensive intervention package in both countries, 20 sub-districts (upazilas) in Bangladesh and 40 communes in Viet Nam were randomized to either the intensive or non-intensive intervention.

In Bangladesh, the program areas and the subset of evaluation areas were both rural. In Viet Nam, the program areas included both urban and rural areas, but the subset of evaluation areas were rural. At the outset of the evaluation, given the challenges of generalizability of a combined urban-rural evaluation model in Viet Nam, a decision was made to focus on rural areas only for the evaluation. By selecting rural areas only, we tried to ensure that the pool of areas included in the randomized allocation were somewhat homogenous.</p><p>The implementation teams were distinct from the evaluation teams. In Bangladesh, the implementation team was BRAC and FHI360, and the data collection team came from DATA, a survey research firm that had limited interactions with the implementation team. In Viet Nam, the implementation team was Save the Children and the government health system, and the data collection team came from the Institute of Social and Medical Studies. International Food Policy Research Institute researchers in charge of the evaluation connected and shared the information between the implementation and evaluation teams.</p><p>The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov in August 2012, about 2 y after the start of the program evaluation (April 2010). The sole reason for the delay in registering the trial was our understanding, at the time the study was initiated, that a program evaluation did not warrant registration, given the distinct differences between program evaluations and standard clinical trials. However, as discussions grew in the program evaluation community for preregistration of impact evaluations [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a decision was made to register this program evaluation in a trial registry to ensure transparency and public availability of this information. No changes were made to the planned evaluation design or the planned analyses in the period between the design of the evaluation in 2010 and the registration of the evaluation in at ClinicalTrials.gov in 2012.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Interventions</title><p>In Bangladesh, BRAC delivered intensified IPC and CM in 50 rural sub-districts in five of six divisions (later subdivided into seven) through its existing countrywide Essential Health Care program that already included standard counseling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002159.s005">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For standard nutrition counseling (available in both non-intensive and intensive areas), BRAC FLWs, called Shasthya Kormi, and health volunteers, called Shasthya Sebika, conducted routine home visits and provided standard information on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, including breastfeeding. In intensive areas, IPC was based on multiple age-targeted IYCF-focused visits to households with pregnant women and mothers of children up to 2 y of age by the FLW and volunteer, as well as home visits by a nutrition-focused FLW, called Pushti Kormi, who was an additional human resource to provide more skilled support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding. In these areas, Shasthya Kormi and Pushti Kormi conducted monthly home visits and introduced age-appropriate IYCF practices, coached mothers as they tried out the practices, and engaged other family members to support the behaviors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002159.t001">Table 1</xref> for more details). These workers were supervised using observation checklists, and their workload was monitored. Cash incentives (US$6&#x02013;US$8/mo) were given to the volunteers in the intensive areas for intervention delivery performance, which included ensuring high coverage, carrying out age-appropriate counseling at home visits, and collecting maternal reports of practicing the recommended behaviors. Households were unaware of this performance incentive. In intensive areas, CM included sensitization of community leaders to IYCF, and community theater shows focused on IYCF. The MM component consisted of the national broadcast of seven TV spots that targeted mothers, family members, health workers, and local doctors with messages on various aspects of IYCF; two of the spots focused on breastfeeding. Buys of media airtime were designed for multiple airings during the country&#x02019;s most watched programs. In intensive areas that had limited electricity and TV access, supplemental activities were conducted to air the TV spots, and other IYCF films produced by the project, through local video screenings. PA included workshops to share data, engagement of journalists to broaden reporting on IYCF in the media, creation of an IYCF alliance and other such activities, which aimed at creating additional countrywide awareness of policies and programs to support breastfeeding.</p><p>In Viet Nam, standard nutrition counseling (available in both non-intensive and intensive areas) consisted of messages and information on IYCF delivered as part of routine child health care contacts at the government health facilities. Intensive areas received A&#x00026;T program activities, which were implemented in 15 of 63 provinces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002159.s006">S2 Fig</xref>). Save the Children worked with the government of Viet Nam to establish a total of 781 government health facilities at the province, district, and commune levels that used a social franchising model, called Mat Troi Be Tho (MTBT), to deliver facility-based individual and group counseling. All facilities were required to meet minimum criteria including a standardized counseling room, trained staff, and availability of job aids and client materials. The program aimed to deliver 9 to 15 counseling contacts to each mother-child pair from the last trimester of pregnancy through the child&#x02019;s first 2 y of life, including eight breastfeeding-focused contacts in the first 6 mo of life. Referrals, CM, promotional print materials, and TV advertising were used to generate demand for preventive IYCF counseling services, a concept new to most families. Training and supervision, incentives to the health facilities, and tools to collect data were applied to improve the quality of services. The MM component consisted of a nationally broadcast campaign using TV and the digital space (internet and mobile phone applications); three of four TV spots focused on breastfeeding. In intensive areas, the MM campaign also included additional out-of-home advertising through billboards and LCD screens. PA at the national and provincial levels targeted the extension of paid maternity leave to 6 mo, strengthening of the code of marketing of breast milk substitutes, and improving provincial planning for IYCF and nutrition actions.</p><p>The major components of the interventions started at the same time in all intervention areas in both Bangladesh and Viet Nam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002159.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In Bangladesh, intensified IPC began in 22 sub-districts (upazilas) by August 2010 and in another 28 sub-districts by August 2011. MM was launched in December 2010 and intensified to reach national coverage by February 2011. CM was operational in August 2010. In Viet Nam, IPC was initiated in March 2011, MM in November 2011, and CM in March 2011. PA activities commenced in August 2010 in both Bangladesh and Viet Nam. With the endline survey in 2014, the total duration of implementation of the full intensive package of interventions was about 3 y in both countries. All components continued uninterrupted throughout the implementation period once they had started.

Delivering Infant and Young Child Feeding Interventions at Scale: The Alive &#x00026; Thrive Approach</title><p>The A&#x00026;T programs in Bangladesh and Viet Nam operated from the outset with an &#x0201c;at scale mindset,&#x0201d; requiring the building of partnerships across diverse stakeholders. To reach large numbers of mothers with sufficient support for improving IYCF practices required the utilization of program platforms with existing high coverage such as the national primary health care system in Viet Nam and BRAC&#x02019;s nationwide community-based networks of FLWs and volunteers in Bangladesh. Behavior change on a large scale required the strategic use of multiple harmonized communication channels with proven high reach and working with various types of opinion leaders. Mothers and family members needed to buy into benefits of the recommended practices that were of salience to themselves and their families. Mothers needed to feel confident about the feasibility of making changes, and families and mothers needed to perceive that social norms were shifting. The achievement of scale itself was intended to help shift the perception of social norms related to recommended feeding practices.</p><p>The A&#x00026;T initiative was expected to demonstrate that improvement in IYCF could be achieved on a large scale in diverse contexts. Each country program was guided by formative research that narrowed the program focus to key leverage points for changing behaviors among mothers in each context, from among the many potential factors that influence IYCF practices. Streamlining was key for both countries and allowed us to set ambitious targets for the millions of pregnant women and mothers of children under 2 y to be reached with intensified IPC and for influential family/community members to be reached through multiple MM channels, advocacy, and CM. In 2013, at the height of implementation, approximately 17 million children under 2 y of age lived in the 50 of 493 sub-districts in Bangladesh where BRAC provided intensified IPC. Between December 2011 and February 2014, BRAC conducted almost 2.2 million home visits to mothers of children 0&#x02013;5.9 mo. This required training more than 11,000 FLWs and supervisors in BRAC alone. Training was also provided to government staff and other stakeholders as part of support given to a national IYCF alliance formed for this purpose. Evidence of improved practices from early monitoring results, and an increasingly streamlined operational model with ready-made tools, facilitated other stakeholders&#x02019; joining the national IYCF initiative. The Viet Nam program worked with the government health system to establish an innovative social franchise model, MTBT, to deliver IYCF counseling at health facilities. Approximately 800,000 children under 2 y of age lived in 15 of the country&#x02019;s 63 provinces where franchises were first established; between January 2012 and December 2014 there were 1.1 million counseling contacts with mothers of infants 0&#x02013;5.9 mo of age at these franchises. Reaching this number of contacts required overcoming caregivers&#x02019; lack of experience in seeking preventive counseling and required community outreach and TV advertising to generate demand.</p><p>These large numbers of contacts were further enhanced with the addition of national MM campaigns to reach an estimated 8.5 million mothers of children below 2 y during more than 3 y in Bangladesh, and over 2 million mothers in Viet Nam. In addition, the media campaigns reached fathers, grandmothers, community leaders, physicians, village doctors, non-governmental organization workers, government FLWs, and policy makers. In each country, national and provincial or regional advocacy led to greater awareness of IYCF practices in communities and an improved enabling environment that supported investments in scaled-up programs and helped push the boundaries of scale even further.</p><p>For further reading, see the report &#x0201c;Scaling up in Agriculture, Rural Development, and Nutrition&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the <italic>Food and Nutrition Bulletin</italic> 2013 supplement &#x0201c;Designing Large-Scale Programs to Improve Infant and Young Child Feeding in Asia and Africa&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec></boxed-text><boxed-text id="pmed.1002159.box002" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec id="sec014"><title>Box 2.

A key secondary outcome is early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), defined as the proportion of infants who were reported by mothers to have been put to the breast within 1 h of birth. Other related breastfeeding behaviors were also measured. Women with obstetric complications or cesarean delivery were included in the counts in determining EIBF. We categorized breastfeeding as exclusive, predominant (infant given water, water-based drinks, fruit juice, or ritual fluids in addition to breast milk), partial (infant given liquids and non-liquids such as milk, non-milk-based products, and other foods in addition to breast milk), and no breastfeeding [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and also report EBF for the age bands 0&#x02013;0.9 and 1&#x02013;5.9 mo. We assessed prelacteal feeding based on maternal recall of foods consumed by the infant immediately after birth and during the first 3 d of life. Intervention exposure was measured by maternal recall of FLW home visits in the last 6 mo, recall of attendance at a CM event in the last 1 y, recall of ever having seen an A&#x00026;T-promoted TV spot, and recall of specific breastfeeding messages contained within the TV spot. To help address the challenge of recall-based self-reported measures of breastfeeding, we collected information on infant diarrhea (defined as three or more loose stools in a 24-h period [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Sample Size Estimations</title><p>Sample size calculations were carried out to determine the sample size needed to detect differences in the primary outcome, i.e., EBF, between the two intervention groups at endline, considering an alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80, intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.01 (estimated from previous national or sub-national surveys), and estimated baseline prevalence of EBF of 43% in Bangladesh and 30% in Viet Nam. We hypothesized that the intensive intervention would increase the primary outcome indicator, and therefore a one-sided test was used. For cost and logistical reasons, 20 clusters (sub-districts) were selected to be randomized in Bangladesh, and 40 clusters (communes) in Viet Nam. In Bangladesh we estimated that a sample size of 49 infants aged 0&#x02013;5.9 mo per cluster&#x02014;for a total sample of 980 (490 per group)&#x02014;was sufficient to detect a difference at endline in the practice of EBF of 10 percentage points (pp) or larger. In Viet Nam, we estimated that a sample size of 23 infants per cluster&#x02014;for a total sample of 920 (460 per group)&#x02014;was sufficient to detect a minimum difference of 9 pp. Prior to conducting the endline survey, we re-verified sample size estimates based on the original sample size, the observed baseline EBF prevalence in our sample, and the ICC for EBF from the baseline survey (ICC of 0.04 for Viet Nam, and 0.1 for Bangladesh). No changes in sample sizes were made at the endline survey, based on these parameters and anticipated effect sizes based on the baseline survey.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>In Bangladesh, 100 sub-districts, across five divisions, were selected by BRAC as possible A&#x00026;T intensive areas based on high poverty, stunting levels in excess of 30% among children &#x0003c; 5 y of age, and non-inclusion of the sub-district in the government National Nutrition Program. This list was narrowed to 78 based on geographic proximity (i.e., within the same agro-ecological and/or administrative zone, also called a division in Bangladesh), size, and other operational aspects to ensure homogeneity across the sample. The first phase of implementation took place in 50 of these sub-districts. Within each of five divisions, four sub-districts were randomly selected for inclusion in the evaluation sample using a computer program, for a total of 20 sub-districts. Sub-districts within each division were then randomly assigned, using a computer program, to either the intensive (10 sub-districts) or non-intensive (10 sub-districts) intervention. The randomization process was carried out in the presence of BRAC and A&#x00026;T staff and the program evaluators in BRAC&#x02019;s headquarters in Dhaka.</p><p>In Viet Nam, 15 provinces were selected for program implementation based on stunting levels, absence of other large organizations working in nutrition, population density, and representation of the different ecological regions covered by the initiative. Four rural provinces, representing four distinct ecological zones, were then selected for inclusion in the evaluation sample, and within these provinces, ten rural districts; two to six communes per district were selected for the evaluation sample based on the presence of a health center that met the eligibility criteria for the A&#x00026;T franchise model; this ensured homogeneity across the sample. Communes were randomly assigned to either the intensive (20 communes) or non-intensive (20 communes) intervention. The randomization process was carried out using a simple public lottery system in the presence of local, district, and provincial health authorities as well as the program evaluators.</p><p>In both countries, households within the intensive and non-intensive areas were not explicitly made aware of the results of the randomization. Additionally, there was no blinding of the intervention at the level of service delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Sampling and Data Collection</title><p>In Bangladesh, within each sub-district, five unions and two villages within each union were randomly selected, to yield a total of 200 villages. Each village had an average size of 250 households. Within each village, a household census was conducted at baseline and endline to list mothers and infants and infants&#x02019; date of birth. A list of all households with infants less 6 mo of age was then drawn up. In Viet Nam, communes were sampled, and household listings were obtained from the health authorities, which maintain all birth records. In both countries, from these census lists that identified all households with children &#x0003c; 6 mo of age, households were selected for the survey using systematic sampling beginning with a random seed start point, to yield the desired sample size per cluster. Household visits for the survey were conducted only after sampling the desired number of households per village/commune. Desired sample sizes were 50 households per village in Bangladesh and 25 households per commune in Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, when there were insufficient infants within a commune due to small population sizes, we oversampled infants from another commune within the same district and intervention group.</p><p>A household questionnaire was administered to mothers of children under 6 mo of age to collect data on primary and secondary outcomes, along with data on several other household, maternal, and child characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002159.s013">S1 Table</xref>). The interview was conducted in the local language, and almost all interviewees agreed to participate in the surveys. The refusal rate among mothers selected for inclusion through the random selection process and contacted was 0.9% for Bangladesh and 0.6% for Viet Nam. We excluded only mothers who had a clear mental disability, defined as inability to answer basic questions about their name or willingness to be interviewed that would prevent them from understanding and answering the questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Baseline differences between the two interventions were tested using ordinary least squares regression models (continuous variables) or logit regression models (categorical variables) with random effects, accounting for child age, sex, and geographic clustering [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We derived difference-in-differences estimates (DDEs) of impact using fixed-effects regression models that assessed differences between the two study groups over time [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The difference-in-differences method relies on comparing the difference in changes (i.e., differences) between baseline and follow-up in the intervention and control groups. Even though there are other methods of attributing the impact of interventions, the difference-in-differences method with randomization allows a best estimate of the impact attributable to the program by taking into account the changes in outcomes that may occur among the non-beneficiary population as a result of non-program factors such as secular trends, other types of programs, or climate-related or other types of shocks that may have independent positive or negative impacts on the study&#x02019;s main outcomes.

Using a subset of five items adapted from Reynolds [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] that were collected in the endline survey, we conducted a robustness analysis for EBF to test for social desirability bias, i.e., tendency of respondents to respond so as to be viewed favorably by others. Data analysis was performed using STATA 13; a statistical analysis plan was developed prior to endline data collection and discussed with the funder and program implementers. Although the prespecified plans assumed a one-sided test, we conducted analyses using two-sided tests to allow for the possibility of uncovering unexpected effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec020"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec021"><title>Trial Flow</title><p>No evaluation clusters were lost to follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002159.g002">Fig 2</xref>); none crossed from non-intensive to intensive during implementation.

There was no evidence of this bias for other breastfeeding outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002159.s008">S4 Fig</xref>). In Viet Nam, as social desirability scores for EBF increased, reported EBF increased in both groups, but more so in the intensive group. After adjusting for this differential increase, the impact estimate for EBF in Viet Nam remained strong and statistically significant (DDE 15.2 pp, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). In addition, based on the premise that diarrhea could potentially be lower in the EBF group, we cross-checked EBF self-reports and infant diarrhea and found that the prevalence of diarrhea was indeed lower among EBF infants than among non-EBF infants (3.2% versus 5.0% in Bangladesh, <italic>p =</italic> 0.044, and 3.7% versus 9.7% in Viet Nam, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Discussion</title><p>An at-scale behavior change program that focused on integrating intensified IPC, MM, and CM (the A&#x00026;T intensive intervention) had a greater impact on breastfeeding practices, especially EBF than MM with standard nutrition counseling (the A&#x00026;T non-intensive intervention), within the context of national advocacy to create a supportive environment for optimal feeding practices. In Bangladesh and Viet Nam, the proportion of women who reported practicing EBF in the previous 24 h among children &#x0003c;6 mo was 36 pp and 28 pp higher, respectively, in the intensive compared to the non-intensive intervention areas. In Bangladesh, where intensified IPC was delivered through repeated home visits at critical ages combined with CM, the proportion of women practicing EBF at endline was 88% in the intensive group (from a baseline prevalence of 49%). In Viet Nam, the proportion of women practicing EBF reached 58% (from a low 19% at baseline) through a facility-based delivery model for IPC that was built on principles of social franchising and helped strengthen the health system&#x02019;s capacity to deliver counseling. These impacts were seen despite positive changes in household economic conditions, maternal education, and occupation that in many settings in Asia are associated with lower rates of EBF [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The higher EBF prevalence in the intensive compared to the non-intensive group at endline in Bangladesh and Viet Nam is comparable to results from systematic reviews of breastfeeding promotion interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By contrast with previous literature, the magnitude of the effect we report was achieved in a large at-scale program. In Bangladesh the intensive approach was implemented in 50 of 493 rural sub-districts, 20 of which were in the evaluation. Based on program monitoring, BRAC reported conducting 2.2 million home visits focused on the promotion of EBF to mothers of infants 0&#x02013;5.9 mo old between December 2011 and February 2014. In Viet Nam, a total of 781 A&#x00026;T franchises in 15 of 63 provinces (four of which were in the evaluation) were operational at endline, and there were 1.1 million counseling contacts with mothers of infants 0&#x02013;5.9 mo of age at health facilities between January 2012 and December 2014. The Bangladesh results are generalizable to other program models that rely on incentivized community volunteers and/or skilled FLWs conducting home-based or community IPC and CM, and suggest that intensifying and strengthening contacts and linking them with MM could have significant benefits [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results for Viet Nam are applicable to other countries where primary health care utilization is high, MM reach is almost universal, and facility-based platforms can be used to deliver preventive and curative health care. In Viet Nam, the four provinces selected for evaluation were representative of the A&#x00026;T program areas in terms of geographic regions (north, south, and central). Compared to the rest of the country and parts of the program areas, however, they were more rural and had a higher level of stunting. Similarly, in Bangladesh, the program was operational primarily in rural areas. Therefore, the results are primarily generalizable to rural areas served by government health services (in countries like Viet Nam) and rural areas in countries like Bangladesh.</p><p>The A&#x00026;T model for improving breastfeeding at scale was initiated in 2008, and developed in 2009&#x02013;2010, based on prior experience [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Much of the evidence on the impacts of breastfeeding [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and on elements necessary to assure scale up of breastfeeding programs using multiple platforms and data-driven coordinated efforts [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], was available only after the initial development of the A&#x00026;T model. This rigorous evaluation of a complex intervention now deeply strengthens the programming evidence base for improving breastfeeding, and supports the data-driven and adaptive approach that has been recommended but not always put into practice. The A&#x00026;T model, thus, provides guideposts for developing a practical and well-coordinated approach that links PA, strengthening of systems for implementation at scale, and the use of data from formative research, monitoring, and evaluation.</p><p>The plausibility of our findings are strengthened by the findings from a process evaluation [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] on service delivery and intervention exposure. Interventions were implemented largely as designed in both countries [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but demand-side constraints to use of facilities were a challenge in Viet Nam [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Bangladesh, intensified IPC was delivered well by FLWs, who were incentivized and monitored to cover all targeted households; achieved coverage was very high. In Viet Nam, high-quality counseling was established in the intensive group compared to the non-intensive group [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; since reach was dependent on mothers visiting the health facilities, and subject to demand-side constraints, the model achieved lower coverage [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] than the outreach-based model in Bangladesh. MM reached a substantial proportion of the population in both settings, and we saw evidence of shifts in some breastfeeding practices in the non-intensive group as well. It is likely the MM played multiple roles and worked synergistically with the IPC, but our evaluation design does not tease these apart.</p><p>A challenge in assessing impact on feeding practices is the use of recall-based self-reported measures. Our study was subject to this challenge, particularly because the intervention included a MM component that provided regular reminders of recommended behaviors. Although we did not collect data on lactational amenorrhea, we did collect information on infant diarrhea (reported by the mothers). We compared differences in diarrhea prevalence between groups, finding, as expected, that there was lower prevalence of diarrhea among EBF infants compared to non-EBF infants. We also assessed the role of social desirability in relation to the main impact indicators [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In Bangladesh, the results were unaffected by respondents&#x02019; desire for social approval. In Viet Nam, it appears that respondent desire for social approval had some influence on reporting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002159.s014">S1 Text</xref>), which was differential between intervention groups, but strong and significant intervention effects were still demonstrated after accounting for this reporting bias.</p><p>In both countries, the evaluation was restricted to a significantly smaller geographic area than the true coverage of the program. In order to assess the possibility that there was a differential quality of service delivery due to the non-blinded nature of the intervention, we randomly assessed service delivery in a subset of intensive areas that were not included in the impact evaluation. We found no evidence of differential quality of service delivery in either country, further supporting the external validity of the evaluation findings to the at-scale program in both countries.</p><p>From the perspective of understanding the scaling up of a successful breastfeeding program, and the special efforts made by this initiative to ensure delivery of a comprehensive set of interventions at large scale, an analysis focused on the scaling up of this program identified the presence of several critical elements for scaling up [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, the program appears to have successfully included multiple elements deemed necessary for successful scale-up, including the following: (1) a vision for impact on breastfeeding; (2) finding the right combination of interventions and operational contexts in the two countries; (3) having access to adequate, stable, and flexible financing to stay adaptive and goal-focused; (4) actively engaging champions and alliances via PA; (5) using multiple pathways to scaling up&#x02014;expanding and strengthening the capacities (increasing FLWs in Bangladesh and establishing counseling rooms within facilities in Viet Nam); and (6) including adequate learning through the use of data and learning. Much of what occurred in the context of this program also reflects elements of the complex adaptive health care systems framework [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Looking forward, assessments of the sustainability of these actions at scale will be needed to understand the extent to which these investments led to a sustained legacy focus on infant feeding in the context of the BRAC program in Bangladesh and the health system in Viet Nam.</p><p>Given that the A&#x00026;T intervention was a large-scale intervention involving IPC, MM, and CM, there was some potential for between-group contamination. In Bangladesh, there was no between-group contamination because the sub-districts were administratively separated for implementation, and we verified the lack of contamination through routine interactions with the program implementation team. In Viet Nam, since the communes were situated within districts that were in turn located inside the provinces chosen for the overall A&#x00026;T program, there was potential for some between-group contamination. We assessed this contamination informally in 2013 and ascertained that some content-related overlap had occurred in refresher training of health workers. Given that between-group contamination is likely to have dampened intervention effects, overall intervention effects may have been even higher than those seen.</p><p>This study was not designed to assess the impact of MM alone on breastfeeding practices, because the media campaign was implemented nationwide. Similarly, our design did not allow us to isolate the contributions of the nationwide PA activities, which aimed to create an enabling environment for implementation and scale-up of IYCF programs in the country. Our impact estimates may thus underestimate the full potential of such a multipronged intervention because the evaluation lacks a &#x0201c;pure control&#x0201d; area with no MM or national/provincial PA. Lastly, the EBF indicator itself (EBF in the previous 24 h), though currently recommended by WHO, has limitations. Most notably, it is reflective only of the previous day&#x02019;s practice and does not inform about usual or continued breastfeeding practices over time. A study of the dynamics of EBF in Peru showed that mothers switched back and forth between exclusive and predominant breastfeeding during the first 6 mo of the child&#x02019;s life [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The possibility of this practice is also supported by smaller scale qualitative research in our process evaluations [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although there is some evidence that the EBF indicator is accurate [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], further research is needed to develop stronger and more reliable indicators of EBF, beyond the 24-h recall-based indicator that is currently used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Evidence has been mounting on the positive impacts of breastfeeding on a range of maternal and child health outcomes in diverse settings [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and yet progress on improving breastfeeding practices is held back globally [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], possibly because policies and interventions to date have not embraced full-scale efforts to deliver integrated, tailored, and well-coordinated strategies [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this global health context, this study fills an important gap in the public health literature [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on the impact of delivering a critically important child survival, nutrition, and human development intervention at scale. Using rigorous cluster-randomized evaluation designs, it shows that comprehensive behavior change strategies implemented at scale, under real-life conditions, and delivered through outreach-based (Bangladesh) and facility-based (Viet Nam) platforms have strong and significant impacts on breastfeeding practices. Strategies that combine intensive IPC with MM campaigns, CM, and advocacy are more effective than standard counseling with less-intensive accompanying strategies. Our study demonstrates the impacts of recommended complex adaptive systems-based approaches to programming for scaling up combined interventions to improve breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pmed.1002159.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We conclude that investments in combined, coordinated, and data-driven strategies, especially those that intensify counseling and are supported by MM, CM, and PA, are recommended for replication in similar contexts and for sustained implementation in Bangladesh and Viet Nam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a cluster-randomized trial.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s002"><label>S2 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE Statement&#x02014;checklist of items that should be included in reports of observational studies.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s003"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Data for Bangladesh.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s003.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s004"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Data for Viet Nam.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s004.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Program scale in Bangladesh.</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s005.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s006"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Program scale in Viet Nam.</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s006.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s007"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Social desirability scores and exclusive breastfeeding, by program group.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s007.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s008"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Social desirability scores and early initiation of breastfeeding, by program group.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s008.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s009"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>CONSORT diagram.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s010"><label>S1 IRB</label><caption><title>Institutional review board approval from the Bangladesh Medical Research Council.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s010.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s011"><label>S2 IRB</label><caption><title>Institutional review board approval from the Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s011.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s012"><label>S3 IRB</label><caption><title>Institutional review board approval from the International Food Policy Research Institute.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002159.s012.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002159.s013"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Key components of the Alive &#x00026;
