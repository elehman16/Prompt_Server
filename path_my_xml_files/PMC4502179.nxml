As this ectasia progresses, corneal irregularities form that decrease visual quality precluding spectacle correction in most cases. Although the condition is usually bilateral, the severity in each eye may differ. The incidence of KCN is reported to be around 1 in 2000.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, advanced diagnostic equipment is allowing identification of early stages of KCN and the incidence seems to be higher than previous estimates.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> KCN usually begins in adolescence and in many cases progresses into moderate and advanced forms that are associated with severe visual impairment.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Options for improving vision in KCN patients include prescription spectacles, hard contact lenses, and surgical procedures such as implantation of intracorneal ring segments and corneal transplantation. Until recently, there was no treatment to stop or slow the progression of KCN.</p><p>In the early 90 s, researchers at Dresden University, Germany, investigated methods to prevent or slow the progression of KCN by increasing corneal tensile strength. Their efforts lead to the introduction of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL). The method is based on the observation that creation of cross-links between adjacent collagen molecules can increase the tensile strength of the cornea, and therefore, slow or halt the progress of KCN.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As a morphologic correlate of the crosslinking process, significant increases in corneal collagen diameter have been observed after cross-linking.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The concepts of CXL originated from physiologic findings and an understanding of the changes that occur during the aging process and diabetes mellitus. The number of cross-links between collagen fibrils increase with age, and this may somehow explain why the progression of KCN halts at older age (physiologic cross-linking).<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In addition, an increase in CXL in diabetics is due to glycosylation of the cornea and results in increased corneal tensile strength. This may also explain the very low incidence of KCN in diabetics (pathologic cross-linking).<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In CXL, riboflavin (Vitamin B2) drops are instilled on the cornea to saturate the corneal stroma. Subsequently, the cornea is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV radiation causes riboflavin molecules to release free oxygen radicals that lead to irreversible covalent cross-linking between adjacent collagen molecules.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Studies have demonstrated that CXL increases the tensile strength of the cornea<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and clinical experience has shown that it can halt progression of KCN.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, most clinical studies that have been published to date lack control groups, and only one prospective, randomized controlled study has been reported.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the results and complications of CXL associated with the treatment of progressive KCN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study enrolled patients presenting at the Noor Eye Hospital or Noor Eye Clinic, Tehran, Iran. A total of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled, but only data from 26 cases with complete preoperative examinations and presented at their follow-up visits up to 1-year were used in the analysis. The nine patients, who were not included in the final analysis, missed their follow-up visits for unknown reasons or did not present within the time frame for their final visit which was 12&#x02013;14 months postoperatively. All patients underwent a thorough informed consent procedure that included a discussion of the treatment and procedures in the study. All patients signed consent forms before enrollment into the study. Inclusion criteria were age between 15 and 40 years, confirmed bilateral KCN based on clinical and topography findings, bilateral minimum corneal thickness of 400 &#x003bc;m as measured with the Pentacam (Oculus Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) maximum keratometry of 60 D in each eye based on Pentacam readings, and evidence that KCN is progressing. Both eyes of each patient had to meet the criteria indicative of KCN progression over the previous 12 months. Evidence for KCN progression was determined by chart review, and previous spectacles or base curve of contact lenses. KCN was diagnosed as &#x0201c;progressive&#x0201d; if at least one of the following changes were verified:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Increased simulated maximum keratometry (sim max K) by at least 1.0 D, based on corneal topography or &#x02265;1.0 D increase in the curvature of the steep meridian based on keratometer measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased cylinder by at least 1.0 D, based on the manifest refraction</p></list-item><list-item><p>Loss of &#x02265;2 lines of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) attributable solely to the progression of KCN.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The exclusion criteria were corneal scarring in either eye, previous eye surgery, ocular surface or tear problems, and the coexistence of ocular pathology other than KCN.</p><p>In each patient, one eye was randomly selected for treatment using a computerized random number table, and the contralateral eye served as the control. All eyes underwent complete examinations before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after CXL. Examinations included uncorrected visual acuity, refraction, BSCVA, slit lamp exam, fundoscopy, Scheimpflug imaging with the Pentacam (Ocular Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Germany), and pachymetry with an ultrasound pachymeter (Nidek, US 1800, Echoscan, NIDEK Co. Ltd. Gamagori, Japan). Patients were advised to discontinue wearing hard contact lenses at least three weeks prior to the procedure and soft contact lenses at least 3 days before.</p><p>The selected eye underwent CXL treatment within 1-month after preliminary preoperative examinations. We used a method similar to that proposed by Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Local anesthesia was achieved by instilling one drop of tetracaine hydrochloride 0.5% (Sina Daru, Iran), three times at 5 min intervals. For the procedure, the lid speculum was placed, and then the epithelium was removed in an 8 mm area of the central cornea. Then we instilled one drop of riboflavin 0.1% in 20% dextran (Streuli pharmaceuticals, Uznach, Switzerland) onto the stroma once every 3 min for 30 min (a total of 10 drops). Once this stage was completed, the patient was examined at the slit lamp to observe the presence of riboflavin and yellow tindall in the anterior chamber. Subsequently the UV-X (IROC, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland) was used to irradiate 370 nm UV light, 9 mm in diameter onto the cornea from a distance of 5 cm.</p><p>Before each treatment session, the UV-X was calibrated to ensure a radiation intensity of 3 mw/cm<sup>2</sup>. The cornea was exposed to UV for 30 min while simultaneously instilling riboflavin drops every 3 min. At the end of this procedure, the corneal surface was irrigated with sterile BSS, and then covered with a soft bandage contact lens (Night and Day, Bausch and Lomb, CA, USA). One drop of chloramphenicol 0.5% (Sina Daru, Iran) was instilled and the patient was instructed to topical chloramphenicol four times daily in addition to betamethasone 0.1%, four times daily, and preservative-free artificial tears (hypromelose) as needed. Patients were examined on the first and third posttreatment day. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day, the contact lens would be removed provided that epithelial healing was complete. After the lens removal, chloramphenicol was discontinued, and betamethasone was continued twice daily for one week. Betamethasone was not prescribed for a longer duration to mitigate complications such as increased intraocular pressure and also based on the observation that the majority of previous studies limited steroid use to 1 to 2 weeks only. Cases with incomplete epithelial healing on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day were examined daily until complete reepithelialization.</p><p>Main outcome measures during follow-up were BSCVA, the maximum simulated keratometry (K-max) and mean keratometry (K-mean) based on Pentacam readings. The mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for K-max, K-mean, BSCVA, and spherical equivalent. The independent-samples Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test was used to compare data in the two groups. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 52 eyes of 26 patients were studied.

The inclusion criteria in this study were chosen to overcome this obstacle, and we followed a paired analysis approach; the untreated eye of each patient served as the control for the contralateral treated eye. We ensured that KCN was progressing bilaterally and randomized the grouping of eyes into treatment and control groups. This approach may minimize the confounding effect of different progression rates in different eyes. To eliminate the potential effect of hard contact lenses, imaging with the Pentacam was performed at least 3 weeks after patients discontinued contact lens wear.</p><p>The first clinical report concerning CXL was published in 2003 by Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>., who studied 6 month results in 23 patients.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The mean reduction in K-max in their study was 1.4 D, and they had no cases of failed treatment. Hoyer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported 3-years results in 153 eyes, with a mean reduction of 4.0 D in K-max and a 2% (3 eyes) treatment failure. Similar results have been reported from Italy,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> France,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and India.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> All these reports concern case series without controls. Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic>. published the first and only randomized controlled study of CXL.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> They<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found the outcomes in the treatment and control cases were statistically significantly different. Average K-max changes at 1-year were &#x02212;1.45 D and 1.28 D in the treatment and control groups respectively, and were no failed treatments.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, they compared different people, not contralateral eyes.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Coskunseven <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> treated one eye with CXL and used the contralateral eye as the control in 29 patients. In each patient, they<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> chose the eye with more advanced KCN for treatment, and there was no randomization. After a mean period of 9 months, the K-max in the treated group decreased by 1.57 D and did not change in the control group.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of CXL in which contralateral eyes are compared, and case selection was randomized. At 1-year, the mean change in K-max was &#x02212;0.22 D in the treated group and 0.41 D in the control group. In 3 cases (12%), CXL was not successful, and KCN progressed despite treatment. Overall, our findings concur with the literature. CXL can slow or halt the progress of KCN in the treated eye; however, some treatment failures should be expected. Similar to other studies, we observed a decrease in K-max (&#x0003e;0.5 D) in one-third of treated eyes, and this was associated with a slight improvement in BSCVA. Furthermore, the majority of untreated eyes (control eyes) demonstrated increases in K-max, further progression of KCN and decreased BSCVA.</p><p>We encourage more prospective controlled trials to determine if CXL can become part of the standard treatment for progressive KCN. Currently, these studies are rare.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The longest reported follow-up has been 6 years.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Our study provides some information on the safety and efficacy of this new treatment option, but more extensive studies with longer follow-up are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
