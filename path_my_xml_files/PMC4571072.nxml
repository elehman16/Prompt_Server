The Boston University approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BPR) is a comprehensive methodology that can offer this type of support. To date, several Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT&#x02019;s) investigating the effectiveness of BPR have yielded positive outcomes with regard to societal participation. However, information about the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of the methodology, which may be important for broader dissemination of the approach, is lacking. BPR may be more cost effective than Care As Usual (CAU) because an increase in participation and independence may reduce the costs to society. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of BPR for people with SMI who wish to increase their societal participation. In addition, the budget impact of implementing BPR in the Dutch healthcare setting will be assessed by means of a budget impact analysis (BIA) after completion of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a multisite RCT, 225 adults (18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years of age) with SMI will be randomly allocated to the experimental (BPR) or the control condition (CAU). Additionally, a pilot study will be conducted with a group of 25 patients with severe and enduring eating disorders. All participants will be offered support aimed at personal rehabilitation goals, and will be monitored over a period of a year. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after enrolment. Based on trial results, further analyses will be performed to assess cost-effectiveness and the budgetary impact of implementation scenarios.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The trial results will provide insight into the cost-effectiveness of BPR in supporting people with SMI who would like to increase their level of societal participation. These results can be used to make decisions about further implementation of the method. Also, assessing budgetary impact will facilitate policymaking. The large sample size, geographic coverage and heterogeneity of the study group will ensure reliable generalisation of the study results.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN88987322">ISRCTN88987322</ext-link>.

The needs of these people comprise access to a broad array of services, which are not limited to clinical and humanitarian needs, but also include rehabilitation requirements such as support with societal participation, which is defined as engaging in meaningful daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram.

An example of such an activity is regular employment, which is associated with higher self-esteem, fewer psychiatric symptoms, general wellbeing and higher quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. When it comes to engaging in meaningful daily activities, people with SMI experience environmental obstacles such as lack of opportunities and support or negative images of the clients&#x02019; potential on the part of possible employers and others in their environments. They also have to cope with personal obstacles such as self-stigmatisation, psychiatric symptoms and lack of social skills, employment skills and emotional stability. A combination of these barriers, which often reinforce each other, can lead to motivational problems and fear of failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As a result, more people with SMI are unemployed and undertake fewer activities outside the home than may be explained by the seriousness of their psychiatric symptoms. Support in the area of societal participation is therefore vital.</p><p>Over the years, various methods have been developed to offer support in engaging in work and other meaningful activities. However, only a few of these have been proven effective. An example of a well-documented, evidence-based approach to supporting the employment needs of patients with SMI is the Individual Placement and Support model of supported employment (IPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Whereas IPS focuses mainly on regular paid employment, the Boston University approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BPR) has a broader scope and also focuses on other forms of meaningful activities, housing, education, social contacts, and of course, work (regular and sheltered employment as well as voluntary work). The mission of BPR is to &#x0201c;help persons with psychiatric disabilities increase their ability to function successfully and be satisfied in the environment of their choice with the least amount of ongoing professional intervention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, a number of RCTs have been performed which investigate the effectiveness of BPR and results are partially positive. In the United States, Rogers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of Psychiatric Vocational rehabilitation (BPR in the vocational context) but found no differences in vocational or clinical outcomes compared to a control condition. However, the researchers made considerable enhancements to the control condition, which may have diminished the contrast between the experimental and control condition. Positive results were found by Shern et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], also in the United States, who focused on street-dwelling individuals with psychiatric disabilities. They found that the experimental group experienced fewer psychiatric symptoms and a better quality of life than the control group. Also, the experimental group spent significantly less time on the streets and showed increased societal participation in terms of a greater likelihood to attend a day programme than the control group. In Italy, Gigantesco et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] investigated a specific structured planning and evaluation approach called VADO (in English, Skills Assessment and Definition of Goals) which is inspired by BPR. They found greater improvement in the personal and social functioning in patients treated with VADO compared to routine care. Swildens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] performed a multisite RCT in the Netherlands with 156 SMI patients in outpatient MHC, sheltered living and inpatient rehabilitation units. This study covered all rehabilitation areas: work, education, structured activities, social contacts and living independently. Patients were randomised to BPR or Care As Usual (CAU) with follow-ups after 12 and 24&#x000a0;months. The rate of goal attainment was substantially higher in BPR at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months than with CAU. Also, BPR was more effective with regard to promoting social contacts and societal participation. However, both groups improved equally with regard to quality of life, and BPR was no more successful than CAU with regard to living independently.</p><p>Despite the positive results and the subsequent recommendation of BPR in the Dutch Guidelines for Schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], implementation in MHC practice is still limited. The lack of insight into the cost-effectiveness structure of BPR is one of the obstacles to implementation. For instance, BPR may be more intensive than CAU and require an initial time investment from caregivers, which could later be compensated by increased independency and the empowerment of the patient. Indeed, if BPR effectively improves the societal participation of patients with SMI according to their own wishes, and patients have fewer needs, this may promote long-term improvement in functioning and have a positive effect on costs for society. A cost-effectiveness study is required to provide answers to these and other cost-related matters, and the results &#x02013;if positive- may lead to broader dissemination of the approach. Therefore, in this study we aim to analyse the cost-effectiveness of BPR compared to CAU from a societal perspective. To further support policymaking regarding implementation, the trial results will be used in different implementation scenarios to assess the budget impact of implementing BPR in the Dutch healthcare setting.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives/aims</title><p>The main objective of the research is to gain insight into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Boston University approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BPR) compared to Care as Usual (CAU) for patients with SMI (aged 18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years) who wish to increase their societal participation.</p><p>The primary outcome criterion is change in societal participation, which is defined as the presence of meaningful activities: paid work, regular voluntary work, vocational training or academic study, or full-time care of a family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

CAU is provided by multidisciplinary MHC teams with assertive outreach elements for patients who need more intensive contact (Flexible ACT teams) and by Dutch regional institutes for Residential Care (RIRC, Dutch acronym RIBW), which support independent living in the community and offer supported housing facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Participants will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group or the control group.

In addition, a specialist team for SMI patients with long and enduring eating disorders will participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>The study will include a heterogeneous group of 225 adult outpatients with SMI who express a wish to increase their societal participation. SMI is characterised by psychiatric disorders with a long duration of treatment and severe dysfunction. In the Netherlands, approximately 160,000 patients between 18 and 65 suffer from SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although most patients in this group have a history of psychosis, the definition of severe dysfunction is not limited to those with psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Some patients have multiple diagnoses such as varying combinations of psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders and drug addiction. All patients are care recipients of the participating organisation that supports independent living in the community and offers supported housing facilities, or of FACT teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] at the participating regional mental health care (MHC) centres. A pilot group of 25 patients with severe and enduring eating disorders &#x02013;often in combination with other severe psychiatric diagnoses- will be included in the study to add insight into the effectiveness of BPR for this group of long-term mentally ill patients. Patients with eating disorders also face problems such as entering or re-entering the labour market and/or finding meaningful ways of spending the day. These patients are often hospitalised for extreme underweight, meaning that this group will consist of outpatients as well as inpatients.</p><p>MH professionals will assess eligibility for participation in the study according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients are eligible for participation if they:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Have been diagnosed with Severe Mental Illness (a diagnosis according to DSM IV, long duration of service contact and functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) and/or have a severe and enduring history of Anorexia Nervosa.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Have expressed a wish for change in societal participation (work, education, daily activities outside the home).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are between 18 and 64&#x000a0;years of age.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Are willing to participate in the study.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients will be excluded if they:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Have received BPR in the four months preceding the start of the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are admitted as inpatients to a MHC centre at the start of the study (except for patients with Anorexia Nervosa).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Are legally incompetent.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental group: Boston Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BPR)</title><p>Patients in the experimental group will take part in rehabilitation sessions based on BPR, which uses a methodology that helps patients achieve and retain their rehabilitation goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The approach consists of four phases:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Exploring: the client is supported in discovering what he/she wants to achieve.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Choosing: the client is supported in choosing a goal in a rehabilitation area such as work or housing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Getting: the client is supported in carrying out the necessary interventions to attain the goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Keeping: the client is supported in keeping the attained goal.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Patients do not need to have a clearly defined idea or plan for change in order to receive BPR because an important component of BPR is helping patients explore their options. Therefore, BPR attends to the needs of patients who have been suffering from mental illness for a long time and have lost confidence in their own ability to initiate change. Participants assigned to BPR will be offered at least one session every 2&#x000a0;weeks with an experienced BPR rehabilitation worker. There is no predefined maximum or minimum number of sessions that must be completed. Instead, patient and BPR worker plan sessions by agreement. However, BPR workers are obliged to offer one session every 2&#x000a0;weeks. The total number of sessions and duration of the period in which patient and worker cooperate will be registered. The intervention will be carried out by rehabilitation workers fully trained in the methodology (social workers, MH nurses, occupational and vocational therapists) who have practised with at least four patients under the supervision of a certified expert in BPR. Each participating centre will take part by involving at least four workers experienced in BPR in the BPR condition. Each worker will have an additional caseload of four research patients a year. In all three centres, a sufficient number of professionals with BPR training are available to carry out the intervention.</p><p>Fidelity in the experimental condition will be checked by means of a BPR fidelity measure, using criteria developed by the Dutch foundation for BPR &#x02018;Stichting Rehabilitatie &#x02018;92&#x02019; in collaboration with the Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation. Independent registered BPR experts will use the instrument to blindly rate all patient treatment files involved in this study. Furthermore, BPR workers will receive regular feedback and supervision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Control group: Care As Usual (CAU)</title><p>Patients in the control group will receive CAU conducted according to the guidelines for FACT teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Dutch RIRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These guidelines form a general outline of the philosophy of care for the target groups and the way care is delivered in daily practice. The FACT model, which was developed in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], contains all elements of the internationally well-known Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but FACT differs from ACT in that a FACT team also targets patients who function in a more or less stable manner. These multidisciplinary teams provide medical, psychiatric, social, financial and vocational support, which can be intensified according to the patients&#x02019; needs. Detailed information about the Dutch FACT model is described in the English version of the FACT Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands, supported housing and supported independent living in the community for patients with SMI is provided by 21 RIRCs. RIRC&#x02019;s are primarily concerned with patient&#x02019;s daily activities but also offer some support with regard to participation in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, structural support with rehabilitation is often lacking.</p><p>In line with the experimental group, participants assigned to the control group will also be offered at least one session every 2&#x000a0;weeks targeting a wish for societal participation, with no predefined maximum or minimum number of sessions that must be completed. Patient and CAU worker plan sessions by agreement and the total number of sessions and duration of their cooperation will be registered.</p><p>Although MH professionals working according to FACT or RIRC guidelines (social workers, MH nurses, occupational therapists or employment specialists) may be familiar with rehabilitation, they have not received specific training in BPR. They offer additional support to patients in clarifying and achieving their rehabilitation goals on the basis of generic MHC models: mental health nursing care, social work and vocational rehabilitation programmes. All CAU workers have at least 1&#x000a0;year of experience with supporting SMI patients. Each participating centre will provide at least three experienced rehabilitation workers to the CAU condition and each worker will have an additional caseload of at most 4 to 5 research patients a year. In all three centres, a sufficient number of professionals without BPR training are available to carry out the intervention. Because of the generic nature of CAU, fidelity will not be measured in this condition. However, CAU workers will receive regular supervision according to the FACT and RIRC guidelines to ensure a high level of care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Contamination between BPR and CAU</title><p>Because workers from BPR and CAU conditions work in the same team environment and come in contact with each other, some contamination between conditions is unavoidable. However, BPR is a complex method that cannot be properly applied without extensive training and ongoing methodological supervision. Moreover, our focus is on the possible added value of specific rehabilitation techniques and not solely on rehabilitation attitude, for example. We therefore believe that the contrast between conditions will be great enough to detect possible differences.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measures</title><p>All measures and related domains are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Additionally, the client version has a sixth item asking about how patients feel immediately after seeing their MH professional which is answered with unchanged, better or worse. The professional version has two additional open items that ask about positive and negative aspects of the therapeutic relationship.

With this expected difference in proportion of change in both conditions, the study will have a power of 80&#x000a0;% (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, two sided) if complete data from 2 &#x000d7; 90 patients is obtained. Furthermore, with regard to the economic evaluation, SF-12D is used to calculate a preference-based utility index, SF-6D. In the preceding RCT, the SF-12D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] was not used, but scores on the WHOQOL are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. For patients with rehabilitation goals in the area of societal participation, the differences between BPR and CAU after one year were 1.23 (SD 2.18). Calculating the required power of the study with this parameter, only 60 patients in each condition are needed to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power. Power rises to 95&#x000a0;% with 90 participants in each condition, which is needed for the primary outcome measure. Taking into account an average dropout rate of 20&#x000a0;% and a maximum dropout rate of 25&#x000a0;% after one year follow up, at least 225 respondents with SMI are needed for this trial. The number of patients eligible but not willing to participate will be carefully monitored to support the BIA. A pilot will be conducted for the additional 25 patients with severe and persistent eating disorders who will also participate in this study, since no information is available on the differences in change that can be expected after a year with and without BPR support for this group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After written informed consent has been received, an independent investigator using a stratified block randomisation scheme will assign participants to CAU or BPR.

The group with eating disorders has an additional stratification factor: &#x02018;duration of hospitalisation in the 6&#x000a0;months prior to inclusion (less/more than 3&#x000a0;months)&#x02019; because this group in particular needs support with rehabilitation goals directly after hospitalisation. In order to avoid large differences between both conditions in the level of costs during the period before commencement of the study, duration of hospitalisation will be added as an extra stratification factor for this group.

Missing items will be handled according to questionnaire instructions and standards. Furthermore, data will be collected from multiple sources (patients and workers), which allows indirect judgements to be used as proxies of missing data if needed.</p><p>To analyse results on the main outcome, the difference in percentage of patients with increased participation in both groups after 1&#x000a0;year will be compared. Firstly, descriptive statistics will be performed with regard to the proportions of patients with increased participation. Secondly, risk differences yielding numbers needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated using (multilevel) regression models to be adjusted for research centre and employment in the year preceding the study. Other possible confounders such as sociodemographics, psychiatric symptoms and remission, quality of the therapeutic relationship or educational level of MH professional will be added if comparison between intervention group and control group shows differences between these groups despite randomisation. In addition, sensitivity analyses will be performed on all outcomes, including only respondents who participated in at least two contacts with the rehabilitation worker and excluding patients for whom the outcome was rated indirectly because they were not available for interviews at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes are (I) continuous variables indexing quality of life, psychosocial functioning, recovery and self-efficacy and (II) binary variables indexing patients&#x02019; experience of success in achieving their rehabilitation goals (yes/no). Patients&#x02019; experience of success in achieving their rehabilitation goals could also be presented as an (III) ordinal variable (yes/no/partially). Means and proportions of these variables at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months will be modelled using both multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses in which each person (level 2) contributes three observations (level 1), making adjustments for participating centre, and other confounders. Treatment effects will be quantified using the Time (baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months) &#x000d7; Group (BPR and CAU) interaction, assessing whether change in the outcome of interest over time differs significantly between the two groups.

Time horizon of the study is 12&#x000a0;months, during which costs and health outcomes will be prospectively registered for all patients included. Costs and health outcomes will not be discounted due to the length of the current time horizon, which is in line with current guidelines on economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses will address important cost aspects, such as components of the intervention costs and hospitalisation. Uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios will be assessed by bootstrap analyses. In addition, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be used to inform decision-makers on the probability of the examined intervention being cost-effective.</p><p>Societal participation will be used as primary outcome measure of the cost-effectiveness analysis. Results will be expressed in terms of incremental costs per proportion of increase in societal participation gained. This outcome is highly relevant for patients with a history of SMI, but also closely relates to recent policy decisions on structural changes in the MHC sector (promoting de-institutionalisation and community care at lower costs). Furthermore, a cost-utility analysis will be conducted with the QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years) as primary outcome measure. In order to estimate QALYs, utility scores will be derived from the SF-6D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

The trial results will be extrapolated to a time horizon of up to four years and to the entire Dutch patient population concerned using health economic modelling. The model will combine the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis with epidemiological data on the targeted patient population, as well as data on programme scale and implementation. The BIA will require information about the size of the population of patients with SMI who are eligible and will participate in the intervention under study.

This requires assumptions on how participation at 12&#x000a0;months will be sustained. Since specific data for the current population are lacking, we plan to use general population data concerning quit rates from various types of participation in combination with literature on similar interventions (if available). A distribution will be used to reflect uncertainty surrounding this parameter. Further modelling assumptions required concern the use of resources during months 12 to 48 and the sustainability of effects on quality of life.

This research is highly relevant because people with SMI require support in several rehabilitation areas, in particular employment and other forms of societal participation. On average 80&#x000a0;% of the patients with SMI are unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This number is consistent among studies and also applies to the Dutch situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Data from a large panel of Dutch patients with enduring psychiatric illnesses showed that only 16&#x000a0;% of the panel members had a regular paid job of 12&#x000a0;hours or more per week, but more than half of panel members indicated a wish to undertake more activities outside the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These facts clearly illustrate a large need for support in this area, and BPR may be a successful method for providing this support.</p><p>Promoting participation in mainstream activities in the community is increasingly seen as an important MHC goal for people with SMI, and BPR could provide the much-needed support in achieving this goal.</p><p>Strength of BPR is that it focuses on all forms of meaningful activity and also provides support with more accessible activities than competitive employment, which may appeal to a broader group of SMI patients. However, a potential drawback is that goals could be set too low and patients achieve less than they are actually capable of.</p><p>With this study, we will be the first to gain insight into effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of BPR, which is innovative and will make the study results of interest and applicable to MHC policy makers and healthcare funding companies. The findings of our study could potentially influence routine practice in the care of people with severe mental illness in the Netherlands as well as in other countries. The expected findings of this study will be highly relevant because the study group consists of a heterogeneous group of outpatients with SMI in different MHC settings in different parts of the Netherlands, adding to the generalisability of the results. This is important, because BPR is not specific to a particular diagnosis or group of patients. Also, this study will have a larger sample size than previous studies in the area of psychiatric rehabilitation, enabling in-depth analyses of the cost-effectiveness of BPR.</p><p>One of the design&#x02019;s strengths is the active control condition, which allows for minimising the influence of attention by MH professionals and the combination of subjective and objective/clinical outcome measures. Also, treatment fidelity is measured throughout the study period, ensuring close adherence to the BPR method.</p><p>There are also some limitations associated with our study. In particular, the pragmatic approach to the study design may be a potential source of bias. For instance, centres differ in the level of BPR implementation. In some centres, BPR has been implemented for several years, whereas in others implementation is in the initial phase. In centres where BPR is almost fully implemented, the entire working context is modelled according to BPR standards. This may also have an effect on MH professionals in the control group, thus decreasing the contrast between the experimental and control conditions. On the other hand, contamination between interventions will not readily occur because BPR is too complex to adopt without proper training and ongoing supervision and the experimental condition is conducted by fully trained and experienced BPR workers.</p><p>Another limitation is the lack of standardisation of the control group. MH professionals in the control group use generic rehabilitation methods based on MH nursing care, social work and vocational programmes. This methodological diversity makes it impossible to use a fidelity measure in the control group. However, this diversity is in agreement with the reality of daily practice and workers in the control group will receive regular supervision to ensure a high quality of care.</p><p>We have mentioned the heterogeneity of our group as an advantage since it promotes generalisability of results. However, it also has the disadvantage that patients from FACT teams, regional centres for Residential Care and those with severe eating disorders in combination with other psychiatric diagnose, may have different societal and/or mental health problems and could have different participation needs. Although stratified randomisation should ensure an equal distribution in both arms, differences could impact outcomes for theses subgroups. In particular, patients with severe eating disorders may have different goals and need a different kind of support than other SMI patients. Since rehabilitation has never before been investigated among these patients, we will initially analyse this group as a separate pilot and afterwards perform sensitivity analyses on this group to investigate if adding this group to our larger sample will influence outcomes. It should be noted however, that the inclusion of a group of patients with eating disorders may also increase the relevance of this study because this group has many needs in rehabilitation areas that deserve attention, but it has not been investigated before.</p><p>Finally, patients are not blinded because this was not possible in the study design. However, to ensure data integrity, the interviewers who gather data are blinded and analyses are only performed on finalised and anonymous datasets.</p><p>If BPR proves to be a cost-effective rehabilitation method, this may lead to its further dissemination. But most importantly, it will mean that MH professionals have an evidence-based method at their disposal to fulfil the enormous need for support in societal participation and community integration among patients with SMI.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BPR</term><def><p>Boston University approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAU</term><def><p>Care As Usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACT</term><def><p>Flexible assertive community treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHC</term><def><p>Mental health care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MH</term><def><p>Mental health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RIRC</term><def><p>regional institute for residential care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMI</term><def><p>Severe Mental Illness</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Until January 1st 2014, 65&#x000a0;years was the retirement age in the Netherlands. After this date, retirement age is gradually being increased to 67&#x000a0;years. In our experience, older patients usually have different goals in societal participation &#x02013; most noticeably, other than obtaining regular employment.
