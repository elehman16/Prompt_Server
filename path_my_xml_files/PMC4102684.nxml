In this present study, we aimed to examine the effect of CPB temperature on the clinical outcome in infants undergoing repair of isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Of the 212 infants with isolated VSD who underwent open heart surgery (OHS) between January 2001 and December 2010, 43 infants were enrolled. They were classified into 2 groups: group 1, infants undergoing hypothermic CPB (26&#x02103;-28&#x02103;; n=19) and group 2, infants undergoing near-normothermic CPB (34&#x02103;-36&#x02103;; n=24).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The age at the time of the OHS, and number of infants aged&#x0003c;3 months showed no significant differences between the groups.

The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was 1.6 days in group 1 and 1.8 days in group 2. None of the infants showed postoperative neurological and developmental abnormalities.

Patient selection</title><p>Between January 2001 and December 2010, 621 infants underwent OHS in Kyungpook National University Medical Center. Among them, 212 patients were VSD patients. The lowest bypass temperature of hypothermia (26&#x02103;-29&#x02103;) and near-normothermia (34&#x02103;-36&#x02103;) were selected<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Sixty-five infants were in two temperature groups. Twenty-two patients with insufficient laboratory data and records were excluded. Forty-three infants were enrolled and they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, infants undergoing hypothermic CPB (26&#x02103;-29&#x02103;) and group 2, infants undergoing near-normothermic CPB (34&#x02103;-36&#x02103;).</p><p>As a laboratory parameter for inflammatory reaction, white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) of preoperative and postoperative day 1, 2, and 4 were serially reviewed<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

Univariate analyses of the differences in proportion between the two groups were accomplished using the chi-square analysis. Differences with a <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To examine changes over time after surgery, mixed model analysis were employed using PASW statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Among of them, 19 infants were group 1 and 24 were group 2.

Patients' body weight was significant different between groups 1 and 2 (<italic>P</italic>=0.004). In group 1, 4 infants were Down syndrome and 8 infants had admission for respiratory infection before OHS. There were no patients with pneumonia or sepsis at the time of surgery. In group 2, number of infants with Down syndrome and pre-OHS admission were 2 and 3, respectively. The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was 1.6 days in group1 and 1.8 days in group 2.</p><p>Priming volume showed no differences between two groups.

Medical treatment includes corticosteroids.

Mild hypothermia group showed similar clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers with hypothermia group.

Clinical postoperative outcomes were similar in two groups.</p><p>Long CPB time tends to increase plasma cytokine levels. Long ACC time also increases cytokine levels and inflammatory responses<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref>. In our study, hypothermia group had longer CPB and ACC times. Even though hypothermia decreased inflammatory reaction, longer CPB and ACC time may resulted in similar clinical and laboratory outcomes in both groups. Overall in our study, neonates and infants requiring correction of simple VSD, hypothermic and near-normothermic CPB could have similar clinical outcome. And there was no laboratory differences suggesting inflammatory reaction between two groups.</p><p>This study has limitations. This study was designed under the retrospective chart review and could only include WBC count and CRP as inflammatory markers. Cytokines could not be included. And patients with diverse age, different type of congenital heart disease needs to be investigated.</p><p>Inflammation and organ damage is a concern after the OHS. In this study, near-normothermic CPB showed similar clinical outcome and inflammatory response compared to hypothermic patients. Near-normothermic bypass should be concerned in pediatric OHS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Paparella</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yau</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cardiopulmonary bypass induced inflammation: pathophysiology and treatment.
