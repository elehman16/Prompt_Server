Good balance is also essential in various sport activities in order to both get results and prevent injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Research about the effect of balance training on sports performance is however inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite this, possibilities to improve balance and thereby possible enhancement of performance are attractive.</p><p>Balance has been defined as &#x0201c;Sensing the position of the body&#x02019;s centre of mass and moving the body to adjust the position of the centre of mass over the base of support provided by the feet&#x0201d;, by Nashner <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several systems interact to maintain balance: vision, the somato-sensory system, and the vestibular organ. These systems interact and register inputs from the surroundings, which are integrated and processed in the central nervous system. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) coordinates eye and head movements, making it possible, for example, to walk and read signs at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Through the head-neck skeletomotor system, the cervico-ocular reflex interacts with the VOR, providing information about head movements in relation to the trunk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sensory receptors in the skin as well as mechanoreceptors in the muscles provide input as to how gravity affects the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Input from these different parts of the balance system is constantly reconsidered and a response from the motor cortex is sent back. This means that even when standing still, the body is constantly in motion. This motion is called postural sway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and can be measured by using a force plate and measuring the movement of the center of pressure (COP) in the medio-lateral (ML) direction as well as in the antero-posterior (AP) direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Wristbands and function</title><p>There are several companies that market wristbands aiming to improve functions such as balance, mobility/agility and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The technology differs: holograms, ions, protons and minerals are claimed to influence function and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therapists and coaches are often asked by patients and athletes about the efficacy of these wristbands and their impact on balance. Randomized controlled trials have shown that wristbands with holograms have no effect on balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but studies on wristbands with minerals seems to be lacking. Mineral wristbands are marketed to be able to dramatically improve balance by simply putting it on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to perform studies on mineral wristbands as well, in order to provide therapists and coaches with adequate information about different wristbands, giving them possibilities to give correct advise to patients and athletes.</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to investigate a mineral wristband&#x02019;s impact on postural sway in a group of healthy individuals, compared to a placebo wristband, and no wristband at all.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study group was 40 healthy volunteers, aged 20 to 69&#x000a0;years (mean 35&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17), of whom 25 (62&#x000a0;%) were women. They were 162 to 191&#x000a0;cm tall (mean 176&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.5) with a body mass index 20.3 to 30.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean 23.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9). The inclusion criteria were no dizziness or balance problems, no neck pain, no newly acquired injury to the hip, knee, or foot for the last two months, and corrected visual impairment, if any. None of the participants had any hearing problems and none of them had used a wristband before. The subjects were selected among students and staff at Lund University.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics</title><p>Participation in the study was strictly voluntary. All participants gave their informed consent before entering the study. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund no 2014/127.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p>In this randomized double-blind study, the patricipants were tested on a force plate (Good Balance&#x02122;, Metitur Ltd, Finland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.papapostolou.gr/clientfiles/file/pdf/Good_Balance_Brochure.pdf">http://www.papapostolou.gr/clientfiles/file/pdf/Good_Balance_Brochure.pdf</ext-link>) wearing the Bionic-sport wristband (The BIONICSPORT&#x02122;, BionicFamily&#x000ae;, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bionicband.com">www.bionicband.com</ext-link>), a placebo wristband (without minerals but made of silicon and the same colour, weight and circumference as the mineral wristband), or no wristband. Tests were performed on the force plate with open and closed eyes and standing on 3&#x000a0;cm thick foam on the force plate with open and closed eyes.</p><p>All measurements were standardized and the tests were performed in the same room. Before the measurements, each participant received verbal and written information and signed a paper on the voluntary participation and filled in a report on personal data. Since the whole procedure took about 30&#x000a0;min, the participants was offered to drink a glass of water before the measure to reduce the risk of dehydration. The participants removed shoes, jewelry, watches, and electronic equipment such as mobile phones.</p><p>On the force plate, the participants were placed with the feet in a standardized position with 30&#x000b0; of external rotation, marked on the force plate. The neck was positioned in 20&#x000b0; of flexion, and the participants were asked to focus eyes on one spot on the wall, at a distance of 1.5&#x000a0;m, individually adjusted to height and neck position. This is to avoid proprioceptors from the neck to have an impact on the postural wobbling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The participants could not see the force platform&#x02019;s computer screen during the measurements. The verbal instructions were standardized. The participants were instructed to keep the arms hanging freely and during the test not to speak. Each participant then performed a test measurement for 30&#x000a0;s with eyes open and on a firm surface, in order to familiarize themselves with the plate and the test approach.</p><p>The procedure was carried out without wristband, with the placebo wristband and with the mineral wristband. The order in which each of the three procedures was carried out, was randomly selected, using a random list.</p><p>The measurements were performed by two test-leaders. The same test-leader gave instructions to the participants, and applied the wristband to be used at each measurement. This test leader had no knowledge of which bracelet was used, or the randomized test scheme. Another test leader provided the first test leader with the wristbands according the random list, and documented the measurements into the computer system Good Balance TM, Metitur Ltd., Finland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Equipment</title><p>The postural sway was measured by a computerized system, which consisted of a triangular plate with force sensors at each corner. Force plate was connected to a PC where the program Good Balance TM, Metitur Ltd, Finland, was installed and synchronized with the plate. Based on signals from each corner of the force plate, the system analyzed the average speed of the movements based on the COP both ML and AP. These values are indicated in mm/s. The system corrects for any differences in the height and the COM of the various test subjects. The force plate was tested and calibrated prior to use and a basic calibration was implemented automatically every time the computer program was started. There were also automated checks every two hours. This model of force plates has been tested for validity and intrasession- and test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The mineral wristband was made of silicone and, according to the manufacturer, it contains mineralized surgical steel and has the &#x0201c;highest frequency&#x0201d; which therefore makes the greatest impact on balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The placebo wristband was also made of silicone and looked the same as the mineral wristband.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Considering standard deviation for measures on the force plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] a power of 80&#x000a0;% and the significance level set at 0.05, a sample size of 30 subjects was required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since we also wanted to detect small differences between the groups, sample size was set to 40.</p><p>Due to the fact that the observations are repeated measures within the same subject, there is dependence between measurements. To correct for this deviation from the pre-requisites for a traditional regression model, we used a multilevel approach, where a correction for dependence is built into the model. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We regarded the repeated measures to be clustered within the subjects, thus giving a two level structure. The dependent variables used were ML and AP. The independent variables used were vision (eyes open or closed), surface (firm surface and foam) and wristband: without, placebo or mineral. Each dependent variable (ML, AP) was analyzed separately with all independent variables.</p><p>The multilevel analysis started with a so-called empty model, <italic>i.e.</italic> a model with only a fixed part and a random part. The fixed part models the effect of the mean that underlies all observations. The random part consists of a decomposition of the total variance into two levels: variance between subjects (second level) and between occasions within subjects.</p><p>The empty model was then extended by including the independent variables in the fixed part of the model (eyes, surface and wristband). Inclusion was made stepwise, but only the last model with all variables is presented.</p><p>Analysis was made with MlWin, v 2.30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Residual (or restricted) maximum likelihood (REML) was used for all analysis. REML estimation takes into account the loss of degrees of freedom resulting from the estimation of the parameters of the fixed part. This has an indirect effect on the estimates of the fixed part.</p><p>The results are presented with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>A reduction in the total variance is an indicator of a better &#x0201c;fit&#x0201d; of the model, as is the reduction in the deviance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Standing with eyes open on a firm surface caused the smallest postural sway in all dimensions (ML 7,47&#x000a0;mm/s, AP 13,64&#x000a0;mm/s) and standing with eyes closed on foam prolonged the sway (ML +3,82&#x000a0;mm/s, AP +8,12&#x000a0;mm/s).

Thus, the small but statistically significant reduction in sway seen when using any of the wristbands in our study can be caused by the sensory information provided through the wristband&#x02019;s contact with the skin. Another explanation might be the expectation from the participants that without the wristband, balance would be worse. Studies about the placebo effect has shown that positive expectations increases the likelihood of reporting feeling better after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and that dopamine receptors can be affected by treatment with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Further studies are also needed on the impact of mineral wristband on strength and flexibility. Also, the placebo effect has to be taken into account when considering the effect of the wristband; a small increase in performance caused by the placebo effect when the athlete is convinced that the wristband will improve performance, is in fact a real improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Wearing a mineral wristband did not affect postural sway in this group of healthy individuals, compared to a placebo wristband or no wristband at all.
