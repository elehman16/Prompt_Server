They have an annual incidence of 8 per 100,000 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and a prevalence of 0.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to 3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] per 1000 individuals with visual impairment. The condition occurs more frequently in adults aged 75&#x000a0;years or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Macular holes can have a devastating impact on quality of life and independence but can be repaired by surgery in which the causative tractional forces in the eye are released and a temporary bubble of gas is injected. To promote successful hole closure individuals may be advised to maintain a face-down position for up to 10&#x000a0;days following surgery. However, face-down positioning can be arduous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and associated with significant adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and evidence of its value is lacking. A recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] highlighted the need for an appropriately designed, adequately powered randomised controlled clinical trial to determine with confidence its value. The review reported that estimated effects were in favour of positioning but differences were not statistically significant for smaller macular holes. It concluded that face-down positioning may improve the likelihood of successful surgery for large macular holes (400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m or greater in diameter) and highlighted the need for an appropriately designed, adequately powered randomised controlled clinical trial to determine with confidence the value of advice to position face-down.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale</title><p>The benefit of face-down positioning to the success of surgery is unproven; evidence to guide individuals on its impact is lacking and advice offered by clinicians varies widely. The current lack of evidence with which to guide patients has led to a lack of consensus among clinicians and wide variation in clinical practice.</p><p>To address the limitations in the evidence we will perform a trial to determine whether advice to position face-down, as opposed to face-forward, improves the probability of macular hole closure at 3&#x000a0;months after surgery, and so reduces the need for further surgery. We will test whether advice to position face-down results in a better outcome than an inactive face-forward position following surgery for large macular holes (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m).</p><p>A previous pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] has demonstrated the feasibility of this definitive RCT.</p><p>We have chosen to include only large macular holes (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) because the available evidence suggests that face-down positioning is of more relevance to larger holes than for smaller macular holes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, the role of surgery in the management of smaller macular holes may be influenced in the future by the introduction of enzymatic vitreolysis techniques; intra-ocular injection of ocriplasmin can help induce closure in up to 40&#x000a0;% of smaller macular holes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this approach is not designed for larger holes, the management of which is likely to involve surgery for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The proposed trial has been designed taking into account the views of individuals with macular holes and clinicians. The pilot study suggested a benefit of positioning following surgery for large macular holes. Previous pilot study subjects were invited to form a Patient Advisory Panel to advise on the design and methodology of this new RCT. Both patients and clinicians indicated that randomisation to either face-down positioning for as long as 10&#x000a0;days, or conversely to no positioning at all, would adversely affect recruitment to the trial because these alternatives are typically considered too arduous or would present too high a risk of non-closure, respectively. Instead, we have reached a consensus, based on the approach used by Guillaubey et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], on the alternatives of 5&#x000a0;days positioning either face-down or in an inactive face-forward position.</p><p>For the primary outcome we have chosen successful closure of the macular hole because, according to our Patient Advisory Panel, this is directly relevant to patients; hole closure is essential for a favourable impact on sight and determines whether further surgery is required. Although visual acuity is a relevant measure of functional outcome, its validity is limited to some extent in the short term by the confounding influence of secondary lens opacity and does not directly determine the need for further surgery.</p><p>We have chosen not to attempt to measure objectively the compliance of subjects with positioning. This is because self-reported compliance is of unknown reliability, and objective monitoring risks influencing behaviour artificially and unpredictably. Instead, we have taken the pragmatic approach to determine the value of the <italic>advice</italic> to patients regarding position. However, following the period of positioning we will ask subjects to say retrospectively how easy they found it to maintain their allocated position (on a scale of 0 (very difficult) to 10 (very easy). We will also assess their quality of life using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25).</p><p>The trial will benefit patients by providing reliable information on the value of positioning following surgery for large macular holes, thereby enabling them to make an appropriately informed choice about the management of their condition.</p><p>The research will benefit the National Health Service (NHS) because by determining the value of face-down positioning we can expect to improve the likelihood of prompt successful surgery and hence reduce the amount of additional resource required for further clinical management and associated costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim is to determine whether advice to position face-down improves the surgical success rate of closure of large (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) macular holes, and thereby reduces the need for further surgery.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective is to determine the impact of face-down positioning on the likelihood of closure of large (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) full-thickness macular holes following surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>The secondary objective is to determine the impact of face-down positioning on sight, quality of life and wellbeing.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This will be a multicentre interventional, comparative randomised controlled clinical trial comparing face-down positioning with face-forward positioning.</p><p>We will recruit 192 participants having surgery for large macular holes (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m); 96 in each of the 2 arms of the study.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Presence of an idiopathic full-thickness macular hole, greater than or equal to 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients electing to have surgery for a macular hole, with or without simultaneous phacoemulsification and intra-ocular lens implant.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ability and willingness to position face-down or in an inactive face-forward position.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Age-related macular degeneration; glaucoma; diabetic retinopathy; retinal degeneration; amblyopia; previous vitrectomy surgery (refractive error, lens opacity and previous use of ocriplasmin are not exclusion criteria).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Traumatic macular hole.</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of visual loss suggesting macular hole duration longer than 12&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Presence of a retinal tear identified during surgery for which postoperative positioning is advised.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Informed consent</title><p>Eligible candidates will be approached at their baseline visit by the clinical team, provided with information about the trial and invited to participate.

In particular, there is some concern that individuals with large holes randomised to non-positioning may be less likely to benefit from hole-closure. We have addressed this concern by ensuring that subjects not allocated to face-down positioning are advised to maintain an inactive face-forward position, which has been an acceptable standard for previous trials. If the results demonstrate that positioning face-down is more effective than positioning inactively face-forward we can conclude that it is also likely to be more effective than not positioning at all.</p><p>Applications to the UK&#x02019;s main REC (NRES Committee London &#x02013; Westminster) and the local Moorfields Research Management Committee have received favourable opinion (REC reference 14/LO/2061).</p><p>We will perform the study in accordance with the ethical principles in the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care, Second Edition, 2005 and its subsequent amendments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Dissemination of research findings</title><p>The results will be disseminated at clinical meetings, and by publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The research team combines the strengths of experienced eye specialists with the expertise of the PCTU, and the active involvement of patients to ensure that the trial addresses their needs.
