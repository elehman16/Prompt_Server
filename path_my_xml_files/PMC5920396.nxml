Introduction</title><p>Poor oral hygiene is related to microbial plaque aggregation on the teeth and oral structure which results in dental caries [<xref rid="B1-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], gingivitis and periodontal disease [<xref rid="B2-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of caries and periodontal disease in Iranian children and adolescents [<xref rid="B3-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Oral hygiene education has been shown to be effective, specifically among 9&#x02013;12-year-olds who are responsible for their oral hygiene themselves, and parents now become the observer instead of their previous active role. In addition to lower cooperation and motivation for health among 12-year-old children, reduced self-confidence at the same time as puberty leads to poor plaque control [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Changes in diet and hormones can also cause caries development and inflammation. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to retrain and motivate children at this age [<xref rid="B10-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The three major methods for oral health education comprise of verbal, written and audiovisual methods [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Jabarifar et al. concluded that the lecture method was more effective than video for the promotion of oral health knowledge, attitude and practice among 14-year-old children [<xref rid="B11-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, controversies exist regarding the most effective oral health education methods. Redmond et al. reported a higher acceptance rate of written health education methods among adolescents [<xref rid="B12-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while educational videos resulted in a greater effect on oral hygiene learning when compared to the lecture method [<xref rid="B13-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of different educational methods of toothbrushing (lecture, video and pamphlet) on the dental plaque index (PI) of 12-year-old children.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-children-05-00050"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-children-05-00050" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>The cluster randomized interventional trial was performed from January to April 2017 on 12-year-old children in public and private schools in Babol, north of Iran. A sample size of 128 participants was considered (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05, power = 80%, effect size = 0.6). The subjects were allocated into four groups based on the type of intervention: group 1 had no intervention; group 2 had a lecture; group 3 watched a video; group 4 read a pamphlet (<italic>n</italic> = 32), and they were matched according to gender and school type. In each school, just one educational group was selected.</p><p>The inclusion criteria consisted of healthy children, having teeth take part in the plaque index (11, 16, 26, 31, 36 and 46). The exclusion criteria included the dissatisfaction of children to participate in the study, physical and mental problems that limited learning ability, having a painful tooth in the mouth, sensitivity to toothpaste, and having a large dental calculus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-children-05-00050"><title>2.2. Clinical Measurements and Outcomes</title><p>All study groups (including the control) received a toothbrush/toothpaste before the baseline PI assessment and had an opportunity to brush before the assessment. The following program was performed for the intervention groups. At the baseline, after measuring the plaque indices, the participants were trained in the Bass toothbrushing technique [<xref rid="B14-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Next, the plaque indices were assessed 24 h later. The retraining was delivered four weeks later for all groups and was the same as teaching at the baseline. The final plaque index measurement was done one month later (eight weeks after the baseline).</p><p>In addition, the plaque index assessment served for no intervention group (group 1) at the baseline and two months later. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="children-05-00050-f001">Figure 1</xref> displays the study procedure.</p><p>The plaque index measurement was performed for all 128 participants by two well-trained, but not blinded senior dental students (intra- and inter-examiner v <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> value = 0.91 and 0.86) during school hours at the health office of the school on a comfortable chair, using a mouth mirror and a dental explorer.</p><p>A single toothbrush and toothpaste (Oral-B, Iowa City, IA, USA) were given to each student and they were asked to brush their teeth, then the Sillness and Loe plaque indices were measured [<xref rid="B15-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The mean PI scores were classified as less than 0.1 (absence of plaque or perfect plaque control), between 0.1 to 1.0 (small amount of plaque or good plaque control), between 1.0 to 2.0 (average value or fair plaque control), and between 2.1 to 3 (bad plaque control).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-children-05-00050"><title>2.3.

The educational content of the video and pamphlet was assessed by one of the masters in the Education Development Center (EDC) department of the Babol University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>The video was made in two sections including an animation describing dental plaque and caries development and a film with a footnote in the Persian language displaying the toothbrushing method on a dental model for eight minutes.</p><p>The lecture was also presented by a senior dental student within almost 10 min. The lecture was accompanied by brushing training on a dental model. The pamphlet was designed with both text and images in the Persian language and was given to participants for studying within 10 min.

Results</title><p>In this interventional study no participants were missed. The PI mean (&#x000b1; standard deviation (SD)) of 12-year-old children at the baseline was 0.89 (&#x000b1;0.41). A good status of oral and dental hygiene was considered when 0.1 &#x02264; PI &#x02264; 1.

Discussion</title><p>The main aim of this study was to compare the effect of toothbrushing education by practical lecture, video and a pamphlet on the dental plaque index among 12-year-old children. Like previous studies, the results indicated that education was effective in plaque reduction [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, a statistically significant decrease occurred in the PI of all educational groups in both intervals after training (24 h and two months) when compared to the control group. Since the oral hygiene status of the subjects was estimated as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; at the baseline, no significant clinical difference was seen after education. The control group showed a significant increase in the PI during the two months, which may be due to no participation in any educational or motivational intervention either in the framework of this research project or otherwise.</p><p>Among the study groups, the lowest score of PI was in the pamphlet, video and lecture at 24 h, respectively. This difference indicated the higher impact of the pamphlet in a short time. After two months, the lowest score of PI was observed in the lecture, video and pamphlet groups, respectively; however, these differences were non-significant.</p><p>A significant reduction in plaque index was observed after 24 h and two months when compared to the baseline which was similar in all study groups. In order to study the short-term effect of education, the plaque index was measured 24 h later; and for the long-term effect, it was evaluated eight weeks later. In order to enhance the degree of learning, the retraining program was planned four weeks after the baseline.</p><p>When comparing different oral health education methods, however, Yazdani and colleagues reported that leaflets were more effective than videotapes, while a culturally appropriate video revealed oral hygiene improvement among Nigerian children [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, although no significant PI difference was observed by gender in the baseline, boys in the pamphlet group showed more PI reduction than did the girls, while previous study in Tehran revealed that the videotape was more effective to improve boys&#x02019; oral cleanliness and gingival health when compared to girls [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This difference consists of different gender preferences in educational material in different geographical states in Iran, which may be related to socio-cultural factors. Therefore, oral health education interventions should consider gender preferences in different states in Iran.</p><p>The selection of private and public schools was considered according to their predictive role in the household economic situation. In the present study, students in private schools showed a higher PI when compared to public schools&#x02019; students at the baseline. Participants from both public and private schools, however, showed plaque reduction in all intervention groups.</p><p>Regarding learning styles, three main ways exist such as writing, audio-visual and oral methods [<xref rid="B9-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, the authors used the three main methods of health education including a pamphlet, lecture and video. The pamphlet served as the writing method regarding its advantages such as summarizing content, fast replication, simple design, reusability, and multi-threading ability. However, the pamphlet lacked the ability to transmit the message and the details of a practical tutorial completely.</p><p>The video served as the audio-visual method regarding its several advantages such as attractiveness and the possibility of repetition of similar training without modifying the quality and quantity of data for the group, as well as being easy to apply. However, this method needed an audio-visual player, which was inappropriate or defective at some schools.</p><p>Verbal education with a dental model needed less specialized equipment and facilities while allowing children to closely see how to brush.</p><p>Some limitations of this study included the lack of knowledge assessment of participants to ensure that the education content was completely paid attention to or understood, the fact that the examiner was not blind to the study groups, and that the authors could not possibly prevent the students from receiving additional educational information from other sources. Loyalty to the speaker&#x02019;s text may not be the same across the different groups, and this was subject to limitation. While health education has benefits, the long-term effectiveness of oral health education interventions for improving oral health outcomes is questionable [<xref rid="B19-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Asimakopoulou and Newton believed that behavioral changes resulted from capability, opportunity and motivation while knowledge was only part of capability [<xref rid="B20-children-05-00050" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Overall, in the present study, the effect of different educational methods on the PI was not significantly different.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-children-05-00050"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Toothbrushing education with lecture, video and pamphlet modes reduced the dental plaque index. In all three different teaching methods, the effectiveness was almost the same; however, the pamphlet was the most effective method in a 24 h period. To achieve effective results, in the future, oral health promotion programs could use each of these oral health education methods set to the unique resources of the settings.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>J.R. and S.G. and I.J. conceived and designed the experiments; J.R. and Z.A. performed the experiments; H.G. analyzed the data; M.M.N.S. and I.J. contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools; J.R. and S.G. and M.M.N.S. wrote the paper.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-children-05-00050"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moses</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rangeeth</surname><given-names>B.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurunathan</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of dental caries, socio-economic status and treatment needs among 5 to 15 year old school going children of Chidambaram</article-title><source>J.
