A good memory power acts as a catalyst in all walks of life, be it academic success or maintenance of personal relationships. It is observed that an average man uses only 10% of his natural memory. Remaining 90% is left unused in a haphazard manner. As per the American psychologist Carl Emil Seashore, if one is alert and makes systematic attempts to awaken and use the natural memory properly, his/her natural memory would be activated creatively and would offer benefits of higher order. A comparative study was conducted comprising 90 subjects to know the efficacy of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> and <italic>Yogic</italic> practices in short-term memory of school-going children. The study was conducted over a period of 3 months. It was an open, prospective, and randomized clinical study. The subjects of group A formed the control group and they were observed silently for 3 months without any intervention. The subjects in group B were administered with <italic>Choorna</italic> (powder) of four <italic>Medhya Rasayanas, Mandukaparni</italic> (Centella asiatica Linn.), <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> Linn.), <italic>Guduchi</italic> [<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (Willd.) Miers ex Hook. f. and Thoms.], and <italic>Sankhapushpi</italic> (<italic>Convolvulus pluricaulis</italic> Choisy), at a dose of 2 g twice daily with milk. Subjects belonging to group C were advocated regular <italic>Yogic</italic> practices of <italic>Asanas, Pranayama</italic>, and <italic>Dhyana</italic>. Further study revealed that among the three groups, group B treated with <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to objective parameters in the tests, i.e. (1) short-term memory test pictures and (2) serial recall effects test using memory scope. Among the three groups, group C treated with <italic>Yogic</italic> practices showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to subjective and objective parameters in mini mental status scale i.e. test 3. The treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, which can be beneficial for the community. Mean increase after first follow-up in group B was higher as compared to group C. This shows that <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic>s are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with <italic>Yogic</italic> practices. So, on the whole, group B can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic></kwd><kwd>school children</kwd><kwd>short term memory</kwd><kwd><italic>Yogic</italic> practices</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the present era, individuals are overloaded with stress, tension, anxiety, and lack of sleep, which adversely affect the memory of most individuals. It is very common even in children. The prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children of age group 11-17 years was 2.1%, anxiety disorders was 6.9%, and depression was 2.1% in the US in 2007.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Also, the prevalence of overall mental illnesses is 12.5% in 0-16 year age group, prevalence of anxiety disorders in developed countries is on an average 8% (2-24%) and in India, it is 4.1% among 4-16 year olds.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome is 1.7-17.8% in India. Hence, it very essential to manage these mental faculties affecting the short-term memory of children by advocating <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic>s and <italic>Yogic</italic> practices as mentioned in our ancient classics.</p><p>Daily use of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> is not only good for memory but also good for promotion of mental health. <italic>Yogic</italic> practices reduce stress in life and enhance lifespan along with increasing memory. Hence, the present research work has been designed to know the relation between <italic>Prakriti</italic> and <italic>Sara</italic> of children with short-term memory of school-going children, to evaluate the effect of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> on the improvement of short-term memory and maintenance of health and to evaluate the effect of <italic>Yogic</italic> practices in the improvement of short-term memory among school-going children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Approval was obtained from the departmental research committee and ethical committee of the institute.

Subjects of this group were advised to take <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> 2 g twice daily with milk for 3 months. The combination comprised of fine powder of the above-mentioned four <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> drugs, milk powder, and sugar powder in the ratio 2:1:1. Totally 4 g of medicine (<italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> 2 g, milk powder 1 g, and sugar powder 1 g) was given in one dose. These drugs were mixed with milk powder and sugar powder to increase the palatability of the drug, so that children could consume it easily. This combination was used as the subjects were school-going children. <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> was given in the morning and evening with milk.</p><p>Group C: Subjects treated with <italic>Yogic</italic> practices.

This indicates the proper development of body due to proper intake of food and good <italic>Vyayama</italic>. Regarding <italic>Satmya</italic>, maximum subjects (62.22%) came under the <italic>Madhyama Satmya</italic> category, followed by 32.22% in <italic>Pravara Satmya</italic>. This indicates that the children consumed more than four <italic>Rasas</italic> regularly in the diet. About 61.11% subjects belonged to <italic>Madhyama Satva</italic>, whereas 24.44% belonged to <italic>Pravara Satva</italic> and only 14.44% belonged to <italic>Avara satva</italic>. This shows that proper <italic>Satva</italic> leads to good memory. Maximum subjects were not under major stress, which was assessed by means of selected questions from Hamilton's Stress Index. Majority of subjects (i.e., 65.56%) were having <italic>Pravara Abhyavaharanashakti</italic>, while 27.78% subjects were having <italic>Madhyama Abhyavaharanashakti</italic>. <italic>Jaranashakti</italic> was also found to be <italic>Pravara</italic> in majority of subjects (61.11%). This indicates that children are basically physically active, and because of it, their <italic>Agni</italic> is increased. Hence, they need good amount of energy through food. Majority of subjects (i.e., 55.56%) were having <italic>Madhyama Vyayamashakti</italic>. This also indicates that subjects were physically fit for doing Yoga. In this study, the effect of four <italic>Medhya Rasayanas, Mandukaparni, Yashtimadhu, Guduchi, and Sankhapushpi</italic>, was studied. These are easily available, and they are very beneficial for memory and also help in the prevention of many diseases. <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> was given to group B subjects at a dose of 4 g twice daily for 3 months.</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Distribution according to <italic>Deha Prakriti</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-383-g007"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Mode of action of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic></title><p><italic>Medhya Rasayanas</italic> strengthen the body and maintain normal body function. <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic> maintains the intelligence and <italic>Kapha</italic> sustains the body with intelligence and <italic>Dhriti</italic> (courage) by its <italic>Sthira Guna</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] <italic>Pranavata</italic> performs the intellectual function and it is the main factor involved in grasping and fast recall, especially because of its <italic>Chala</italic> (mobile) and <italic>Vishada</italic> (fast-spreading) properties. <italic>Sadhaka Pitta</italic> performs functions like discrimination between right and wrong by the <italic>Nishchayatmaka Buddhi</italic> and <italic>Medha</italic> (intelligence).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] <italic>Medhya Rasayanas</italic> help to maintain <italic>vata, pitta</italic>, and <italic>Kapha Doshas</italic> normal functions.

It also shows immune-modulatory activity and strong antioxidant activity as revealed by increased level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione in mice. <italic>Ce. asiatica</italic> extract and powder may ameliorate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> -induced oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation via alteration of the antioxidant defense system in rats.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Thus, it is a general health promoter. It has neuronal dendritic growth-stimulating property.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This may help in enhancing concentration power, thus improving short-term memory. Asiaticoside, an active principle present in <italic>Ce. asiatica</italic>, imparts anxiolytic activity,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and thus, it helps in reducing the anxiety which is one of the factors affecting the memory. Aqueous extract of <italic>Ce. asiatica</italic> Linn. is reported to be effective in preventing the cognitive deficits as well as oxidative stress caused by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin in rats.</p><p><italic>Madhura</italic> and <italic>Shita</italic> qualities and <italic>Vatapittashamaka</italic> and <italic>Rasayana</italic> effects of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> bring about soothing effect, and probably this helps in bringing about <italic>Stairya</italic> and <italic>Dhriti</italic> to establish stability of mind and for enhancing memory [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>]. The root of <italic>G. glabra</italic> Linn. contains the active principles, glycyrrhizin, glycoside, isoliquritin, liquiritin, steroid estrogen, hispaglabridin B, isoliquiritigenin, and paratocarpin B.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Experiments showed that <italic>G. glabra</italic> Linn. increases the blood circulation to the central nervous system and balances the sugar levels in the blood.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The isoflavones glabridin and hispalglabridins A and B of <italic>G. glabra</italic> Linn. have significant antioxidant activity. The antioxidants protect susceptible brain cells from the oxidative stress, resulting in reduced brain damage and improved neuronal function, thereby enhancing the memory.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Ethanol extract of <italic>G. glabra</italic> Linn. possesses cerebroprotective effect in hypoxic rats, which may be mediated by its antioxidant effects. According to a study improvement in learning and memory of mice was observed when they were administered aqueous extract of liquorice in a dose of 150 mg/kg. This is probably due to facilitation of cholinergic transmission in mouse brain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T8" position="float"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Properties of plants as per <italic>Bhavaprakash Nighantu</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-383-g008"/></table-wrap><p><italic>Guduchi</italic>, another component of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic>, has <italic>Katu</italic>, <italic>Tikta Rasas</italic> which help in keeping the mind alert, so that things can be remembered properly.

It has <italic>Tridoshahara</italic> property. <italic>C. pluricaulis</italic> contains many phytonutrients like convolidine, convolvine, convolvidine, convoline, confoline, phyllabine, subhirsine, and scopoline. These compounds help in brain stimulation and increase the ability to concentrate.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] <italic>C. pluricaulis</italic> reduces anxiety and stress by controlling the production of body's stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol. It is reported to possess anxiolytic and memory-enhancing and mood-elevating effects, and is claimed to retard brain aging.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Neuroprotective role of <italic>C. pluricaulis</italic> has been proved in the study by Bihaqi <italic>et al</italic>. on aluminum-induced neurotoxicity in rat brain.

After 1 month of treatment, a significant reduction in the neurotic features was observed and immediate memory span was significantly improved.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Mode of action of <italic>Yoga</italic></title><p>Due to short-term memory loss, the individual faces many problems and overall poor performance in work. <italic>Yoga</italic> can help humanity in a major way by making individuals overcome the challenges posed by loss of memory. An integrated approach to <italic>Yoga</italic> is necessary for the holistic development of memory. <italic>Tadasana</italic> develops physical and mental balance. <italic>Tiryak Tadasana</italic> balances the body as well as the mind.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] <italic>Vrukshasana</italic> gives sense of balance and poise. <italic>Virabhadrasana</italic> develops concentration power. <italic>Trikonasana</italic> stimulates the nervous system and alleviates nervous depression. <italic>Kapalabhati</italic> energizes the mind for mental work and removes sleepiness,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] thus brings about alertness needed for the improvement of short-term memory. While performing <italic>Anuloma</italic>-<italic>Viloma</italic>, breathing through the left nostril tends to activate the right hemisphere and breathing through the right nostril activates the left hemisphere. It has calming effect and relieves anxiety, improves concentration, and stimulates <italic>Ajna cakra</italic>. The brain centers are stimulated to work nearer to their optimum capacity. <italic>Bhramari</italic> relieves stress and cerebral tension, and thus helps in alleviating anger, anxiety, and insomnia. <italic>Omkar Dhyana</italic> produces benefits at many levels of life. It simultaneously influences body, emotions, mental functioning, and relationships. Meditation also improves brain functioning, enhances the ability to focus, improves perception and memory, promotes development of intelligence, decreases craving for cigarette, alcohol, and drug abuse, along with decreasing the withdrawal symptoms, induces relaxation, and decreases stress. Meditation is an inherent ability of the human body. Meditation is an activity whereby the nervous system, brain, and senses get tuned themselves for best functioning. During meditation, the concentration on different <italic>Cakras</italic> like on <italic>Muladhara Cakra</italic> enhances health and <italic>Vidya</italic>, <italic>Manipura Cakra</italic> enhances <italic>Vidya</italic> and capacity, and on <italic>Vishudha Cakra</italic> brings about improvement in speech and knowledge. The <italic>Satvasarata</italic> state leads to excellence of memory; this state can be brought about by the regular practice of <italic>Yoga</italic>, so as to improve short-term memory.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Objective assessment</title><p>In test 1 (short-term memory test - pictures), the intergroup comparison showed that group B treated with <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> was most effective as the increase in mean values in the group was higher.

This shows that the <italic>Yogic</italic> practices help in the improvement of mental status like relief from day-to-day stress and also help in the improvement of memory. When group B was compared with group C in test 1, the difference between the 1<sup>st</sup> follow-up values was found to be significant. Increase in mean values after 1<sup>st</sup> follow-up in group B was higher as compared to group C. This shows that <italic>Medhya Rasayanas</italic> are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with <italic>Yogic</italic> practices. So, on the whole, group B can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> helps in improvement of memory power. <italic>Yogic</italic> practices help to improve the concentration and calm the mind, resulting in memory improvement. Among the three groups, group B treated with <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> was highly significant and most effective with respect to objective parameters in tests 1 and 2. Further, the treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, so it can be applied in the community. Among the three groups, group C treated with <italic>Yogic</italic> practices was highly significant and most effective with respect to subjective and objective parameters in test 3. It is also a cost-effective, non-pharmacological intervention; so, everyone can adopt it to enhance memory as well as prevent many lifestyle disorders. Group B treated with <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> is most effective in improving short-term memory of school-going children among the three groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very much thankful to Prof. C.
