Protein fermentation or putrefaction is the anaerobic digestion of protein by the microbiota residing in the colon. Proteins entering the colon originate from dietary proteins that escaped digestion in the proximal gut, pancreatic or intestinal secretions or desquamated gut cells. Increased protein intake results in increased protein fermentation in both animals and humans <xref rid="pone.0052387-Evenepoel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Toden1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Protein fermentation results in the production of branched chain fatty acids (BCFA; isobutyric and isovaleric acid) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA; acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) but also of metabolites such as ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), amines, indolic, phenolic and sulfur-containing compounds <xref rid="pone.0052387-Blachier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies investigated the effects of protein fermentation metabolites in relation to gut toxicity. Ammonia was found to increase cell proliferation and decrease cell permeability in colonic adenocarcinoma cells (CaCo-2) at concentrations between 10 and 100 mM <xref rid="pone.0052387-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Also phenol (1&#x02013;10 mmol/L) increases cell permeability <xref rid="pone.0052387-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Attene-Ramos <italic>et al.</italic> showed that hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S; 250 &#x000b5;mol/L) induces genotoxic damage in colonic adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29) <xref rid="pone.0052387-AtteneRamos1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and suggests that this could be radical-mediated <xref rid="pone.0052387-AtteneRamos2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>S also impairs butyrate oxidation, which is the most important energy pathway in colonocytes <xref rid="pone.0052387-Roediger1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-DePreter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Additional evidence on protein fermentation toxicity arises from animal studies. In a study where rats received a high casein diet (25%) urinary levels of p-cresol, a marker of protein fermentation, significantly correlated with genetic damage, indicating a possible role of protein fermentation in genotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0052387-Toden1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Genotoxicity of fecal water also increased in rats on a high soya diet (25%). Unfortunately, no markers of protein fermentation were included in this study <xref rid="pone.0052387-Toden2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In contrast, when casein that was thermolyzed for different times to make it less digestible was administered to rats to increase protein fermentation no association was found between formation of aberrant crypt foci and protein fermentation in rats <xref rid="pone.0052387-Corpet1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Several epidemiological studies found an association between meat intake and both colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, those studies focused on meat intake <xref rid="pone.0052387-Norat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052387-Arafa1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or protein intake <xref rid="pone.0052387-Hou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> but not on protein fermentation. As high meat intake is not only associated with higher protein intake but also with a higher intake of fat <xref rid="pone.0052387-Willett1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, heterocyclic amines <xref rid="pone.0052387-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and heme <xref rid="pone.0052387-Bastide1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, it is extremely difficult to attribute the increased CRC and IBD risk to protein intake or fermentation. In addition, this association was not found in all epidemiological studies <xref rid="pone.0052387-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>In the present human intervention study, we specifically modified the degree of protein fermentation by changing protein intake and evaluated the impact on parameters of gut health by investigating fecal water genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. A metabolome approach was applied to identify those metabolites associated with increased genotoxicity and cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Based on results from a pilot study in 9 subjects, a sample size of 18 healthy subjects was expected to provide 80% chance for detecting a difference of 15% (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10.05) in fecal water genotoxicity (the primary outcome variable of this study) between the high and low protein diet at the 5% level of significance. Participants were recruited by advertisement among the students of the Catholic University of Leuven and among employees of the University Hospitals Leuven. Twenty-two healthy subjects with a regular dietary pattern (3 meals per day on at least 5 days per week) participated in the study between October 2009 and June 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052387-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Exclusion criteria were abdominal surgery in the past (except from appendectomy), liver- or kidney failure, history of chronic gastro-intestinal conditions such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease. Also subjects that consulted a dietician in the 6 weeks prior to the start of the trial or that were on a low-calorie or vegetarian diet were excluded. Female subjects were excluded if pregnant or lactating. All subjects were free of medication influencing the gut transit or intestinal microbiota for 14 days and of antibiotics for 1 month before the start of the trial. Intake of pre- and probiotics was prohibited during the complete study period. Twenty subjects (14 women, 6 men, age range: 19&#x02013;41 years, BMI range: 18.5&#x02013;25.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the study. At the time of inclusion, the subjects were informed about pre- and probiotics and the foods containing them. The study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by The Ethics Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (clinical trial number: NCT01280513). All subjects gave their written informed consent before participation.

The first week of each intervention was considered as an adaption period to the new diet. All dietary information and samples were collected during the second week of the intervention. After providing informed consent, the eligible subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) were randomly assigned to one of the randomization groups differing in the sequence of the intervention diets. Randomization and enrollment of the subjects was performed by an independent researcher who is no part of the study using online randomization software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). The type of intervention made it impossible to blind the treatment for both the subjects and the researchers.</p><p>During the first week of the run-in period, the subjects completed a 7-day dietary record. Subjects were asked to record all food and beverage intake, including weights and brands. All subjects received a kitchen scale to be able to quantify their dietary intake. In total, there were 3 clinical visits during the study. On the morning of day 5 subjects came to the Laboratory Absorption &#x00026; Digestion from the Catholic University Leuven, Belgium, after a night of starvation. All subjects underwent a ventilated-hood calorimetry <xref rid="pone.0052387-PinheiroVolp1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> for the assessment of their caloric needs and completed the Baecke questionnaire for physical activity <xref rid="pone.0052387-Baecke1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. They were weighed and performed a test during which they provided baseline samples, consumed a test meal and collected samples until the morning of day 7 (see below).</p><p>During the second week of the run-in period, subjects continued their habitual diet. This period was used to draw up individually adapted diets for each dietary period. Adapted diets were isocaloric to the habitual diet of the subjects and took the personal preferences of the subjects into account. Protein was replaced by digestible carbohydrates and fat and fiber intake were kept as constant as possible during the intervention. At the start of the first intervention period, each subject received two series (one for the LP diet and one for the HP diet) of 3 lists with 7 suggestions for breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively, and 1 list with 10 possible snacks. They were allowed to choose one breakfast, one lunch and one dinner suggestion per day. Depending on their caloric needs, subjects were allowed to consume two or three snacks per day. The HP diet was supplemented with 20 g protein powder/day (Resource, Nestl&#x000e9; Healthcare Nutrition, Switzerland). During the second week of each dietary period the subjects completed a 7-day dietary record to evaluate the actual food intake. After the first dietary period subjects immediately switched diets and started the second dietary period. On day 26 and on day 40 the subjects came to the laboratory for the second and third clinical visit, respectively. They were weighed and consumed a test meal and collected samples as after the 1<sup>st</sup> visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study End Points</title><p>The primary outcome variable of this study was fecal water genotoxicity.

The calorimeter was calibrated before each measurement. After an overnight fast, subjects came to the laboratory of the department of Nutrition-Public Health from the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, by bus or by car to avoid physical activity. In this way, they were in a metabolic state in which only fat oxidation occurs. They were put in a resting position (laying on a bed). A ventilated hood was positioned over the subject&#x02019;s head and 40l of air/min was sucked out of the hood. After passage through a mixing chamber, the calorimeter calculated the amount of expired CO<sub>2</sub> (VCO<sub>2</sub>) and inspired O<sub>2</sub> (VO<sub>2</sub>) per minute, taking the composition of the surrounding air into account. Based on these data the REE was calculated each minute of the test using the Weir formula: REE (kcal/24 h)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.44&#x000d7;(3.9&#x000d7;VO<sub>2</sub>+1.1&#x000d7;VCO<sub>2</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0052387-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

After measurement of the volumes, aliquots of urinary samples (40 mL) were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for further analysis. Fecal samples were collected for 72 h and delivered to the laboratory within 12 h. Upon delivery, 10 g of each sample was aliquoted for analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Twenty grams of feces was centrifuged at 50 000&#x000d7;g at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h for the production of fecal water. The remaining portions of the fecal samples were weighed, combined, and homogenized. Aliquots of these homogenized samples were lyophilized.

Briefly, the VOC were purged out of the sample with a helium flow (high purity (&#x0003e;99.99%)) at a rate of 40 mL/min for 20 min at 70&#x000b0;C. Consequently, He was carried over a &#x02018;dry flow&#x02019; column (Trap Tenax, Velocity, Interscience, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) to control moisture transfer and VOC were concentrated on a second polar trap column (Trap Vocarb, Velocity, Interscience, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium). By raising the temperature to 250&#x000b0;C the VOC were desorbed from the column to the injector of the GC, where they are separated on an analytical column, AT Aquawax DA (30 m&#x000d7;0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 &#x000b5;m film thickness, Grace, Deerfield, IL, USA). The oven starting temperature was 35&#x000b0;C for 2 min and increased with 5&#x000b0;C/min to 100&#x000b0;C and with 10&#x000b0;C/min to 240&#x000b0;C. The final temperature was held constant for 5 min. Masses between m/z 30 and m/z 500 were detected with in full scan mode at 2 scans/s. XCalibur&#x02122; software (Version 1.4 SR1, Thermo Electron) was used for automatization of the GC-MS and for data acquisition.</p><p>The obtained chromatograms were processed using AMDIS (Automatic Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification Software version 2.1) provided by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). This software provides quality matching using advanced spectral algorithms, adjacent peak deconvolution and background subtraction, which enables an unambiguous identification together with a quantitative indication of the metabolite levels. Identification of the metabolites in the samples was achieved by comparing the mass spectra of unknown peaks with the NIST library. Compounds showing mass spectra with match factors &#x02265;90% were positively identified. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Relative indices of all VOC versus 2-ethylbutyrate as internal standard were calculated. A number of VOC were selected as markers for saccharolytic fermentation (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) and proteolytic fermentation (isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, dimethyl sulfide and p-cresol). They were absolutely quantified with appropriate calibration curves obtained using internal standard quantification. The SCFA and BCFA were quantified using 2-ethylbutyrate as internal standard, whereas p-cresol and indole were quantified versus 2,6-dimethylphenol and dimethyl sulfide versus diethyl sulfide respectively. Results were expressed as mmol/L.</p></sec><sec id="s2g6"><title>Analysis of <sup>3</sup>H in lyophilized feces</title><p>The <sup>3</sup>H-PEG content in 100 mg lyophilized fecal sample was measured with liquid scintillation counting (Packard Tricarb Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, model 3375, Packard Instruments Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA) after oxidation to <sup>3</sup>H-H<sub>2</sub>O (Packard Sample Oxidizer, model 306, Packard Instruments Inc.).

Then 250 &#x000b5;l cooled NH4Ac was added. After mixing the samples, they were put on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, 2 extractions were performed with chloroform/iso-amylalcohol (24/1). Then 700 &#x000b5;l supernatant was transferred to 378 &#x000b5;l isopropanol, mixed and centrifuged for 8 min at 51010&#x000d7;g. After removal of the supernatant, 150 &#x000b5;l ethanol (70%) was added and the samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 51010&#x000d7;g.After removal of the supernatant, the samples put in the vacuum centrifuge for 5 min.

Next, community PCR was performed using universal primers F357+GC clamp and R518 targeting the hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria. The resulting 16S rRNA gene amplicons were analyzed with DGGE using a 35&#x02013;70% denaturating gradient as previously described resulting in profiles of the predominant fecal microbiota per subject <xref rid="pone.0052387-Vanhoutte1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. On each DGGE gel, a standard reference consisting of an amplicon mix of 12 different bacterial species was included in the middle and at both exterior ends to allow digital gel normalization and comparison between gels. DGGE profiles were digitally processed with Bionumerics version 6.6 (Applied Maths, St-Martens-Latem, Belgium). After normalization of the gels, individual bands in each sample lane were marked using the auto search function of the software, followed by manual correction if necessary. All profiles were compared using the band matching tool and uncertain bands were excluded. Every band in a profile was allocated to its nearest band-class after a collective analysis of all profiles, in which common bands were traced across different sample profiles. A maximum error of 0.5% of deviation was applied, which means that a band was only allocated if it was located at a distance of less than 0.5% of the total length of the profile from the closest band-class. The designation of the band-classes was based on their position on the profile compared to the standard reference. The intensity of a given band-class was expressed in respect of the other band-classes on the same profile.</p></sec><sec id="s2g8"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human colonic adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells were obtained from ECACC (European Collection of Cell Cultures) and grown in RPMI-1640 (Lonza Group Ltd, Switzerland) with 10% fecal calf serum (FCS, Lonza Group Ltd, Switzerland) and 0.08% antibiotics (gentamycine sulfate, Lonza Group Ltd, Switzerland) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2g9"><title>Cytotoxicity of fecal water: WST-1 assay</title><p>Cytotoxicity of fecal water was measured using a colorimetric cell viability assay, the WST-1 assay, on HT-29 cells.

Colonic bacterial fermentation results in the production of a wide variety of metabolites that intimitately interact with the host&#x02019;s epithelial cells and in this way affect health. Whereas it is widely accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of SCFA, protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health. However, the relationship between protein fermentation and gut health has not been thoroughly investigated <xref rid="pone.0052387-Windey1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the present intervention trial that specifically modified protein fermentation we could not establish an association between degree of protein fermentation and markers of gut toxicity.</p><p>Protein intake was estimated from 7-d weighed food records, reported as golden standard <xref rid="pone.0052387-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and validated by urinary biomarkers (urea and total nitrogen). Although several studies report underestimation of protein intake when based on assessment of dietary records <xref rid="pone.0052387-Bokhof1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, we obtained excellent correlation between dietary records and urinary markers. In addition, the agreement between the measured caloric use and the calculated energy intake from the dietary journals suggest that the dietary assessment was reliable. Besides, the dietary intervention successfully modified the degree of protein fermentation as evidenced by the significant positive association between protein intake and urinary p-cresol excretion. In this study, diets were specifically drawn up to modify protein intake and protein fermentation without affecting fat intake and fiber intake. Fat is considered as a potential factor that increases CRC risk due to increased production of secondary bile acids <xref rid="pone.0052387-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Bernstein1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> whereas fiber is considered as a protective factor through the production of SCFA <xref rid="pone.0052387-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The HP diet protein mainly consisted of lean meat, chicken and dairy products (which explains the significantly higher calcium intake during this period). Fat and fiber intake remained similar as compared to the NP diet. The fact that fecal SCFA concentrations remained constant during the intervention confirms that carbohydrate fermentation was not affected. In the LP diet, protein was mainly replaced by digestible carbohydrates to keep the fiber intake constant. Unfortunately, subjects also reduced fat intake.</p><p>The labeled biomarker lactose-[<sup>15</sup>N,<sup> 15</sup>N]-ureide was added to the test meal to evaluate changes in the bacterial ammonia metabolism in the colon due to the intervention. This biomarker is used as a vector to administer a known amount of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> in the colon. Labeled ammonia can be used by the colonic microbiota for their growth and activity and is consequently retrieved in feces. Ammonia that is not taken up by the bacteria is absorbed through the colonic mucosa, converted in the liver to <sup>15</sup>N-urea and excreted in urine <xref rid="pone.0052387-DePreter4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Geboes1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Excretion of <sup>15</sup>N in urine and feces was not different throughout the study suggesting that the changes in protein intake and protein fermentation did not affect colonic bacterial activity. To detect changes in predominant composition of the microbiota, we applied DGGE-analysis on bacterial DNA extracted from fecal samples. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study and animal studies indicate that higher protein or red meat intake shifts the balance of the gut microbiota away from potentially beneficial or health promoting bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria towards a predominance of bacteria like clostridia and Bacteroides sp <xref rid="pone.0052387-Bedani1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0052387-Zentek1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, in our study no bandclasses were found to be different during the different dietary interventions, indicating no effect of the intervention on the composition of the microbiota in the gut.</p><p>In this study, protein intake and protein fermentation were related to genotoxicity and cytotoxicity towards colonic cells. Genotoxic compounds induce genetic damage directly or indirectly by various mechanisms. Compounds which are positive in tests that detect such kinds of damage have the potential to be human carcinogens. Genotoxicity tests have therefore mainly been used to predict carcinogenicity. Cytotoxicity tests measure the potential of compounds to induce cell death. The WST-test used in this study measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Alternative assays are based on assessment of the cell membrane integrity.</p><p>Studies in rats previously showed that increased protein intake and increased protein fermentation were associated with genotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0052387-Toden1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052387-Toden3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Studies in humans are scarce. A recent human study compared fecal water genotoxicity after a high protein weight loss diet (35% protein) and a high carbohydrate weight loss diet (17% protein) <xref rid="pone.0052387-BenassiEvans1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Although a weak correlation was found between urinary p-cresol excretion and DNA damage, the reduction in DNA damage was similar in both groups and was associated to loss of weight irrespective of the diet. It therefore seems that weight loss contributes more to a reduction in fecal water genotoxicity than protein fermentation. In the present human study, protein intake and protein fermentation were not associated with genotoxicity. However, subjects consumed an isocaloric diet throughout the study period which might explain the different results.</p><p>Whereas genotoxicity was not correlated to protein fermentation, cytotoxicity of fecal water, was reduced with increased protein fermentation. Similar results were obtained by Glinghammer <italic>et al.</italic> who compared fecal water genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of a dairy product-rich and a dairy product-free diet. Genotoxicity was not different between both diets, whereas cytotoxicity of the samples from the dairy-product rich diet was reduced (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025). This reduction in cytotoxicity was attributed to calcium present in the diet <xref rid="pone.0052387-Glinghammar1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The diary product-rich diet also resulted in a significantly higher protein intake compared to the dairy product-free diet (91 g/d versus 60 g/d; p&#x0003c;0.001). Unfortunately no parameters of protein fermentation were evaluated. As the protein intake during the HP diet was partially achieved by increasing dairy product, calcium intake was significantly higher as compared to the NP and LP diet. Therefore it is likely that the lower cytotoxicity observed should be attributed to a higher calcium intake rather than to an increased protein intake. The positive effect of calcium on cytotoxicity was directly assessed in a 12-week oral calcium-supplementation study were fecal water cytotoxicity was also reduced <xref rid="pone.0052387-Welberg1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This effect was explained by the precipitation of bile acids and fatty acids. We analyzed fecal metabolite profiles to clarify the relation between intestinal bacterial metabolites and parameters of gut health. Identified VOC were alcohols, ketones, terpenes, esters, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, sulfur- and nitrogen compounds. The complex metabolic pathways for microbial VOC formation are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052387-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Most information on microbial VOC arises from environmental studies that used those compounds as indicators of biocontamination. Since the 1990s, microbial VOC have been analyzed in indoor air to detect hidden microbial growth and have been related to health risks such as eye and upper respiratory tract irritation <xref rid="pone.0052387-Korpi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0052387-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052387.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Main metabolic pathways for the production of microbial metabolites.</title><p>VOC are shown in bold <xref rid="pone.0052387-Welberg1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0052387.g006"/></fig><p>By clustering metabolite profiles according to genotoxicity or cytotoxicity we identified a number of metabolites that were significantly associated with genotoxicity or cytotoxicity. As surprisingly little is known about VOC produced by intestinal microbiota, it is extremely difficult to assign individual components to specific bacteria and to estimate the relevance to gut health of individual colonic compounds. In addition, many compounds also have other environmental sources than microbial metabolism (e.g. diet composition) and do not only originate from bacteria <xref rid="pone.0052387-Korpi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In a recent study in mice, 179 metabolites were identified in the colonic luminal metabolome of which 131 were common to those detected in the chow of the animals <xref rid="pone.0052387-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Nevertheless, a number of sulfides, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide and methyl propyl disulfide, appeared to be associated with genotoxicity in our study. This was confirmed in the MANOVA-analysis, which identified higher concentrations of dimethyl disulfide in the samples with high genotoxicity. Sulfides are produced from fermentation of the sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine, but also originate from mucines or food-derived sulfate <xref rid="pone.0052387-Florin1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Although it was previously shown that dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation in the colon <xref rid="pone.0052387-Magee1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, our results suggest a considerable contribution from other sources of sulfur as well. For example western diets have been reported to be high in sulfate <xref rid="pone.0052387-Florin1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Also allyl acetate was positively associated with genotoxicity. Allyl acetate is a precursor of the known toxic compound acrolein. In rats a daily dose of 100 mg allyl acetate/kg caused hemorrhage, inflammation and epithelial necrosis in the large and small intestine <xref rid="pone.0052387-Auerbach1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Heptanal, 1-octanol and the medium chain fatty acids most likely originate from fatty acid metabolism. Their association with genotoxicity and cytotoxicity could be explained by their generation during lipid peroxidation. Possibly, they rather result from toxicity instead of causing toxicity. Surprisingly, also the SCFA, propionic acid, was associated to cytotoxicity. In vitro cytotoxicity studies in different cell lines showed that propionic acid induces cytotoxicity through a mechanism of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0052387-Sakurazawa1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the results obtained in this study do not provide evidence for a role of protein fermentation in gut toxicity in healthy human subjects. On the other hand, we were able to identify several metabolites that possibly play a role in colonic genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. However, more research is needed on the actual source of these metabolites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0052387.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
