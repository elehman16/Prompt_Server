Its role has been appreciated in the manifestation of serious diseases like ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke etc. These lifestyle diseases are a result of lifestyle factors such as overnutrition etc., which have been referred to as the <italic>Santarpanjanya Vyadhis</italic> in the classical texts. <italic>Mustadi Ghanavti</italic> is a modified form of the classical formulation <italic>Mustadi Kwath</italic> that has been advocated by Acharya Charaka for the management of <italic>Santarpanjanya Vikaras</italic>. This placebo-controlled randomized trial of <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> was carried out on 61 patients suffering from hyperlipidemia; of the 61 patients, 50 completed the entire course of treatment. The results of the study revealed that <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> decreased serum cholesterol by 22.4%, serum triglycerides by 19.6%, serum LDL by 18.2%, and serum VLDL by 4.2%; serum HDL increased by 5.6%. Thus <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> was able to effect a total improvement of 58.8% in the lipid profile. It brought about mild improvement in 42.86% of patients and moderate improvement in 14.28% of patients. <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> was also found to have a significant effect on other subjective as well as objective parameters considered for the study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hyperlipidemia</kwd><kwd><italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic></kwd><kwd>placebo-controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The growing challenges of modernization have resulted in human beings readjusting their customary behavior by modifying their dietary and lifestyle preferences. Fast foods, lack of exercise, stress, and various addictions are some of the factors which are adversely impacting the lifestyle of man in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This has resulted in a discrepancy between the external environment and man's internal mechanism, leading to a multitude of diseases, mainly due to impaired metabolism; these are popularly referred to as lifestyle diseases. Hyperlipidemia is one such disorder. It has been identified as a potential risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, the metabolic syndrome, and hypertension.</p><p>Hyperlipidemia is defined as the presence of raised or abnormal levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Hyperlipidemia has drawn worldwide interest for its ability to participate in the pathology of atherosclerotic diseases like coronary heart disease (CHD), which is an important cause of morbidity and mortality the world over. Hyperlipidemia is term used to denote raised serum levels of cholesterol or triglycerides or both. The lipid hypothesis proposed by Rudolph Virchow in 1856 suggested that blood lipid accumulation in arterial walls caused atherosclerosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In 1913, a study by Anitschkow showed that feeding rabbits cholesterol could induce symptoms similar to atherosclerosis, suggesting a role for cholesterol in atherogenesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Since then raised levels of cholesterol and triglycerides have been identified as the prime modifiable risk factors in atherosclerotic disease. Globally, raised cholesterol is estimated to be responsible for 18% of cerebrovascular disease and 56% of ischemic heart disease. Overall, these diseases accounts for about 4.4 million deaths (7.9% of the total) and 40.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) (2.8% of the total).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Raised total cholesterol, being a risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke, is a major cause of the disease burden in both the developed and developing world.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Also, after controlling for LDL and HDL cholesterol, increased serum levels of triglycerides have been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>There is no precise term for hyperlipidemia in the Ayurvedic classics. Yet various scholars have tried use distinct nomenclature for hyperlipidemia, e.g., <italic>Rasagata Sneha Vriddhi, Rasa Raktagata Sneha Vriddhi, Medovriddhi, Medoroga</italic> or <italic>Medodosha, Ama Medo Dhatu</italic>, etc. A detailed study of hyperlipidemia reveals its similarity to <italic>Asthayi Medo Dhatu Vriddhi</italic> with regard to the pathophysiology. Also, this excessively increased <italic>Asthayi Medo Dhatu</italic> is <italic>Ama</italic> in nature, due to which it is retained in the body for a longer time, resulting in further complications.</p><p>From the Ayurvedic point of view hyperlipidemia is a result of <italic>Santarpana</italic>. Acharya Charaka has stated that regular administration of <italic>Mustadi Kwath</italic> as a formulation can cure all the <italic>Santarpanjanya Vyadhis</italic> or diseases due to overnutrition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Considering the lack of definite Ayurveda comprehension of hyperlipdemia, as well as the role of hyperlipidemia in the causation life-threatening diseases, we carried out this study to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Mustadi Ghana Vati</italic> in the management of hyperlipidemia. The classical formulation of <italic>Mustadi Kwatha</italic> was modified and made into a <italic>Ghanavati</italic> form for better efficacy and patient compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Patients fulfilling the criteria and attending the OPD and IPD of the Department of Kayachikitsa, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Hospital, Jamnagar, were selected for the present study irrespective of age, sex, religion, etc. A detailed proforma was specially designed encompassing all the aspects of the disease to collect the data.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Diagnostic criteria</title><p>Patients were diagnosed on the basis of the lipid profile.

In the <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> group, a 55-year-old female patient complained of loose motions with severe abdominal cramps. This was confirmed with a positive challenge test to be the result of drug administration. On further evaluation of the cause it was noted that the patient had a <italic>Pitta Pradhana Prakriti</italic> along with <italic>Mridu Koshta</italic>, displaying a history of loose motions after intake of milk and milk products or raisins. The formulation <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> contains <italic>Aragvadha</italic> and <italic>Triphala</italic>, which are known <italic>Virechana</italic> drugs and might have served as a stimulus for <italic>Mridu Koshtha</italic>, initiating the loose motions with and abdominal cramps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Thus, <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> is a true drug possessing pharmacological activity. All the patients in both the groups followed strict dietary restrictions as well as lifestyle changes. Therefore, the difference between the two groups can be attributed to the pharmacological efficacy of the drug (along with some benefit from the dietary and lifestyle changes). The above findings are consistent with the <italic>Ama Pachana, Lekhana</italic>, and <italic>Upashoshana</italic> properties of the drug, which result in the reduction of <italic>Anga Gaurava, GatRasada, Alasya, Nidradhikya, Snigdhangata, Angachalatva</italic>, and <italic>Swedadhikya</italic>. Reduction in <italic>Anga Gaurava, Anga Chalatva, Kshudra Shvasa</italic>, and <italic>Sandhishoola</italic> can also be attributed to the loss of body weight caused by the administration of <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati. Atipipasa</italic> may be reduced because of the <italic>Trishnanigrahana</italic> property of <italic>Musta. Atikshudha</italic> was seen to decrease to a greater extent in the placebo group. Placebo provides psychological relief in patients hence some symptoms of the disease are seen to decrease as a result of it.</p><p><italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> was not seen to be successful in reversing the dyslipidaemic changes in the patients, which may be due to relatively short duration of the therapy, change in the method of preparation of the classical formulation, failure of patients to follow dietary and lifestyle changes, chronicity of the disease, stress, etc.</p><p>Serum cholesterol was found to rise in some patients on starting drug therapy and dietary restrictions. This may be because of excessive endogenous production of cholesterol in the body in response to the decreased dietary supply. Serum triglycerides showed a better response to <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> than serum cholesterol; the response however was not significant, which may be due to the fact that The stored triglyceride in our body is changed every 2-3 weeks due to its constant synthesis and utilization, whereas it takes a longer duration to work on cholesterol.</p><p><italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> showed better results on other objective parameters related to obesity (i.e., body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, body circumferences, and skin-fold thickness), which shows its depletory action on <italic>Sthayi Medo Dhatu</italic>.</p><p>In this study we also observed that the patients who shed their excess weight during the course of study showed better improvement in their lipid profiles as compared to the patients whose weight remained constant. Thus, a relationship can be established between obesity and hyperlipidemia, which is in accordance with the <italic>Poshya Poshaka Meda Dhatu</italic> relationship described in Ayurveda.</p><p>Thus, <italic>Mustadi Ghanavti</italic> was seen to reduce the levels of &#x02018;bad&#x02019; cholesterol (serum LDL) and increase the levels of &#x02018;good&#x02019; cholesterol (serum HDL), thereby correcting dyslipidemia. HDL is known to have protective action against atherosclerosis and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Probable mode of action of <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic></title><p>The total effect of the <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> is <italic>Tridosha Shamaka</italic>, especially <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic>. It is <italic>Tikta, Kashaya</italic>, and <italic>Katu</italic> in <italic>Rasa; Laghu</italic> and <italic>Ruksha</italic> in <italic>Guna</italic>; and <italic>Katu</italic> in <italic>Vipaka</italic>; and thus pacifies the vitiated <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>, which is dominant in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia. It also depletes the excessively produced <italic>Rasa, Mamsa, Meda, Vasa, Sweda</italic>, and <italic>Kleda</italic>, which are all similar in attributes to <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>. It should be noted here that one of the ways of synthesis of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> in the body is as a <italic>Mala</italic> of <italic>Rasa Dhatu</italic>. Similarly, <italic>Sweda</italic> is the <italic>Mala</italic> of <italic>Meda Dhatu</italic>. Thus, it is known to act against the <italic>Santarpanottha</italic> pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia. <italic>Aragvadha</italic> and <italic>Triphala</italic> have mild purgative action, which causes <italic>Anulomana</italic> of <italic>Vayu</italic> which further corrects the body <italic>Vayu</italic>, bringing an end to the <italic>Vatapradhana Samprapti</italic>. Drugs like <italic>Patha</italic> and <italic>Gokshur</italic> are <italic>Mutravirechana</italic>, which bring about diuresis and thus relieves the body of the excess of <italic>Kleda. Aragvadha, Kutaj, Patha, Nimba, Khadir, Haridra</italic>, and <italic>Daruharidra</italic> are known to act on <italic>Medo Dhatu</italic> and allied <italic>Dhatus</italic> and are indicated in diseases like <italic>Kushtha, Medo Roga</italic>, and <italic>Prameha</italic>. Hyperlipidaemia has the vitiation of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> and <italic>Rasa, Mamsa, Meda, Vasa, Sweda</italic> which as <italic>Dushyas</italic>. Involvement of the same <italic>Doshas</italic> and <italic>Dushyas</italic> is seen in the pathology of the diseases like <italic>Medoroga, Prameha</italic> and <italic>Kushtha</italic>. Hence <italic>Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> which is indicated in <italic>Santarpanajanya</italic> diseases like <italic>Medoroga, Prameha</italic> and <italic>Kushtha</italic> can be used in the treatment of Hyperlipidaemia. These drugs relieve the body of excess of <italic>Kapha, Meda, Kleda, Vasa</italic>, and <italic>Sweda</italic> by diminishing their <italic>Drava Guna</italic>. Drugs like <italic>Neem, Patha</italic>, and <italic>Triphala</italic> bring about augmentation of the digestive fire, leading to proper formation of the <italic>Rasadi Dhatus. Patha, Musta, Triphala, Haridra</italic>, and <italic>Daruharidra</italic> digest the <italic>Ama Dosha</italic> present at the <italic>Jatharagni</italic> level as well as the <italic>Medodhatvagni</italic> level. Also drugs like <italic>Triphala</italic> and <italic>Khadir</italic> are <italic>Rasayana</italic> in nature, leading to the formation of optimal <italic>Dhatus</italic>, and thereby protect the body from injury due to vitiated <italic>Doshas</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hyperlipidemia can be treated on the principles of <italic>Apatarpana</italic> and by following the line of treatment of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> or <italic>Prameha</italic> since all the three arise due to <italic>Medo Dushti. Mustadi Ghanavati</italic> showed a better result on all the subjective and objective parameters than placebo. Dietary and lifestyle changes are supportive to therapy in hyperlipidaemia and obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 3rd Febuary, 2009</date-in-citation><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Virchow</surname></name><name><surname>Rudolph</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Phlogose und Thrombose im Gef&#x000e4;ssystem</article-title><source>Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur wissenschaftlichen Medizin</source><year>1856</year><publisher-loc>Germany</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Staatsdruckerei Frankfurt</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anitschkow</surname><given-names>NN</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatalov</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>&#x000dc;ber experimentelle Cholesterinsteatose und ihre Bedeutung f&#x000fc;r die Entstehung einiger pathologischer Prozesse</article-title><source>Zentralbl Allg Pathol</source><year>1913</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>The World Health Report</article-title><source>Reducing risks, promoting healthy life</source><year>2002</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ezzati</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lopez</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vander Hoorn</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of disease</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2002</year><volume>360</volume><fpage>1347</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12423980</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence that triglycerides are an independent coronary heart disease risk factor</article-title><source>American J Cardiology</source><year>2000</year><volume>86</volume><fpage>943</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><name><surname>Dash</surname><given-names>VB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Agnivesha,Charaka Samhita Text with English Translation &#x00026; Critical Exposition Based on Chakrapanidatta's &#x02018;Ayurveda Dipika&#x02019;</article-title><source>Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series</source><year>2002</year><edition>7th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Sutra Sthana</publisher-name><fpage>122</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>American Journal of Lifestyle</article-title><year>2008</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>51</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref9"><label>9</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>QJM Advance Access originally published online on February 27, 2006</article-title><source>QJM</source><year>2006</year><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 28th March, 2008</date-in-citation><volume>99</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>277</fpage><lpage>287</lpage><comment>doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcl027</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16504986</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref10"><label>10</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 12th December, 2008</date-in-citation><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage</uri></comment></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
