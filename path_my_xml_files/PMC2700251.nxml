Bioabsorbable stents are discussed as a means to combine mechanical prevention of vessel recoil with the advantages of long-term perspectives. The possibility of not having a permanent metallic implant could permit the occurrence of positive remodeling with lumen enlargement to compensate for the development of new lesions. The present study was designed to investigate the safety of absorbable metal stents (AMSs) in the infrapopliteal arteries based on 1- and 6-month clinical follow-up and efficacy based on 6-month angiographic patency. One hundred seventeen patients with 149 lesions with chronic limb ischemia (CLI) were randomized to implantation of an AMS (60 patients, 74 lesions) or stand-alone percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; 57 patients, 75 lesions). Seven PTA-group patients &#x0201c;crossed over&#x0201d; to AMS stenting. The study population consisted of patients with symptomatic CLI (Rutherford categories 4 and 5) and de novo stenotic (&#x0003e;50%) or occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the infrapopliteal arteries who presented with a reference diameter of between 3.0 and 3.5&#x000a0;mm and a lesion length of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;mm. The primary safety endpoint was defined as absence of major amputation and/or death within 30&#x000a0;days after index intervention and the primary efficacy endpoint was the 6-month angiographic patency rate as confirmed by core-lab quantitative vessel analysis. The 30-day complication rate was 5.3% (3/57) and 5.0% (3/60) in patients randomized for PTA alone and PTA followed by AMS implantation, respectively. On an intention-to-treat basis, the 6-month angiographic patency rate for lesions treated with AMS (31.8%) was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.013) than the rate for those treated with PTA (58.0%). Although the present study indicates that the AMS technology can be safely applied, it did not demonstrate efficacy in long-term patency over standard PTA in the infrapopliteal vessels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Critical limb ischemia</kwd><kwd>Absorbable stent</kwd><kwd>Stent</kwd><kwd>Angioplasty</kwd><kwd>Revascularization</kwd><kwd>Peripheral artery disease</kwd><kwd>Below the knee</kwd><kwd>Infrapopliteal</kwd><kwd>Crural</kwd><kwd>Limb salvage</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) 2009</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last years, a gradual change in treatment strategy for critical limb ischemia (CLI) has been observed: the endovascular approach has become more and more accepted as a valid alternative for surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The BASIL trial participants played a pivotal role in this shift toward the minimal invasive approach for patients with CLI due to infrainguinal disease. They were the first to publish results of a controlled, randomized study comparing bypass surgery results to those of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in CLI patients that yielded similar outcomes for both treatments, with angioplasty being the less expensive alternative in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The latter resulted in the statement in the renewed TASC-II guidelines that there is increasing evidence to support a recommendation for PTA in patients with CLI and infrapopliteal artery occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the use of stents is common in other peripheral vessels, the application of stents in the infrapopliteal bed remains highly controversial. The fear that early thrombosis and late luminal loss due to intimal hyperplasia formation potentially lead to insufficient long-term patency rates can explain the reluctance on implanting stents in these small-diameter vessels. Although the limited evidence available suggests very acceptable outcomes using either passive coated stents (PCSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], balloon-expandable drug-eluting stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], or self-expanding nitinol stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], target lesion revascularization (TLR) is still required in a significant percentage of patients to enable limb salvage. The permanent presence of an artificial implant is believed to be the potential trigger for late restenosis. Recently the stenting technology has moved toward the development of temporary implants composed of biocompatible materials which mechanically support the vessel during the period of high risk for recoil and then completely degrade on the long-term perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, bioabsorbable stents are discussed as a means to combine mechanical prevention of vessel recoil with various advantages of the long-term perspective compared to permanent implants, including the possibility of late outward vessel remodeling, and improved reintervention options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The bioabsorbable magnesium-alloy stent developed by BIOTRONIK AG was the first of its kind for which it was proven that it could be implanted safely in infrapopliteal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and human coronary arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and that it was absorbed in the intended time frame. In the absorbable metal stent (AMS) below-the-knee study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Bosiers et al. presented the first clinical results using AMSs for treatment of infrapopliteal lesions in 20 patients with CLI. After 6&#x000a0;months, the resulting values for primary clinical patency and limb salvage indicated a promising performance for the treatment of below-the-knee lesions in CLI patients. Moreover, in the PROGRESS-AMS study the authors proved that bioabsorbable magnesium stents can achieve immediate angiographic results similar to the results with other permanent metal stents and is safely degraded after 4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in native coronary artery single de novo lesions.</p><p>Based on these findings, the study was set up to give further proof of AMS safety and efficacy for the treatment of CLI, and the AMS INSIGHT (Bioabsorbable Metal Stent Investigation in Chronic Limb Ischemia Treatment) randomized controlled trial was initiated. Therefore, in this article, safety results based on 1- and 6-month clinical follow-up and efficacy data based on 6-month angiographic results for the AMS INSIGHT in patients with CLI are presented and discussed (see Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> for a complete list of authors and their contributions).

The first-generation AMS is a balloon-expandable, tubular laser slotted, electropolished stent made of a bioabsorbable magnesium (Mg) alloy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The first-generation AMS design is a special one that takes into consideration the specific mechanical properties of the bioabsorbable Mg alloy. The mechanical properties of the Mg stent are similar to those of permanent stainless-steel stents, including a high collapse pressure (0.8&#x000a0;bar), low elastic recoil (&#x0003c;8%), and minimum amount of shortening after inflation (&#x0003c;5%). The stents (10, 15, and 20&#x000a0;mm in length; 3.0 and 3.5&#x000a0;mm in diameter), premounted on a low-compliance fast-exchange delivery balloon catheter, were deployed after predilatation of the lesion. The two radio-opaque markers on the balloon ends were used for precise positioning since the AMS itself is not visible under fluoroscopy. The delivery system is compatible with guiding catheters with an inner diameter of at least 0.07 in. (1.78&#x000a0;mm). Magnesium was chosen as the main alloy component because of its hypothrombogenic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and good predictable local tissue tolerance. Additionally, the mechanical properties and corrosion of Mg alloy are controllable under physiologic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and match the high requirements for bioabsorbable stent implants.</p><p>The Pleon Explorer fast-exchange balloon catheter, used for the angioplasty arm (PTA group) and for lesion predilation in the stenting group, is designed for dilatation of stenotic segments in infrapopliteal arteries. The balloon has the same dimensions as the AMS (10, 15, and 20&#x000a0;mm in length and &#x003d5;3.0 and &#x003d5;3.5&#x000a0;mm in diameter). The working length of the Pleon Explorer balloon catheter is 140&#x000a0;cm. The inner distal lumen permits the use of guidewires of diameter 0.014 in. to facilitate advancement of the catheter to and through the lesions to be dilated. The Pleon Explorer balloon catheter is compatible with either coronary guiding catheters with an inner diameter of&#x000a0;&#x02265;0.056 in. (1.42&#x000a0;mm) or introducers with a minimal size of 5 Fr and length of 45&#x000a0;cm or 90&#x000a0;cm for antegrade or crossover procedure, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedural Description</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to and treated with either PTA or AMS implantation. The randomization list was generated using PROC PLAN of SAS (Statistical Analysis Software). Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes contained information on the treatment to be applied. The sealed envelopes were opened only after the lesion was successfully crossed with the guidewire, and then patients were allocated either to stent or to PTA alone.</p><p>Vascular access was achieved, and all inflow-limiting lesions were treated according to the investigator&#x02019;s standard clinical practice. Before lesion treatment, diagnostic angiography of the lesion area and distal runoff were performed. A long sheath or guiding catheter was used to advance the interventional catheters for the Pleon Explorer fast-exchange balloon catheter or the AMS delivery system.</p><p>In patients randomized to stenting, after measurement and then selection of a suitable balloon length, the lesion was predilated with the Pleon Explorer balloon under angiographic control. Predilatation was mandatory in this study. After dilatation, the stenosed area was treated by one AMS implant. Postdilatation was allowed at the discretion of the physician, for cases where angiographic control revealed suboptimal apposition of the AMS to the vessel wall or flow-limiting residual stenosis.</p><p>In patients randomized to PTA, the lesion was dilated with the Pleon Explorer balloon under angiographic control. In cases in which the residual stenosis after procedure was estimated to be&#x000a0;&#x0003e;50%, balloon inflation was repeated and prolonged.

Finally, the identical imaging parameters were set and considered for the 6-month follow-up DSA control.</p><p>CFDU was performed at screening, before hospital discharge, and at scheduled 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits and any interim visit. Each examination comprised measurements of the maximum peak systolic velocity (PSV) 1&#x000a0;cm proximal to the lesion (&#x0201c;prestenotic&#x0201d;), within the lesion (&#x0201c;intrastenotic&#x0201d;), and 1&#x000a0;cm distal to the lesion (&#x0201c;poststenotic&#x0201d;). The ratio of the maximum intrastenotic PSV to the maximum prestenotic PSV (proximal peak velocity ratio PVR<sub>proximal</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;PSV<sub>intrastenotic</sub>/PSV<sub>prestenotic</sub>) determined the percentage stenosis by means of a look-up table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

We assumed at 6&#x000a0;months a patency rate of 50% in the PTA arm and a clinical relevance effect of 25% in the AMS arm. With acceptance of a 10% dropout rate, a crossover rate of 30% in the PTA arm, a two-sided significance level &#x003b1; of 0.05, and 80% statistical power, a total of 117 patients were required.</p><p>Descriptive data summaries were used to present and summarize the collected study data. For categorical variables (e.g., gender), frequency distribution and cross tabulation were considered. For numeric variables (e.g., patient age), minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated. For all variables a 95% confidence interval for the relevant parameters of the underlying distribution were calculated. To show superiority regarding safety and efficacy endpoints of AMS over PTA alone, life tables according to the method of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier are presented for all time-dependent events. To test differences in the cumulative survival probabilities between the study groups, the log-rank test was performed. To show statistical difference for the non-time-dependent variables, a <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for continuous variables. In the case of nonnormally distributed variables, a Wilcoxon test and, in the case of dichotomuous variables, a Fisher exact test were performed. Data were analyzed according to both &#x0201c;intention to treat&#x0201d; (ITT), i.e., the initial randomization schedule and &#x0201c;on-treatment&#x0201d; (OT), i.e., the actual treatment received.

These patients were included in the PTA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;AMS group, which is not considered in the OT data analysis in this paper. One patient randomized for stenting (1/60) with a double lesion (2/74) underwent implantation of a nonstudy stent (self-expanding) due to severe tortuosity of the iliac artery. Therefore, this patient is not considered in the OT analysis. The final OT cohort consisted of 50 patients with 64 lesions treated with PTA only and 59 patients with 72 lesions who underwent implantation of the study stent. Therefore, ITT procedural success, which was based on visual assessment, was achieved in 60 of 60 patients in the AMS group (100%) and in 55 of 57 patients for the PTA group (96.4%). For one PTA lesion, data on procedural success were not provided by the investigator. In a conservative manner, this patient was considered a nonsuccess. The OT procedural success was 96.0% (48/50) and 100% (59/59) of patients in the PTA and AMS arms, respectively.

Earlier investigations have shown that the BIOTRONIK AG-developed bioabsorbable Mg-alloy stent is safe for use in infrapopliteal vessels and that it performed as intended. This study has succeeded in proving the safety of AMS technology (primary safety endpoint). The 30-day complication rate, as defined by the occurrence of major amputation and/or death, of patients treated with AMS (ITT, 5.0%) was not significantly different (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.0) from the rate fr those treated with PTA alone (ITT, 5.3%).</p><p>Although the safety of the AMS technology has been shown, this study failed to prove the efficacy of the tested first-generation AMS. The results of the core-lab QVA even show that the 6-month outcome of PTA followed by AMS implantation does not equal the outcome after PTA alone. On n ITT basis the 6-month angiographic patency rate was significantly inferior (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.013) for lesions treated with AMS (31.8%) compared to those treated with PTA alone (58.0%).</p><p>To date, only limited comparative QVA data for below-the-knee arteries are available in the literature. The 6-month binary restenosis rate after AMS was 68.2% (ITT), which is higher than restenosis rates published by Siablis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Scheinert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]comparing the effect of bare metal stents (BMSs) versus drug-eluting stents in the infrapopliteal bed. Siablis et al. reported a 55.3% binary restenosis rate 6&#x000a0;months after BMS and 4.0% after Sirolimus Eluting Stent implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while Scheinert et al. found a 6-month binary restenosis rate of 39.1% after coronary-type BMS and 0% after drug-eluting stent implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a single-arm controlled study published by Bosiers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a 12-month binary restenosis rate of 20.45% was seen after the implantation of nitinol self-expanding stents in the same bed. The 6-month binary restenosis rate of the PTA control arm of the AMS INSIGHT (ITT, 42.0%) scores within the range of the published data for coronary-type BMS in the infrapopliteal region: 55.3% by Siablis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and 39.1% by Scheinert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, postprocedural MLD was seen to be 2.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.4&#x000a0;mm in the patient cohort receiving first-generation AMSs either &#x003d5;3.0 or &#x003d5;3.5&#x000a0;mm in diameter. The low postprocedural MLD might be attributed to the inadeaquate radial force of the first-generation AMS to withstand the initial vessel recoil.</p><p>As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, there is a significant difference in the outcomes based on CFDU versus angiography (QVA). It was seen that there is no correspondence between the outcomes of both investigation methods. The untransformed values correlate significantly (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.69, <italic>p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;</italic>&#x000a0;0.001), but the Bland-Altman plot reveals a systematic overestimation by CFDU. Both methods differ significantly in their mean values (mean difference&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11.6). A significant number of patients diagnosed by CFDU to have&#x000a0;&#x0003c;50% restenosis (PVR&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2.4) were observed to have significant restenosis measured by angiography. Other lesions with CFDU values indicating significant restenosis were shown to be well patent on angiographic core-lab control. Therefore it was decided to add a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimation of primary patency based on the angiographic findings as provided by the core lab. A similar angiographic primary patency curve was first published by Siablis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] after the initiation of the AMS INSIGHT and has been used in different publications since then [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Two recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] confirmed our finding that, although there is good agreement between CFDU and angiography in lower limb artery disease in general, there is only poor agreement in infrapopliteal regions.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Color flow Dopper ultrasound (CFDU) and quantitative vessel analysis patency correlation.

The 6-month angiographic patency rate for the PTA (ITT, 61.2%) group is higher than the one published by Rand et al., which was only 45.6% for the PTA-only group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The 6-month angiographic primary patency of the AMS (ITT, 47.2%) is well below the rates published for permanent balloon-expandable stent types in the crural arteries. A 6-month angiographic patency rate of 68.1% after BMS was found by Siablis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and 79.7% was found by Rand et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] after PCS.</p><p>As could be expected the limb salvage rates in the AMS trial are within the range of previously published studies on infrapopliteal endovascular interventions. In general, the 6-month limb salvage rates are far higher than according patency values and mostly lie at about 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It could be understood that a nonhealing wound or viable limb does not require a full 6-month patency or reperfusion time to generate optimal healing or symptom relief. It is believed that, in combination with restarting the patient&#x02019;s daily life activities, an approximate reperfusion lasting about 3&#x000a0;months would be sufficient for 6-month limb salvage. Nevertheless, long-term limb salvage undoubtedly benefits from extended patency of the treated lesion.</p><p>The findings from the AMS INSIGHT did not support the positive clinical outcome of the initial AMS findings in a small cohort of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and indicate that the current-generation stent does not meet the efficacy criteria. Therefore, the stent needs to be improved and re-evaluated before commercial use can be an option. The following criteria are believed to cause the problem. In the AMS INSIGHT, core-lab QVA showed a discrepancy between inclusion criteria and available stent sizes. The reference vessel diameter in the AMS randomized group was 2.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.5 (range, 1.5&#x02013;4.4) mm. Therefore, many lesions were too small in diameter and longer than the stent length. Hence, the lesion did not match the available nominal AMS sizes. It is possible that oversizing causing vessel trauma was the case. A small magnification error due to the ruler on the table can only partially explain the observed mismatch. New sizes and longer lengths for AMSs should be developed for below-the-knee use. This first-generation AMS is probably being absorbed too fast, inducing loss of stent scaffolding properties. The AMS PROGRESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] coronary study suggested fast degradation that initiated immediately after deployment, with nearly fully absorption after 4&#x000a0;months. Thus the restenosis in the AMS group can be attributed to early recoil in addition to neointima formation. To improve clinical results with the AMS technology, a second-generation AMS is under development, with optimization of the Mg alloy and the stent design resulting in a longer degradation time and increased radial force and stent sizes should be better adapted to peripheral lesions.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The major limitation of the AMS INSIGHT was the selection of a CFDU investigation to determine the primary patency. During the course of the trial, it was discovered and evidence was obtained on hand that CFDU has only limited relevance in the diagnosis of infrapopliteal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it was decided during data analysis to use angiographic primary patency as the main comparator with other trials.</p><p>A second limitation of the trial might be the initially very strict angiographic inclusion criteria. It was decided, in order to have a good match with the limited length variations of the available AMS devices (the initial maximal stent length was 15&#x000a0;mm; later, 20-mm-long stents also became available) and to have each lesion covered by maximally one stent, to limit the maximal lesion length to 15&#x000a0;mm initially and to 20&#x000a0;mm later. Furthermore, it was decided to include only patients with a maximum of two lesions in one or more infrapopliteal vessel. As the majority of CLI patients represent with complex multilevel disease, it was the experience of the different investigators that these criteria allowed the inclusion of only a very restricted number of patients, not accurately reflecting the real-world CLI population. Therefore it was decided to amend the protocol and also allow the PTA treatment of other infrapopliteal lesions in nontarget vessels outside of the current study.</p><p>Third, repeated angiographic imaging could not be obtained in 34% of the study population. Similar high dropout rates have been published in other CLI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and can be considered acceptable for this fragile population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The AMS INSIGHT has shown that the AMS technology is a safe technique to use for treating peripheral arterial disease, but that the tested current-generation AMS did not show efficacy in long-term patency over standard PTA in infrapopliteal vessels. Therefore, important stent design modifications are required and further clinical trials should be performed before potential widespread application of the technology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors take great pleasure in thanking the staff of the Flanders Medical Research Program (www.fmrp.be), with special regards to Koen De Meester for performing the systematic review of the literature and providing substantial support in the data analysis and the writing of the article.
