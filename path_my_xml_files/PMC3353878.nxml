Some COCs are available in a 24/4-day regimen (24 days of active hormonal intake followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval); although 24/4-day regimen COCs have been shown to provide more sustained ovarian suppression and reduced hormonal fluctuations compared with 21/7-day regimens,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> they still follow the traditional 28-day cycle paradigm.

With such regimens, users do not experience a monthly withdrawal bleed because the active hormonal intake period is extended, resulting in fewer hormone-free intervals. Fixed extended regimen COCs may be appealing to the not insubstantial proportion of women who would welcome a reduction in the frequency of their menstrual bleeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Unfortunately, fixed extended regimen COCs are not currently available outside of the USA.</p><p>Given the interest that women have in reducing and also being able to control when they have their menstrual bleeding, it was considered that a regimen of ethinylestradiol (EE) 20 &#x003bc;g/drospirenone (DRSP) 3 mg that extended beyond the conventional 28 days and that enabled the management of intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding (MIB), which can occur with fixed extended regimen COCs, would be appealing. The objective of this 2-year study was to compare the safety and tolerability of EE/DRSP in a flexible extended regimen with MIB (&#x02018;flexible<sub>MIB</sub>&#x02019;) with EE/DRSP in a conventional 28-day or a fixed extended regimen. The efficacy, bleeding data and 1-year safety of the three regimens has been reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> This paper focuses on the safety and tolerability over 2 years. In addition, a separate analysis was conducted to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in women receiving the fixed extended regimen relative to the conventional regimen. This was because it has been reported that bone loss can occur during the use of depot contraceptives containing medroxyprogesterone acetate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> which has been speculated to be the result of prolonged ovarian suppression leading to reduced ovarian estradiol production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group study conducted between December 2005 (first subject, first visit) and October 2008 (last subject, last visit) at 37 centres in Canada, Germany and The Netherlands (protocol number, 308683; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00266032).</p><p>The study was conducted in two phases. In the comparative phase, women were randomly allocated to receive one of three different regimens of EE/DRSP for 1 year: a flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, a conventional 28-day regimen or a fixed extended regimen. In order to provide long-term safety data for the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, all subjects who completed the comparative phase of the study were eligible to participate in a 1-year safety extension phase. During the safety extension phase, the majority of women received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen. There was, however, a small number of women (<italic>n</italic>=28) on the fixed extended and conventional regimens who remained on their respective first-year regimens in order to assess BMD and bone markers.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

With the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, women received EE/DRSP for a flexible number of cycles. Tablets were taken for at least 24 days (&#x02018;mandatory phase&#x02019;); in this manner, the minimum cycle length was 28 days and the design of the COC was based on the approved and marketed conventional 24/4-day regimen of EE 20 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg (YAZ<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals). After the mandatory phase, the cycle could continue up to a maximum of 120 consecutive days (i.e. for a maximum cycle length of 124 days). During Days 25&#x02013;120 (&#x02018;flexible phase&#x02019;), women were instructed to have a 4-day tablet-free interval if bleeding and/or spotting occurred for three consecutive days. The 4-day tablet-free interval was to be taken after no more than 120 days of continuous tablet intake. After a 4-day tablet-free interval, a new cycle with a minimum of 24 days and a maximum of 120 days of tablet intake was initiated.</p><p>For the conventional 28-day regimen, women received EE/DRSP for 13 cycles. Each cycle comprised 24 days of active hormonal intake followed by 4 days of placebo tablets (hormone-free interval) to induce withdrawal bleeding.</p><p>For the fixed extended regimen, women received EE/DRSP for three cycles. Each cycle comprised 120 days of uninterrupted active hormonal intake, regardless of any bleeding/spotting, followed by a 4-day tablet-free interval to induce withdrawal bleeding.</p><p>All women who completed the comparative phase of the study were eligible to participate in the safety extension phase. Women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen in the comparative phase continued to do so in the safety extension phase. All women on the other two regimens, except those participating in the analysis investigating BMD and bone markers, were allowed to switch to the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen for the safety extension phase.</p><p>Full details regarding how study medication was dispensed, when it was started and guidelines regarding study drug intake are reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study variables</title><p>The primary and secondary efficacy variables are defined and reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Safety was evaluated by assessing adverse events (AEs), general physical and gynaecological findings (including the outcomes of cervical smear tests), laboratory variables, vital signs and body weight. A separate safety analysis of the effects of treatment on endometrial characteristics (histology and thickness), ovarian morphology, metabolic parameters and hormone levels was conducted and assessed at two of the study centres (one in Germany and one in The Netherlands) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The effect of treatment on BMD and bone markers was also assessed in a small number of women participating in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of subgroup analyses undertaken during the 1-year comparative treatment phase and the 1-year safety extension phase.

Biopsies were postponed if subjects had menstrual bleeding or spotting, had not taken tablets for at least 10 days or had an acute clinically relevant genital infection. Biopsies were analysed by a single reader. Endometrial thickness and ovarian morphology were assessed by transvaginal ultrasound.</p><p>Metabolic parameters were analysed using blood samples collected from women who had fasted for 12 hours. A total of 25 ml of blood was needed from each subject for all of the metabolic parameters, with the exception of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which was undertaken to assess carbohydrate metabolism. For the OGTT, subjects were instructed to consume a balanced diet (no alcohol and no excessive consumption of any food) on the day preceding each of the tests. The tests were performed after a 12-hour overnight fast. The 75 g standardised OGTT involved taking five blood samples (3 ml each) 30 minutes before and at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after ingestion of a glucose load. Hormone levels were measured from blood samples. A total of 7.5 ml of blood was needed for each sample per subject.</p><p>For those women included in the analyses of endometrial characteristics, metabolic parameters and hormone levels who had received sex hormone prior to the study, a washout period of 2 months (i.e. two menstrual cycles) was required before study medication could be initiated.</p><p>BMD of the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and hip (femoral neck and total hip) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. At each visit, two BMD measurements were taken at each anatomical site. Measurements of bone markers in serum [estradiol, plasma osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide (CTx)] were assessed using blood samples taken in the morning after a 10-hour fast. Women were only eligible to participate in the analysis of BMD and bone markers if the mean of two pretreatment BMD T-scores was greater than &#x02013;1 at the lumbar spine site.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative data, while frequencies were given for categorical data.</p><p>The randomisation scheme for the flexible<sub>MIB</sub>, fixed extended and conventional regimens in the two study centres in which the additional safety analyses were conducted was 1:1:1, which used a separate randomisation list and schedule. Randomisation was conducted using blocks of three until the respective sample size defined for each specific investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was achieved. In those women recruited at all other centres, the randomisation ratio to the flexible<sub>MIB</sub>, conventional and fixed extended regimens was 4:1:1. To prevent selection bias an interactive voice response system was used for randomisation. Further details regarding the randomisation of women to the different regimens are reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Analysis set</title><p>The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all women who took at least one dose of study medication and for whom at least one clinical observation was available.

The evaluation of safety data was based on the FAS.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Sample size</title><p>For safety reasons, a treatment duration equivalent to 10 000 cycles of 28 days was to be achieved for the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen. It was assumed that after the first year comparative phase, 50% of all subjects would voluntarily agree to receive the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen in the safety extension phase. Assuming an annual dropout rate of 40%, approximately 660 subjects were needed for the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, and 225 subjects were needed for each of the other two regimens.</p><p>The sample size for BMD measurements was based on the assumption that the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference of mean BMD loss would exclude the value &#x02013;2.3% [with an assumed standard deviation (SD) of 2.6%]. To achieve a power of at least 90%, 28 &#x02018;completers&#x02019; were needed per treatment arm.

One case of DVT occurred in the left calf of a 22-year-old Caucasian non-smoker. The subject had received study medication for approximately 7 months, and before that had received other COCs for approximately 14 months. The subject had no personal or family history of thrombosis and an assessment of clotting status showed normal values; however, diagnostic examination revealed a heterozygous prothrombin gene mutation (factor II) and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The woman was treated accordingly without the need for hospitalisation, and recovered approximately 4 months after diagnosis. The event was considered to be possibly related to the study medication. The second case of DVT (of the right lower leg) occurred in a 25-year-old Caucasian non-smoker approximately 1 month after study medication was initiated. The subject had used a COC for 8 months before enrolling in the study. An assessment of clotting status showed normal values, and laboratory results excluded factor V and prothrombin gene mutations; however, the woman was found to have a family history of thrombosis and varices. The woman received treatment for 5 months. The event was considered to be possibly related to the study medication. The case of postoperative thrombosis (of the crural vein) occurred in a 29-year-old Caucasian non-smoker 1 day after knee surgery that took place approximately 2 months after starting study medication. The subject had used a COC for almost 1 year before starting the study. The event was considered to be most likely related to the knee surgery and postoperative immobilisation and unlikely to be related to the study medication.</p><p>The case of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver occurred in a 20-year-old Caucasian smoker (10 cigarettes daily) who had a 26-month history of COC use prior to study entry. Study medication was received for almost 19 months before being discontinued because of high alkaline phosphatase levels; prior to medication being discontinued, increasing values of alkaline phosphatase and &#x003b3;-GT were found. Three months afterwards the subject was diagnosed with benign focal nodular hyperplasia in the right lobe of the liver. Neither the focal nodular hyperplasia nor the increased liver enzymes were treated with specific drugs or procedures. The relationship of the event to the study medication was defined as possible.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Safety laboratory evaluations</title><p>In general, changes in safety laboratory values were minimal with all three regimens over time. Only a small proportion of subjects had high or low levels of laboratory values. During the course of the study, there was a transient increase in the proportion of subjects with laboratory values for potassium that were above normal (peak proportion of 2.0% at Week 27 of the safety extension phase). That said, absolute changes from baseline were minimal, levels remained stable in all treatment groups and the proportion of subjects with levels above the normal range was similar to baseline at the end of the treatment (Week 51 of the safety extension phase).</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Endometrial and ovarian characteristics</title><p>The endometrium was characterised at the end of the comparative phase in 23 women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen and in 17 women who received the fixed extended regimen. Most women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> and fixed extended regimens had an inactive endometrium (7/23 and 3/17 women), an atrophic endometrium (6/23 and 5/17 women) or a secretory endometrium of the progestational type (5/23 and 4/17 women), respectively. A weakly proliferative endometrium occurred in 4/23 and 3/17 women. The endometrium was characterised at the end of the safety extension phase in seven women who had originally received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen and in nine women who had originally received the fixed extended regimen. Most of these women had insufficient material for diagnosis; in those that did, an atrophic endometrium (4/7 women who originally received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen and 0/9 women who originally received the fixed extended regimen) or secretory endometrium of the progestational type (1/7 and 4/9 women, respectively) was the most common. No abnormal findings were identified, including no hyperplasia, carcinomas, sarcomas, carcinomatous or other types of metaplasia or cervical carcinomas.</p><p>Endometrial thickness was assessed at Weeks 27 and 51 of the comparative phase in 32 and 34 women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, 27 and 25 women who received the conventional regimen, and 28 and 30 women who received the fixed extended regimen. At Week 27, mean endometrial thickness was 3.99 mm with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen (vs 7.61 mm at baseline), 3.99 mm with the conventional regimen (vs 7.08 mm at baseline) and 3.97 mm with the fixed extended regimen (vs 7.71 mm at baseline). Mean thickness at Week 51 was 4.27 mm, 3.94 mm and 4.48 mm, respectively. Endometrial thickness was assessed at Week 51 of the safety extension phase in nine women who had originally received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, 13 women who had originally received the conventional regimen and 10 women who had originally received the fixed extended regimen. Mean endometrial thickness was 3.69 mm, 3.37 mm and 4.10 mm, respectively.</p><p>Ovarian morphology was assessed at Weeks 27 and 51 in the comparative phase in 32 and 34 women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, 27 and 26 women who received the conventional regimen, and 28 and 30 women who received the fixed extended regimen. One woman who received the conventional regimen was pregnant at Week 51 of the comparative phase. One woman who received the fixed extended regimen had suspected chocolate cysts on both ovaries at Week 27; this was confirmed by Week 51 following laparoscopic enucleation of the cysts. The woman prematurely discontinued study medication. Ovarian morphology was assessed at Week 51 of the safety extension phase in nine women who had originally received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, 13 women who had originally received the conventional regimen and 10 women who had originally received the fixed extended regimen.

DVT and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are rare events in users of hormonal contraceptives.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Additional risk factors include increasing age, increasing body mass index, genetic mutations that affect coagulation, and a family history of VTE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> One DVT case that was deemed to be possibly related to study medication occurred in a woman 1 month after the study medication was initiated. Contrary to initial information, the woman had a family history of thrombosis, which was an exclusion criterion of the study. The other case occurred in a woman approximately 7 months after treatment was initiated; diagnostic examination revealed that this woman had a heterozygous prothrombin gene mutation (factor II) and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. A third VTE was considered to be most likely related to knee surgery and the postoperative immobilisation. It is not possible to evaluate the risk of rare events such as VTE using the results of clinical trials such as this one that have limited treatment exposure. That said, this topic needs to be investigated in robust postmarketing epidemiological studies. The risk of thrombotic events has been associated with estrogen, although controversy remains as to whether or not there may be an increased risk of VTE associated with specific progestogens. Recent database studies have suggested that the risk of VTE is lower in women using levonorgestrel-containing COCs relative to women using so-called &#x02018;third-generation&#x02019; COCs, and women using COCs containing DRSP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> These findings are in contrast to those of the European Active Surveillance Study (EURAS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and the Ingenix database study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> which show that the risk of VTE is comparable for low-dose COCs, regardless of the type of progestogen included.</p><p>The use of COCs is associated with distinct changes in endometrial histology, including the inhibition of glandular growth and differentiation, often resulting in an inactive or atrophic endometrium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> These changes contribute to the contraceptive efficacy of COCs. In this study, endometrial biopsies showed that the use of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> or fixed extended regimens resulted in an inactive, atrophic or secretory endometrium in most women.

In this study, alterations in lipid parameters, haemostatic variables and carbohydrate metabolism with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen were comparable to those with the conventional and fixed extended regimens. These results are consistent with those of a study that showed no statistically significant differences in lipid, carbohydrate and coagulation parameters with EE 30 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg when administered continuously for 168 days, or as six 28-day cycles comprising 21 days of active tablets followed by a 7-day tablet-free interval.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> The changes in certain lipid parameters [HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL<sub>2</sub> cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a)] observed in this study are comparable to those reported in a study of 59 women who received a 24/4 regimen of EE 20 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg or a 21/7 regimen of EE 20 &#x000b5;g/desogestrel 150 &#x000b5;g for seven cycles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Extension of the intake cycle with the flexible extended or fixed extended regimens has no impact on the known effect of COCs on the haemostatic system.

This agrees with a previous study that showed that the effect of conventional and extended regimen COCs on haemostasis variables did not substantially differ.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study show that EE/DRSP administered using a flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen is well-tolerated and, when administered for up to 2 years, has a good safety profile that is comparable to other estrogen/progestogen COCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Lyndal Staples and Clare Wheatcroft of <italic>in</italic>Science Communications for medical writing support.
