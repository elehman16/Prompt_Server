There is consensus in the literature that at least 3.8&#x000a0;L of good-quality MC (IgG &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;g/L and Total Plate Counts, TPC &#x0003c;100,000&#x000a0;cfu/mL) should be administered to prevent failure of passive transfer (FPT) of immunity, a condition characterized by serum IgG&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;g/L&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;24&#x000a0;h post colostrum ingestion in calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Failure of passive transfer of immunity is a well-recognized risk factor for increased preweaning calf morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The condition has also been associated with milk yield losses and decreased longevity in lactating adult cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Adequate intake of MC is critical for preventing FPT and its negative consequences on calf health and future production performance. Several studies have confirmed the presence of bovine specific pathogens (e.g. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp., bovine leukemia virus, and <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic>) in MC suggesting that feeding raw MC is an early means by which newborn calves can become exposed to such pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, negative correlations have been reported between bacterial contamination levels in colostrum and post-feeding serum IgG concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence, feeding colostrum of inferior quality (IgG&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;g/L and TPC&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;100,000&#x000a0;cfu/mL) can exacerbate the risk of FPT in calves and compromise preweaning performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Colostrum replacers derived from either spray-dried bovine plasma or spray-dried cow colostrum are formulated to provide&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;g of IgG to calves when ingested at the replacer dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Specific heat treatment must be utilized along with spray-dry processing of the plasma or colostrum to effectively destroy all pathogens present in MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, CR products have the potential to limit calf exposure to bovine pathogens that may be shed or contaminate MC and are indicated for calves when quality or quantity (or both attributes) of raw MC may be compromised.</p><p>Previous IgG absorption studies on various CR products yielded conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, studies that report a positive association between bovine lacteal or serum based CR products and adequate transfer of immunity in calves rarely include an assessment of preweaning morbidity and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In one Minnesota study, 93% of calves fed a plasma-derived CR product (125&#x000a0;g of IgG) after birth experienced FPT compared with 28% of calves fed MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Even so, preweaning morbidity and mortality risks did not differ between groups in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Several studies reported that feeding a higher IgG mass (&#x02265; 200&#x000a0;g of IgG) delivered using CR products resulted in greater IgG absorption and lower FPT risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, these studies did not evaluate post-administration performance in terms of preweaning morbidity and mortality risks, feed intake, and weight gain for calves fed larger masses of IgG in the CR products evaluated.</p><p>We recently completed a study comparing IgG and serum total protein (TP) in calves fed pooled MC or lacteal-derived CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In that study, serum TP and IgG concentrations at approximately 24&#x000a0;hours post-colostral intake were significantly lower for calves fed pooled MC (TP&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.77&#x000a0;g/dL, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55; IgG&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.50&#x000a0;g/L, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.0) compared to calves fed CR (TP&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.50&#x000a0;g/dL, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52; IgG&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.15&#x000a0;g/L, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.75). Colostrum IgG concentration and mass fed were significantly higher in the CR (71.4&#x000a0;g/L; 200&#x000a0;g, respectively) compared with MC group (21.08&#x000a0;g/L, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.77; 79.79&#x000a0;g, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;36.96, respectively). The apparent efficiency of IgG absorption (AEA) was similar for calves fed MC (28.79%, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.098) or CR (26.98%, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.65). A significantly higher proportion of calves fed MC (188/269 [70%]) suffered from FPT (serum IgG&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;g/L) compared with calves fed CR (32/292[11%]) (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). However, producers are often interested not only in passive transfer of immunity in calves, but also in preweaning health and growth rates. The objective of this randomized trial was to determine the effect of feeding a higher dose of a commercial lacteal-derived CR or pooled MC on preweaning morbidity, daily weight gain and mortality in Holstein heifer calves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Descriptive data</title><p>In total, 568 newborn calves were enrolled in the study.

Failure of passive transfer of immunity is a well-recognized predictor for increased preweaning calf morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that calves fed raw pooled MC in this study were more likely to be treated with antibiotics or experience preweaning event of diarrhea compared with calves fed lacteal-derived CR in the study herd.</p><p>Bovine specific pathogens (<italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp.) are frequently shed in colostrum of infected fresh cows either during an epidemic or intermittently during the peripartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is possible that the higher proportion of diarrhea in preweaned calves fed pooled MC (vs. lacteal-derived CR) was a consequence of direct ingestion of such pathogens in pooled MC. However, this theory could not be further investigated given that culture of the pooled MC samples for specific pathogens (example <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp., <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp.) was not performed in the current study.</p><p>Our results indicate that only 21% of diarrhea cases and 12% of antibiotic-treated calves would be eliminated in this population if the pooled MC feeding program was replaced by 200&#x000a0;g IgG/ calf delivered in a lacteal-derived CR product. This should not be surprising given that in replacement heifer rearing, improved preweaning health is a function of several factors including reducing calf exposure to risk factors (infectious agents inclusive). This can be accomplished through proper housing, ventilation, and general hygiene; increasing levels of specific and non-specific immunity through providing good quality colostrum, balanced nutrition, stress minimization; and boosting specific resistance through preventive vaccinations of either the dams or newborn calves against specific pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Calves in the present study were housed in raised individual wooden hutches up to 60 d of age and maintained on preweaning diets of milk replacer, calf starter grain, and fresh water ad libitum. While a number of calf management practices were in place to reduce calf exposure to risk factors for disease in the current herd, it is possible that some yet unidentified factor (unrelated to pooled MC) may have contributed to the additional risk of diarrhea (e.g. compromised sanitation) leading to increased antimicrobial use on this specific farm.</p><p>The overall finding that calves fed raw pooled MC (vs. lacteal-derived CR) were more likely to be treated with antibiotics or experience preweaning diarrhea differed from a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Swan et al. reported no difference in post-feeding morbidity risk observed between calves fed a plasma-derived CR compared with calves fed individual maternal colostrum (i.e. non-pooled colostrum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, another study found significantly lower morbidity risk for calves fed MC (46.9%) compared with calves fed a lacteal-derived CR (67.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although not statistically significant, Priestley et al. reported that a greater proportion of calves fed a lacteal-derived CR experienced diarrhea (44.9%) compared to calves fed MC (28.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although some studies have found no link between FPT and the risk of treatment for diarrhea in beef calves, a possible reason for the difference in findings could be the higher proportion of FPT in calves fed MC in the current study, and in calves fed a lacteal-derived CR (vs. MC) in the Priestley et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The difference in FPT is likely to be due to better quality MC fed to calves in the aforementioned studies compared to the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In a recent survey, 41% of individual colostrum samples met industry recommended colostrum quality benchmarks (IgG &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;g/L and TPC &#x0003c;100,000&#x000a0;cfu/mL) compared with only 26% of pooled colostrum samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The mean IgG mass in the pooled MC fed to the calves in this study was approximately 21&#x000a0;g/L compared with approximately 69.7&#x000a0;g/L of IgG reported for non-pooled colostrum in the recent survey of colostrum quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>While there were no differences in the proportion of preweaning respiratory disease, omphalitis or death in calves fed lacteal-derived CR compared to those fed pooled MC, mean daily weight gain was significantly higher in the former. This reflected perhaps a general benefit accruing from the improved preweaning health outcomes associated with feeding lacteal-derived CR rather than a direct role in enhancing daily weight gain in the study calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Such a link between reduced morbidity and increased weight gain was also reported in a Florida study, although unlike in the current study, the Florida study reported reduced morbidity in calves fed MC compared to those fed a lacteal-derived CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, type of colostrum fed (CR versus MC) had no effect on mortality risk between birth and weaning in the study calves. These results are consistent with results from an earlier study in which feeding a plasma-derived CR (vs MC) had no effect on preweaning mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; however they differed from the Florida study which found a significantly lower proportion of mortality in calves fed MC compared to calves fed a lacteal-derived CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These contradictions may reflect the fact that in concert with passive transfer of immunity, calf survival in the preweaning period is a function of several herd factors including housing and nutrition.</p><p>Although a major strength of this study included its randomized assignment of treatment, the results presented here must be interpreted cautiously. It is possible that the ability to correctly assign a disease diagnosis (i.e. diarrhea, respiratory disease, omphalitis) varied among the study personnel involved in the care of the calves during the follow-up period. This potential bias, if present, was likely to be non-differential because the study personnel were blinded to treatment group assignment (lacteal-derived CR vs. pooled MC). Moreover, a veterinarian (SA) cross-validated each recorded diagnosis and treatment with the herd veterinarian&#x02019;s drug protocols. The extent to which this study&#x02019;s results can be extrapolated to a wider population of dairy herds is limited by the use of a single herd to evaluate the current study objectives. While approximately 57% of large dairy operations in the US routinely feed pooled MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the current herd was not representative of this wider population with respect to FPT risk profiles and quality of pooled MC fed. Recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] suggest that approximately 23% of calves in US operations that fed pooled MC experienced FPT compared with 70% of calves fed the pooled MC in this study. In addition, the mean IgG mass in the pooled MC fed to the calves in this study was 3-fold lower than similar estimates of IgG concentration in nationally representative samples of pooled MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The lower quality of the pooled MC fed to calves in this study compared to comparable US herds likely biased the morbidity outcomes in a direction suggestive of a better efficacy for the lacteal-derived-CR for improving preweaning health in calves. Hence, it is possible that the benefits of feeding lacteal-derived CR (vs. pooled MC) on preweaning health may not be similar in dairy herds managed under a different husbandry system.</p><p>The findings reported here indicate that producers should adopt colostrum management strategies that improve colostrum quality. To achieve this, producers can begin by pooling only colostrum with acceptable immunoglobulin concentration (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;g/liter IgG). This can be achieved by testing individual cow colostrum samples prior to pooling and by properly identifying dams so that first milking colostrum is pooled separate from colostrum harvested from subsequent milkings. Alternatively, pooling colostrum can be replaced by feeding a colostrum replacement product with a known immunoglobulin concentration. Other recommendations identified from previous research should also be followed such as observing proper sanitation and hygiene during harvesting, processing, and storage of colostrum, feeding colostrum replacement products or heat-treated colostrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, calves fed CR had a significantly higher rate of daily weight gain and were less likely to be affected with diarrhea compared to calves fed MC.

Pregnant dams were moved to a group calving pen approximately 3 d prior to the expected calving date and monitored until calving. Heifer calves born between 6&#x000a0;AM and midnight were separated from their dams immediately after birth. Cows calving otherwise were monitored by the dairy&#x02019;s night shift staff and newborn calves were removed immediately after birth to the holding pen until fed the assigned colostrum type by study personnel the following morning. Once in the holding pen, each calf had its navel dipped in an iodine-based antibacterial solution, its ear tagged and its dam ID recorded on farm paper records.</p><p>Calves were randomized to one of two treatment groups and fed either 3.8&#x000a0;L of raw pooled MC (control group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;273) or two doses of a lacteal-derived CR (Land O Lakes Colostrum Replacement, Lake O Lakes Animal Milk Products) (treatment group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;295). The CR was reconstituted based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions as follows. Each package (100&#x000a0;g IgG/dose) of the lacteal-derived CR powder was dissolved in 1&#x000a0;L of warm water (approx. 49&#x000b0;C) yielding a mixture of 1.4&#x000a0;L containing 71.4&#x000a0;g/L of IgG. Maternal colostrum was harvested after morning milking sessions within 1 to 12&#x000a0;h of calving, pooled and refrigerated at 4&#x000b0;C until feeding within 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h of collection. Both the lacteal-derived CR and pooled MC were administered as a single oral dose (CR&#x02009;~&#x02009;2.8&#x000a0;L and MC ~3.8&#x000a0;L) within 6&#x000a0;h of birth. All calves were fed using a bottle nipple. However, when a calf failed to ingest some or all of the colostrum quantity, an esophageal tube feeder was used to deliver the complete dose in lieu of the bottle.</p><p>Following feeding, each calf was housed in an individual raised wooden hutch until weaning at approximately 60 d of age. During the preweaning period, calves were fed daily diets consisting of 2&#x000a0;L of pasteurized hospital pen milk, clean water and a starter grain mix.</p></sec><sec><title>Enrollment and preweaning health monitoring</title><p>Before feeding the assigned colostrum type, calves were bled for serum IgG and TP concentration estimation.

Other data recorded included dam identification, colostrum type fed (lacteal-derived CR or pooled MC), birth date, time from birth to separation from dam (h), time from birth to colostrum feeding (h), quantity of colostrum fed (L) and whether or not an esophageal tube feeder was used to administer the colostrum.</p><p>Calf morbidity from birth to weaning were monitored and recorded daily by trained study personnel including study authors (SA and JC) while blinded to the type of colostrum fed (lacteal-derived CR or pooled MC) at enrollment. For uniformity in morbidity recordings the following working definitions were applied based on a modification of the University of Wisconsin Calf Health Scoring Chart (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/dms/fapm/fapmtools/8calf/calf_health_scoring_chart.pdf">http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/dms/fapm/fapmtools/8calf/calf_health_scoring_chart.pdf</ext-link>): (I) diarrhea was indicated in calves that voided abnormal feces with watery consistency and foul smell (score 2 or 3) with or without dehydration or elevated body temperature (&#x02265; 40&#x000b0;C), (II) respiratory disease was reported for calves that exhibited increased respiratory rate, nasal discharges, or cough (score 1, 2 or 3 except no attempt was made to induce a cough) with or without an elevated body temperature (&#x02265; 40&#x000b0;C), (III) omphalitis (navel infections) was associated with presence of overt umbilical inflammatory signs, including heat, swelling, purulent discharges, or evidence of pain on palpation of the umbilical area. Furthermore, a calf&#x02019;s joints were physically examined for heat if a joint or umbilicus appeared enlarged. Treatments including antibiotics administered by the dairy&#x02019;s staff to the study calves were recorded on a daily basis. No specific treatment protocols were developed for this study.
