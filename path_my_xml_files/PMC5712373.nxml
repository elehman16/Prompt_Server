The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the combination of these therapies would induce synergistic effects to treat lymphedema-related complications and to analyze a possible physiological mechanism involved in the observed effects.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 55 patients diagnosed with mastectomy-induced lymphedema were recruited and randomized into three experimental groups: PNF group (<italic>n</italic> = 17), MLD group (<italic>n</italic> = 20), and PNF + MLD group (<italic>n</italic> = 18). They were subjected to designated rehabilitation program three times a week for 16 weeks. ROM (flexion of the shoulder joint), edema size, arterial blood flow velocity, and degree of pain and depression were measured every 4 weeks over experimental period.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Lymphedema volume, VAS pain scale, and Beck depression scale were decreased in PNF and MLD groups for 16 weeks in a time-dependent manner. In combination, a greater reduction of these variables was observed over 16 weeks compared to each PNF and MLD. While axillary arterial blood circulation rate in the affected extremity was increased in both PNF and PNF + MLD groups over 16 weeks, this value was not increased in MLD group throughout the experimental period. A greater reduction of scales of VAS pain and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was observed in PNF + MLD group after the 16 week-treatment, as compared to each PNF and MLD group. Pearson's coefficients test demonstrated that there are significant correlation of depression against pain (<italic>r</italic> = 0.616, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), ROM (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.478, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and lymphedema size (<italic>r</italic> = 0.492, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The combination of MLD and PNF induces potent synergistic effects on edema volume, shoulder range of motion (ROM), pain, and depression in patients with lymphedema. In addition, an increased rate of axillary arterial blood flow in PNF-treated patients provide a potential physiological mechanism by which local arterial pulsation in the affected extremity plays a positive role in the treatment of lymphedema. Therefore, it is suggested to incorporate an element of PNF into traditional MLD method to facilitate treatment process for patients with lymphedema.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>manual lymphatic drainage</kwd><kwd>lymphedema</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>mastectomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Research Foundation of Korea<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003725</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">NRF-2016R1C1B2015125</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">NRF-2013S1A5A8021383</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5636"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lymphedema is a pathological state of chronic tissue swelling induced by the restriction of lymph drainage (Armer, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). It is reported that more than 20% of breast cancer patients are inflicted with lymphedema (Ezzo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Since most of the current surgical procedures are accompanied by removal of lymph nodes in unilateral or bilateral upper extremities (Fairey et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), the etiology of lymphedema is primarily caused by reduced capacity of processing lymph fluid in axillary region of the affected area (Bassler, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Although lymphedema is not a life-threatening disorder, this chronic condition can cause not only physical discomfort, but also functional impairment, ultimately leading to anxiety and depression (Ridner, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ha and Choi, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, accumulating evidences proved that lymphedema is tightly coupled with the development of severe pathological complications such as lymphangitis and cellulitis (Pereira de Godoy et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, an effective strategy for lymphedema is warranted. With the advent of microsurgery, the application of multiple lymphatic-venous anastomoses has become a common surgical treatment for lymphedema (Campisi and Boccardo, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Campisi et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, due to lack of convincing evidence of the success, a significant portion of patients with lymphedema opt for non-surgical therapeutic treatments (Damstra et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Among them, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) has garnered attention as a non-surgical treatment. MLD is defined as a manual massage technique which is applied on skin surface along with anatomical lymphatic pathways to promote drainage from the affected extremity (Huang et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). At present, the application of MLD combined with other supplemental methods, such as complex decongestive physiotherapy is regarded as the most effective non-surgical therapeutic method. These treatments commonly cause an increase in the flow of lymph, the contraction rate of lymphatic vessels, and the re-absorption of proteins into lymphatic vessels, leading to transferring the fluid of edema in the direction of lymph nodes (Williams et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Moseley et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Williams, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ezzo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The development of lymphedema is tightly associated with reduction in muscle flexibility and joint movements (Thomas-Maclean et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Moreover, more aggressive breast cancer treatment involving mastectomy induces a greater restriction in shoulder range of motion (ROM) in the affected arm (Smoot et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Since deficits in ROM may interfere with daily activities, leading to a diminished quality of life, it is recommended that patients require vigilant musculoskeletal attention following mastectomy to restore normal range of shoulder elevation.</p><p>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a stretching technique mainly utilized to improve ROM in the field of sports medicine. A key element of PNF technique induces joint movements within a functional range in the absence of pain (Sharman et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). PNF has been well-proven to improve flexibility and muscular strength, and vascular blood flow (Feland and Marin, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Since contraction of skeletal muscles propels lymph flow in the direction to cardiovascular system (Drewes et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), it is hypothesized that PNF-induced muscle movement has positive role in the reduction of lymphedema. Although a couple of studies suggested potential of PNF's therapeutic effects in patients with lymphedema (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ha and Choi, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), synergistic effects of the two prevalent manual methodologies, PNF and MLD, have not been investigated. Therefore, the main objectives of the study are two-fold: to investigate if the combined treatment of PNF and MLD would improve lymphedema-related complications and to study a possible physiological mechanism involved in the observed effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject</title><p>The subjects consisted of 55 female patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent mastectomy. Their physical characteristics are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The criterion for entry in the study was a minimum of 2 cm difference in circumference between both arms (Andersen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Patients with multiple lymphedema sites were excluded from the study. All the participants were provided sufficient information on the test's purpose, procedures, and risks, and then submitted a written consent. To minimize extra variables in the subjects, Stretch compression bandages (Lohmann &#x00026; Rauscher, USA) and lymph pads (Mediven, USA) were treated to all the subjects for 46 h every 2 days in a supportive and time-controlled manner over the course of the study. All the dependent variables were measured 30 min after bandage removal. They were also recommended to inhibit programmed exercise, drinking, smoking, and additional medication.

They were subjected to respective rehabilitation program three times a week for 16 weeks. Each session consisted of 30 min per session. PNF techniques consisted of rhythmic initiation (RI) and a combination of isotonic, contract-relax, and hold-relax. Both PNF and MLD were performed by a certified technician. ROM (flexion of the shoulder joint), edema size, blood flow velocity, degree of pain, and psychological variables were measured every 4 weeks until the end of 16-week program in a time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Measurement and analysis methods</title><sec><title>Range of motion (ROM)</title><p>The ROM in the shoulder joint was measured using a goniometer, according to the instruction released by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS), to measure flexion in the shoulder joint in the affected arm.

The flexion was measured as the angle of the affected arm elevated vertically from position in which the body was fixed.</p></sec><sec><title>Edema size</title><p>Edema in the upper extremity was measured using the Arm Circumference Gauge (Sammons Preston, USA). Edema size was measured at both sides of 10 cm proximal and distal to the ulnar olecranon. The values were obtained by comparing the circumferences of the affected arm and the non-affected arm. They were obtained every 4 weeks until the end of 16-week program. Data were presented using the following formula.

The data were presented as ml/s.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain and depression</title><p>The degree of pain was used as an indirect indicator of muscle activation. The degree of pain was measured based on the visual analog scale (VAS), which is widely used in clinical settings to quantify pain severity (Kelly, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The level of pain was examined during the ROM measurement of shoulder joints. The subjects were instructed to check a straight line graph once a month, which displays gradation from &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; = 0 to &#x0201c;unbearable pain&#x0201d; = 10. The values were obtained every 4 weeks until the end of 16-week program. Depression levels of the subjects were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), developed by Beck et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>). There are 21 categories; each of which has four options. Participants were instructed to select the suitable option reflecting their current emotional status.

Due to a limited success rate of surgical procedure, non-surgical therapies have garnered attention on upper lymphedema following mastectomy (Garza et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is regarded that combination of several non-surgical therapies plays an important role in the management of lymphedema (Moattari et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Among them, MLD has been widely implemented in the field. Although a couple of studies suggested that PNF could be also implemented as a potential therapeutic method (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ha and Choi, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), synergistic effects of MLD and PNF have not been explored. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that patients receiving combined MLD/PNF treatment showed a greater reduction in lymphedema symptoms over 16 weeks, compared to those receiving either treatment respectively.</p><p>Traditionally, patients with lymphedema have been recommended not to engage in repetitive exercise (Harris and Niesen-Vertommen, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). This conservative clinical guideline indirectly discourages patients from using their extremities in the affected side. Such limitation of regular activity is hypothesized to retard rehabilitation process, inducing atrophy, adiposity, and decreased ROM in a vicious cycle manner (Schmitz, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, the consensus throughout recent studies indicates that various types of exercise involving the affected extremity are not associated with the exacerbation of lymphedema (Harris and Niesen-Vertommen, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; McKenzie and Kalda, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Courneya et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Schmitz et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, a study reported that exercise intervention induces therapeutic effects on lymphedema symptoms (Schmitz et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Despite the positive benefits of exercise, patients are hesitant to participate in repetitive exercise requiring a wide ROM mainly due to fears of movement-induced pain. Meanwhile, PNF requires patients to move the affected extremity within their ability in a designated direction in the absence of unbearable pain (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), suggesting a possibility that traditional exercise intervention could be substituted with PNF treatment for patients with lymphedema.</p><p>In the study, when patients were treated with a course of intensive MLD or PNF respectively, swelling in the affected extremity was decreased in a similar fashion over the 16 week-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, when PNF was added to a course of MLD, a greater reduction of lymphedema volume was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), showing physiological evidence that the combined treatment of MLD and PNF induces a strong synergistic effect on reduction of lymphedema. The observed synergistic effect implies a possibility that these two manual methods modulate the therapeutic process through different physiological mechanisms. This idea is confirmed by our result that axillary artery blood circulation velocity was increased in PNF group while this value was not increased in MLD group throughout the experimental period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Under resting condition, lymph flow is known to be mainly regulated by rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle walls of lymphangion under the control of autonomic nervous system (von der Weid and Zawieja, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, a study suggested that contraction of skeletal muscle adjacent to lymphatic vessels is also involved in dynamics of lymphatic flow (Havas et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In the aspect of techniques, MLD uses light touch to move lymph out of the tissues and back into the lymphatic vessels (Moseley et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This suggests that lymph flow is induced by direct touch of therapist. In the meanwhile, PNF elicits repetitive cycles of muscle contraction and relaxation, which pumps the flow of lymph into the lymphatic vessels and cardiovascular system indirectly (Drewes et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Furthermore, local arterial pulsation in the affected extremity is positively related with lymphatic flow (Ezzo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore, the accelerated reduction of edema in patients receiving the combined treatment might be explained by additional effects of PNF-induced local skeletal muscle contraction and arterial pulsation.</p><p>It has been well-documented that patients with lymphedema have reduced ROM in the affected extremity (Moattari et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the study, although MLD-mediated reduction of edema was observed over 16 weeks, shoulder ROM was not improved statistically over 16 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Moreover, a greater ROM improvement was observed in PNF and MLD + PNF groups compared to MLD group. These results implicate that MLD-mediated reduction of edema alone is not sufficient to increase patients' ROM, suggesting that lymphadema patients require vigilant musculoskeletal attention following mastectomy to restore normal range of shoulder elevation. In contrast to our results, multiple studies demonstrated a possibility that MLD has a potential to increase shoulder ROM in patients with lymphedema (Moattari et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, previous studies acquired positive results by applying a series of programmed treatments such as compression pumping, remedial exercises, compression bandage, education, and MLD (Moattari et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This integrative approach makes it difficult to find specific physiological mechanism of a certain therapy. In our study, MLD and/or PNF were applied to all the patients while compression bandage was treated in a time-controlled manner. Therefore, it is considered that methodological difference induced the discrepant results among studies.</p><p>PNF has been proven to enhance flexibility in patients with musculoskeletal dysfunction (Feland and Marin, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Hindle et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lee, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, research on its application to patients with lymphedema has been extremely limited. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to report that MLD combined with PNF induces potent synergistic effects to reduce lymphedema volume as well as to increase shoulder ROM in the affected extremity. Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate an element of PNF into traditional Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) to facilitate treatment process for patients with lymphedema.</p><p>There is a strong link between chronic pain and depression (Ohayon and Schatzberg, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). It was reported that chronic physical pain is a major contributor to the development of depression (Corruble and Guelfi, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Pain is regarded as a critical complication of lymphedema, causing a great deal of distress and depression. In addition, the prolonged pain induces fears of recurrence and intrusive thoughts about breast cancer in a vicious cycle fashion (Passik and McDonald, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Therefore, it is considered that proper management of pain is a major priority to prevent the development of depression in patients with lymphedema. In our study, the scales of pain and depression were decreased by each treatment gradually over 16 weeks (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). In addition, the greatest reduction in the scale of pain and depression was observed in patients receiving the combined treatment over the experimental period. Since physical disfigurement, discomfort, and severe pain of the affected limb are primary causes of the depression (Passik and McDonald, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), it is perceived that the combined treatment-induced improvement of these factors contributes to a greater reduction of depression scale. This idea is further supported by significant correlation coefficients of depression against pain (<italic>r</italic> = 0.616, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), ROM (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.478, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and lymphedema size (<italic>r</italic> = 0.492, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This study was conducted with lymphedema patients who desired to participate in at least one of therapeutic treatments. Therefore, there is a slight limitation in the interpretation of the results due to lack of control group. However, our study is unique in that the recruited patients participated in the respective program over an extended period (16 weeks) and all the values were measured in a time-dependent manner. In future endeavor, a greater understanding of the combined effect of potential therapeutic treatments would provide new perspective into the development of promising non-surgical strategy for patients affected by mastectomy-induced lymphedema.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, our time-dependent study demonstrated that the combination of MLD and PNF induces positive synergistic effects on lymphedema volume, shoulder ROM, pain, and depression in patients with lymphedema. Especially, the increased rate of axillary arterial blood flow in PNF-treated patients provide insight into a potential physiological mechanism by which local arterial pulsation in the affected extremity plays an additional role to alleviate lymphedema symptoms. To gain additional insight, future studies are warranted to evaluate the direct causality among axillary local arterial pulsation, skeletal muscle contraction, and lymphatic flow to find efficient therapeutic strategies.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Summary of synergistic effects of PNF and MLD.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Edema</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Abv</bold>.</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>ROM</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Pain</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Depression</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PNF</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0002.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0002.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLD</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0001.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PNF + MLD</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0003.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0002.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0004.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0003.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00959-i0003.jpg"/></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Abv, Axillary blood velocity; ROM, range of motion.
