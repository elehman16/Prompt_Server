However, ischemic damage and follicular loss during the in-vitro culture of OCTs are major technical challenges. Human umbilical cord stem cells (HUMSCs) and their conditioned medium (HUMSC-CM) have been considered to be potential resources for regeneration medicine because they secrete cytokines and enhance cell survival and function. The aim of this study was to determine whether HUMSC-CM improves the development of frozen-thawed in-vitro cultured ovarian tissues compared with a serum-free culture medium (SF-CM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The thawed OCTs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68) were cultivated in HUMSC-CM and SF-CM in vitro for 8&#x000a0;days, and the ovarian tissues were processed and analyzed by a classical histological evaluation.

Improvement in reproductive medicine and cryobiology has enabled many females to avoid fertility loss. Compared with embryo and oocyte freezing, ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) could be offered to prepubertal girls, premarital women, or married women who cannot delay cancer treatment or injections of ovarian stimulating medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The follicles within the tissues can be initiated to grow towards the formation of fertilizable oocytes with a lesser ethical dilemma. OTC offers the potential to restore natural fertility by thawing and transplanting the ovarian tissues (OTs) or maturing the oocytes in vitro (IVM) to allow their development in the future. Due to the limitation posed by the high risk of malignant recurrence in transplantation, an in-vitro culture is an alternative that appears to be more highly recommended. However, ischemic damage and follicular loss during the in-vitro culture of the cryopreserved OTs remain the main challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Nowadays, there is evidence demonstrating that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in angiogenesis in ischemia animal models and clinical vascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">Human OTs containing immature PF have been successfully cryopreserved to preserve fertility with a lesser ethical dilemma for women facing a reproductive compromise. OCT has allowed for the development of alternative strategies for the re-establishment of fertility in women at a risk of fertility loss, particularly those that underwent cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although autotransplantation, which is an OCT approach, is limited by the high risk of a malignant re-transplantation, an in-vitro culture is an alternative approach that appears to be more highly recommended. Promoting angiogenesis and neovascularization were not only the most important achievements in the in-vitro culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but were also the primary difficulties in OCT.</p><p id="Par53">Many tissue repair studies have explored the paracrine activity and proliferation of HUMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These studies suggested that MSCs exert their protective effects via paracrine-distinct growth factors and cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, against several diseases or to repair tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There were also several studies in the reproductive area that demonstrated that HUMSC transplantation improves ovarian function and prohibits follicular apoptosis due to ovarian damage caused by superovulation or chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The positive factors secreted by the transplanted HUMSCs, such as VEGF, IGF-1, and HGF, acted as antiapoptosis-related factors, although no studies have found HUMSCs to develop into follicular components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These results indicated that the antiapoptotic effect of the transplantation of HUMSCs primarily manifests in the protection of the secondary follicles and antral follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The current results showed that the AC-3-positive follicles were mostly in the PF. The conditioned medium of MSCs was also found to promote capillary formation, induce angiogenesis, and exert a therapeutic function. Lotfinia et al. indicated that the HUMSC-CM contained a higher concentration of VEGF, and the results suggested that HUMSC-CM treatment may enhance vascular formation in ischemic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether HUMSC-CM can improve the development of the cryopreserved OCTs in an in-vitro culture system. Thus, by comparing HUMSC-CM to SF-CM in OT in-vitro culture, the SF-CM was suggested as an organ culture system for human follicles yielding a reduced apoptotic rate and better follicular survival, particularly in tissues that are cut into cubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, a 1640 medium was applied to prepare the serum-free HUMSC-CM, which efficiently avoided the effect of FBS.</p><p id="Par54">NIV is a new vitrification technique that can maintain the satisfactory viability of the ovarian follicles and stroma compared to another cryopreservation methods that was used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, NIV was capable of reproducible preservation as evaluated by H&#x00026;E staining which showed a positive structure of the follicles and a better percentage of PF in group A (64.75&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.23%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Notably, there were no secondary follicles or antral follicles observed in group A, while no antral follicles were observed in groups B and C. We speculated that the cause was the sensitivity of antral follicles to cryoinjury. During the cryopreservation of the OTs, cryoinjury inevitably occurred which had a detrimental effect on the ovarian quality and reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, restoring the function and structure of the stroma of thawed OTs in an in-vitro culture system was important. In addition, developing follicles requires a lengthy and complicated process in humans, and it is difficult to simulate the natural system in vitro. Overcoming the limit of follicular growth and death in current in-vitro systems requires a better proportion of the activation of follicle growth initiation, the interplay of important growth factors, the basic metabolic needs of early growing follicles, and mimicking the natural environment of the follicles. Furthermore, an ischemic injury that lacks a supportive and sustaining bloodstream limits the development of PFs only to the pre-antral stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in a DEHP-induced OT study, the extra accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the oxidative stress system was found to lead to follicular apoptosis and affect angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, this result suggests that apoptosis occurred throughout the entire study, and we consider that follicular loss and stroma integrity damage can be the result of a lack of a sufficient blood supply in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated ovarian follicle counts at various stages, MVD, and percentage of apoptosis.</p><p id="Par55">Based on our results, in groups B and C there was a time-dependent generation of neoangiogenesis that gradually increased until day 5, after which it declined to a stable level. In particular, the neoangiogenic capability of the HUMSC-CM peaked on day 4. The neoangiogenic effect on days 3 to 5 was remarkable in both groups, and another OT transplantation study reported that the initial revascularization of human OT occurred within 3 to 5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This result indicated that neoangiogenesis of human thawed OTs in vitro occurred earlier than that in transportation. In humans, a period of hypoxia occurred in the thawed OTs that was found to have an effect on oxygenation during the active process of graft revascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This agrees with our MVD results over the first 5&#x000a0;days. However, as stated above, ROS from the oxidative stress system affected angiogenesis, which might lead a decline in MVD after day 5 in this study. Based on these results, we might presume an oxidative stress-induced process of revascularization on OTs in vitro. When outside of their natural environment, follicles must cope with physical restrictions, such as oxygen tension, which likely stimulates neoangiogenesis more rapidly than in transplantation.</p><p id="Par56">In addition, over 8 consecutive days, the percentage of PF corresponded to the neoangiogenesis detected by MVD. This result suggests that promoting the microvascular formation led to an improved follicular development. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the developed PF and MVD between groups B and group C on day 4, followed by a significant difference in apoptotic reduction on day 5. This result suggests that promoting microvascular formation occurred earlier than the prohibition of apoptotic follicles in the in-vitro system. We speculate that the HUMSC-CM contains angiogenic factors that are secreted by the HUMSCs, such as b-FGF and VEGF, and that change the vascular microenvironment to function as &#x0201c;drugstores&#x0201d; surrounding the follicles, which results in a reduction in the apoptosis of ovarian follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This result is consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] where applied MSCs in human follicle isolation in-vitro culture decreased follicular apoptosis and promoted follicular development. Compared to SF-CM, the number of AC-3 positively stained cells decreased significantly after the HUMSC-CM treatment. Based on these results, there is a positive role of HUMSC-CM in the thawed OTs in vitro. Unfortunately, our study was a prospective research study that investigated the effect of the HUMSC-CM on thawed OTs in an in-vitro system. Thus, future studies on HUMSC-CM should be conducted to better understand the beneficial and protective effects of the CM during OCT in-vitro culture progress.</p><p id="Par57">The results of these experiments indicate that HUMSC-CM played a cytoprotective role and had high antiapoptotic properties compared to SF-CM. The HUMSC-CM components that participated in the protective process might be associated with the paracrine activity of HUMSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">Overall, we firstly used HUMSC-CM to improve the recovery of frozen-thawed OCTs in the in-vitro culture system The results revealed features promoting microvascular formation and inhibiting follicular apoptosis by the HUMSC-CM treatment and demonstrated the potential application of HUMSCs and their conditioned medium in the area of reproductive medicine in the future.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AC-3</term><def><p id="Par5">Active caspase-3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALP</term><def><p id="Par6">Alkaline phosphatase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b-FGF</term><def><p id="Par7">Basic fibroblast growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p id="Par8">Dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPBS</term><def><p id="Par9">Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EG</term><def><p id="Par10">Ethylene glycol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGF</term><def><p id="Par11">Epidermal growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBS</term><def><p id="Par12">Fetal bovine serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H&#x00026;E</term><def><p id="Par13">Hematoxylin and eosin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HGF</term><def><p id="Par14">Hepatocyte growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSA</term><def><p id="Par15">Human serum albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HUMSC</term><def><p id="Par16">Human umbilical cord stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HUMSC-CM</term><def><p id="Par17">Human umbilical cord stem cell conditioned medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGF</term><def><p id="Par18">Insulin-like growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITS</term><def><p id="Par19">Insulin-transferrin-selenium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVM</term><def><p id="Par20">In vitro maturation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>L-15</term><def><p id="Par21">Leibovitz&#x02019;s L-15 medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p id="Par22">Mesenchymal stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVD</term><def><p id="Par23">Microvessel density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIV</term><def><p id="Par24">Needle immersed vitrification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCT</term><def><p id="Par25">Ovarian cortical tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OT</term><def><p id="Par26">Ovarian tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OTC</term><def><p id="Par27">Ovarian tissue cryopreservation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF</term><def><p id="Par28">Primordial follicles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par29">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-CM</term><def><p id="Par30">Serum-free culture medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UC</term><def><p id="Par31">Umbilical cord</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p id="Par32">Vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par59">This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 0040215401109 and 31201117).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par60">All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par61">YXJ, YW, and SWL designed the study.
