Different manual therapy techniques combined with exercise therapy and electrotherapy modalities play an important role in its management.

Epidemiological studies showed that 70 to 80% of all people have LBP at some time in their life.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Back Pain may be mechanical or non-mechanical in nature. The mechanical conditions related with chronic low back pain consist of osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis. The non-mechanical conditions are neoplastic, infection, vascular, rheumatologist rest other multiple systemic issues.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The management of low back pain consists of different intervention strategies. These include surgery, drug therapy, and non medical intervention. Most of the systematic reviews focus on the effectiveness of a single intervention and describe the effectiveness on different types of LBP.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Various types of exercises have been used in the management of low back pain. For example, William&#x02019;s flexion exercise, and McKenzie extension exercise are used in the treatment of low back pain.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Spinal Manual Therapy (SMT) is also an effective complementary and alternative treatment for individual experiencing LBP.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Spinal manual therapy is used in treatment of LBP and significant improvement in Oswestry Disability Questionnaire(ODQ) and Numeric Pain Rating Scores (NPRS)were achieved from both thrust and non thrust manipulative therapy technique, but significant differences in ODQ was obtained in favour of thrust manipulation group.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>One of most important technique of mobilization with movement (MWM) is SNAGs, which involve the application of accessory passive glide to lumber vertebra, while patient simultaneously perform active movement.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The McKenzie extension exercise program is another method of treatment focusing on sustained posture or repeated movement, which could improve pain intensity in acute and sub acute low back pain.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The current study was designed to determine the effects of Mackenzie EEP Versus Mulligan SNAGs for chronic mechanical low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted at Riphah Physical Rehabilitation Centre, Pakistan Railways General Hospital Rawalpindi, from 1<sup>st</sup> July to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2014. The inclusion criteria were patients of both gender and age range 30-70 years with minimum 4 weeks history of CMLBP, while patients with acute and sub acute low back pain and trauma were excluded from the study. A total of 37 patients in which there were 20 male and 17 female patients were screened out as per inclusion criteria and randomly placed into two groups.</p><p>Twenty patients in group A were treated with Mulligan SNAGs in sitting, standing and prone position by applying anterocranial glide in the direction of treatment plane over the spinous or transverse process at 6 to 8 repetitions per sessions, and 17 patients in group B were treated with McKenzie active EEP in prone position with repeated movements along with standard protocols. Both groups were treated for four weeks at two session per week and single session per day and total 8 sessions. Treatment was applied at different lumber levels from L1 to L5. Both groups were given electrotherapy treatment such as hot pack and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation TENS.</p><p>The self reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Scale (ODI) and lumber Range of Motion (ROM) were used as an assessment tools and were measured at baseline and at the mid intervention (2 weeks) and completion of 4 weeks intervention. The lumber ROM for flexion and extension was measured by inclinometer, side bending with finger &#x02013; tip to floor method, and rotation with help of measuring tape. The data was analyzed with SPSS version 20 to draw the statistical and clinical significance of both interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of participants in group A was 50.25 &#x000b1; 9.56 and in group B was 49.12 &#x000b1; 12.47.
