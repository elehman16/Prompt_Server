However, ACE inhibitor and ARB may not accomplish enough among high-risk patients because there exist bypass mechanisms and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin axis (RAS) is usually incomplete <xref rid="pone.0062736-Staessen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Renin inhibition is a new option to block the RAS at the first rate-limiting step. Preliminary data suggest a more complete suppression of the intra-renal RAAS with direct renin inhibition as compared with ARBs and ACE inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0062736-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Renin inhibition with aliskiren lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients <xref rid="pone.0062736-Stanton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062736-Gradman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. There is early evidence that direct renin inhibitors may also have anti-proteinuric effect. In nondiabetic hypertensive patients, renin inhibition with remikiren leads to albuminuria reduction <xref rid="pone.0062736-vanPaassen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Recently, Persson et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> showed that aliskiren, the only direct renin inhibitor on the market, reduced 24-hour blood pressure, and this was associated with a reduction in albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the efficacy of direct renin inhibitor for the treatment of non-diabetic chronic proteinuric kidney diseases has not been evaluated. The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety and short-term efficacy of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, on proteinuria reduction in patients with IgA nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062736.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062736.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062736.s003">Protocol S1</xref>). The study was approved by our local clinical research ethics committee (Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee). The study procedure was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

The appearance, packaging and labelling of the study medication and placebo were identical. Individuals were randomised by a computer-generated list, which was used for packaging of the study item and then maintained by a third party that was not involved in the conduction of the study. Marked drug packs (35 capsules for each 4 week supply) were designated for each patient. During follow up visits, study drug was dispensed by a dedicated research nurse. Both patients and investigators were blinded from the treatment allocation.

During every visit, the following parameters were measured: body weight, blood pressure, pulse, adverse effects of treatment, complete blood picture, differential white cell count, renal function test, liver enzymes, serum calcium, phosphate, and early morning urine collection for protein-to-creatinine ratio. Renal function was determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to a standardized formula validated in Chinese <xref rid="pone.0062736-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Serum fasting glucose and lipid profile were measured at 0 and 16 weeks. Prior to enrolment, all patients were taking a stable dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB.

The sample was separated within 20 minutes, and the plasma was then stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C before transport, on dry ice, to the laboratory for assay. Serum TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from the R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), with a detection limit of 31.2 pg/ml.

Data were expressed in mean &#x000b1; SD. Data are compared by Chi-square test or Student&#x02019;s t-test as appropriate between groups. Correlations between continuous variables were computed by the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient. Overall effect of the treatment was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Post hoc analysis for individual time point was performed by paired Student&#x02019;s t test with Bonferroni&#x02019;s adjustment for multiple comparisons. A p value of below 0.05 was considered significant. All probabilities were two-tailed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 22 patients.

Our study indicates that, in additon to diabetic nephropathy, direct renin inhibitor also has anti-proteinuric effect on non-diabetic glomerular disease. In general, aliskiren is very well tolerated, and its effects on blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium level are relatively modest.</p><p>The anti-proteinuric effect of aliskiren we observed is similar to previous reports. For example, in an uncontrolled study on IgA nephropathy, Tang et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> reported that after 14 weeks of aliskiren treatment, proteinuria decreased from 1.73 to 1.27 g:g-Cr. In patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy on losartan, treatment with aliskiren for 12 months reduced the mean urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio by 26.3% <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. More recently, Chen et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> also reported that add-on treatment of aliskiren reduced proteinuria and attenuated the decline in renal function in non-diabetic CKD patients who were receiving ARB. Although the magnitude of proteinuria reduction seems consistent in all these, it is interesting to note that proteinuria appears to be reduced within 4 weeks of treatment in the reports of Persson et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> as well as our present study, while it takes 8 weeks in the report of Chen et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and 14 weeks in the study by Tang et al <xref rid="pone.0062736-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The reason of this discrepancy is unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that proteinuria also reduces significantly during the period of placebo treatment, although the degree of reduction was less as compared to the period during aliskiren treatment. Our findings are in line with previous reports. For example, Parving et al noted that in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy, proteinuria was reduced by 50% or more in 12.5% of patients treated with placebo <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Previous studies on diabetic nephropathy also showed that intensive care received by patients in a clinical trial setting also reduced the rate of decline in renal function, presumably by the optimization of all risk factors <xref rid="pone.0062736-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>We observe a modest but statistically significant reduction in blood pressure during the period of aliskiren treatment. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction is also consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0062736-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In theory, the anti-proteinuric effect of aliskiren could be the result of its blood pressure lowering effect. However, we found no correlation between the degree of blood pressure reduction and the decrease in proteinuria. Previous studies on diabetic nephropathy showed that the antiproteinuric effects of aliskiren were independent of baseline blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0062736-Persson2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Since this is a crossover study, it could be argued that the anti-proteinuric effect during the phase of placebo treatment could represent a carry-over effect of recent aliskiren treatment. However, the anti-proteinuric effect during the phase of placebo treatment was actually observed irrespective to the sequence of treatment allocation (details not shown). Based on the result of a previous study <xref rid="pone.0062736-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, a washout period of 4-weeks would be sufficient and baseline proteinuria level could be re-established.</p><p>Contrary to two previous reports <xref rid="pone.0062736-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062736-Lizakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we did not observe any reduction in serum TGF-&#x003b2; level in response to aliskiren treatment. It is interesting to note that our patients had much lower pre-treatment serum TGF-&#x003b2; levels (around 16 pg/ml) than those in Tang&#x02019;s study (25 to 30 pg/ml) <xref rid="pone.0062736-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, suggesting some difference in patient selection between the studies.</p><p>In the present study, hyperkalemia was uncommon and mild during aliskiren treatment. It should, however, be noted that most of our patients had stage 2 to 3 CKD, and the risk of hyperkalemia should be considerably higher if the baseline renal function is worse. Previous studies on diabetic nephropathy reported that hyperkalemia developed in 22.5% of patients treated with aliskiren <xref rid="pone.0062736-Persson3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A recent meta-analysis showed that aliskiren plus ACE inhibitors or ARB increases risk for hyperkalemia more than monotherapy with any of these agents <xref rid="pone.0062736-Moist1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>We find that short term aliskiren treatment is well tolerated. Currently the efficacy and safety of aliskiren is best tested in two clinical trials in heart failure, namely, the Aliskiren Trial of Minimizing OutcomeS for Patients with HEart failure (ATMOSPHERE) <xref rid="pone.0062736-Krum1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and the Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) <xref rid="pone.0062736-Gheorghiade1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, on 20 December 2011, the Aliskiren Trial In Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Disease Endpoints (ALTITUDE) <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, was stopped on the recommendation after the second interim efficacy analysis <xref rid="pone.0062736-Angeli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, aliskiren or placebo was randomly assigned as an adjunct to an ACE inhibitor or ARB to type 2 diabetic patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular and renal events. Although the primary and secondary renal end points were similar between the groups after a median follow-up of 32.9 months, and the reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was greater in the aliskiren group, the proportions of patients with hyperkalemia and hypotension were both significantly higher in the aliskiren than the placebo group <xref rid="pone.0062736-Parving3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A similar problem has also been reported by the ONTARGET study, which used dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by combination therapy of ACE inhibitor and ARB <xref rid="pone.0062736-Yusuf1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The long term safety and efficacy of vigorous inhibition of the renin-angiotensin axis deserves further studies.</p><p>There are a number of limitations of our study. The sample size of the present study was small and we recruited patients, on average, over 5 years after their renal biopsy. There was, as a result, a possible selection bias that we enrolled patients with persistent proteinuria but relatively stable function, while the subgroup of IgA nephropathy patients with rapidly progressive disease was not represented in our study population.</p><p>More importantly, the duration of study was short and the long term efficacy of aliskiren in reducing proteinuria needs to be confirmed. We observed a &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; in proteinuria soon after aliskiren treatment was discontinued (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062736-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Because of the short follow up and crossover design of our study, we cannot make any conclusion on the effect of aliskiren on the rate of renal function decline.</p><p>In summary, our study showed that aliskiren has anti-proteinuric effect in patients with IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria despite ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. Further studies are needed to confirm the renal protecting effect of direct renin inhibition in chronic proteinuric kidney diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062736.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
