For patients with hypertension with type 2 diabetes, specific BP targets are recommended, along with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid treatment in specific cases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These guidelines and targets rely on an extensive body of evidence from a substantial number of large randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></p><p>Nevertheless, most patients with hypertension do not achieve control according to the recommended targets.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the UK, 30% of people aged between 20 and 79&#x02005;years are hypertensive, but among them only 65% are aware of their condition. Of these, 51% are treated and 27% are controlled.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These figures are even worse in France, where 31% of people aged 18&#x02013;74&#x02005;years are hypertensive, 52% are aware, 42% treated and 21% optimally controlled.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Evidence from the USA and Canada also shows considerable room for improvement.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Overall, in Europe and North America, more than half of the patients with hypertension are uncontrolled.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, when multiple risk factors are active in one patient, control of each risk factor becomes even more suboptimal.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Various causes may explain this gap between proposed targets and actual clinical outcomes. While patients' lack of adherence remains a prominent factor,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the responsibility of the healthcare professional has been more recently brought to light.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Among the various reasons that often keep adherence to guidelines low, therapeutic inertia (TI), or the failure of healthcare providers to initiate or increase treatment when the therapeutic targets are not met, is now regarded as a major impediment to reach individual and public therapeutic goals regarding cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The existence of TI in the management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors has been shown.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> For uncontrolled BP in patients with treated hypertension in European countries, TI occurs in up to 85% of consultations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>A number of explanations have been proposed to understand this phenomenon. The subjective overestimation by the practitioner of the care provided, a lack of familiarity with the guidelines or organisational issues have been shown to lead to TI.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Various hypotheses regarding the intimate mechanisms underlying these behaviours have also been proposed,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> but very few qualitative studies have explored these in depth.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> Studies were based on either nominal or focus groups, but did not specifically explore what happens during consultations with individual patients.</p><p>Decision-making is an important issue in psychological research, and the use of typologies has proven effective to better understand vocational choices<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> or to characterise the effects of cultural differences.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Regarding healthcare, typical patterns of dealing with clinical issues and typologies in decision-making have been brought to light in various situations.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Decision-making is also crucial and very specific in cardiovascular primary prevention, where the physician should prescribe drugs and rules to an asymptomatic patient, expecting a hypothetical benefit that will remain unseen. A typology of general practitioners&#x02019; (GPs) decision-making in cardiovascular primary prevention in actual clinical practice has not been proposed yet.</p><p>In this qualitative study, the objective was to construct a typology of GPs&#x02019; responses regarding their justification of TI in cardiovascular primary prevention. We explored the reasons put forward by GPs for not optimising a treatment when indicated, that is, to explain their TI, and then looked for possible patterns of responses that could be clustered into types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Qualitative approach</title><p>We performed an empirically grounded construction of typology.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> A typology is made up of a number of types. Each type is constructed and defined by a combination of attributes. These attributes are codes that resulted from the qualitative analysis of the responses collected from the GPs included. The typology described the reasons given for not initiating or reinforcing a preventive cardiovascular drug treatment when indicated. Although the aim was to construct a typology, there was no initial framework, and all types were inductively derived from the data.</p><p>In the process of constructing the typology, the combination of two rules was followed:

The quantitative part of ESCAPE was a cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in general practice settings in France. It aimed at determining whether a multifaceted intervention focused on GPs could increase the proportion of high-risk patients with hypertension in primary prevention who achieved their recommended therapeutic targets. The results have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The GPs involved in this qualitative study were all in the intervention group of the ESCAPE trial.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> As the intervention of the trial was at the GPs level, they all attended a 1&#x02005;day training seminar about therapeutic targets and strategies recommended by the French national guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Four trained university GP lecturers delivered the standardised training seminars, using the same teaching kit. A validated electronic BP measurement device (Spengler TB101, Spengler SAS, Antony, France) was provided to the GPs to improve the accuracy of BP measurements. A six-page leaflet that summarised therapeutic targets and strategies recommended in the guidelines was also provided, and the GPs were asked to keep it on their office desk.</p><p>A total of 126 GPs formed the intervention group of the ESCAPE trial and recruited at least one patient; 125 provided qualitative data.

Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, and remaining disagreements went to arbitration with a fifth researcher (JSC).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Attributes and types</title><p>A matrix was constructed, where codes were the columns and GPs were the rows. The number in each cell was the number of occurrences of the code found in the responses of each GP. In order to have as much data as possible in a manageable size, a submatrix of the 10 GPs who provided the greatest number of codes was first analysed to characterise GP types and start constructing the typologies. From this submatrix, researchers defined relevant codes as major or minor attributes to construct and define types. The decision to use a given code as a major or minor attribute of a type was taken independently by the two teams of researchers (JPL/VY and IAA/AM), and then discussed with the arbitration of a third team (JSC and DP) for a final consensus. The types thus defined were then applied to 30 other randomly allocated GPs (10 for each of the three teams) to check for other emerging types and characterise them.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Typology</title><p>The types were applied to the whole matrix, and every GP that provided sufficient data was allocated to one type.</p><p>Finally, we checked for consistency per GP of belonging to one type over time and from one patient to another.

While our results cannot be confronted with previous results of the exact same nature, the various factors and behaviours involved in the inaction process have all been described before.</p><p>Reviewing the whole database for a first impression, the overwhelming confidence in lifestyle counselling is striking. Diets of all kinds, physical exercise, weight loss and various other lifestyle modifications expected or prescribed were cited very often as reasons to delay a drug prescription. Although most guidelines do recommend lifestyle counselling as the first intervention, such a confidence in its effectiveness for high-risk patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetes is not supported by clinical evidence.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Moreover, recent results suggest very little effect on clinical outcomes, if any, of lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This confidence relates to the broader &#x02018;overestimation of care provided&#x02019; issue, already described by Phillips <italic>et al</italic> as a cause of TI.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

In this study, very few physicians disregarded the results of such measurements. Nevertheless, a few &#x02018;checkers&#x02019; did check values above targets up to five times for the same patient, without increasing the treatment over 2&#x02005;years, which can hardly be justified.

Negotiating the primary prevention of cardiovascular risk in a consultation raises some specific issues.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Cardiovascular risk prevention means lifestyle modifications and drug treatments for a benefit that remains hypothetical, and usually not discernible. Further, most patients will not agree with all the lifestyle or drug options available. This ambivalence relates to the controversy that arose when, in order to overcome clinical inertia, Phillips and Twombly suggested to &#x02018;run the numbers first and deal with blood pressure and glucose before asking about other problems&#x02019;.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> A number of researchers and physicians protested that such an attitude would oversimplify primary care and go against the principles of patient centredness.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Elements of negotiation were present in a very large proportion of the GPs&#x02019; responses gathered here, and most of them sounded relevant at first sight. However, GPs in the &#x02018;negotiators&#x02019; group seemed to lead, with any given patient, the same negotiation about the same drug every 6&#x02005;months for 2&#x02005;years. In these cases, negotiating did not actually lead to any further action.</p><p>The &#x02018;rounding phenomenon&#x02019; refers to three different behaviours, related to three possible reasons for inaction. The first one is the end-digit preference, or tendency of physicians to round down the results of measurement.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> For BP measurement, the results are usually rounded to the lower multiple 10 or 5. Although the use of an electronic device reduces this tendency, it still exists and can significantly delay the initiation or reinforcement of a recommended treatment.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The second one is the &#x02018;close enough to target&#x02019; issue, already extensively described.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> It was mentioned here at least once by each of the &#x02018;rounders&#x02019;. Although its consequences have not been as precisely assessed as with end-digit preference, it is likely to have the same effect. The third one is the &#x02018;mental adjustment&#x02019; described by participants in the study by Howes <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> where physicians described how they mentally adjust down the BP actually measured to &#x02018;better represent the true BP&#x02019; of the patient. Although such behaviour was not as clearly described here, it seemed to underlie the decision of some &#x02018;rounders&#x02019;. Overall, rounding, in any of these three ways, might be a way to avoid a difficult or time-consuming negotiation.</p><p>The context of the measurement provided a wide variety of reasons why the results were not regarded as reliable. At the time of the study, ambulatory measurements were not mandatory, and the three measurements made in the office were the standards for the study. Therefore, contextual reasons ranging from &#x02018;waited too long in the waiting-room&#x02019; to &#x02018;didn't have enough time in the waiting room&#x02019; are now outdated. Still, the &#x02018;contextualisers&#x02019; paid much attention to any kind of stress that the patient was going through, regarding elevated BP as a consequence. This has probably much to do with a coincidence of words in French, where BP, muscular tension and psychological stress share the same denomination (<italic>tension</italic>). Supporting this hypothesis, the findings of Nicod&#x000e8;me <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> in France, stressing the high impact of the &#x02018;immediate&#x02019; context on the physician's decision of inaction, differ from those in English-speaking countries, where context refers more to the initial reason for consultation or to other medical priorities.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Questioning the content of the guidelines is also a very common reason invoked by professionals for not following them.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The usual criticism relates to their complexity, inapplicability in general practice and outdated evidence basis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This study did not find any rejection of the guidelines related to either their complexity or their inapplicability in daily practice. This unusual result may be due to the framework of the ESCAPE trial, where the GPs in the intervention group attended a 1-day training seminar about these guidelines and the way they should be followed. Therefore, the &#x02018;scientists&#x02019; typology included GPs that criticised the validity of the guidelines on the basis of new scientific evidence. Indeed, during the 2&#x02005;years of the study, two articles were published that concluded that low-dose aspirin for patients with hypertension and diabetes should be prescribed under certain conditions only.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> At the same time, a controversy arose about the maximum BP values that should be tolerated before initiating or increasing a treatment. A popular French evidence-based medicine journal advocated values above those defined in the guidelines.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> There were only five &#x02018;scientists&#x02019; in our sample, but this should not be understood as a lack of scientific attitude in this GP population, since the typology related only to reasons for inaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>It should be noted that the names given to the types are actually nicknames referring to responses and not to the person, and therefore should not be considered as semantic description of the GPs included.</p><p>The GPs included were all investigators in the ESCAPE trial, and as such were recruited by the French National College of Teachers in General Practice. Many of them hosted a general practice trainee in their practice, and a substantial number of them were involved to various extents in teaching. Furthermore, they were all randomised in the intervention group of the trial and underwent a training seminar. Their involvement and motivation in treating cardiovascular risk factors was therefore different from the general population of GPs.</p><p>Results of LDL cholesterol, HbA1c and BP measurements were included in the Case Report Form (CRF), but the prescriptions were not, so it was not possible to know if a reason for not modifying therapeutics was given every time it should have been.</p><p>Two key points in the analysis process could introduce considerable subjectivity: initial coding and definition of the types. Modelling of the analysis by the researchers' assumptions is a bias nested in the core of qualitative analysis. We tried as much as possible to overcome this by blinded coding and analysis by separate teams of researchers. The initial coding and the types initially described separately by the two teams were remarkably consistent, although we had as little discussion as possible on the matter before the analysis.</p><p>Although many of the reasons given by the GPs for inaction were questionable, the analysis came across very few that could be regarded as definitely inacceptable, such as &#x02018;no time&#x02019; or &#x02018;not in the mood&#x02019;. One can imagine that in writing down the reasons for inaction, a physician would consider the acceptability of the response. This social desirability bias may have influenced the content of the data. Indeed, the typology defined here described the way GPs rationalised their decision of inaction, and thus may not elucidate underlying factors or motivations, especially those that might be considered socially unacceptable. Nevertheless, while it may not provide complete insight into the intimate mechanisms of inaction, it does provide a practical classification of justifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Perspectives</title><p>The answers given by the GPs were related to typical clinical inertia.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Interventions so far have aimed at reducing inertia as a whole, but chances are that a proportion of the recorded inaction is actually appropriate patient-centred care.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This typology could help GPs elucidate their personal decision-making processes and help design physician-centred interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate inaction only.</p><p>Concerted and repeated efforts in implementing up-to-date guidelines have proven effective in addressing the recurrent issue of poor BP control but have still left room for improvement.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Our results suggest that a well-defined set of doctor-related determinants are important. This reinforces the need for education and interventions aiming at the physician's behaviour.</p><p>More work is needed to understand the mechanisms of inaction in GPs&#x02019; decision-making. First, the validity of this typology should be confirmed. One way could be to propose clinical case vignettes to these GPs, and check for the consistence of their declared behaviour with the attributes of the type they belong to. Second, a thorough exploration of their representations and inner feelings in these situations must be conducted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the primary care physicians who participated in this study, which would not have been possible without their cooperation and strong commitment to the project.
