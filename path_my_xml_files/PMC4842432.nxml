after primary micro-damage of the muscles. Chemicals such as histamine, bradykinin, and
prostaglandin are released in the regions with pain, and osmotic pressure increases due to
increased permeability within the muscles. For this reason, type III and IV afferent nerve
fibers are activated, signaling pain to the central nervous system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. DOMS is clearly shown in the muscle belly and the
musculotendinous junction, and it begins to be expressed within 12 to 24 hours after
eccentric exercises, peaking within 48 to 72 hours post-exerciese<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapies for the prevention of DOMS include nerve
mobilization, ultrasound, electrotherapy, ice, and vibration. Among them, ultrasound is a
treatment tool that is commonly used for musculoskeletal diseases, and it elicitis various
biological effects in the soft tissues through heat or specific heat<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nerve mobilization techniques are performed to reduce nerve
mechanosensitivity and increase the compliance of nerve tissues by increasing neural
flexibility<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, most studies of nerve mobilization techniques have been conducted using
patients with peripheral nervous system disorders, and few studies have attempted to reduce
DOMS. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the effects on DOMS of an upper
extremity neural mobilization technique combined with ultrasound after the induction of DOMS
in the biceps brachii muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected forty-five healthy people with no orthopedic history and was conducted
after their consent to participation in this study had been obtained. The subjects were not
currently experiencing any neck or dominant upper extremity symptoms, had no significant
history of a chronic painful condition, and were not using pain-relievers. All the
experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of
Eulji University Hospital. The forty-five healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two
groups: a nerve mobilization group (experimental) and a control group. For randomization,
sealed envelopes were prepared in advance and marked inside with A or B, indicating the
experimental group or the control group. The randomization was done by a third party who was
unaware of the study content. The subjects&#x02019; characteristics and all outcome measures before
and after the treatment were assessed by Physician 1, who was blinded to the treatment
allocations. The intervention was administered in a closed room by Physician 2, who was not
involved in the assessment of the subjects. Both physicians were instructed not to
communicate with the subjects about the possible goals or the rationale of either
treatment.</p><p>The general characteristics of the subjects of this study are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG (n=22)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=23)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.4&#x000b1;2.2<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.4&#x000b1;1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.5&#x000b1;6.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.5&#x000b1;10.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 60.1&#x000b1;11.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4&#x000b1;6.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Mean&#x000b1;SD, EG: Ultrasound + Neural mobilization technique, CG:
Ultrasound</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>. DOMS was induced in the biceps brachii muscle of the subjects on the
non-dominant side so as not to disturb their daily activities. The subjects were instructed
to hold a dumbbell, which weighed 70% of their maximum isometric strength, while fixing
their trunk and shoulders, and to maintain the elbow joint at 90&#x000b0; for one second, and then
slowly lower the dumbbell for three seconds. After the elbow joint had completely extended,
the tester flexed the subject&#x02019;s elbow joint at 90&#x000b0; again. The subjects had to perform this
motion 15 times as a set, and five sets in total. After finishing each set, a one-minute
break was provided<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects in the experimental group received ultrasound and a neural mobilization
technique, each for 10&#x02005;min. The subjects in the control group only received ultrasound for
10&#x02005;min. After DOMS was induced, all the subjects were treated with ultrasound (Ultra Combi
707, Daeyang Medical, Korea).</p><p>Subjects received ultrasound while lying comfortably on a bed. Ultrasound was applied to
the biceps brachii muscle for 10 minutes at a frequency of 1 MHZ and an intensity of
1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>. An upper-extremity neural mobilization technique was additionally
administered to subjects in the experimental group<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This technique was performed sequentially using a five-stage
application method for the relaxation of the biceps brachii muscle. The neural mobilization
technique for the median nerve was performed similar to those reported in the
literature<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participant was
positioned supine and the cervical spine was positioned in approximately 25&#x000b0;of contralateral
lateral flexion, or when the first sense of increased resistance was perceived by the
investigator, whichever occurred first. This was followed by the following consecutive
positioning procedures: (1) the application of passive scapular depression until a sense of
resistance was perceived by the investigator; (2) 90&#x000b0;of combined shoulder abduction and
external rotation combined with forearm supination, wrist extension, finger extension until
a sense of resistance was perceived by the investigator; (3) elbow extension was then
applied until a sense of resistance was perceived by the investigator, or when shoulder
girdle elevation was noted. This process was repeated eight times. The final posture was
maintained for 20 seconds, and it was repeated 12 times. This process was performed for 10
minutes within the degree that did not cause a sense of discomfort in the subjects<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A lactate analyzer, Accutrend (RDGH, Germany), was used to measure lactic acid in the
blood. Blood was collected from capillary vessels of the end of the second finger using a
capillary tube, and was then analyzed. In addition, a digital pressure pain threshold
measuring instrument, The Digital Pain Evaluating System (ZEVEX Co, USA), was used to
determine changes in pressure pain threshold. This device measured the blood generated when
the pressure pain threshold measuring instrument was vertically placed over the muscle belly
of the biceps brachii and applied pressure.</p><p>Before therapy, differences in the general characteristics of the experimental group and
the control group were compared using the independent t-test for age, height and weight, and
the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for gender. Comparisons of the variables before and after the
training within each group were made using the paired-samples t-test. Comparisons of pre-
and post-test differences in variables between the experimental group and the control group
were done using the independent t-test. The statistical software SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. The level of significance was chosen as
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group showed significant improvements in all variables, compared to

applying an upper-extremity neural mobilization technique combined with ultrasound, it
examined the treatment effects on the concentration of lactic acid in the blood and pressure
pain threshold. The results show the treatment&#x02019;s effectiveness at reducing the concentration
of lactic acid and pressure pain threshold. Cowell and Phillips<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in their study that a neural mobilization technique
reduced problems with nerve conduction caused by damage to the nervous system, and improved
flexibility in the structure of the nervous system and muscles, thereby helping to relieve
sensory or motor disorders. Moreover, their study exhibited a similar pattern to the results
of the present study in terms of reducing the secretion of lactic acid and reducing pain due
to enhanced blood circulation.</p><p>The therapeutic mechanism of nerve mobilization techniques facilitates nerve conduction by
improving axonal transport and increasing blood flow by reducing pressure within the
nerves<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is effective at reducing muscular pain due to musculoskeletal
diseases and elevated concentrations of lactic acid in the blood<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the continuous
application of a neural mobilization technique for shortened muscle tissues can prevent the
accumulation of lactic acid within the muscles by increasing the extensibility of nerve
roots, and can reduce pain by blocking the signaling of nerve fibers with pain to the
midbrain-thalamus. The limitations of this study were as follows. First, this study involved
healthy people and it is therefore difficult to generalize the results to all populations.
Second, the absence of a follow-up after the end of the nerve mobilization did not allow the
determination of the durability of the effect of this therapy. Further studies, including a
long-term follow-up assessment, are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits of nerve
mobilization. Future studies should also suggest standardized application methods for nerve
mobilization techniques and continue to research nerve mobilization techniques combined with
interventions for various musculoskeletal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Clarkson</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubal</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Exercise-induced muscle damage in humans</article-title>.
