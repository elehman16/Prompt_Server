Therefore, regular exercise can be a potent primary prevention strategy against chronic disease development that can assist to counter the economic and social repercussions of these diseases [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The benefits of exercise for chronic disease prevention have traditionally been associated with systemic adaptations and improvements in clinical risk factors (i.e. fat-mass, lean muscle mass, aerobic capacity, lipid profile) associated with glucose regulation and/or insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In part, these clinical benefits have also been attributed to metabolic and molecular remodeling within skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To date, the majority of research has focused on the health benefits of continuous, aerobic-based exercise training, such as walking, running and cycling [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, prolonged intermittent exercise, such as football-specific small-sided games (SSG) training, has the potential to improve motivation and compliance compared with continuous aerobic exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Football-specific (futsal) SSG training has also been associated with positive adaptations on measures shown to influence glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity (i.e. body composition, aerobic capacity, blood pressure, capillary and density fiber type), which are either comparable to, or better than, continuous, aerobic exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While this suggests that SSG training should be effective for improving glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity, there are no published data directly examining this hypothesis.</p><p>Insulin resistance has also been linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the reduced content of key regulatory proteins, which have been shown to increase with aerobic or high-intensity, low-volume, sprint interval training (SIT) [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, SSG training has been reported to increase several factors known to be associated with increases in the content of skeletal muscle proteins important for mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These factors include increases in maximal oxygen uptake, citrate synthase activity, number of capillaries per muscle fibre, and muscle fibre area [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, to date, there has been no published research directly investigating the effects of SSG training on the content of skeletal muscle proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and improved glucose metabolism.</p><p>It has been proposed that exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, which can be partly explained by increased content of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase AKT/PKB [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exercise training has also been reported to increase the content of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;), which in turn regulates mitochondrial transcription factors, function and overall protein content, with over expression associated with improved enzyme activity, insulin sensitivity and aerobic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additional proteins associated with PGC-1&#x003b1; and mitochondrial functioning are sirtuin (SIRT)1 and p53 [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Increased SIRT1 activity has been implicated in the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis following exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While the acute exercise response of p53 has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the response to exercise training in humans is unknown. Since SSG training has been reported to improve aerobic capacity, body composition and skeletal muscle structure, it may also improve the content of proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular glucose uptake, so as to improve glucose tolerance.</p><p>Understanding the effects of different types of exercise on skeletal muscle regulatory proteins implicated in glucose control and mitochondrial biogenesis, and how they interact with systemic changes in glucose metabolism, may assist to improve preventative and therapeutic strategies for inactive populations. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to compare the effects of continuous cycling and SSG training on risk factors (body composition, aerobic capacity and strength) and indicators (blood glucose metabolism and regulation) associated with the development of T2DM. The second aim was to investigate changes within and between the respective conditions for the content of skeletal muscle proteins that have been associated with glucose control and mitochondrial biogenesis. It was hypothesized that SSG would be an effective alternative to continuous (cycling) training for inactive, middle-age men, capable of eliciting positive changes in clinical risk-factors and skeletal muscle proteins associated with the prevention of T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-three men (<xref rid="pone.0127548.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; age 48.6 &#x000b1;6.6 y; stature 176.7 &#x000b1;5.9 cm; mass 89.8 &#x000b1;12.3 kg) were recruited and randomly assigned to a stationary cycling (CYC, n = 11), a SSG (n = 11), or a control (CON, n = 11) group (<xref rid="pone.0127548.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0127548.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127548.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of participant numbers during enrolment, allocation, follow-up and analysis.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0127548.g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone.0127548.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127548.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Mean &#x000b1; SD participant characteristics, anthropometry, body composition, aerobic capacity and strength pre and post 8 weeks of control (n = 11), continuous cycling (n = 11) or small-sided games (n = 10).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0127548.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0127548.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Control</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Cycling</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Small-Sided Games</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age <italic>(y)</italic>

After all participants were recruited and groups were formed, block randomisation (Microsoft Office, excel 2010) was used to place each group of three into an allocated condition by the chief investigator. Participant recruitment and follow-up occurred over a 12-week period between October and December 2011. Participants were recruited through verbal communication and newspaper advertisements within a regional Australian community. Based on verbal communication and the self-reporting of activity patterns, participant recruitment ensured the inclusion of participants who were non-smokers, inactive for a minimum of 12 months (i.e. no regular pattern of planned strenuous activity or exercise of &#x0003e;60 min per week), with no clinically diagnosed cardiovascular or metabolic disorders, and taking no prescribed medications. Participants with orthopedic limitations were excluded from the study. Neither the researchers nor participants were blinded to group allocation during pre and post-intervention testing. However, while the training was not blinded, all muscle and blood analyses were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Prior to participant recruitment and all testing procedures, human ethics clearance was obtained from Charles Sturt University Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number: 2011/113; approved September 2011) and participants attended an information and familiarization session where verbal and written informed consent for all testing and training procedures was obtained. This study was registered for inclusion in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry and was allocated the clinical trial registration number: ACTRN12613000874718. Clinical trial registration is not an ethical requirement of the University, thus, registration occurred after participant enrollment due to delayed awareness of required clinical registration. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.

The first session comprised of resting blood pressure, a sub-maximal graded exercise test (GXT), and a 3-repetition maximum (3RM) chest press and leg press. After a minimum of 72 h recovery from the previous testing session, participants returned for a second session that included anthropometric measurements, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, a resting muscle biopsy and a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The exercise interventions consisted of 8 weeks of SSG (modified rugby) or CYC training. Participants were required to attend at least 90% of all training sessions for their results to be included. Given the different exercise modes, the challenge of matching external training load or metabolic cost is acknowledged. However, in an attempt to match training load between conditions, the respective training programs were designed to elicit similar internal training loads as determined from percent of age-predicted (220-age) maximal heart rate (~80&#x02013;85% HR<sub>max</sub>) and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Nutritional and physical activity standardization</title><p>Prior to the start of all testing sessions participants refrained from any physical activity for 72 h, and the consumption of alcohol and caffeine for 24 h. Participants documented diet and physical activity patterns 24 h prior to pre-intervention testing. This document was photocopied and issued to the participants to ensure diet was replicated for the 24-h period prior to post-intervention testing. Prior to participation in the study, all participants were informed (verbal and written) of the importance of maintaining their normal dietary and physical activity patterns throughout the 8-week training period with lack of compliance resulting in exclusion from the program. Participants were required to maintain food and beverage type and timing of consumption, including cooking preparation and portion size. Physical activity was standardized to ensure all participants in all conditions did not change planned or incidental physical activity during the 8-week intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Cycling training</title><p>Participants performed continuous CYC training (Monark 828E, Monark Exercise AB, Varburg, Sweden) for three supervised sessions per week (details of training load progression are presented in <xref rid="pone.0127548.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

The main findings revealed that 8 weeks of either SSG or CYC training induced comparable improvements in TB-FM, aerobic capacity, estimated insulin sensitivity and glucose AUC. Although training was matched for internal load and duration, SSG was the only condition to decrease insulin AUC, and to increase TB-FFM and leg strength. Furthermore, the control group showed an increase in TB-FM, IA-FM and insulin AUC. Despite these improvements in clinical risk-factors for the SSG and CYC conditions, skeletal muscle proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose metabolism showed no significant changes.</p><p>Common measures utilized by health professionals for the diagnosis of metabolic disease include HbA1c (%A1c), fasting glucose and insulin, estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), estimated insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI) and/or an OGTT [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consistent with the current findings, 12 weeks of SSG (soccer) training has been reported to have no significant effect on fasting glucose concentration [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, there were also no significant changes in HOMA-IR, which was reflected by non-significant changes in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations within all conditions. However, as all participants were normo-glycemic during the pre-intervention period, the likelihood for exercise training to improve resting glucose and insulin concentrations was reduced [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, both training interventions resulted in a decrease in HbA1c. This magnitude of decline in HbA1c in both groups was similar to that previously reported following <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>12 weeks of moderate-intensity endurance exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The present study is the first to show that SSG training can reduce HbA1c concentration, with the decrease similar to that occurring following traditional, continuous aerobic training. The decrease in HbA1c in both training groups should decrease the development and progression of microvascular complications [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For example, a 1% A1c rise above 5% A1c increases the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death by 41% [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These relationships indicate that both SSG and CYC conditions improved long-term glycemic control and decreased the risk of a future cardiovascular event [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The decreased HbA1c and training-induced increase in insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI) in both groups of the present study signifies improved glucose metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These results also coincided with a similar reduction for glucose AUC in both training groups. Of particular interest, SSG was the only condition to show a decrease in insulin AUC. Thus, for the first time we report that SSG is an effective training mode that can be used for improving glucose disposal and reducing insulin release in response to a standard glucose load. The results of SSG training are consistent with literature involving SIT and futsal, which has been shown to lower glucose and insulin concentrations during an OGTT [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the results between SSG and previous SIT training studies are similar, the social and community-based benefits of SSG may lead to better adherence and compliance within an inactive middle-aged cohort [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The preservation of strength and muscle mass through exercise training can also help ameliorate metabolic dysfunction and prevent the onset of T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, SSG training led to an increase in TB-FFM and leg strength compared to no change in either the CYC or CON groups. Previous interventions involving SSG training (12 weeks) have reported increases in maximal isometric hamstring strength and lean muscle mass, when compared to continuous running, within an inactive cohort [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These previous findings, along with those of the present study, suggest that SSG training provides sufficient loading to induce myofibrillar protein synthesis, skeletal muscle hypertrophy and an increase in leg strength. These aforementioned adaptations in the SSG condition may also provide a mechanism for the observed decrease in insulin AUC that was not observed in CYC [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], although further research is required to assess these specific hypotheses. Importantly, the increased leg strength and TB-FFM indicates a potential advantage of SSG training over continuous, aerobic training to improve glucose metabolism and reduce risk-factors associated with T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Abdominal adiposity is also correlated with the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with this relationship persisting after accounting for the effects of increased TB-FM [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the present study, TB-FM deceased by 3.6% in SSG and 2.9% in CYC. These reductions are similar to previous observations following 12 weeks of SSG (soccer) training in inactive men, which report a decrease in fat-mass by 3.0%, compared to a 1.8% decrease with continuous running [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, there was also an interaction effect of IA-FM for both training conditions, compared to CON; within all groups no significant changes were evident in body mass, BMI or WHR. Regardless of the small changes in anthropometry, SSG training was equally effective as CYC at improving TB-FM and IA-FM, which are two important risk-factors associated with the development of T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated a greater increase in VO<sub>2max</sub> with SSG (soccer, 13%) compared to continuous running (8%) [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In comparison, the current study observed similar increases in sub-maximal VO<sub>2</sub> between conditions (19.1% in CYC and 18.9% in rugby SSG). This increase in VO<sub>2</sub> coincided with an increase in test duration and workload at 80% HR<sub>max</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0127548.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that SSG is as effective as CYC for inducing adaptations in aerobic capacity within a previously inactive population, especially when training is matched for internal training load. From a clinical perspective, men with high cardiorespiratory fitness (<underline>&#x0003e;</underline>35.7 mL<sup>.</sup>kg<sup>-1.</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>) have been shown to be nearly two-thirds less likely to develop metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These improvements in aerobic capacity have the potential for preventing the development of metabolic syndrome and associated co-morbidities [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite the positive adaptations of the aforementioned clinical risk factors within the present study, there were no significant changes in the content of skeletal muscle proteins associated with glucose regulation and mitochondrial biogenesis (Figs <xref rid="pone.0127548.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0127548.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake have been shown to be facilitated by increased GLUT4 and AKT content [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An important function of AKT is to mediate the metabolic actions of insulin to stimulate cellular glucose transport [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given that GLUT4 is highly abundant in skeletal muscle and is associated with enhanced glucose disposal and insulin action, there has been extensive interest in therapeutic strategies to increase AKT and GLUT4 expression in cohorts at risk of developing metabolic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no other published findings that have investigated changes in the content of proteins associated with glucose regulation in response to rugby-specific SSG training. In the present study, both SSG and CYC training were associated with favourable changes in blood chemistry relating to glucose disposal (OGTT); however, there were no corresponding increases in GLUT4 or AKT protein content. One possible explanation is that the improved insulin sensitivity with exercise may be more dependent on increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, rather than an increase in GLUT4 abundance [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As we did not measure GLUT4 translocation in the present study, further research is required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>This is the first study to investigate adaptations of mitochondrial complexes I-V in response to SSG, with both training groups showing no significant effect on the protein abundance of these complexes (<xref rid="pone.0127548.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Both SIT and aerobic training have been associated with increases in the expression and activity of COX II and IV in healthy trained adults [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; however, an increase [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or no change [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] has also been reported in inactive adults. As the intensity and duration of exercise has a direct effect on COX activity and expression [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], it appears that the accumulated training stimulus of SSG and CYC was below the threshold required to significantly increase the protein content of these mitochondrial complexes. An additional observation from the present study is that adaptations in pulmonary measures of VO<sub>2</sub> were not reciprocated by any observed changes in total protein content of mitochondrial complex (I-V) within skeletal muscle. Improvements in aerobic capacity are also related to improved cardiovascular function, vascular content and resistance [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Accordingly, the absence of significant changes in the protein content of the mitochondrial complexes (I-V) in the present study suggest that the predominant training adaptations were cardiovascular [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and/or adaptations of mitochondrial functioning/efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, further research is required to verify these hypotheses.</p><p>Given the absence of significant changes in the protein content of the mitochondrial complexes, it is not surprising that there were no significant changes in other proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. Both SIRT1 and p53 are two of the many proteins that have been reported to acutely regulate PGC1-&#x003b1;, and thus may contribute to exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present study, there were no significant changes in SIRT1, p53 or PGC1-&#x003b1; protein content; in addition there were no changes in associated transcription factors (Tfam, NRF1, NRF2 and MEF2A) after either training intervention. There is limited literature available on the SIRT1 response to exercise in humans, with no reports of changes in the content of proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis following SSG training. A 16% increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; protein content has been reported following 6 weeks of interval training [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, in the same study there was a 20% decrease in SIRT1 protein content, but a 31% increase in SIRT1 activity [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, an increase in SIRT1 (56%) content, no changes in PGC-1&#x003b1; content, and an increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; nuclear abundance (~25%) has been reported in response to SIT training [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. More recently, using rat models, p53 has emerged as a potential acute regulator of mitochondrial content and function [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although there are no published studies involving exercise training in humans. As such, the measurement of p53 provides an additional novel element to the current study even though there was no change of total protein content in response to either SSG or CYC training within an inactive population. Similar to the results of the present study, no significant changes in mitochondrial protein content in response to exercise training (aerobic and/or resistance, intermittent) has previously been reported in sedentary and active cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition to these previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127548.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], results of the current study suggest that longer (&#x0003e;12 weeks) training programs may be required in previously inactive men to promote increases in skeletal muscle protein content associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose regulation.</p><sec id="sec031"><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite the potential glucose regulatory benefit of exercise, some limitations in the present study should be acknowledged. Firstly, although the number of participants was typical for muscle biopsy studies, it could be conceived as relatively low, and the effect of this on the statistical power of the muscle analyses is accepted as a limitation. Further, a sub-maximal VO<sub>2</sub> test was conducted and thus the ability to compare results to previous studies measuring VO<sub>2max</sub> is compromised. However, this is unlikely to affect the findings of the current study as sub-maximal tests are well recognised as appropriate and sensitive measures of aerobic fitness. Additionally, the use of age-predicted (220 bpm&#x02014;age) HR<sub>max</sub> is not anchored against a true individual HR<sub>max</sub>, which may create differences in relative intensity between participants and the determination of sub-maximal VO<sub>2</sub> during the GXT, and hence should be acknowledged as such. However, it should be noted that the use of age-predicted HR<sub>max</sub> and sub-maximal VO<sub>2</sub> are sensitive to experimental manipulation and therefore appropriate for assessing training adaptation in aerobic function. Although group allocation was randomized, complete elimination of all bias may not be possible, and the data should be interpreted accordingly. Moreover, caution is advised in the interpretation of fasting blood chemistry and OGTT-derived results, as it is acknowledged the low reproducibility of this technique can result in discrepancies in findings. Finally, the knee injury sustained as results from SSG training may be considered as a limitation with this training method and further data on longitudinal effects of such training on orthopaedic injuries should be considered.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time, our results indicate that SSG training is an effective alternative to continuous cycling for improving metabolic risk-factors associated with the prevention of T2DM. The current study revealed improvements in glycemic control, glucose AUC, aerobic capacity, abdominal and total-body fat-mass in response to both CYC and SSG training, while SSG showed additional improvements in insulin AUC, lean muscle mass and lower-body strength. Despite these improvements in response to CYC and SSG training, there were no changes in the content of skeletal muscle proteins associated with glucose regulation and mitochondrial biogenesis. As such, additional research should focus on longer (&#x0003e;8 weeks) training programs to investigate adaptations in skeletal muscle protein content in middle-aged, inactive men. Given previous reports of greater motivation and enjoyment associated with participation in team sports, the incorporation of SSG into an exercise training approach may encourage long-term compliance for increased levels of physical activity and the overall prevention of T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0127548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127548.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist for reporting information of a randomized trial.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127548.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127548.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Protocol as submitted to ethics.</title><p>Research methodology and procedures as submitted to ethics.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127548.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127548.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Approved IRB documents.</title><p>Informed consent form and information sheets as submitted to ethics</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127548.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0127548.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Raw data.</title><p>Tables reporting raw data for all primary and secondary variables assessed.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0127548.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge ISEAL, Victoria University for assistance with the western blot analyses In particular the authors would like to thank Rodrigo SF Oliveira, Cesare Granada and Martin Waterstraat who assisted with the western blot analysis.
