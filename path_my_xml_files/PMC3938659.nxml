Reperfusion injury causes damage that with current medical treatment is largely irreversible. It may occur in the prenatal, perinatal or postnatal periods. Interestingly, only the most severe injuries, accounting for only 25% of cases, are diagnosed at birth <xref rid="pone.0090258-Vannucci2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090258-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Clinically known as Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), it is more likely to occur in an immature brain rather than in the brain of a full-term neonate <xref rid="pone.0090258-Sidhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Damage resulting from hypoxic ischemia may lead to chronic conditions such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning disabilities, and epilepsy <xref rid="pone.0090258-Vannucci2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090258-Vannucci3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These conditions confer significant challenges to the affected individual, their family, and society. The remaining 75% of cases that consist of mild and moderate HIE may be diagnosed weeks or even months after the initial insult.</p><p>Despite extensive research, no treatment or intervention has been found to significantly improve or reverse these injuries, and the medical scientific community continues to search for therapeutic strategies which might at least minimize injury and improve behavioral function. Treatment using remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPC) can be either rapid or delayed; the former is applied immediately or within a few minutes after reperfusion <xref rid="pone.0090258-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> while delayed treatment is applied hours to weeks after reperfusion. Since rapid RIPC is only applicable for patients with HIE diagnosed immediately after birth, there exists an extremely short therapeutic time window which may make clinical application challenging <xref rid="pone.0090258-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In contrast, delayed RIPC (dRIPC) can be initiated on patients presenting anytime beyond few hours and may represent a practical new strategic intervention for HIE with delayed presentations.</p><p>The aim of this study is to determine if dRIPC is effective when applied to a neonatal HI rat model, through observation of 1) long term neuro-functional effects, 2) effect on brain volume and weight and 3) effect on systemic organ weights. Our interventions included a single treatment 24 hrs following the injury and three consecutive daily treatments following a 24 hr delay following the injury. Both groups were evaluated after five weeks to assess long term effects. We hypothesize that dRIPC applied 24 hrs after HI will improve long term sensorimotor deficits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University approved all the procedures and protocols in this neonatal HI rat model. Handing of animals was carried out in accordance with National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Animal model/Surgical procedure</title><p>Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat litters with 12&#x02013;13 pups per litter were obtained from Harlan Laboratories in Livermore, CA. A total of 37 pups were housed along with their dams and provided with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Due to the inability to determine gender in neonatal rats, unsexed pups were randomized into the following groups: Sham (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), HI induced (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), HI +24 hr dRIPC treatment (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) and HI +24 hr delayed RIPC with three consecutive daily treatments (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7). Three pups died during surgery or in the hypoxic chamber, resulting in a mortality rate of 8.1%.</p><p>The Rice&#x02013;Vannucci neonatal HI model was used in this study <xref rid="pone.0090258-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Surgery was performed under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. 10 day old rat pups were placed on a 37&#x000b0;C temperature-regulated surgical table, induced with 3% isoflurane (mixed with air and oxygen) and maintained during surgery with 1.5% isoflurane. Using sterile technique, a small midline incision was made on the anterior neck followed by a gentle blunt dissection to identify the right common carotid artery. Once isolated and separated from its surrounding structures the artery was ligated and transected. The sham group of rat pups underwent the same blunt dissection and right carotid artery isolation but no ligation or transection was done. Hemostasis was maintained throughout the procedure, and following the procedure the neck incision was sutured. The total surgical time including induction of anesthesia did not exceed 9 minutes. Rat pups were given a temperature regulated recovery period of 1 hr, then placed in a low-oxygen environment created using an air-tight glass chamber which was submerged in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath in which an 8% Oxygen and 92% nitrogen ambient environment was maintained. The pups were kept in this hypoxic chamber for 2.5 hrs and then returned to their dams. The dams and pups were then held in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator until all treatment procedures were complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Remote Ischemic Post-Conditioning (RIPC) treatment</title><p>RIPC consisted of four 10 minute cycles of hind limb ischemia and reperfusion in non-anesthetized unrestrained rat pups as previously described <xref rid="pone.0090258-Yilin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To produce limb ischemia, two ends of a cut rubber band were passed through a small rubber tube to form a reversible snare. Ischemia was induced by encircling this snare around each hind limb of the rat pups, and clamped using hemostatic forceps for 10 minutes. The clamp and rubber band were then released to allow reperfusion for 10 minutes. This was repeated four times. Limb ischemia was confirmed with observation of swelling and cyanosis of the limbs, and reperfusion was confirmed by return of the limbs to their original pink color.</p><p>RIPC was initiated 24 hrs after HI surgery for two treatment groups. The first group received a single treatment at 24 hrs, and the second group received three consecutive daily treatments: at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs. Following RIPC, animals were closely observed and all pups resumed their normal activities including walking, feeding and sleeping.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Neurobehavioral Tests</title><p>The following neurobehavioral tests were done in a blinded manner at five weeks after the HI.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Foot Fault</title><p>Tests motor coordination <xref rid="pone.0090258-Doycheva1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Rats were placed on a horizontal grid floor elevated above the surface and allowed to walk for 2 minutes. A foot fault was noted when the rat's foot miss&#x02013;stepped on the grid and the foot fell downwards through the opening between the grids. All four limbs were observed for misses. The total number of left and right foot faults was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Modified Grip Traction (Wire Hang)</title><p>A test to evaluate muscle strength <xref rid="pone.0090258-Pazaiti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Rats were placed at the base of a T shaped platform in a dark environment and were allowed to explore it until they chose to turn into one of the arms of the maze.

In this test rats attempted to find a hidden (submerged) platform in a pool of water using visual cues. Three trials were conducted on each of four consecutive days. All trials lasted a maximum of 60 seconds. The &#x0201c;cued&#x0201d; trials provide a visible platform above the water level where the rats were allowed to sit for 10 seconds after finding it or being guided to it. For the &#x0201c;spatial&#x0201d; trials, the platform was submerged under water and rats were released and allowed to swim in search of the platform. In this trial the time taken to find the platform over consecutive days represents spatial learning. For the &#x0201c;probe&#x0201d; trial, the platform was removed completely and rats were allowed to swim in search of the platform.</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>Beam Balance</title><p>A test of sensorimotor function. Rats were placed with all four limbs onto a stationary horizontal balance beam (50 cm long, 5 cm diameter) for a maximum of 60 seconds and the length walked without falling was recorded (with a 20 cm cut-off in either direction). Scores were assigned as follows: 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; walked beyond 20 cm, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; walked&#x0003c;20 cm, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; walked some length but fell, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; could not walk, but remained on balance beam, and 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; could not walk, could not remain on beam.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Evaluation of brain damage and systemic organ weight</title><p>The exclusive ipsilateral brain damage that occurs in HI model <xref rid="pone.0090258-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, is best evaluated for long term studies by hemispheric weight loss and been used as the primary variable to estimate brain damage in neonatal HI rats <xref rid="pone.0090258-Yilin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090258-Fathali1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090258-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>At five weeks after HI, the rats were euthanized and organs including brain, lung, liver, spleen and heart were harvested. Rats weren't perfused as it would interfere with accuracy in gross organ weights. The brain samples were assessed for gross tissue loss, after which the cerebellum and brainstem were removed. The brains were then divided into left and right hemispheres and weighed on a high-precision balance (sensitivity - 0.001 g). The results were expressed as the mass ratio of the ipsilateral (right) hemisphere compared with the contralateral (left) hemisphere. Gross weights of lung, liver, and spleen were also measured. Weights were expressed as the ratio of organ weight to body weight.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Evaluation of Brain Morphology</title><p>Brain tissue damage (microscopic tissue loss) was assessed and hippocampal (CA1) region was evaluated for neuronal density.

Our results show that 24 hr dRIPC improves long-term neurobehavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g002">2</xref>) and does not affect systemic organ weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g003">Fig 3B&#x02013;3E</xref>). dRIPC does not attenuate brain atrophy, shown both grossly and microscopically with no further disruption of hippocampal CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g004">4A&#x02013;4D</xref>). Hippocampus CA1 cells are more involved in cognitive as compared to motor function <xref rid="pone.0090258-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, our study shows an improved cognitive deficit caused by HI behaviorally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g001">Fig 1A, 1C</xref>) but no morphologic differences seen following dRIPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g004">Fig 4B, 4C</xref>). We were able to show long-term and dose-dependent improvement of sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments with treatment up to five weeks following HI. Single treatments as well as three consecutive daily treatments were shown to be beneficial with consecutive treatment possibly being of greater benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p><p>RIPC is a new experimented non-pharmacologic intervention and is an important therapeutic strategy that can be quickly and easily administered to protect the brain from an ischemic brain insult. The technique of RIPC is simple and can be performed by placing a tourniquet or an inflating a blood pressure cuff for brief periods of time. One of the advantages of this study is that we used hind limbs as the remote organ to induce brief episodes of ischemia, which is a more practical model, as upper limbs are more commonly used for intravenous administrating of fluids and medications. To our knowledge, our data are the first to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of dRIPC on an HI-induced neonatal rat model. Another advantage of this study is that a 24 hr delayed treatment is protective. Our study indicates a neurobehavioral improvement as well as a non-worsening brain injury both grossly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and microscopically with no further disruption of hippocampal CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g004">Fig 4B, 4C</xref>). This observation suggests that RIPC is a safe and easy to use therapeutic intervention that can be used as late as 24 hrs after the initial brain injury. We do not have a solid explanation that 24 hr dRIPC improved long term neurobehavioral deficits but did not significantly reduce brain tissue loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090258-g004">Fig 4D</xref>), but to acknowledge that infarction size alone may not reflect the protective effect of a neuroprotectant <xref rid="pone.0090258-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The third advantage is that dRIPC has long term benefit effects. We observed in this study that a delayed treatment of dRIPC improved neurological function at five weeks after the initial injury. We noticed that dRIPC has not been studied previously in a neonatal HI model. Future studies are needed to address potential molecular signaling pathways and the potential cause that dRIPC did not reduce brain atrophy but still improved neurological functions at five weeks after HI.</p><p>Even though three consecutive treatments may be more effective, more consecutive treatment plans such as five or even ten treatments were not used because experimentally RIPC is distressful for the neonatal limb to handle the ischemic cycles without anesthesia. This may be a potential disadvantage in patient care since distress will affect new born children and it may be difficult to obtain cooperation even though RIPC is a convenient, non invasive and all most pain free intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, a 24 hr delayed RIPC significantly improved long term sensory motor deficits in a neonatal rat model even five weeks after HI and three consecutive daily treatments seem being more beneficial. The results highlight dRIPC to be beneficial in neonates who have been diagnosed as late as 24 hrs following an ischemic brain injury by promoting a long term well being and alleviating its severe neurobehavioral deficits. Hence this study mandates further replication, mechanistic and clinical studies to be performed in order to promote this intervention as a bedside clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0090258-Vannucci1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Vannucci RC, Palmer C (1997) Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy: pathogenesis and neuropathology.
