and muscle strengthening related to respiration depending on the level of the Gross Motor
Function Classification System (GMFCS) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) through tests
of respiratory function and respiratory pressure. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 49
children with CP who were classified as below level III of the GMFCS were recruited for
this study. They were divided into three groups (i.e., GMFCS level I, GMFCS level II, and
GMFCS level III). All children took the pulmonary function test (PFT) and underwent
respiratory pressure testing for assessment of respiratory function in terms of lung
capacity and respiratory muscle strength. [Results] The GMFCS level III group showed
significantly lower scores for all tests of the PFT (i.e., forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and slow vital capacity (SVC))
and testing for respiratory pressures (maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal
expiratory pressure (MEP)) compared with the other two groups. The results of post hoc
analysis indicated that the GMFCS level III group differed significantly from the other
two groups in terms of FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, MIP, and MEP. In addition, a significant
difference in SVC was observed between GMFCS level II and III. [Conclusion] Children with
CP who had relatively low motor function showed poor pulmonary capacity and respiratory
muscle weakness. Therefore, clinical manifestations regarding lung capacity and
respiratory muscle will be required in children with CP who demonstrate poor physical
activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Gross motor function</kwd><kwd>Respiratory muscle strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a developmental disorder of movement and posture caused by a
nonprogressive lesion to the immature brain, which can induce a variety of developmental
motor disabilities and clinical presentations<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinically, movement-related disorders have
traditionally been classified according to type of muscle tone abnormality (i.e., spastic,
athetoid, and ataxic type) and involved limb (i.e., hemiplegic, diplegic, and quadriplegic
type)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Apart from the traditional
classification, it is an important clinical factor for evaluation of functional level for
motor ability in children with CP. Therefore, currently, the Gross Motor Functional
Classification System (GMFCS) has been widely adopted in clinical settings for diagnosis of
functional motor level in CP<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Along with motor disability, children with CP can have abnormality of respiratory function,
such as poor airway clearance, respiratory muscle weakness, and lung distensibility<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These symptoms are caused by consequences of neuromuscular impairment resulting from brain
injury. Numerous previous studies have reported a close association of respiratory function
with motor ability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to the best of
our knowledge, little evidence regarding differences in respiratory function depending on
functional level of motor ability in CP has been published. Therefore, in the current study,
we attempted to determine whether a difference in respiratory function could be found using
tests of pulmonary function and respiratory pressure according to the GMFCS level in
children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty-nine children with cerebral palsy were recruited for this study. Children with CP
participated according to the following criteria: (1) spastic diplegic and hemiplegic
cerebral palsy diagnosed by a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist from their brain MR
image, (2) belong to levels I, II, and III in assessment of the GMFCS, (3) cognitive and
language ability sufficient to perform respiratory function tests, and (4) no psychiatric or
neurological disease except cerebral palsy. Thirty-eight of the children had spastic
diplegic cerebral palsy (17 boys, age: 10.3&#x000b1;1.8), and 11 were children with spastic
hemiplegic cerebral palsy (8 boys, age: 10.9&#x000b1;1.2). According to their GMFCS levels, they
were divided into three different groups (i.e., GMFCS level I, GMFCS level II, and GMFCS
level III). Ultimately, there were 16, 13, and 20 children in the GMFCS level I, II and III
groups, respectively. All parents of the children gave written informed consent prior to
their child&#x02019;s participation in this experiment. The study protocol was approved by the local
ethics committee.</p><p>The pulmonary function test (PFT) and measurement of respiratory pressure were performed by
the same examiner throughout the entire experiment for evaluation of respiratory function,
such as lung capacity and respiratory muscle strength. All children took the tests in a
sitting position on a chair with a backrest. A spirometer (Vmax 229, SensorMedics, USA) was
used for the PFT. All children were asked to take a breath and then to blow out through a
mouth piece while in a sitting position, as deeply and rapidly as possible. The PFT was
completely conducted three times with a sufficient break between each trial for prevention
of hyperventilation. For the best trial of three, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), peak expiratory flow (PEF), slow vital
capacity (SVC), and tidal volume (TV) were acquired.</p><p>The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were adopted
for measurement of respiratory pressure for muscle strength related to respiration. These
tests assess the highest pressure that respiratory muscles are able to generate against an
occlusion at the mouth using a MicroRPM (Micro Direct Inc., Lewiston, ME, USA). Children
were instructed to breathe in or out against the occluded mouth piece with maximal voluntary
effort and as much force as possible while keeping the lips sealed tightly around the
mouthpiece and remaining in a sitting position.</p><p>The c<sup>2</sup> test and one-way ANOVA were performed for comparison of demographic
information (i.e., age, gender, height, weight, and body surface area) and respiratory
function (i.e., FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEF, SVC, TV, MIP, and MEP) among the three groups.
The LSD procedure was performed for post hoc analysis. Statistical software, PAWS 18.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), was used in analysis of all data, and statistical significance was
considered at the level of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Demographic information for the three groups according to levels of the Gross

the results of post hoc analysis using the LSD procedure, significant differences in FVC,

group, compared with the other two CP groups. A significant difference in SVC was observed
between the GMFCS level II and III groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current study, we found that children with CP who belonged to the GMFCS level III
group had significantly lower respiratory function and respiratory pressure compared with
the two other groups (i.e., GMFCS levels I and II). However, no significant difference was
observed between children in the GMFCS level I and II groups. These results indicate that
children with CP who walk with an assistive mobility device in most indoor settings have
poor lung capacities and respiratory muscle weakness. Accordingly, it would be highly
expected that children with CP who walk with an assistive mobility device in most indoor
settings could have accompanying non-parenchymal pulmonary dysfunctions due to poor
respiratory function and muscle weakness.</p><p>Decline of physical activity in pathologic conditions could lead to development of
peripheral muscle abnormalities and dysfunction due to muscle weakness, increased muscle
fatigue, and reduced oxidative capacity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several previous studies reported a close
association of respiratory function and muscle strength with amount of daily living
activities or functional exercise capacity in children with neurological disease<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, our findings were supported by those of many previous
studies, suggesting that deteriorated respiratory ability could be attributed to a decrease
in functional activity due to abnormal movement and ambulatory function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our results showed a significant difference in respiratory function and respiratory
pressure in the GMFCS level III group compared with the other two groups; the reason for
this would be the difference in independent walking ability. According to functional GMFCS
level, children categorized into GMFCS levels I and II had independent walking ability,
whereas those categorized into GMFCS level III usually had some limitations in indoor
environments that required use of self-support or walking-aid devices for independence<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, we reasoned that children who
could not walk independently would have low respiratory function and muscle strength due to
a decline in lung capacity accompanied by limitation of functional movement. In addition, no
significant difference between children categorized into GMFCS levels I and II in terms of
respiratory function and muscle strengthening would be due to the fact that their capacities
for physical activity were similar. This finding was supported by those of a previous study
reporting that no difference in aerobic capacity was observed between GMFCS levels I and II
in children with CP<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical function, such as cardiovascular fitness, is known to be closely related to
respiratory function<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In children, active physical activity accompanied by
normal motor development is essential for growth of organs related to respiration in terms
of respiratory muscles, lung parenchymal and airway structures. Our findings indicated that
decrease in functional motor ability as classified by the GMFCS could be accompanied by
respiratory function and respiratory muscle weakness. Therefore, careful evaluation of
respiratory ability and its related muscle function will be required in cases of children
with CP who have lower physical activity. We acknowledge that our study had the limitation
of a small sample size, especially with respect to children classified into GMFCS level II.
Further study will be needed for consideration of a larger sample size and various motor
assessment variables.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was conducted using some data from the corresponding author&#x02019;s (Hye Young Lee)
