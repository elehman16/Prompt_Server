and grip strength of patients with acute lateral epicondylitis and to suggest the
appropriate treatment frequency and period. [Subjects] The subjects were divided into
three: 2 days per week group (n=12), 3 days per week group (n=15), and 6 days per week
group (n=13). [Methods] All groups received conventional physical therapy for 40 minutes
and therapeutic exercises for 20 minutes per session during 6 weeks. The outcome
measurements were the visual analogue scale (VAS), Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation
(PRTEE), and grip strength. [Results] The results of this study were as follows: at 3
weeks, there were no significant differences in VAS and PRTEE in the 3 groups, but at 6
weeks, 6 days per week group significantly decreased these two outcomes. Grip strength was
significantly increased in 3 and 6 days per week groups at 6 weeks. [Conclusion] In
conclusion, physical therapy is needed 3 days per week for 3 weeks in patients with acute
lateral epicondylitis. After 3 weeks, 6 days per week is the most effective treatment
frequency.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Frequency of physical therapy</kwd><kwd>Lateral epicondylitis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition in which the outer part
of the elbow that attaches the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) sore and tender. It
causes pain, decreased muscle strength, and dysfunction in the arm<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pain and dysfunction decrease the work capacity,
quality of life, and increase medical costs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, there is greater chance that lateral epicondylitis can
recur and last for a long time after treatment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary goals of treatment of lateral epicondylitis are reduction in pain, preservation
of motion, flexibility, and strength, and development of endurance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. We routinely use the treatment methods of TENS, vibration,
and manipulation. In addition, we have used injection, braces, elbow mobilization with
movement technique, massage, tapping, and so on<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most patients with lateral epicondylitis
can be treated by conservative physical therapy; however, 3.3~8% of patients requir
surgery<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the various conservative treatments, exercise therapy is the most essential and
important treatment that can be effective when performed steadily<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also convenient and has little risk of side
effects<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. To date, many studies
regarding exercise programs for lateral epicondylitis have been completed. Svernl&#x000f6;v and
Adolfsson suggested that eccentric training and static stretching for 12 weeks can reduce
pain and increase grip strength in lateral epicondylitis<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finestone and Rabinovitch reported a reduction in pain and
improvement of elbow function through application of resistance exercise for 8 weeks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many other studies about the
effectiveness of exercise therapy for lateral epicondylitis. However, it is difficult to
decide the frequency and period of treatment because of the different designs of such
studies<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the purpose of this
study was to investigate the changes in pain, dysfunction, and grip strength of patients
with acute lateral epicondylitis and to suggest the appropriate protocol of treatment
frequency and period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed with 3 groups with a repeated measures design. The groups were
based on intervention frequency, with each group participating in a physical therapy program
for 2, 3, or 6 days per week. Subjects were evaluated before the intervention (pretest) and
after 3 and 6 weeks of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1. </label><caption><p> Experimental procedures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1037-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>We selected 18- to 65-year-old patients who had been diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis
within 6 weeks after onset and had experienced pain at more than 2 physical examinations in
Cozen&#x02019;s test (resistance test for the wrist extensor), Milll&#x02019;s test (maximal passive flexor
test for the wrist), and resisted middle finger test (resistance test for the middle
finger)<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We excluded subjects who had neurological manifestations, medial epicondylitis in the
ipsilateral elbow, or cervical, shoulder, or wrist functional disability; subjects who had
been treated within the past 4 weeks; subjects who required some other therapy (i.e.
pacemaker); subjects who had undergone surgery; subjects who had rheumatism, fracture,
arthritis, osteoporosis, or pain due to calcium deposition or other causes; and subjects who
had difficulty in communication. None of the subjects were on any medication during the
study. We explained the purpose of this study and obtained informed consent from the
subjects. The study&#x02019;s protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of
Sahmyook University in Seoul.</p><p>All subjects received general physical therapy consisting of heat therapy for 20&#x02005;min,
ultrasound (1&#x02005;MHz, 1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> continuous mode) for 5&#x02005;min, and TENS (100&#x02005;Hz). After
the pretest, we applied the exercise program in 2 stages for treating the lateral
epicondilitis. The first stage of the program was comprised of pain control, stretch
exercise for recovery to normal range of motion, isometric contraction exercises, grip
strength exercise using a soft ball, and stretch exercise as the final exercise. The second
stage consisted of wrist extensor stretching, eccentric contractions, concentric
contractions, grip exercise using a grip dynamometer, and stretch exercise as a final
exercise. The concentric contractions of the wrist were implemented with the elbow flexed
and pronated, and the eccentric contractions were implemented with the elbow extended and
pronated using a TheraBand. The grip exercise was comprised of 3 sets with 10&#x02013;15 repetitions
per set. In the interval between sets, the subjects had a break for one minute to prevent
fatigue.</p><p>The outcomes were measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> to rate pain and the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation
(PRTEE)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> to rate tennis elbow
functional disability. We measured grip strength with the shoulder flexed to 90&#x000b0; and the
elbow in maximal extension. In total, tests were repeated 3 times, and we provided a
1-minute break per set; we then computed the mean<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPSS version 18.0 software was used in performance of statistical analyses for the mean
and standard deviation. The normality of the distributions was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk
test. Descriptive statistics were used for general features, and one-way ANOVA was used for
each group&#x02019;s differences. To determine the differences between the 3 groups and within
groups, we used the repeated measure ANOVA. The statistical significance level (p) was less
than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Regarding the general characteristics of the subjects, no statistically significant

amount and method of the training is required. For the application of physical therapy,
physical therapists need to select the variables, such as frequency, intensity, duration,
type of muscle contraction, range of motion, speed of movement, and direction of movement.
In past studies, many adjustments have been made to frequency, intensity, and duration<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the VAS and PRTEE were applied to groups performing a 6-week exercise
program, which included general physical therapy, stretching, and resistance exercises using
a TheraBand. Fyfe and Stanish et al. reported that strengthening exercise is effective for
treating diseases or protecting injuries resulting from increases in the threshold of pain
in stressful situations<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Glazebrook et
al. also reported that an exercise program with appropriate stretching and strengthening
exercise for the lateral epicondylitis is very important in strengthening the tendon region
and improving the functional activities<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the effect test among the groups, the VAS and PRTEE scores of the 6 days per week group
showed significant differences at 6 weeks compared with the other groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the
effect test within the groups, all 3 groups showed a significant decrease according to the
interval (p&#x0003c;0.05). Regarding the pain scores, however, the decreases from 3 weeks to 6
weeks were greatest in the 6 days per week group. Regarding the dysfunction scores, the 3
days per week group and 6 days per week group showed significant differences compared with
the pretest. However, the decreases at 3 weeks and 6 weeks were greatest in the 6 days per
week group.</p><p>Above, the close relationship between the two scores and the large reductions in the
changes from 3 to 6 weeks compared with baseline to 3 weeks have relevance to the healing
process, including the end of the inflammation period, reformation of blood vessels,
reoccurring local circulation, and reconstruction of the synovial membrane<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. We think that after the healing process,
a greater physical therapy effect appears. In addition, there were no significant reductions
in pain between the pretest and after 3 weeks of intervention in the 3 days per week group
and 6 days per week group. Considering these factors, performance of therapy 3 days a week
within the initial 3 weeks and then 6 days a week appears to be efficient.</p><p>In the present study, there was no significant difference in grip strength in any group,
and in the effect test within groups, there were differences in the effects of the interval
in each group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In the within-group test, the 2 days per week group showed no significant changes in grip
strength, but the 3 days per week group and 6 days per week group did show significant
increases in grip power (p&#x0003c;0.05). It is considered that 2 days per week of exercise is
not enough. For strengthening the same muscle fiber, an exercise interval should be less
than 3 days<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The 6 days per week group
showed no significant increase in grip power compared with the 3 days per week group at 3
weeks. We think that is the result of overtraining for 6 days without rest in the early
inflammation period. Muscle fatigue resulting from overtraining causes lack of tissue
recovery, excessive physiological stress, and lack of energy for the body<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were some participants in the 6
days per week group who experienced muscle fatigue; so we adjusted the intensity of the
exercise. To decrease pain and increase muscle power, we think it is important to apply
training with an appropriate amount of rest.</p><p>This study had some limitations. Despite restraints concerning movements of the wrist and
hand for each participant, the compliance with the restraints could not be insured. In
addition, there was some difficulty in regulating the intervals between days of therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kohia</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Brackle</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Byrd</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effectiveness of physical therapy treatments on lateral
