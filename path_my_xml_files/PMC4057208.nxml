The B/A ratio may be a valuable measure, in addition to the total serum bilirubin (TSB), in the management of hyperbilirubinemia.

The primary outcome was neurodevelopment at 18 to 24 months' corrected age as assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III by investigators unaware of treatment allocation.

Demographic characteristics, maximal TSB levels, B/A ratios, and other secondary outcomes were similar. The rates of death and/or severe neurodevelopmental impairment for the B/A ratio versus TSB groups were 15.4% versus 15.5% (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0) and 2.8% versus 1.4% (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.62) for birth weights &#x02264;1000 g and 1.8% versus 5.8% (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03) and 4.1% versus 2.0% (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.26) for birth weights of &#x0003e;1000 g.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The additional use of B/A ratio in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants did not improve their neurodevelopmental outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn74465643/bilirubin+albumin">ISRCTN74465643</ext-link>

In accordance, the total bilirubin load together with Bf is thought to predict bilirubin neurotoxicity more reliably than the total serum bilirubin (TSB), as assessed by clinical and electrophysiological parameters, i.e. neurodevelopmental outcome and maturation of automated brain stem responses, respectively. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Wennberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099466-Watchko1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Nevertheless, only TSB and not Bf is incorporated in the clinical management of hyperbilirubinemia. Neither is it routine practice to measure Bf in clinical laboratories nor are FDA approved instruments commercially available. The bilirubin (TSB)/albumin (B/A) ratio, which could be a surrogate for Bf, might be a good additional parameter to TSB, to indicate an increased risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in preterm infants. To date, mainly retrospective data have favored an additional role for high B/A ratios as risk factors for bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity and only limited data exist regarding B/A ratios in the management and neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Hulzebos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> What is lacking are prospective clinical trials on the use of the B/A ratio in jaundiced preterm infants to evaluate its safety and clinical utility in preventing or reducing long-term bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity.</p><p>We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial on the management of preterm infants with hyperbilirubinemia to determine the effects of the additional use of B/A ratios on their neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 24 months after the expected date of delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Preterm infants of 31<sup>+6</sup> weeks' gestation or less (based on the first day of the last menstruation), were eligible for enrollment after admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during the first 24 hours after birth.

Parents, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Treatment</title><p>During the first ten days hyperbilirubinemia in infants in the B/A ratio group was evaluated daily using the B/A ratio together with TSB. Treatment decisions were based on the B/A ratio and the TSB level, whichever threshold was crossed first. We chose to use both thresholds in this study group because we considered the evidence from previous studies, regarding the safety of B/A ratio thresholds insufficient, to justify ignoring TSB thresholds.</p><p>TSB and albumin levels were also measured daily for infants in the TSB group (control group), but treatment was based on the TSB level only. TSB and albumin were measured using routine analytical methods. <xref rid="pone.0099466-vanImhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>
</p><p>The TSB treatment thresholds (in &#x003bc;mol/L) for phototherapy (PT) and exchange transfusion were uniform and consensus-based. The B/A ratio thresholds (in &#x003bc;mol/L divided by g/L&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003bc;mol/g) were also uniform and derived from the corresponding TSB values and albumin levels of 25 g/L and 30 g/L for infants with birth weights of &#x0003c; or &#x0003e;1250 g, respectively. <xref rid="pone.0099466-vanImhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Treatment nomograms depended on infants' birth weights and risk factors (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099466.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), and national guidelines for phototherapy and exchange transfusions were available on line. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Dijk1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary outcome was the composite motor score at 18 to 24 months' corrected age because previous retrospective data analyses of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Phototherapy Trial showed that peak bilirubin levels correlated with psychomotor developmental indices (PDI). <xref rid="pone.0099466-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> The 3rd Version of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID III) was used to assess fine and gross motor as well as cognitive functions by investigators who were unaware of the treatment allocations. Standardized, pediatric, neurologic evaluations were performed at the same age as the BSID III assessments. Cerebral palsy and mild neurological dysfunction were diagnosed using international criteria and definitions. <xref rid="pone.0099466-SurveillanceofCerebralPalsyinEurope1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Hearing and vision were assessed with standardized tests.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included death, neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), pre-defined clinical diagnoses, and potential adverse events. Neurodevelopmental impairment was defined as a composite motor score of &#x0003c;85 or a composite mental score of &#x0003c;85, any degree of cerebral palsy, any visual impairment, or any hearing impairment. Severe NDI was defined as a composite motor score of &#x0003c;70 or a composite mental score of &#x0003c;70, moderate or severe cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, or bilateral hearing loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In a consensus meeting of the Netherlands Neonatology Research Network a difference between the two treatment groups on the composite motor score &#x02265;7 points was considered clinically relevant. To detect this on a 100 point scale, SD 26, alpha 0.05, power 0.80, we planned to evaluate 434 infants. Accounting for 10% mortality and 20% incomplete follow-up, a total of 614 subjects needed to be included, i.e. 307 per group. Intentions to treat analyses were performed.</p><p>We pre-specified two subgroups: birth weights &#x02264;1000 g and birth weights of &#x0003e;1000 g with high B/A ratios. We selected these two birth weight groups because previous NICHD data showed an increase in mortality of approximately 20% in infants with birth weights &#x02264; 1000 g who had received PT. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Lipsitz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>
</p><p>Another subgroup analysis was performed to determine the contrast between the two groups. Exploratory analyses were performed of survivors and non-survivors.</p><p>We used the <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney test to compare continuous variables and the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Repeatedly measured variables, such as TSB, albumin and B/A ratio's, were pooled for each infant; mean, maximum or trough value's were calculated for each infant and used for further analyses. A two-sided P value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 18.0 software for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p><p>We did not plan an interim analysis on the primary outcome since these data would not be available before 18 to 24 months.

</p><p>In our RCT fewer deaths in the B/A ratio subgroup of infants with birth weights of &#x0003e;1000 g was not associated with less PT (data not shown) or with any significant differences in neonatal morbidities. The observed difference in mortality seemed biologically unrelated to the management of hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, this trial was not powered for mortality, and in particular not for mortality in subgroups, therefore caution should be exercised to interpret this finding, as it could be found by change. The mortality rate in this subgroup, 1.8%, was also less than the historical figure of approximately 6% kept by the Dutch Perinatal Registry for infants who had also been treated according to their TSB levels. Furthermore, the reduction in mortality between the two categories of our trial appeared to be consistent. We found a trend towards fewer deaths in the subgroup allocated to the B/A ratio group who had been treated at least once on the basis of their B/A ratios (&#x02212;9.3%, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.09) and who had statistically significant lower (mean) peak B/A ratios.</p><p>We cannot explain why mortality was not reduced in the B/A ratio subgroup with birth weights &#x0003c; 1000 g. We did not find significant differences in causes of death between the two treatment and birth weight categories, although there was a trend towards fewer infants who had necrotizing enterocolitis in the B/A ratio subgroup weighing &#x0003e;1000 g at birth (but not in the subgroup &#x0003c; 1000 g). Infants in this subgroup lived significantly longer compared to infants allocated to the TSB category (30&#x000b1;16 versus 10&#x000b1;7 days, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). Overall, peak B/A ratios were significantly higher in the non-survivors, whereas TSB and albumin levels were actually lower. We do not know whether the infants who died had a reduced anti-oxidant capacity due to lower albumin and bilirubin levels. This finding supported our original hypothesis that the additional use of the B/A ratio is a valuable parameter in hyperbilirubinemia management in preterms. It is tempting to speculate that it may be more appropriately to treat infants with PT when bilirubin is more harmful and the infant brain is more vulnerable to bilirubin neurotoxicity, i.e. when albumin levels are low. The pathophysiological conditions may involve respiratory and circulatory failure and sepsis, as was previously described. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Oh2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Oh et al. found that higher Bf levels are associated with a higher risk of death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome regardless of clinical status, while in stable infants higher TSB levels were associated with better outcomes. This finding also supports the potential benefits of using the B/A ratio in addition to the TSB level. It is a more useful indicator of the Bf level than using the TSB level alone. <xref rid="pone.0099466-Ahlfors2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099466-Ahlfors3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> Using the B/A ratio in addition to TSB levels may lead to reducing early mortality by a mechanism that is as yet unknown. Our unexpected finding that use of the B/A ratio in the management of preterms with birth weights of &#x0003e;1000 g reduces mortality needs to be confirmed by a larger study.</p><p>The findings of the current study also underscore the efficacy of phototherapy in managing hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants: only two babies in the entire cohort received an exchange transfusion and none of the infants in the current cohort exhibited neurological findings of classical kernicterus.</p><p>How can our results be translated into clinical practice? Incorporating B/A ratios in management guidelines does not seem an essential parameter to improve neurodevelopmental outcome, but it may reduce mortality in infants weighing &#x0003e;1000 g at birth. More specifically, the additional use of pre-defined B/A ratios did not allow for earlier or more intensive treatment and lower TSB levels. This was, at least in part, what we expected and was related to its add-on use. Approximately half of all infants in the B/A ratio group received PT at least once on the basis of the TSB level crossing its threshold and not on the basis of the B/A ratio, which would have resulted in unintentional undertreatment when using the B/A ratio as the sole threshold for treatment decision. We found no evidence for safe B/A ratio thresholds that would justify the sole use of B/A ratio rather than TSB thresholds. The contrast between the two treatment groups was thus diluted. Higher pre-specified albumin levels and lower B/A ratios would have resulted in more contrast, i.e. earlier treatment based on the B/A ratio. Actually, the mean albumin levels were slightly higher than the albumin levels that we used to predefine the BA ratio threshold. Based on these relatively low differences, we anticipated a rather small contrast. Another explanation for the absence of an effect of the additional use of the B/A ratio on neurodevelopmental outcome could be the relatively low treatment thresholds: the majority of preterms received PT. To date, the applied thresholds were consensus&#x02013;based. The results of our RCT provided some evidence of the benefits without causing any harm. We demonstrated that the additional use of the B/A ratio does not result in harmful PT.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In preterm infants of 32 weeks' gestation or less with hyperbilirubinemia we found no significant effect of the additional use of B/A ratio compared to TSB-based treatment on the composite motor score at 18 to 24 months' corrected age.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0099466.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
