Each year more than 650,000 children visit emergency departments (EDs) in the United States with apparently minor blunt head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 14 to 15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan, the reference standard test for the emergent diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children with blunt head trauma, exposes children to ionizing radiation which has been linked to the development of brain tumors, leukemia, and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, although radiation exposure from a single head CT scan may not significantly increase an individual&#x02019;s risk of cancer, patients often undergo multiple CT examinations over their lifetime and the cumulative radiation dose may exceed the 50&#x000a0;mSv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] threshold that has been linked to the development of cancer among atomic bomb survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One method to reduce CT use in patients with blunt head trauma is through evidence-based clinical prediction rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In 2009, Kuppermann <italic>et al</italic>. derived and validated two clinical prediction rules to accurately identify children at very low risk for clinically-important TBIs (ciTBIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The rules were developed from a cohort of more than 42,000 children with minor blunt head trauma among 25 EDs in the United States. They have been externally validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and are accurate for use in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two rules were created, one for children younger than 2&#x000a0;years and a second for children between 2 and 18-years-old. The rules and study data allow for the classification of children into three risk groups: high risk, for whom a CT scan is recommended (risk of ciTBI for the younger than 2 and 2 to 18-years-old age groups is 4.4% and 4.3%, respectively); moderate risk, for whom observation or a CT scan are reasonable options depending on parental preference, clinician experience, and other factors (risk of ciTBI for the younger than 2 and 2 to 18-years-old age groups is 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively); and low risk, for whom a CT scan is typically not recommended (risk of ciTBI for the younger than 2 and 2 to 18-years-old age groups is &#x0003c;0.02% and &#x0003c;0.05%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the prediction rules recommend observation or a CT scan as reasonable options for children in the moderate risk group, the rules provide little guidance for clinicians regarding how to weigh each of these factors and engage parents in the decision-making process.</p><p>Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process of decision-making in medicine that has several key features: the involvement of the patient (or parent, in a child&#x02019;s case) and the clinician, a sharing of information by both parties, and both parties taking steps to reach an agreement about which management option to implement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While SDM may occur in a routine discussion during a clinical encounter, clinical decision-support tools may be necessary to effectively present comparative effectiveness research findings in a way that facilitates SDM. Decision aids provide the best scientific evidence available to support decision-making, prompt clarification of patient values and preferences, and have become increasingly used to provide the necessary decision support for SDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate SDM between clinicians and parents of children with minor head trauma at low-moderate risk for ciTBI, we sought to develop and test a decision aid, &#x02018;Head CT Choice&#x02019;. Specifically, we aimed to incorporate risk estimates for ciTBI from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) prediction rules, along with the perspectives of parents and other stakeholders, in an iterative development process to produce a decision aid that is ready for testing. We hypothesized that use of the decision aid will significantly increase parents&#x02019; knowledge and satisfaction and safely tailor the rate of cranial CT scan and seven-day healthcare utilization to risk-informed parent preferences. In this manuscript, we describe the methods and protocol used to develop and refine the Head CT Choice decision aid and how we will test its effectiveness in a multicenter randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This practical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] multicenter clinician-level parallel randomized trial compares an intervention group receiving a structured risk assessment and corresponding decision aid (Head CT Choice) to a control group receiving usual care. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval has been obtained from the Mayo Clinic IRB (approval number: 13&#x02013;004659), the University of Minnesota IRB (approval number: 1401&#x000a0;M46802), the Children&#x02019;s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota IRB (approval number: 1312&#x02013;117) and the University of California Davis IRB (approval number: 587396). The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT02063087).</p></sec><sec><title>Study setting</title><p>The decision aid was developed and refined at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (United States). The clinical trial will take place in five EDs in the United States: four in Minnesota and one in California: Mayo Clinic (an academic ED serving a largely rural population), University of Minnesota Amplatz Children&#x02019;s Hospital (a university-based academic freestanding children&#x02019;s hospital ED serving a largely urban population), Children&#x02019;s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota Minneapolis (a private but academic freestanding children&#x02019;s hospital ED serving a largely urban population), Children&#x02019;s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota St. Paul (a private but academic freestanding children&#x02019;s hospital ED serving a largely urban population), and University of California, Davis Medical Center (a university-based academic ED serving a largely urban population).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient and stakeholder engagement in the trial</title><p>Parents and other key stakeholders were engaged early on in the design of this trial and will continue to be engaged throughout the entire investigation; they will comprise the Patient and Stakeholder Advisory Council (PSAC). The PSAC consists of an ED Patient Advisory Council (PAC) and a parent representative. The ED PAC consists of five individuals who have contributed the patient&#x02019;s perspective to several practice and quality improvement initiatives at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester over the years - a Masters level ED quality specialist, three patients, and a nurse representative. The ED PAC reviewed and provided feedback on the study design and grant proposal and will continue to inform on the conduct of the trial, interpretation of the results, and dissemination of the study findings. The parent representative, who both provides her own perspective and serves as a liaison for the views of the ED PAC, has experience as a parent of a child with minor head trauma who was evaluated in the ED. The parent representative assisted in the development and iterative refinement of the Head CT Choice decision aid, provided feedback on the grant proposal submitted for funding, selected the primary outcome for the study, is an active member on the investigative steering committee, and participates in the study as a co-investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria and participant identification</title><p>Eligible participants will be parents seeking care for a child or adolescent who is less than 18-years-old, has experienced blunt head trauma (above the eyebrows and not isolated to face or eyes) within 24&#x000a0;hours, and has at least one of the PECARN risk factors for ciTBI (except for the two higher risk variables of altered mental status or signs of skull fracture) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Randomizing at the clinician level will obviate the risk of contamination associated with randomizing at the patient level. To decrease the risk of contamination by the sharing of information regarding the intervention between clinicians, we will emphasize to participating clinicians the importance of not sharing information about the intervention with their colleagues during the enrollment period. In addition, study coordinators will monitor for contamination at the time of patient enrollment and through review of the video recordings of clinician-patient discussions. Clinicians will be dynamically randomized and stratified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] by site and by whether their primary clinical training is in a pediatric specialty (pediatrics or pediatric emergency medicine) or another specialty (such as general emergency medicine, family practice, or internal medicine). Informed consent to participate in the study and have their clinical encounters audio and video recorded will be obtained from clinicians at each site prior to enrollment. After clinician consent is obtained, a statistician will centrally randomize the clinician and communicate the study arm assignment to the site principle investigator and study coordinator. This centralized process will effectively conceal allocation prior to randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant identification and recruitment</title><p>Study coordinators will identify potentially eligible parent/patient dyads based on a chief complaint related to head trauma recorded at the time of ED registration and communication with treating clinicians in real-time. Senior resident physicians who often first evaluate the patient in the settings in which the trial will be conducted will be instructed to obtain the PECARN risk factors when conducting the initial history and physical examination and to not discuss the diagnostic options with the parent (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Once these data have been obtained, the clinical predictors will be communicated to the study coordinator to determine if the patient has at least one of the (non-high-risk) PECARN predictors and meets all other eligibility criteria. The study coordinator will record these data on the eligibility assessment case report form (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Once patient eligibility is confirmed, study coordinators will obtain written informed consent from the parent(s) and assent from the patient to participate in the study and video record the discussion with their clinician.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention arm</title><sec><title><bold><italic>Development and refinement of the decision aid</italic></bold></title><p>A multidisciplinary research team including clinicians, health service researchers, a graphic designer, a radiation physicist, and patient representatives collaboratively developed the initial Head CT Choice decision aid. Using methods we have employed to develop other decision aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we designed and refined Head CT Choice through an iterative process that involved design of an initial prototype, refinement based on the feedback received, use of the prototype in simulated parent/patient dyads in the ED setting, and use in ED clinical encounters in the flow of patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the original PECARN minor blunt head trauma study, only a summary estimate of the risk of ciTBI in the moderate risk group (0.9% for younger than two years and 0.8% for two years and older) was reported in the published manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To maximize the granularity of risk estimates provided to parents, we obtained the PECARN public use database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and calculated the precise risk of ciTBI based on the presence of any (non-high-risk) isolated PECARN risk factor (such as vomiting) or the combination of up to two simultaneous risk factors (such as vomiting and loss of consciousness). For patients whose physicians are randomized to the intervention arm, the clinician will be shown the specific risk estimate for their patient, including the exact proportion and 95% CI. In the case of a patient with two risk factors, the clinician will be shown the risk estimate, exact proportion, and 95% CI for each isolated risk factor and for the combination of the two risk factors. Patients with more than two PECARN risk factors (in addition to those with either of the high risk factors) will be excluded from enrollment due to the very few numbers and the higher risk for these patients. In the trial, coordinators will select the decision aid that corresponds to the risk for ciTBI of that isolated risk factor or, in the case of two risk factors, the highest risk estimate displayed.</p><p>In the process of decision aid development and refinement the following themes consistently emerged: (1) clarifying the differences between concussion and TBI, given recent social media attention on concussion; (2) communication of individual patient risk using natural frequencies, a consistent denominator, a prose description of the natural frequencies, and pictographs; (3) limiting the amount of information to that which is relevant to the decision at hand and best facilitates a conversation between the parent and clinician without undue focus on the decision aid itself; and (4) clearly outlining the choice of a head CT scan during the ED visit, home observation if no CT scan is obtained, or having the clinician make the decision on the parent&#x02019;s behalf.</p><p>The Head CT Choice decision aid (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) is a three-page paper tool that takes into account each of these key themes in numerically ordered sections to facilitate dialogue between the clinician and the parent. The decision aid first graphically highlights key differences between concussions and other types of significant brain injuries and communicates the child&#x02019;s risk for ciTBI. The second page clearly outlines the decision that is to be made (head CT scan in the ED versus home observation) and educates the parent on the concerning signs and symptoms of TBI and the indications for return visit to the ED should they opt for home observation without a CT scan. Next, a table compares the key advantages and disadvantages of each management option and invites the parent to circle the issues that are most important to them. Finally, the decision aid outlines the three management options: head CT scan in the ED versus further observation at home with no CT scan, or having the ED clinician decide on the parent&#x02019;s behalf. It also includes check boxes to document the decision along with a reminder that they will have the opportunity to revisit the decision with their clinician while in the ED. The third and final page includes a space to provide a contact phone number should the parent need to contact a healthcare provider after leaving the ED.</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>Training</italic></bold></title><p>Participating clinicians at each study site were invited to attend a one-hour grand rounds lecture on the use of the decision aid, which included a demonstration of the tool. Clinicians randomized to the intervention arm will also be provided with brief video clips demonstrating use of the decision aid, which site principal investigators will review with the participating clinicians and will also be available for review at their convenience. Study staff will also be available at the point-of-care to provide brief, individualized re-training to clinicians on an as-needed basis. They will also offer reminders of how to use the decision aid when deviations in the quality of delivery are observed in real-time or reviewed on the video recordings of the clinical encounter.</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>Usual care</italic></bold></title><p>For parent/patient dyads cared for by clinicians randomized to the usual care arm, the clinician will discuss the management options with the parent in that clinician&#x02019;s usual fashion.

With the decision aid developed, we will conduct a multicenter clinician-level parallel randomized trial to measure the effectiveness of the decision aid on patient-centered outcome measures, safety, and healthcare utilization in parents of children with minor head trauma. In the context of prior and ongoing work on the development and implementation of the PECARN clinical prediction rules, the current study informs and expands on the incorporation of parental preferences, clinician experience, and other factors that influence the decision of whether to obtain a head CT scan in children at moderate risk for ciTBI. We anticipate that the development and testing of a decision aid for use in this moderate risk group will equip clinicians with the tools needed to educate, empower, and engage parents in the decision-making process. Use of this aid will also facilitate risk communication, thus strengthening the doctor-patient relationship in the context of an emergency care interaction limited by time, the lack of continuity of care, and the need for clinicians to provide care for multiple patients simultaneously.</p><p>Given that we are randomizing at the clinician level, there is some risk of contamination if clinicians randomized to usual care get access to the decision aid and gain experience with using it in clinical encounters with parents of children with minor head trauma. We will take several steps to minimize the risk of contamination. First, we will emphasize to clinician participants the importance of not sharing the decision aid with their colleagues. We will also have study coordinators monitor for this in the process of conducting the trial. Second, using the PECARN public access dataset, we have generated a calculator that provides individual risk estimates for each of the isolated PECARN risk factors and for any two risk factors combined, in addition to the exact proportions and 95% CI&#x02019;s. We have verified the accuracy of these risk estimates with the principal investigator of the PECARN head trauma study (NK), and these estimates are not accessible to clinicians at the point-of-care. Third, only the site coordinators will have access to copies of the decision aid and clinicians will not be provided a copy of the decision aid in the usual care arm. Fourth, site coordinators will be carefully trained to confirm the accuracy of each of the PECARN variables and to obtain sign-off from the treating clinician, but to keep the clinician blinded to the risk estimate for ciTBI unless that clinician is randomized to the decision aid. Fifth, we will make every effort to obtain video and audio data of the discussion between the clinician and the patient regarding whether to obtain a head CT scan during the ED visit or to further observe their child at home in both the intervention and control arms, and we will monitor for contamination by review of these data. Finally, if contamination does occur, we anticipate this will bias the effect estimates in each arm toward the null hypothesis.</p><p>It is likely that not all clinicians will be willing to participate in the trial or have their discussions with the patient to be video recorded. However, in previous (14) and ongoing trials over 90% of the clinicians have agreed to participate. In addition, we have &#x0003e;99% power to detect the degree of difference in patient engagement in the decision making process that has been observed on video-recordings in prior trials, so we anticipate having sufficient power to detect a difference in this outcome measure even if some clinicians do not provide consent to video-recording.</p><p>Obtaining head CT scans in children at a very low risk of TBI unnecessarily exposes children to the potentially harmful effects of radiation and increases healthcare utilization. Developing and testing the effect of a patient-centered decision aid, Head CT Choice, in a pragmatic multicenter clinician-level parallel randomized clinical trial has the potential to more closely tailor CT use to risk-informed parental preferences and improve the experience of care for parents of children with minor head trauma in the context of a busy and overcrowded ED care delivery system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrollment started April 1, 2014 and we anticipate enrollment will be complete in March 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ciTBI: Clinically-important traumatic brain injury; CT: Computed tomography; DCS: Decisional conflict scale; DSMB: Data safety and monitoring board; ED: Emergency department; GCS: Glasgow coma scale; IRB: Institutional review board; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; OPTION: Observing patient involvement in decision-making; PAC: Patient advisory council; PECARN: Pediatric emergency care applied research network; PSAC: Patient and stakeholder advisory council; SDM: Shared decision-making; TBI: Traumatic brain injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EH: conceived, designed, and obtained funding for the study, and drafted and provided critical revisions to the manuscript.

The DA communicates the child&#x02019;s risk for traumatic brain injury using a prose description of natural frequencies and a pictogram (for children with a risk of clinically-important brain injury of at least 0.5%, a pictogram of 100 will be used; for children with a risk of clinically-important brain injury of less than 0.5%, a pictogram of 1000 will be used). The second page clearly outlines the decision that is to be made (head CT scan in the ED versus home observation with no CT scan) and educates the parent in what to watch for and what should prompt a return visit to the ED should they, in collaboration with their clinician, opt for home observation. There is also a table that compares the key advantages and disadvantages of each management option (speed of diagnosis, radiation exposure, pharmacological sedation, cost, potential downsides, and the likely duration of waiting in the ED) and invites the parent to circle the issues that are most important to them. Finally, the DA outlines the three management options (head CT scan in the ED, further observation at home, or having the ED clinician decide on the parent&#x02019;s behalf) and includes check boxes to document the decision along with a reminder to the parent that they will have the opportunity to revisit the decision with their clinician while in the ED.
