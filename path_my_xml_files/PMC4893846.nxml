The primary end point of both trials was the annual rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations. Eligible patients were aged &#x02265;40&#x02005;years and had a history of COPD, a smoking history of &#x02265;10 pack-years and a forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of &#x02264;70% predicted and an FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &#x02264;0.70 after bronchodilator use; they also had a history of at least one documented moderate or severe disease exacerbation in the year before screening. Patients with a prior history of asthma were eligible if they had a current diagnosis of COPD, but those with a current diagnosis of asthma were excluded. For 4&#x02005;weeks prior to randomisation, patients received an open-label combination of fluticasone propionate (250&#x02005;&#x003bc;g) and SAL (50&#x02005;&#x003bc;g) two times per day to establish adherence to treatment and a stable baseline. In both studies, patients were randomised to receive one time per day fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 50/25, 100/25 or 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, or one time per day VI 25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g monotherapy using the ELLIPTA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref></sup> dry powder inhaler.</p><p>These clinical trials had identical study designs to the two trials of SFC versus SAL that were used in the cluster analysis by DiSantostefano <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> with the exception of study medication, and presented the unique opportunity to validate the previously identified clusters of patients who benefited from the addition of an ICS in COPD. The previously identified cluster modelling was therefore applied to the FF/VI versus VI data in an attempt to validate the findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cluster analysis methodology</title><p>This exploratory retrospective analysis was performed using a modified recursive partitioning algorithm to carry out supervised cluster analysis that identified new groups of patients who responded better to an ICS/LABA combination compared with an LABA alone. The data-driven algorithm maximised differential responses to treatment between clusters in terms of exacerbation reduction (FF/VI vs VI), based on clinical characteristics from the intent-to-treat populations. For these analyses, all strengths of FF/VI were collapsed and considered as one treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Variables</title><p>The baseline characteristics considered to identify clusters of patients are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010099TB1">table 1</xref>. In the case of missing values for continuous variables, the median value for the full data set was used as an imputed value. For categorical variables, the value of the most frequent category was used as an imputed value. Missing values were generally infrequent and only imputed for variables in the clustering model. The standard rpart clustering methodology addresses missing values by including only observations (patients) with non-missing values. Considering the size of this data set, missing values for variables in the clustering model were imputed to optimise the data and to be consistent with previously conducted cluster analyses.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To avoid confounding by similar variables (eg, membership of a specific age group such as 65&#x02013;75&#x02005;years vs age as a continuous variable), each variable was assessed for co-linearity with every other variable using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Where two similar variables exhibited a Pearson correlation coefficient value of &#x02265;0.7, only one variable was retained. Baseline information was summarised for each cluster. As cluster analysis requires a sufficiently large overall sample size (&#x0003e;&#x0223c;500 patients) to identify maximum differences in response in a robust manner, the algorithms were set to allow clusters of no &#x0003c;100 patients.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010099TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Variables considered for the initial cluster analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demography and medical history</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)<break/>Sex<break/>Race<break/>Ethnicity<break/>Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<break/>Pneumococcal vaccination status (baseline)<break/>Influenza vaccination status (baseline)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">COPD and exacerbation history</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of COPD, bronchitis/emphysema, moderate and severe exacerbation variables at baseline, smoking status/history<break/>Outcome data: mean annual moderate/severe exacerbation data to reproduce primary end point modelling</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concomitant medication assessment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medications at run-in/prior medications (including ATC codes and flags to identify prior period if needed)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome/efficacy assessments</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations as defined in the two clinical trials.

In brief, the frequency of each variable was examined for sparse values prior to inclusion into the tree with the minimal subgroup set at 100 patients. The best split of the tree was determined by maximising the treatment differences between clusters, and cluster membership was assigned to patients based on the selected tree. Splits in the clustering tree (including the value on which the tree splits for continuous variables) are determined by the clustering algorithm. The primary model for the FF/VI versus VI studies was used in maximising treatment differences between clusters. The primary model from the trials was a negative binomial model of the number of moderate and severe exacerbations adjusted for smoking status at screening, geographical region, FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted at randomisation and Study 1 versus Study 2 indicator variable, with log time on treatment per patient as an offset. Imbalances in baseline characteristics by treatment within each cluster were also evaluated and added to the final model (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were used to estimate the differences in annual mean exacerbation rates for each cluster. Internal validation was performed using a split sample, so that a random sample of 50% of the patients was selected to create the tree and the remaining half was used for the computation of RRs and CIs to test statistical significance. Baseline variables within each cluster are presented as proportions for categorical variables and medians (interquartile range) for continuous variables. Differences between variables in clusters were assessed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Validation</title><p>To validate the clusters from the previous analysis of SFC versus SAL,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the same negative binomial model and final clusters from the recursive partitioning tree from that analysis were evaluated using the FF/VI versus VI data. The SFC versus SAL model was adjusted for baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, reversibility status (yes/no for &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x02005;mL improvement) and investigator region as a random effect, with log time on treatment per patient as an offset. The prior clusters were considered validated if the resulting RRs were in the same direction, and the p value for the overall treatment by cluster interaction was &#x0003c;0.05 utilising the FF/VI versus VI data. The clusters were also considered conceptually validated if the new clusters identified from the FF/VI versus VI data were defined by similar characteristics as the SFC versus SAL clusters (reversibility and/or diuretic use).

The clusters were defined by blood eosinophil levels (as a percentage of white cell counts) and smoking history (in pack-years). Using the primary trial model, cluster 1 included patients with blood eosinophils &#x0003e;2.4% (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.78), cluster 2 included patients with blood eosinophils &#x02264;2.4% and a smoking history of &#x02264;46 pack-years (RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) and cluster 3 included patients with blood eosinophils &#x02264;2.4% and a smoking history of &#x0003e;46 pack-years (RR=1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.60). Patients in clusters 1 and 2 exhibited statistically significant reductions in mean annual exacerbation rate, whereas no reduction was observed for those in cluster 3.</p><p>Within clusters, the number of hospitalisations due to exacerbations, number of steroid/antibiotic-treated exacerbations, COPD type (bronchitis and emphysema), ethnicity and reversibility subgroup at baseline were imbalanced (p&#x0003c;0.05) by treatment (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S1). These variables were therefore added to the model of moderate-to-severe exacerbations for the final model used in this analysis. After controlling for explanatory variables from the original clinical trial model and imbalances within clusters, treatment with FF/VI reduced the rate of annual moderate and severe exacerbations by 22% (RR=0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.88) compared with VI alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010099F1">figure 1</xref>).

The blood eosinophil level was the primary driver of treatment response, with a greater treatment effect observed in patients with blood eosinophil levels &#x0003e;2.4% when treated with FF/VI versus VI alone. The treatment effect was generally linear, with the mean exacerbation rate decreasing as eosinophil levels increased. Patients with blood eosinophils &#x02264;2.4% were further differentiated by smoking history. Patients with a shorter smoking history (&#x02264;46 pack-years) responded well to the combined treatment, but those with longer smoking history did not respond.</p><p>This analysis was unable to validate the previously identified clusters from the analysis of SFC versus SAL, where patients using diuretics and those who were reversible (&#x0003e;12%) but not using diuretics showed a significant reduction in exacerbation when treated with SFC versus SAL. Patients who were not using diuretics and who were not reversible did not show a treatment benefit of SFC versus SAL, but they did show a treatment benefit with FF/VI versus VI. The inability of this analysis to validate the clusters previously identified in the analysis of SFC versus SAL<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> is potentially due to differences between the patient populations. Besides different treatments across studies, one of the biggest differences was that the SFC versus SAL studies were primarily conducted in the USA and Canada, whereas the FF/VI versus VI studies included a global patient population. Other differences that may explain the inconsistent results were that patients in the SFC versus SAL studies tended to have greater airflow limitation, fewer exacerbations at baseline and less medication use.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Limiting the FF/VI analysis to North America still did not validate the prior findings, suggesting that other factors contribute to differences between the trial populations. Most notably, guidelines for COPD management and diagnosis of COPD evolved during the time between the studies and may have resulted in differences in the populations recruited into the two sets of clinical trials.</p><p>A key strength of this analysis is that it was conducted using data from two large, global clinical trials,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the results have therefore been generated from a robust data set of controlled trials with thorough data collection. On the other hand, the limitations of these clinical trials are also limitations of our analysis and, in particular, the generalisability of our findings is limited to patients with a history of exacerbations, as per the study inclusion criteria. Although cluster analysis is a useful tool to provide important information about differential treatment response among some clusters of patients who may not respond in a manner similar to the total clinical trial population, the standard limitations of any cluster analysis apply.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These analyses are hypothesis-generating using a data-driven algorithm and depend on the baseline patient data collected, and the results may or may not be clinically meaningful. For example, history of asthma was not collected in the trial and, therefore, could not be described by a cluster. Eosinophils are established as a measure of inflammation in asthma phenotypes;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> therefore, similar to the previous cluster analysis,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> patients with asthma&#x02013;COPD overlap could be a potential explanation for some of the observed treatment effect. Although history of asthma was not collected, the clustering algorithm did not split on reversibility variables and similar percentages of each cluster exhibited &#x02265;12% reversibility and &#x02265;200&#x02005;mL improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>. In addition, the discrimination of asthma from COPD in clinical practice for some patients is difficult, particularly for patients presenting with smoking-related COPD. The analysis also relied on the baseline data collected regarding the variables in the clustering model; 77 patients had missing eosinophil per cent data, no patients had missing data on smoking pack-years and small numbers of patients (0&#x02013;44) had missing data for one of the variables included in the model. Owing to the size of the data set, these missing values were imputed, but the results did not appreciably change in sensitivity analyses where values were not imputed. Other limitations to cluster analysis include that the algorithm cannot adjust for multiple comparisons, which could yield spurious results. We were unable to externally validate the clusters defined by eosinophils and smoking history using the SFC versus SAL data because baseline eosinophil levels were not collected in the SFC versus SAL studies. This is an important limitation in light of the fact that the findings from the previous cluster analysis of SFC versus SAL were not able to be externally validated within the present analysis.</p><p>Eosinophil levels are becoming established as a clinically relevant biomarker of oral corticosteroid and ICS response in COPD<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;23</xref> and also in asthma.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> Earlier work focused on sputum eosinophils, but blood eosinophils are now being accepted as an alternative measurement that is more practical to use in a clinical setting.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The clinical relevance of the 2.4% cut-off in blood eosinophil levels requires additional exploration; however, it lies between the 3% value commonly used to define sputum eosinophilia<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In particular, this work complements the post hoc subgroup analysis of the same clinical trials of FF/VI versus VI that was conducted by Pascoe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> That analysis found that patients with COPD with blood eosinophils &#x02265;2% at baseline experienced a reduction in exacerbation rates of 29% (p&#x0003c;0.001) when treated with FF/VI (all strengths) versus VI alone; the corresponding reduction in patients with eosinophils &#x0003c;2% was 10% (p=0.283). This analysis additionally found progressively greater exacerbation reduction when eosinophils were stratified into &#x0003c;2%, 2% to &#x0003c;4%, 4% to &#x0003c;6% and &#x02265;6%, which is consistent with the generally linear trend that we have observed. The results from the present analysis confirm these findings while using a different and data-driven methodology, reinforcing eosinophil levels as an important biomarker of ICS treatment response. Owing to the generally linear relationship between eosinophils and treatment, the recursive partitioning algorithm split for the data around the median, which may not be a true inflection point in the data; although the split chosen in the data is consistent with the existing literature on eosinophils. Also of note, due to the cluster analysis methodology and the correlation between eosinophil per cent and eosinophil count in the data set, eosinophil per cent was kept as a variable on which the algorithm could split the tree rather than count. Eosinophil per cent was kept based on fewer missing values relative to count<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and use in previous analyses.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> As a sensitivity analysis, eosinophils were added as an explanatory variable in the base modelling and the tree was not allowed to split on them. The resulting tree was based on smoking history, with the split at 46 pack-years (data not shown). The group of non-responders from this analysis (ie, patients with lower eosinophil levels and a smoking history of &#x0003e;46 pack-years) has been previously identified.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Further investigation of patients with lower eosinophils and variable smoking history is needed.</p><p>If these findings regarding blood eosinophils being predictive of ICS treatment response can be validated externally, they may provide important information on disease phenotypes that benefit most from the addition of ICS to LABA therapy and inform on the benefit&#x02013;risk profile of ICS-containing regimens. Sputum eosinophilia has been identified in 20&#x02013;40% of patients with COPD,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and a simple blood test may allow for straightforward identification of ICS responders in clinical practice.</p><p>To be useful in clinical practice, external validation of these results, potentially through clinical trials, is required along with further investigations to identify the relevant cut-off points for blood eosinophil levels. In addition, the relevance of smoking history also warrants further investigation. Within asthma, the identification of blood eosinophils has provided a step forward for the identification of patients who benefit from the use of anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody treatments, potentially opening the door to a new treatment option within asthma.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Such advances within COPD, particularly with regard to minimising exacerbations, may also contribute to more optimised disease management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Hao Li, a former employee of GSK, for his contribution to the statistical analyses.
