Whilst IVF treatment is increasingly used to help such couples to conceive, it can be complicated by the potentially life-threatening complication ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (<xref rid="dex253C10" ref-type="bibr">Delvinge and Rozenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C39" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Humaidan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C40" ref-type="bibr">Toftager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Of 387 399 cycles carried out in Europe in 2012 (for whom complete data was available), 7.1% of cycles started were cancelled prior to oocyte retrieval and 19.4% of cycles started did not have a fresh embryo transfer (<xref rid="dex253C3" ref-type="bibr">Calhaz-Jorge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The most frequent reasons cited for cycle cancellation prior to embryo transfer were either due to an insufficient response to stimulation, or due to concern of ovarian over-response and OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C22" ref-type="bibr">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, 2016</xref>). Thus, there remains a clinical need to improve triggering of oocyte maturation to optimize both the efficacy and safety of IVF treatment.</p><p>Many aspects of the IVF protocols used to achieve controlled ovarian stimulation, oocyte maturation and embryo formation aim to simulate the physiological processes observed in the normal human menstrual cycle. One of the major causes of OHSS is the use of hCG to trigger oocyte maturation during IVF treatment (<xref rid="dex253C10" ref-type="bibr">Delvinge and Rozenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C39" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Humaidan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C40" ref-type="bibr">Toftager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). hCG is an effective trigger of oocyte maturation, but its pharmacokinetic properties (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> 38 h) (<xref rid="dex253C13" ref-type="bibr">Ezcurra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) result in a prolonged duration of action at the LH receptor (&#x0003e;1 week) in contrast to the physiological LH-surge which has a plateaux lasting 24&#x02013;28 h (<xref rid="dex253C19" ref-type="bibr">Hoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C5" ref-type="bibr">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). As such, hCG can cause moderate OHSS in 10.2% and severe OHSS in a further 5.1% of patients undergoing IVF treatment (<xref rid="dex253C40" ref-type="bibr">Toftager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Moreover, the risk of severe OHSS is further increased five-fold in patients with risk factors such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (<xref rid="dex253C41" ref-type="bibr">Wada <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>) to as much as a quarter of patients (<xref rid="dex253C37" ref-type="bibr">Seyhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, late pregnancy complications such as prematurity and low birth weight are more frequently observed in women affected by OHSS in early pregnancy (<xref rid="dex253C9" ref-type="bibr">Courbiere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C18" ref-type="bibr">Haas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). GnRH-agonists are a safer alternative than hCG to trigger oocyte maturation, but are often used as second-line agents due to concerns regarding implantation rates (<xref rid="dex253C42" ref-type="bibr">Youssef <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, a number of case reports have suggested that severe OHSS may still occur in the high risk patient even when triggered with a GnRH-agonist and with segmentation (<xref rid="dex253C14" ref-type="bibr">Fatemi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C17" ref-type="bibr">Gurbuz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C29" ref-type="bibr">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Kisspeptin-54 is a key regulator of the human reproductive axis (<xref rid="dex253C7" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Dhillo, 2016</xref>). Kisspeptin signalling is requisite for the normal initiation of puberty (de <xref rid="dex253C33" ref-type="bibr">Roux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C35" ref-type="bibr">Seminara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and is obligatory for physiological ovulation in animals (<xref rid="dex253C30" ref-type="bibr">Matsui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C4" ref-type="bibr">Caraty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C8" ref-type="bibr">Clarkson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We have recently reported that a single injection of kisspeptin-54 resulted in a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge of ~12&#x02013;14 h duration, which was sufficient to safely trigger oocyte maturation in women at high risk of OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Oocyte maturation (at least one mature oocyte) was observed in 95% of patients following kisspeptin-54 triggering (<xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>); nevertheless, it is also important to consider the &#x02018;oocyte yield&#x02019; achieved. Oocyte yield denotes the proportion of mature oocytes retrieved from follicles of sufficient size (&#x02265;14 mm) to yield an oocyte. Patients achieving a good oocyte yield are more likely to progress to subsequent stages of IVF treatment. In our previous study, kisspeptin-54 (9.6 nmol/kg) was an efficacious trigger of oocyte maturation resulting in an overall oocyte yield of 86%, however there was variation between individuals in the oocyte yield achieved (SD 49%). It is increasingly recognized that the efficacy of therapies should be demonstrated at the level of the individual rather than across a group (<xref rid="dex253C34" ref-type="bibr">Schork, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether oocyte maturation could be optimized using kisspeptin-54 to ensure that a clinically effective oocyte yield (&#x02265;60%) was achieved in as many individuals as possible and thus minimize the risk of cycle cancelations due to suboptimal efficacy or safety concerns.</p><p>Kisspeptin-54 results in a shorter duration of LH-exposure than the physiological LH-surge (<xref rid="dex253C19" ref-type="bibr">Hoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C25" ref-type="bibr">Jayasena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that extending the duration of LH-exposure by administering a second dose of kisspeptin-54 10 h after the first could further optimize oocyte maturation and increase the proportion of women achieving an oocyte yield of at least 60%. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a Phase-2 placebo-controlled clinical trial randomizing 62 women at high risk of OHSS to receive either one or two doses of kisspeptin-54 to trigger oocyte maturation during IVF treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="dex253s14"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="dex253s14a"><title>Study approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte's Research Ethics Committee, London, UK (reference: 10/H0707/2) and was undertaken at the IVF Unit at Hammersmith Hospital under a licence from the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority.

All patients then received a second injection 10 h after the first injection, but were randomized 1:1 to receive either a second dose of kisspeptin-54 (D; Double, <italic>n</italic> = 31), or saline (S; Single, <italic>n</italic> = 31) to determine if a second dose of kisspeptin-54 could increase the duration of LH-exposure and optimize oocyte yield compared to a single dose of kisspeptin-54. Serum reproductive hormones (LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone) were measured immediately prior to as well as 4 and 10 h after the first kisspeptin-54 injection. Serum reproductive hormones were also measured immediately prior to as well as 4 and 10 h after the second injection (of kisspeptin-54 or saline). Transvaginal ultrasound-directed oocyte retrieval (TVOR) was carried out 36 h following the first kisspeptin-54 injection, and ICSI was performed using fresh sperm from the male partner. If a high quality blastocyst was available, elective single embryo transfer (eSET) was carried out 5 days following oocyte retrieval. Progesterone 100 mg daily intramuscular injections (Gestone, Nordic Pharma, UK) and estradiol valerate 2 mg orally three times daily (Progynova, Bayer, Germany) was commenced from the evening of TVOR until 12 weeks gestation. All women recruited to the study were regarded as being at high risk of OHSS and were routinely screened for the development of early OHSS (assessed on day of embryo transfer 3&#x02013;5 days after TVOR) and late OHSS (assessed 11 days after embryo transfer). Biochemical pregnancy (serum &#x003b2;HCG &#x0003e; 10 iU/L) was assessed 11 days following embryo transfer and clinical pregnancy was assessed by ultrasonography at 6 weeks gestation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dex253f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="dex253s14d"><title>Assessment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome</title><p>All women recruited to the study were regarded as being at high risk of OHSS and were routinely screened for the development of early OHSS (assessed at embryo transfer 3&#x02013;5 days following oocyte retrieval) and late OHSS (assessed 11 days following embryo transfer) as previously described (<xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

This was associated with those receiving two doses of kisspeptin-54 having an increased proportion achieving an oocyte yield &#x02265;60%. Despite the study population being at high risk of developing OHSS, a second dose of kisspeptin-54 did not increase the occurrence of excessive ovarian response or OHSS.</p><p>For this trial, we chose a patient-centric primary outcome, namely the proportion of patients achieving an oocyte yield &#x02265;60%. This was chosen as a thresh-hold for trigger efficacy that would increase the chance of progression to subsequent stages of IVF treatment such as embryo transfer. All patients who achieved an oocyte yield &#x02265;60% had an embryo available for transfer and 25/36 (69%) had a high quality blastocyst available for transfer. By contrast, 1 of 26 (3.8%) patients with an oocyte yield &#x02264;60% did not have an embryo available for transfer and 10 of 26 (38%) patients had a high quality embryo available for transfer. Thus, from a patient&#x02019; perspective this primary outcome represents a clinically meaningful measure of trigger efficacy.</p><p>In order to investigate the safety and efficacy of kisspeptin-54 in women at high risk of developing OHSS, the inclusion criteria for this trial were a high serum AMH &#x02265;40 pmol/L or AFC &#x02265;23. The women in this study had a mean AFC of 40 and mean serum AMH of 52 pmol/L confirming that we had successfully recruited women at high risk of developing OHSS during IVF treatment (<xref rid="dex253C28" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C23" ref-type="bibr">Jayaprakasan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Once a woman begins controlled ovarian stimulation, the number of follicles &#x02265;11 mm prior to trigger can be used to further delineate the risk of OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C32" ref-type="bibr">Papanikolaou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The mean number of follicles &#x02265;11 mm on the morning of trigger administration was 24 in this trial. Some authors recommend that all women with 25 or more follicles &#x02265;11 mm have segmentation following current triggers of oocyte maturation to avoid late-onset OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C21" ref-type="bibr">Humaidan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, a universal segmentation policy is often not favoured by patients, as it may result in increased cost of treatment and a longer time to pregnancy by ~2&#x02013;3 months when compared with fresh embryo transfer. Despite 48% (30/62) of patients in our trial having more than 25 follicles &#x02265;11 mm on the day of trigger, almost all patients (61/62; 98.4%) were still able to safely receive fresh embryo transfer following kisspeptin-54 triggering.</p><p>It seemed plausible that prolonging the duration of the LH-surge with a second dose of kisspeptin-54 could induce OHSS in the high risk patient, as described in case-reports following GnRH-agonist triggering (<xref rid="dex253C14" ref-type="bibr">Fatemi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C17" ref-type="bibr">Gurbuz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C29" ref-type="bibr">Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, kisspeptin-54 has some unique actions suggesting that despite prolonging the duration of the LH-surge with a second dose of kisspeptin-54, it may still reduce the incidence of OHSS due to: (i) its shorter duration of action compared to hCG (<xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C39" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Humaidan, 2015</xref>); (ii) its action to release a pre-formed endogenous pool of GnRH from the hypothalamus (<xref rid="dex253C12" ref-type="bibr">Dhillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C26" ref-type="bibr">Jayasena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and as the quantity of endogenous GnRH is individually determined, kisspeptin-54 is less likely to produce an excessive ovarian response sufficient to prompt OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C1" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>); (iii) kisspeptin-54 directly inhibits the production of the predominant mediator of OHSS, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), from the ovaries following controlled ovarian stimulation (<xref rid="dex253C6" ref-type="bibr">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Hence, it is conceivable that a second dose of kisspeptin-54 could improve oocyte yield by prolonging the LH-surge, but without additionally increasing the risk of OHSS. In keeping with this, there was no increase in mean or maximal ovarian diameter following a second dose of kisspeptin-54 (see Supplemental Table SII for OHSS screening data). In addition, only one woman from 62 patients at high risk of developing OHSS (from Single group) was treated with segmentation. She had an AFC of 84, a serum AMH of 165 pmol/L, developed 73 follicles &#x02265;11 mm on the morning of trigger and had a serum estradiol of 38 264 pmol/L just prior to trigger administration. She had 46 oocytes retrieved, of which 41 were mature. She developed abdominal pain the day following oocyte retrieval and was thus admitted for analgesia and observation for &#x0003c;24 h before her symptom spontaneously settled without requiring any medical intervention. Prospective clinical trials in which routine screening for OHSS was conducted (<xref rid="dex253C40" ref-type="bibr">Toftager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) often report an increased frequency of OHSS when compared with retrospective trials relying upon patient instigated reporting of OHSS (<xref rid="dex253C36" ref-type="bibr">Serour <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Thus, it is reassuring that despite routine screening of women at high risk of OHSS in this study, two doses of kisspeptin-54 can safely be administered without causing an increased risk of ovarian hyper-response and OHSS.</p><p>Interestingly, this study revealed novel data delineating the pharmacodynamic impact of repeated dosing of kisspeptin-54. Patients receiving two doses of kisspeptin-54 had a variable LH-response following the second dose, which appeared to be resultant on the LH-response following the first kisspeptin-54 injection. Patients who had a substantial LH-rise following the first dose of kisspeptin-54 had a lower further rise following the second dose of kisspeptin-54. Conversely, those with a lower LH-response following the first dose of kisspeptin-54 had a more pronounced &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; LH-rise following the second dose of kisspeptin-54 (see &#x02018;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>&#x02019; for variation in response following the second dose of kisspeptin-54). Thus, a second dose of kisspeptin-54 was able to eliminate the retrieval of fewer than four oocytes from 9.7% in the single group to 0% in the double group. Moreover, it has been suggested that retrieving a greater number of oocytes beyond 15 does not yield further increases in live birth rates (van der <xref rid="dex253C15" ref-type="bibr">Gaast <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="dex253C38" ref-type="bibr">Sunkara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A second dose of kisspeptin-54 improved the proportion achieving a clinically effective oocyte yield, but importantly did not increase the proportion of patients having an excessive ovarian response (see &#x02018;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>&#x02019; for histogram of number of oocytes retrieved by kisspeptin-54-dosing group). It is interesting to speculate as to why the variable response following the second dose of kisspeptin-54 was observed; this property of kisspeptin-54 pharmacodynamics could be explained by its unique mechanism of action. Kisspeptin-54 acts at the level of the hypothalamus to cause the release of a pre-formed endogenous pool of GnRH (<xref rid="dex253C26" ref-type="bibr">Jayasena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Patients with a greater LH-rise following the first dose of kisspeptin-54 may have depleted their hypothalamic GnRH stores such that a second injection of kisspeptin-54 resulted in a minimal further LH-response. In contrast, patients with a lower rise in LH following the first dose of kisspeptin-54 may have remaining hypothalamic GnRH stores, allowing a second dose of kisspeptin-54 to induce a rescue LH-response. A less likely possibility is that the variability in LH-response reflects tachyphylaxis at the kisspeptin-54 receptor; tachyphylaxis is more usually associated with high-dose frequent administration of kisspeptin-54 rather than two intermediate doses administered 10 h apart as in this study (<xref rid="dex253C2" ref-type="bibr">Abbara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This ability of kisspeptin-54 to stimulate gonadotropin secretion in response to a patient's endogenous GnRH reserve, without causing excessive response is of particular value in women undergoing IVF treatment at high risk of developing OHSS in individualizing the LH-response achieved following the second dose of kisspeptin-54.</p><p>A limitation of this trial is that we only examined one dose of kisspeptin-54 (9.6 nmol/kg) in the single and double groups. Furthermore, only one dosing interval of 10 h was evaluated and it is possible that the full benefit on oocyte maturation of the second dose of kisspeptin-54 may not yet have been fully attained, as oocyte retrieval was routinely performed only 26 h after the second injection. Therefore, it remains possible that other regimens utilizing different kisspeptin-54 dosages and other dosing intervals could further improve oocyte maturation in individual patients. The study was designed to detect a difference in oocyte maturation, but was not powered to detect a difference in implantation rates. Thus, further larger studies are now required to directly compare kisspeptin triggering against other currently used triggers of oocyte maturation.</p><p>In summary, we observe that a second dose of kisspeptin-54 administered 10 h following the first can improve the proportion of patients achieving an oocyte yield &#x02265;60%, but without increasing the risk of ovarian overstimulation and OHSS. Thus, a second dose of kisspeptin-54 is a safe option in patients undergoing IVF treatment to further optimize oocyte maturation, even those at high risk of OHSS.</p></sec><sec id="dex253s18"><title>Authors&#x02019; roles</title><p>All authors provided contributions to study conception and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and final approval of the version to be published.
