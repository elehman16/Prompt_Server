It is a distressing symptom complex characterized as a burning sensation or stabbing pain with an urge to void or as discomfort from the suprapubic area to the urethra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The condition of CRBD may aggravate postoperative pain, increase the incidence of postoperative complications, and result in prolongation of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of CRBD is mediated by type 3 muscarinic receptor activation, which increases acetylcholine release and then causes the detrusor muscles of the bladder to contract involuntarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Antimuscarinic agents, including tramadol, tolterodine, oxybutynin, pregabalin, and ketamine, have been applied to treat CRBD in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in spite of their beneficial effect on CRBD, systemic administration of these agents is associated with side effects such as nausea or vomiting, sedation, dizziness, or other unpleasant complications, which may result in reduced quality of recovery. It is important in clinical practice to establish an effective treatment for CRBD with reduced adverse effects.</p><p>Anatomically, the afferent nerves of the urethra and bladder triangle are derived from sacral somatic nerves (S2&#x02013;S4 segment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and theoretically, prevention of CRBD should be achieved by blocking these nerves. The pudendal nerve, the main nerve of the perineum, is derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves; innervates the urethral sphincter and muscles of the perineum and pelvic floor; and provides sensation to the penis in males and the clitoris in females, as well as to the urethra and bladder triangle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinically, pudendal nerve block (PNB) has been applied for analgesia of labor and/or vaginal birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], vaginal repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], sphincterotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and treatment of pudendal neuralgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the safety and effectiveness of PNB have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the basis of the anatomical and physiological proof for nerve innervation, with the support of clinical experience, we designed this trial with the hypothesis that PNB has a CRBD-reductive effect with less side effects related to systemic administration of antimuscarinic agents than PNB with ropivacaine and intravenous tramadol, and we aim to provide a novel and effective way to reduce the incidence of CRBD and with a better outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The PNB trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02683070) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized controlled trial that will test the superiority of PNB with 0.33 % ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg for reduction of CRBD. It will be conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</ext-link>).

We investigated 367 male patients in the PACU of the Department of Anesthesiology, West China Hospital, from 21 June 21 to 17 July 2015 and found that 56.1 % (206 of 367) of them complained of CRBD. On the basis of this information, a difference of 25 % (e.g., 30 % vs. 55 %) in the incidence of CRBD values between two treatment groups is considered to be clinically important. The sample size was calculated to compare two proportions with two-sample noninferiority or superiority; assuming the difference between two groups at a 5 % significance level and a power of 0.80, 37 patients in each group are required for a comparison within the groups. Considering an estimated 20 % dropout rate, 47 patients in each group, and 94 patients in total, are required in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>A total of 94 patients undergoing elective prostate surgery in lithotomy position with urinary catheterization (16-French Foley catheter) while under general anesthesia will be enrolled at West China Hospital of Sichuan University.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>A biostatistician in the Department of Anesthesiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, will perform randomization using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

In addition, a combination of pudendal and periprostatic nerve block has been reported to improve pain reduction during transperineal prostate biopsy compared with periprostatic anesthesia only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the basis of findings reported in the literature and the neural anatomy that sensation of the bladder triangle and urethra provided by the pudendal nerve derived from sacral nerves S2&#x02013;S4, we hypothesize that PNB could reduce the incidence of CRBD as well as side effects due to less nerve-related side effects associated with nerve block than intravenous systemic administration of antimuscarinic agents.</p><p>As a weak opioid with a potent antimuscarinic effect, tramadol is commonly used for postoperative pain relief and chronic pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and it is reported to halve the incidence of postoperative CRBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and is administered to patients with severe CRBD as a rescue treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we chose intravenous tramadol administration as the control and will test the superiority of PNB with 0.33 % ropivacaine to tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in CRBD prevention. On the basis of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg will be given to the patients with moderate to severe CRBD as a rescue treatment to relieve their bladder discomfort.</p><p>During the execution of the PNB trial, all eligible patients will receive the allocated intervention while under general anesthesia, and the research nurses responsible for follow-up and the statistician will not be aware of to which group the patient or data belongs, so the patients, the research nurses, and the statistician will be blind to the group allocation. A 16-French Foley catheter will be inserted into the patients in the present study to test the effects of CRBD prevention because this diameter of the Foley catheter is superior to the 18-French diameter and has been reported to be an independent predictor responsible for moderate or severe CRBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sterilized liquid paraffin will be applied for catheterization for prevention against urethral mucosal injury, but local anesthetics will not be spread onto the surface of catheter, to minimize other confounding factors related to CRBD. Furthermore, although we will test the superiority of PNB with ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol in CRBD prevention, we do not aim to deny the beneficial effects of antimuscarinic agents to relieve CRBD. Instead, we will use tramadol as a rescue treatment to reduce bladder discomfort in the PACU.</p><p>There are several limitations of this trial. First, with regard to the study design, because of different routes of administration (nerve block vs. intravenous), the investigator and responsible physicians will not be blind to group allocation. Second, PNB will be performed with the patient in lithotomy position in current clinical practice, so we will choose patients undergoing prostate surgery placed in the lithotomy position. Therefore, a limitation exists in the application of PNB to patients undergoing other operations in the supine, prone, or other position, and other routes of PNB should be explored in the next step. Third, for patients undergoing medical procedures requiring urinary catheterization without any surgical intervention, the risks and benefits of PNB should be balanced, and this aspect will not be discussed in this study. In addition, CRBD is a very subjective feeling, and it can be defined only semiquantitatively on the basis of the patient&#x02019;s own complaint and the physician&#x02019;s judgment. That is why the incidence of CRBD varies in different articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and we will try our best to get an accurate measurement of CRBD by careful follow-up.</p><p>In summary, this trial is designed to find an optimal clinical practice for CRBD reduction by performing a superiority test for the PNB with 0.33 % ropivacaine compared with intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is not yet recruiting as of the date of publication.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1575_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 checklist: recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents.
