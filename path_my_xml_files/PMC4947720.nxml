Skin antisepsis prior to surgical incision is used to prevent SSI, and is performed routinely worldwide. However, in spite of the routine use of skin antisepsis, there is no consensus regarding which antiseptic agents are most effective. The AVALANCHE trial will compare Aqueous Versus Alcoholic Antisepsis with Chlorhexidine for Skin Excisions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study design is a prospective, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with the aim of investigating the impact of two different antiseptic preparations on the incidence of superficial SSI in patients undergoing minor skin excisions. The intervention of 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in 70% alcohol will be compared with that of 0.5% CHG in aqueous solution. The trial will be conducted in four Australian general practices over a 9-month period, with 920 participants to be recruited. Consecutive patients presenting for minor skin excisions will be eligible to participate. Randomisation will be on the level of the patient. The primary outcome is superficial SSI in the first 30&#x02005;days following the excision. Secondary outcomes will be adverse effects, including anaphylaxis, skin irritation, contact dermatitis and rash and patterns of antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Findings will be disseminated in conference presentations and journals and through online electronic media.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>RCTs conducted in general practice differ from hospital-based projects in terms of feasibility, pragmatism and funding. The success of this trial will be cemented in the fact that the research question was established by a group of general practitioners who identified an interesting question which is relevant to their clinical practice and not answered by current evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12615001045505; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd><kwd>WOUND MANAGEMENT</kwd><kwd>SURGERY</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Practical clinical question relevant to clinical practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment of clinicians and participants will be very feasible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Independent outcome assessor will assess photographs of all infections.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conduct of trial in general practice will provide clinically relevant results to end-user.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis of infection has an element of subjectivity.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>It is a routine practice prior to surgery to carry out preoperative cleansing of the skin with antiseptic preparations at the site of surgical incisions (preoperative skin antisepsis).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> The purpose of preoperative skin antisepsis is to reduce the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) by removing microorganisms on the skin through a combination of mechanical removal and chemical killing.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The incidence of SSI arising from surgery in general practice is usually 1&#x02013;3%, but has been recorded at rates as high as 10%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref> The consequences of SSI include pain and discomfort for patients, increased healthcare-associated costs and temporarily reduced occupational and recreational productivity and functionality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As a result, reducing the incidence of SSIs is in the interest of all stakeholders in healthcare.</p><p>The most commonly used preoperative skin antiseptic preparations are povidone iodine (PVI) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). They are available in aqueous and alcoholic preparations and in different concentrations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> PVI and CHG are effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses and fungi, though CHG has a more appreciable residual antiseptic activity on the skin after application.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Surprisingly, despite the routine use of preoperative skin antisepsis, there is no definitive scientific consensus regarding which antiseptic preparation is most effective in preventing SSI.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There are even less definitive data available for antisepsis prior to clean surgery, which the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) defines as &#x02018;an uninfected operation in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital or uninfected urinary tract is not entered&#x02019; (CDC, 2011).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Prior studies of wound infection after minor surgery in general practice in the Mackay region have shown an SSI rate of &#x0223c;9.5%&#x02014;an incidence that is much higher than expected based on published results of similar cohorts in other regions of Australia and the world.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> The reason for this high infection rate is unclear, but may be related to the hot, humid environment or to patient behaviour in our rural setting. On the one hand, this infection rate is suboptimal, as the CDC suggests that an acceptable rate of SSI after clean minor surgery is &#x0003c;5%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, in settings where there is a low risk of infection after clean surgery, studies of over 5000 procedures may be required to detect a clinically relevant difference in infection from an intervention with statistical confidence, making such trials unfeasible.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Conversely, because of the high rate of infection in our patient cohort and the high minor surgery workload in rural general practice,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> a study of skin antisepsis for the prevention of SSI in our setting is highly feasible.</p><p>In general, the evidence base guiding appropriate selection of antiseptic agents is poor. A landmark study found 2% CHG in 70% isopropyl alcohol to be superior to an aqueous solution of 10% PVI; however, as alcohol is known to have significant antimicrobial properties, this was likely to be an active treatment component in this study.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Most recent meta-analyses, including a Cochrane review, concur that it is difficult to make conclusive statements about whether there are differences in the efficacy of CHG and PVI<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the latest guideline on surgical skin antisepsis released by the Queensland Department of Health agrees with this position.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The Queensland Department of Health does, however, endorse the use of alcoholic solutions in preference to aqueous preparations,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and two recent meta-analyses have asserted that there is some evidence to suggest that alcoholic solutions may be more effective than aqueous solutions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Nonetheless, they agree that the marked heterogeneity in type and application of antiseptic preparations between available studies hinders direct comparisons between them.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This, combined with the overall low statistical power of almost all available studies, makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the proposed superiority of alcoholic solutions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and recent interviews (personal communication) have revealed that the majority of Mackay general practitioners (GPs) use CHG in preference to PVI, one of the reasons behind this being perceptions of &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; and skin staining. Therefore, for practical reasons, our team has chosen to examine the difference between alcoholic and aqueous CHG, rather than comparing the relative efficacy of CHG and PVI.</p><p>The aim of our study is to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of SSI after minor skin excisions in general practice (clean surgery) when alcoholic CHG is used for preoperative skin antisepsis in comparison with aqueous CHG.</p><p>We hope this research will provide more authoritative direction about skin antisepsis to clinicians carrying out a clean surgery. If our research demonstrates a difference in efficacy between alcoholic and aqueous CHG, its dissemination may lead a change in behaviour which may serve to reduce overall incidence of SSI after minor skin excisions in general practice in Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study centre</title><p>This study will be conducted in four private general practices in Mackay, Queensland (latitude 21E8S).

The practice nurses will be responsible for recruitment. Many provisions have been developed to assure informed consent. First, all eligible participants will be provided with a participant information sheet before giving written informed consent. In addition, practice nurses, rather than practice GPs, will recruit patients. This is intended to minimise the risk of perceived coercion, as nurses are somewhat less responsible for direct decisions regarding patient care than the patient's GP. Furthermore, all nurses involved in the trial will receive formal training regarding appropriate consenting procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>In this prospective RCT, randomisation will be performed at the level of the patient with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The random sequence will be generated from a computer-generated random number table. Allocation concealment will be attained using sealed, numbered, tamperproof opaque envelopes such that neither the patient, nor the clinicians involved in their care, will be aware of their allocation until after they have consented to be a part of the trial, thereby minimising selection and confounding bias. The research team involved in the assessment or treatment of patients will have no role in the assignment process. The patients will be blinded to treatment allocation, although there are differences in the alcoholic skin preparation which are identifiable to the patient. Blinding of the operating doctors to the assigned skin antiseptic is not feasible given the differing smell of the two solutions. The practice nurse or doctor assessing outcomes will be blinded to the treatment allocation, as will the practice nurse collecting data and the investigator team.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All patients over the age of 18 undergoing minor skin procedures at the participating practices during the study period who:

<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Funding for primary care research in Australia is very limited, particularly compared with UK and the Netherlands with only 2% of NHMRC grants awarded to primary care research between 2000 and 2008.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> General practice-based research differs in many ways from hospital-based research in issues of funding, feasibility and pragmatism, and we have used our experience from conducting previous successful trials in general practice to inform the design and methods of the present study.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study will be conducted for total funding of $20&#x02005;000, which is similar to the cost of our previous trials.</p><p>Skin excisions form a large proportion of the workload of Australian GPs<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and this is even greater in Queensland, the state with the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This effect is magnified in regional towns such as Mackay, where there are no permanent dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Using a research question that is relevant to our clinical situation increases the feasibility of recruitment of patients because of our high case load of patients presenting for skin excisions.</p><p>Our research question is practical and clinically relevant. Local clinicians do not use betadine antisepsis because of perceptions of &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; and skin staining. Therefore, to be pragmatic, our team has chosen to examine the difference between alcoholic and aqueous CHG, rather than comparing the relative efficacy of CHG and PVI. We have also found that using a clinically relevant research question engages GPs and practice nurses, and facilitates practitioner recruitment, as well as increases the potential for translation into clinical practice.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Our surgical and wound management protocol was developed in consultation with participating doctors and practice nurses, which again increases the ownership and practicality of the project. Occasionally, scientific rigour may be compromised at the expense of pragmatism. For instance, in contrast to hospital-based research, it is simply not practically or financially feasible to have an independent outcome assessor assessing each wound at each of the three geographically dispersed practices. To compensate for this, infections will be photographed and assessed for infection by a second independent and blinded outcome assessor, who will reassess every wound.</p><p>It is also not feasible to have an independent researcher to recruit patients. In our trial, practice nurses will be responsible for recruitment. Many provisions have been developed to assure informed consent. This is intended to minimise the risk of perceived coercion, as nurses are somewhat less responsible for direct decisions regarding patient care than the patient's GP. The practice nurses are also responsible for data collection and are paid on a fee per service basis that compensates them for their time. The study involves very little additional work for the participating GPs&#x02014;they are not responsible for any data collection, and were only required to have knowledge of the process involved to answer any possible queries.</p><p>The trial will provide guidance to GPs regarding skin antisepsis, and will inform current clinical guidelines and healthcare worker education. Although our study is conducted in a tropical rural setting and we are aware that our baseline infection rate is comparably high,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> we have no reason to believe that any relative risk reduction detected will not be generalisable to other settings. If we detect a measurable decrease in the incidence of SSI with alcoholic CHG, this may result in a change in clinical practice, with an increase in the use of alcoholic CHG, which could reduce SSI rates following clean surgery. As this is a pragmatic trial, the findings can potentially be immediately translated into clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Ms Debbie Kimber, Ms Julie O'Sullivan, Dr Sheldon Browning, Dr Luke Notely, Dr Andrew O'Neil, Dr Andrea Cosgrove, Ms Debbie Skerman and Ms Catherine Weiske.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CFH conceived the study idea and oversaw the development of the study design and protocol.
