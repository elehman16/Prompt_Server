The purpose of this study was to compare the bone quality of pre- and post-menopausal women using the quantitative indices determined by measurements on panoramic radiographs (mental index, inferior and superior panoramic mandibular indices, antegonion index [AGI], and gonion index) and to determine the effects of serum calcium and serum estradiol levels on alveolar bone loss.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Sixty female patients in the age group of 25&#x02013;55 years were included in the study.

In practice, this means deciding who is a candidate for DEXA testing. Unfortunately, there is no known combination of risk factors that are both sensitive and specific for identifying individuals likely to have osteoporosis. The goal of such screening is not to diagnose osteoporosis but rather to identify individuals at risk of having osteoporosis and refer them appropriately.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Due to economy and affordability concerns, we opted to use radiographic indices and serum values of calcium and estradiol for provisional screening of postmenopausal women and to provide people within rural setup with an easy facility of assessing osteoporotic changes and then refer them for BMD assessment by DXA scan if required.</p><p>There is a decrease in BMD of women in the postmenopause, more within 3 years of menopause and estradiol levels correlating positively with BMD.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence, we considered patients in Group A premenopausal women with healthy nonosteoporotic changes and patients in Group B and Group C postmenopausal women with decreased levels of estradiol and at increased risk of osteoporotic changes.</p><p>Almost all of the body's calcium are stored in the skeleton and it is an essential nutrient for bone. It has been concluded that calcium supplementation is a cornerstone of any treatment regimen for osteoporosis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study were similar to those of Okyay <italic>et al</italic>. who found no significant differences in calcium levels in women with and without osteoporosis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The results of the present study were unlike those obtained by Ramesh <italic>et al</italic>. in whose study the mean serum calcium in premenopausal women was 9.2 &#x000b1; 0.46 mg/dl, postmenopausal women with healthy periodontium had mean serum calcium 8.64 &#x000b1; 0.30 mg/dl, and 7.01 &#x000b1; 0.46 mg/dl in postmenopausal women with periodontitis with statistically significant differences between and among the three groups.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study were similar to the study by Ramesh <italic>et al</italic>.; in their study, they correlated the levels of mean serum calcium with PMI in pre- and post-menopausal women and did not find any statistically significant correlation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>During the menopausal transition, ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone declines. This natural endocrine transition is associated with diminished circulating levels of estradiol (E2).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Menopause-related estrogen withdrawal might contribute to make bone more vulnerable to oxidative injury thereby increasing the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis development.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Postmenopausal bone loss follows a pattern with an early estrogen-dependent phase of rapid decline in bone mass followed by an age-related bone loss at a constant, slower rate throughout aging.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Bone loss in postmenopausal women is mainly due to estrogen deficiency affecting the balance between osteoclast resorption and bone formation controlled by osteoblasts.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study were similar to those by Reddy Kilim and Chandala, in their study, the mean estradiol levels in premenopausal women was 175.48 &#x000b1; 43.20 pg/ml and mean level in postmenopausal women was 44.18 &#x000b1; 10.52 pg/ml with statistically significant differences between the levels of the two groups; however, they collected the samples for estradiol estimation on 7<sup>th</sup> day of menstrual cycle in premenopausal women unlike the present study, in which samples were collected irrespective of the day of menstrual cycle.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>According to Ettinger <italic>et al</italic>., serum estradiol levels vary with age with levels decreasing as age progresses and as the serum levels fall into the postmenopausal range (30 pg/mL), accelerated bone loss ensues. Women with undetectable estradiol levels (5 pg/mL) were about 2.5 times more likely to suffer hip or vertebral fracture than women with detectable levels (5&#x02013;25 pg/mL).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>There are many studies directly or indirectly correlating the markers of estradiol with bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>None of the radiographic parameters evaluated in the present study correlated with serum estradiol except the cortical width and AGI with which it showed positive correlation in Group C, i.e., postmenopausal women with periodontitis. This difference can be attributed to the possibility that estradiol is a marker for other confounding factors that we did not measure in the present study. We did not adjusted our measurements for the estradiol binding protein and sex hormone binding globulin in present study.</p><p>The reason for nonsignificant statistical difference in mean serum calcium and estradiol levels and various morphometric indices in this study in patients with Group &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; in spite of Group B included, postmenopausal women could be the effects of periodontitis and local osteolytic factors present in the Group C patients affecting the results. This needs further research while considering local effects of all the osteolytic enzymes.</p><p>The results of the present study serve once more to show the evidence of the decrease in cortical width, superior and inferior panoramic mandibular indices, and GI along with estradiol levels in postmenopausal women and thus can act as an adjunctive tool in deciding whether to refer such patients for further evaluation through bone density measurements through DXA scan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, it can be concluded from the present study that radiomorphometric indices cannot be used for diagnosing the patients with osteoporosis but can be used as a supplement to refer women with pronounced thinning or resorption of the inferior mandibular cortices for further investigation of osteoporosis. There is a little evidence of correlation of these indices with serum estradiol and calcium levels and therefore detailed further study and research about this correlation; and to use them for osteoporosis risk assessment, may help in creating an economic alternative of BMD measurements.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"
