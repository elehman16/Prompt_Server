Long-term control is often best achieved through the adaptation of treatment based on disease activity (treat-to-target).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Typical treatment modifications include the addition of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to pre-existing therapy, the addition of a biologic to a conventional DMARD or a switch from a conventional DMARD to a biologic therapy.</p><p>When disease control is inadequate with the first traditional DMARD, typically methotrexate, patients will frequently receive biologic therapy in addition to or instead of methotrexate.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In clinical practice, approximately one-third of patients with RA are being treated with biologic monotherapy,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> often because of tolerability issues with methotrexate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> One such biologic therapy is tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Tocilizumab is efficacious and generally well tolerated in a wide range of patients with RA when given as either monotherapy<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> or in combination with methotrexate<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and other DMARDs.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Long-term studies have demonstrated that tocilizumab can reduce the signs and symptoms of RA for several years in combination with a conventional DMARD and as monotherapy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> Further, tocilizumab, in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to inhibit radiographic progression for up to 3&#x02005;years in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>ACT-RAY is a 3-year, phase 3b, randomised, double-blind clinical trial. The first 24&#x02005;weeks of ACT-RAY assessed the efficacy and safety of adding tocilizumab to ongoing methotrexate (add-on strategy) versus switching to tocilizumab monotherapy (switch strategy) in patients with moderate to severe active RA experiencing an inadequate response to methotrexate.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The primary efficacy analysis of the study at week 24 did not succeed at demonstrating superiority of the add-on over the switch strategy, suggesting that switching to tocilizumab monotherapy might be a valuable treatment strategy for patients for whom methotrexate is contraindicated or poorly tolerated.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>From week 24 to year 3, ACT-RAY employed a treat-to-target strategy. During weeks 24&#x02013;52, patients continued on tocilizumab therapy with blinded methotrexate or placebo (PBO), but open-label conventional DMARDs were added based on disease activity, with the ultimate objective to induce clinical remission during the course of the study. This article reports on the main objectives of the 52-week analyses, which were to evaluate the sustainability of the response observed at week 24 and to further evaluate the treatment strategies in terms of clinical activity, structural damage, immunogenicity and changes in concomitant therapies (all secondary study objectives). Full assessment of treatment adaptation strategies (step-up and step-down) will occur after year 2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This report covers the planned analysis for the first 52&#x02005;weeks of a 3-year, double-blind, PBO-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (NCT00810199, EudraCT No. 2008-001847-20). The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards/ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and local regulations. All patients provided written informed consent for the 3&#x02005;years of the ACT-RAY study.</p><p>Patients and methods have been previously described.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Briefly, patients had confirmed RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria with Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) &#x0003e;4.4 at baseline, despite a stable methotrexate dose of at least 15&#x02005;mg/week for &#x0003e;6&#x02005;weeks and radiographic evidence of RA-related joint erosions. Major exclusion criteria included previous use of biologics and any conventional DMARD treatment other than methotrexate during the month preceding baseline visit. At randomisation, patients either added open-label tocilizumab 8&#x02005;mg/kg intravenously every 4&#x02005;weeks to their existing methotrexate (add-on strategy) or were switched to tocilizumab alone (switch strategy; with PBO). Until week 24, these treatments were maintained except for safety reasons.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Treat-to-target and concomitant RA treatments</title><p>Following the primary endpoint analysis at week 24, treatment was intensified based on individual disease activity while blinding was maintained in both study groups. At week 24, if a patient had a DAS28 &#x0003e;3.2, an open-label conventional DMARD (sulfasalazine, leflunomide, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, parenteral gold or azathioprine; choice and dose at investigator's discretion) was added. At week 36, if a patient still had a DAS28 score &#x0003e;3.2 with the added DMARD, the patient was moved to the maintenance-regimen arm with the option of adding an additional conventional DMARD at the investigator's discretion. Patients in the maintenance arm did not undergo systematic step-up or step-down therapy but were treated as per the investigator's discretion. Tocilizumab and/or DMARD treatment was reduced or temporarily interrupted in patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values &#x0003e;1 to 3&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal (ULN) and discontinued for persistent increases &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN (see online supplementary table S2 for risk mitigation strategy).</p><p>Oral corticosteroids (&#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) were permitted, provided that doses remained stable for at least 25 of 28&#x02005;days prior to the start of study treatment. Alterations in NSAID dose were not recommended during the study, particularly during the first 24&#x02005;weeks. The corticosteroid dose could not be changed during the first 24&#x02005;weeks of the study. From week 24, if DAS28 &#x02264;3.2, corticosteroid treatment could be reduced by 2.5&#x02005;mg/day prednisone-equivalents at week 24 or any visit thereafter; however, the dose may not have been reduced to &#x0003c;5&#x02005;mg/day during the first year or be increased back to a level above the patient's baseline dose.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Collected patient data and assessments</title></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Efficacy, radiographic and safety assessments</title><p>Clinical and laboratory data were collected every 4&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were obtained at baseline, week 24 and week 52 and were assessed by applying the Genant-modified Sharp score (GSS) from two independent readers (Perceptive Informatics Medical Imaging Services, Berlin, Germany) who were blinded to treatment assignment, chronological order of radiographs and patient's clinical status. The smallest detectable change (SDC)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> for GSS was computed based on the observed SD of difference between the X-ray readers; three readers in total participated in the campaign.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Following a regulatory request regarding the tocilizumab development programme, immunogenicity testing was introduced to ACT-RAY while the study was ongoing. Patients were tested for antidrug and neutralising antibodies using available samples from baseline, week 24 and week 52 (or withdrawal visit not later than week 52). Samples were analysed using a screening assay first. If positive for antitocilizumab antibodies, a neutralising assay was performed to test for the ability of those antibodies to inhibit the activity of tocilizumab. The cut-off for assay positivity was determined using baseline sera from ACT-RAY patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The target sample size was 235 patients per arm, resulting from power considerations around the primary analysis of the week 24 DAS28 remission rate.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For this and similar endpoints, logistic regression models were employed including region and baseline DAS28 or the respective baseline values (eg, CDAI or radiographic scores), with supportive Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel tests stratified for the same parameters. Analysis of covariance models with similar adjustments was used to compare continuous outcome measures. For the analyses presented here, statistical significance was declared for p values &#x0003c;0.05 and no correction for multiplicity was employed.</p><p>Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population using non-responder imputation for categorical variables (eg, DAS28 remission, ACR response and radiographic progression). The primary endpoint has been previously reported.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Efficacy endpoints were analysed in accordance with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR collaborative recommendations for reporting RA disease activity in clinical trials<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and included the mean change in DAS28-ESR, ACR20/50/70/90 response and ACR core components. Radiographic endpoints included changes from baseline in total GSS, erosion and joint space narrowing scores, and the proportion of patients with no radiographic progression (progression defined as change in GSS &#x0003e;1.5 for this specific reading campaign). The means were adjusted for region, baseline DAS28 and GSS, and the 52-week analysis used linear extrapolation if the week 24 assessment was evaluable. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), serious infections (SIs) and specific laboratory abnormalities, which were analysed in the safety population (all treated patients with at least one postdose assessment of safety, analysed according to the received treatment).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient flow and baseline characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204761F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> summarises the patient disposition through 52&#x02005;weeks.

Week 24 marked the beginning of the treat-to-target concept, with treatment changes determined by disease activity. Because of the introduction of conventional DMARDs, the week 52 results do not represent a pure assessment of tocilizumab monotherapy versus combination therapy with methotrexate but include the growing effects of a treat-to-target strategy consistently applied to both study arms.</p><p>The changes in non-tocilizumab therapies from week 24 complicate the interpretation of the switch versus the add-on concept. The disease activity-dependent addition of open-label conventional DMARDs (of the investigator's choice) from week 24 was mandated by the study protocol. In the absence of an appropriate control and because the addition of the DMARD was possible at different times, the effectiveness of this intervention cannot be properly assessed and isolated from other effects, such as late response to the study treatments. Reducing the corticosteroid dose was also possible but only within predefined limits to minimise any between-group differences that corticosteroid dose reductions could have on structural outcomes. Both the addition of conventional DMARDs (other than methotrexate) and the dose reduction of corticosteroids occurred in similar proportions of patients in the add-on and switch arms.</p><p>Improvements in signs and symptoms of RA observed at week 24 were maintained or further improved up to week 52 in both treatment groups. Results pointed towards a slightly more favourable response for the add-on arm as numerical trends were observed for most clinical and radiographic endpoints. In exploratory analyses, statistical significance in favour of the add-on arm was identified for 4 of 18 endpoints, including clinical and radiographic endpoints.</p><p>The addition of DMARDs according to disease activity in both arms was expected to lead to a &#x02018;dilution&#x02019; of potential distinctions between the two arms, resulting in smaller differences at week 52 than at week 24, as seen with other treat-to-target approaches.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, for the progression of structural damage, a difference was hardly visible at week 24 but emerged more clearly by week 52, possibly suggesting methotrexate as a causative factor. On the other hand, the cumulative distribution plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204761F3">figure 3</xref>C) demonstrates that, overall, only a few patients benefited from continuously receiving methotrexate.</p><p>Antidrug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were detected in similar proportions of patients in the two groups. The interpretation of this analysis is limited by the fact that the immunogenicity testing was introduced after the trial had started, and not all patients could be included. As antidrug antibody positivity rates are very low compared with other biologics,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> these data suggest that the immunogenic potential of tocilizumab could be low. However, these results do not exclude the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Other safety outcomes were consistent between the two study groups, except that the add-on strategy resulted in a numerically higher proportion of patients who had transaminase level increases compared with the switch strategy. This trend was also observed at week 24 and in other tocilizumab clinical trials, including ACT-STAR and ACT-SURE.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These observations suggest that methotrexate and tocilizumab may have an additive effect on liver transaminases, the clinical relevance of which remains unclear. Overall, the incidence of events such as SAEs, SIs and discontinuations was similar between the strategies and consistent with previous tocilizumab studies.</p><p>Both the add-on and the switch strategies (with or without additional DMARDs) led to meaningful clinical and radiographic responses that could be maintained and, in some cases, improved upon in the first year of treatment. While there was no major overall difference between the add-on and switch treatment strategies, ACT-RAY provides useful information for clinical decision making on a per-patient basis. For example, the addition of tocilizumab to methotrexate may be the preferred approach in patients who can tolerate methotrexate as per EULAR treatment recommendations.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, for patients who cannot be treated with methotrexate, a switch to tocilizumab monotherapy is an option that may provide a robust level of disease control. Examination of other sets of patients with RA (including registries) will be necessary to confirm and further corroborate the results reported herein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204761-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1403" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge and thank Paul-Peter Tak for his critical contributions to the design of the study.
