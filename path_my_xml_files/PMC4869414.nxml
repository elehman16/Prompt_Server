Postoperative Management</title><p>Mean time under traction was 42 days for patients in Group A. For the first 14 days they were kept at hospital. When the hip pain was reduced they were discharged to have skeletal traction at home for the remaining 28 days, when the proximal tibial pin was removed in an outpatient department. After the appearance of clinical and radiological signs of fracture union, weight-bearing was allowed. Group B patients were mobilized on the first day after surgery and sat on their bed, and on the second postoperative day, patients were asked to walk without weight-bearing. On average 73 days after surgery, the external fixator was removed without hospitalization under local anesthesia after confirmation of radiological imaging about fracture union (range 69-77 days) (<xref rid="A15477R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and at this point full weight-bearing was allowed. When the fixators were removed, pin tract classification was done on a scale of 0 to 5, according to the system of Dhal (<xref rid="A15477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Pin entry sites were cleaned with saline solution every two days. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL, daily) (<xref rid="A15477R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) was also administered in both groups for 28 days, for deep vein thrombosis prevention. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 14, 45, 90, 180 and 360 days after surgery and X-rays were performed during each follow up. Radiographic union was defined by observation of bridging trabeculae or periosteal callus within the fracture line (10). Patient data also included pre-fracture and postoperative ability to walk independently, number of blood transfusions, postoperative complications, degree of pain assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) on the third postoperative day and during hospitalization. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the Harris hip score (HHS) (<xref rid="A15477R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), 12 months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec142982"><title>3.3.

Results</title><p>The average age of the skeletal traction group and external fixator group was 82 years (range 63-98 years) and 77 years (range 61-96 years), respectively. In both groups blood loss during operation was minimal and postoperative and preoperative hemoglobin levels were similar. No blood transfusion was required. The average intraoperative time was 15 minutes in patients treated by an external fixator. During the 12-month follow-up period, 13 patients (8 patients in group A and 5 in group B) died because of unrelated reasons to the fracture (P &#x0003e; 0.05). All fractures healed uneventfully in both groups. For fractures with extension to the subtrochanteric area and with comminution of the medial cortex, more time to heal was required. Decrease in the range of motion of hip or knee was observed in nine patients (33%) of group A and three patients (10%) of group B (P &#x0003e; 0.05). In patients of group A, eight fractures (36.36%) that were all AO type A1 were acceptably reduced whereas 14 fractures (63.63%) were reduced with valgus angulation or translation. In group B patients, 26 fractures (86.66%) were acceptably reduced and four fractures (13.33%) were reduced with valgus angulation or translation. This difference was statistically significant (P &#x0003c; 0.05). In one patient of group B, the reduction was lost because of cutout and varus collapse, as indicated by comparisons with the radiographs taken immediately after surgery. The fixator was well accepted in group B patients and sitting or lying was not difficult for any of the subjects. The average VAS score was 5.7 (range 2-9) for group A and 5.3 for group B (range 3-9) (P &#x0003e; 0.05), the average Harris Hip Score was 57 (range 47-88) for group A and 66 (range 41-90) for group B after the 12 months follow up, showing no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Length of hospitalization was between 10 and 16 days (mean 14.3 days) in group A and 2.2 days (range 1-4 days) in group B patients, showing a statistically significant difference between groups A and B (P &#x0003c; 0.05), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl36721">Table 2</xref>). Pin tract complications developed in group B patients; 21 patients (70%) had grade 1 infection (only marginal inflammation treated with frequent pin care) and 9 patients (30%) had grade 2 infection (serous discharge of pin site; all treated with frequent pin care plus oral antibiotics (<xref rid="A15477R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)). No sign of osteolysis was observed around the Schanz pins. Nine patients (30%) in group A and four patients (13%) in group B developed bedsores (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Postoperative complications included pneumonia in four patients (6.6%), urinary tract infection in five patients (8.3%), and deep venous thrombosis in four patients (6.6%); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.</p><table-wrap id="tbl36721" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Postoperative Results of Patients Treated by External Fixator vs. Skeletal Traction <sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn39247">a</xref>,<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn39248">b</xref></sup></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group A (Skeletal Traction)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group B (External Fixator)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Discussion</title><p>Fifty to sixty percent of intertrochanteric fractures are unstable (<xref rid="A15477R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and several methods have been introduced for fixation of these fractures. External fixation was first described by Scott (<xref rid="A15477R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) for the treatment of these fractures. Since then, studies have been done on this type of treatment, but results were not conclusive (<xref rid="A15477R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, in recent articles, intertrochanteric fractures treated with developed external fixators showed better results (<xref rid="A15477R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="A15477R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). All these studies reported on the benefits of external fixation such as simple application, insignificant blood loss, less radiation exposure, pain lessening, satisfactory stability and early mobilization. Intertrochanteric external fixators have been mainly used in elderly high-risk patients (<xref rid="A15477R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and in multiple trauma patients (<xref rid="A15477R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our results are in accordance with the aforementioned studies. Limitations of hip or knee joint motion, and bed sores were lower in group B patients. The visual analog scale and Harris hip score were higher for patients treated by an external fixator, although no statistically significant difference from group A patients was found. On the other hand, a statistically significant difference was found in acceptable reduction and duration of hospitalization between the two groups; with group B having more acceptable reduction, earlier discharge and less costs than group A. The present study confirms the advantages of external fixation for management of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly, high-risk patients. In agreement with previous studies, the mean intraoperative time for application of the fixator was about 0.2 times less than other methods, such as compression hip screw and intramedullary nailing (<xref rid="A15477R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="A15477R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). No blood transfusion was required (<xref rid="A15477R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These advantages are of high importance for these patients. These benefits have not been found with other less invasive methods (<xref rid="A15477R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Another advantage of external fixation was the possibility of application under local anesthesia for patients with poor general health (<xref rid="A15477R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A15477R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There was no need for a fracture table to achieve acceptable reduction in the external fixator group and reduction was accomplished only by hanging the proximal tibia off the operating table instead of consuming time for setting up the fracture table. The external fixator offers additional advantages, leading to minimal radiation exposure (Vekris et al. (<xref rid="A15477R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) found similar results). An additional advantage of the external fixator is less postoperative pain according to patient reports. As a result, the probability of resuming the former level of activity is higher. Although functional results were slightly better in the external fixator group, it was not significantly different between the two groups, and the mean HHS was low in both groups. In accordance to the study by Vossinakis and Badras (<xref rid="A15477R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), nine of our patients had grade 2 pin tract infection (serous discharge of pin site) and were all treated with frequent pin care plus oral antibiotics (<xref rid="A15477R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, pin-tract infection did not occur in the study by Moroni et al. (<xref rid="A15477R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We think that better results of their study were attributed to the application of hydroxyapatite-coated pins, as revealed by bone ingrowth in histological sections. Varus collapse and shortening are the result of mechanical failure of fixation of unstable or severely osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures. Even though most of the fractures in our study were osteoporotic, low mechanical failure was noticed in the group treated with the external fixator compared to the skeletal traction group and the difference was statistically significant. Badras et al. (<xref rid="A15477R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) reported a significantly lower incidence of proximal screw penetration into the joint with the external fixator compared with the dynamic hip screw. In these cases, as indicated by Vekris et al. (<xref rid="A15477R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), retraction of the screw without the need for anesthesia can be performed. In our cases we did not have any migration in the proximal screw, and we only had one cut out from the superior cortex. That was a reverse oblique type of intertrochanteric fracture and due to the poor condition of the patient it was treated conservatively. Difficulty in assessment of fracture-healing is a potential disadvantage of external fixation. Using improved diagnostic tools or application of radiolucent fixators may help solve this problem. In addition, a fixator with compression and distraction capacity at the site of fracture may accelerate fracture healing (<xref rid="A15477R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The optimum study design of this randomized clinical trial restricted the possibility of confounding clinical variables. However, non-blinded assessments of the radiographic variables as well as evaluation of the pin tracts are potential reasons for bias. In conclusion, our study suggests the use of external fixation as an option for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures in elderly high-risk patients. It is applicable under local anesthesia and does not need any fracture table and with this method radiation exposure is minimal, operative time is short, blood loss is negligible, reduction is acceptable and stable, limitation of hip/knee motion is not appreciable, bed sore rate is low, duration of hospitalization is short, costs are low and functional outcomes are favorable.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Mr. Mehrabi for his valuable assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn45921" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions:</bold>Study concept and design: Farideh Najafi and Gholam Hossein Kazemian; acquisition of data: Gholam Hossein Kazemian, Alireza Manafi and Farideh Najafi; analysis and interpretation of data: Farideh Najafi and Mohmmad Amin Najafi; drafting of the manuscript: Farideh Najafi and Mohammad Amin Najafi; critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Gholam Hossein Kazemian, Alireza Manafi and Farideh Najafi; statistical analysis: Mohammad Amin Najafi and Farideh Najafi; administrative, technical and material support: Gholam Hossein Kazemian, Mohammad Emami, Alireza Manafi and Farideh Najafi; study supervision: Gholam Hossein Kazemian and Alireza Manafi.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="A15477R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lindskog</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Baumgaertner</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unstable intertrochanteric hip fractures in the elderly.</article-title><source>J Am Acad Orthop Surg.</source><year>2004</year><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15161171</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="A15477R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of intertrochanteric fractures by skeletal pinning and external fixation.</article-title><source>Clin Orthop.</source><year>1957</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>326</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13561572</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="A15477R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Magyar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Toksvig-Larsen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hydroxyapatite coating of threaded pins enhances fixation.</article-title><source>J Bone Joint Surg Br.</source><year>1997</year><volume>79</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>487</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9180334</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="A15477R4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Faldini</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pegreffi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoang-Kim</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vannini</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Giannini</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dynamic hip screw compared with external fixation for treatment of osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures.
