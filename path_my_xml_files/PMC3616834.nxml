Several studies have described the unmet needs of patients dying in hospitals, such as poor symptom control and insufficient communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Gaps in end-of-life care have been identified, e.g. the lack of awareness of approaching death, and shortcomings in healthcare professionals&#x02019; knowledge of and skills in palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To date research on end-of-life care in hospitals has been mainly descriptive, focusing on the characteristics of care, identifying problems and suggesting possibilities for improvement. In a literature review, Al-Qurainy et al. (2009) proposed improvement strategies: integration of palliative care services in the hospital to enhance caregivers&#x02019; attention for the transition of treatment goals; increase of palliative care knowledge among healthcare professionals; and improvement of prognostication, advanced care planning and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, experimental studies on quality improvement interventions in end-of-life care in the hospital are scarce, partly due to methodological challenges in health services research in general and in the field of palliative care in particular. Many results of studies on quality improvement interventions are thus affected by concerns about the validity and reliability of data, due to e.g. limitations of the design, selection bias, inaccurate measurements and confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To evaluate the effects of changes in palliative care structures and processes on patient outcomes, innovative experimental research is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands most in-hospital deaths occur on wards that lack specific palliative care expertise. Innovations to improve the quality of end-of-life care in the hospital have to be disseminated to all these wards and to be integrated in the whole hospital care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This process of quality improvement seems to be comparable to innovations in other fields of hospital health care, such as infection prevention, and tissue and wound care. To address these problems, networks of specialized nurses, such as infection control link nurses have been implemented in many hospitals. Only few studies have evaluated the effects of these link nurses&#x02019; networks, but the results were promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Some work has been done on networks of palliative care nurse champions in the UK, and evaluations indicated that champions&#x02019; self reported knowledge on palliative care, and confidence in collaborative working had increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the Netherlands a few hospitals have recently started such a network. The empowerment of hospital nurses in being an ambassador of palliative and end-of-life care and in the dissemination of palliative care knowledge and skills could contribute to the quality of care of patients dying in the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This implies the translation of knowledge and skills from palliative care experts via the network of nurse champions to the wards. The translation of knowledge is a complex process, partly because various types of knowledge (e.g. explicit and tacit) are involved, and it has to be received by various persons in various contexts. Therefore such translation requires various teaching skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Transfer of theoretical knowledge by experts to ward nurses easily conflicts with nurses&#x02019; daily practice; nurses may decide that it is irrelevant, or that implementation is impossible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A network of ward based nurse champions, as intermediates between palliative care experts and ward nurses, is expected to improve the results of education. Nurse champions are probably more dedicated to palliative care than other nurses and have more insight in the culture and processes on their wards than the experts. It is thus probably easier to adapt the educational programme to prior knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and educational needs of the champions than of all nurses on all the wards, and the content of the programme will easier be experienced as meaningful when champions can connect it to the context in which they work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Education and training of health care professionals will only be successful when it leads to improved practice and decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In palliative care this means timely identification of patients in need of palliative and end-of life care, timely referral to palliative care experts, collaboration between patients, family and the medical team, the use of guidelines and appropriate working procedures, and knowledge of palliative care and symptom management on the clinical wards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Being a resource and role model for their colleagues, nurse champions can contribute to improved quality of palliative care, when they have sufficient clinical experience, improved knowledge of palliative care, improved teaching capacities, and acquired authority towards managers and colleagues. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Still, rigorous evaluation of the effects of nurse champions on the outcome of care is necessary. In this article we describe the study protocol of the PalTeC-H project: a study on understanding and improving Palliative and Terminal Care in the Hospital by implementing a palliative care network of nurse champions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Objectives of this study are (1) to explore and understand the impact of the quality of care on the quality of life at the end of life and the quality of dying in a hospital and (2) to investigate the contribution of a quality improvement intervention which consists of the implementation of a network of palliative care nurse champions. We define end-of-life care as care provided during the last three days of life (at most). We hypothesize the implementation of the network to result in more attention for palliative care, in improved and timely recognition of patients&#x02019; palliative care needs, in more involvement of palliative care experts and, eventually, in improved quality of life during the last three days of life, improved quality of dying and increased satisfaction of bereaved relatives.</p></sec><sec><title>The intervention</title><p>The intervention consists of the establishment of a palliative care network of nurse champions which indirectly affects care by three main components: education, knowledge dissemination and support, plus several organizational elements (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). On intervention wards two staff nurses are appointed to be palliative care nurse champions &#x02013; further referred to as champions. Together they form the palliative care network coordinated by the multidisciplinary consultation team for pain and palliative care. Champions participate in monthly educational meetings of the network and in a targeted education programme of two days annually. The education programme includes palliative care knowledge and skills as well as organizational knowledge and skills, e.g. on planning dissemination of knowledge, in order to teach the champions to be an ambassador of palliative care on the wards and a role model for their colleagues. The educational strategy is based on the principles of constructivist learning and includes multiple approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A senior nurse consultant, member of the multidisciplinary consultation team, is assigned to be the network coordinator, supported by the medical oncologist of the team. This network coordinator facilitates the learning process of champions, by organizing meetings and education programmes, and supporting champions individually in their development and in performing activities. The monthly meetings stimulate the incremental grow of knowledge. Working and learning in a network throughout the hospital give champions the opportunity to share knowledge and learn from others&#x02019; experiences, and to capture knowledge from outside their own working environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left"><bold>Phase</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Activities</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Method</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Preparation<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ward selection<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Registration multidisciplinary consultation team<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Literature review<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Consent of 7 ward managers<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Organization<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Selection of 14 palliative care nurse champions<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Appointment of a coordinator<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Development and planning network and education programme<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Introduction and follow-up<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Composition network<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Contact coordinator, ward manager and nurse champions on intervention wards<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Meetings<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Every month 90&#x000a0;minutes (9 meetings per year)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Education<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Targeted education programme 2&#x000a0;days yearly and at every network meeting<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mission/champions&#x02019; activities<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dissemination of knowledge (lessons, bedside teaching, being a resource)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Planned activities on each ward<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promotion of consulting multidisciplinary consultation team on pain and palliative care<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Implementation of problem based care pathways or protocols on wards<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acting as a role model<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Support<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Coaching nurse champions in plans and activities<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Information in organizational journal, information in newsletters<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">Discuss compliance with unit managers</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Champions need to identify gaps in knowledge on and quality of palliative care on their ward and to raise health care givers&#x02019; awareness on patients&#x02019; palliative care needs.

The intervention, i.e. the appointment of two champions joining the network, is introduced in seven wards that regularly admit cancer patients or patients with other chronic and life threatening diseases, such as chronic cardiac diseases and COPD. Although there is not much evidence on the time needed to effectively disseminate expertise and knowledge into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we decided that the introduction phase lasts five months, as a run-up period to generate gradual changes in champions&#x02019; behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Expecting a participation rate of 50% among nurses, physicians and relatives we aim to include 400 cases in the pre-intervention phase and 400 in the post-intervention phase.</p><p>Data will be analyzed using descriptive analyses, univariate and multivariate regression analyses, t-tests, ANOVA and Chi square tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Approval for this study was given by the Medical Ethical Research Committee of the Erasmus MC. The intervention was assigned to seven wards and randomisation of individual patients was not needed. According to the Dutch legislation informed consent was not required because data is gathered after patients&#x02019; death and the study involves no more than minimal risk to the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Measurement of quality of end-of-life care</title><p>The multidimensionality and evolution of care at the end of life have been subject of many studies in the last decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Quality of life, quality of dying and quality of care are overlapping constructs but can be distinguished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Quality of life (at the end of life) involves physical, psychological, social and spiritual experiences, and quality of dying additionally includes the domains of nature of health care, life closure and death preparation, and the circumstances of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Quality of care at the end of life addresses the extent to which these domains are affected by health care.</p><p>We study the quality of care of dying patients and their families, as suggested by Stewart et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Stewart&#x02019;s model suggests that health care structures and processes, such as organization, physical environment, communication and decision making, as well as individual patient factors, e.g. diagnosis, psychological characteristics and religious background, determine the quality of dying. According to this model we study to which extent the structure and process of care and patient factors affect the quality of life during the last days of life and quality of dying in the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In consequence of the uncertainty of prognostication, ethical concerns and methodological considerations of prospective measurement in dying patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], we perform retrospective assessments. We invite relatives to participate 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months after the patient's death and incorporate overlap in items asked to relatives and healthcare providers, to address potential recall bias and differences in the reporting of subjective states, such as pain and anxiety, between patients, relatives and healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>A literature search for instruments investigating different aspects of end-of-life care showed that quality of life instruments do not capture experiences unique to the dying process and focus on physical domains mainly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In 2008 and 2010, reviews were published on quality of life instruments for use in palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], quality of dying instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and instruments for the assessment of care of the dying, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] respectively. It was concluded that the QODD, a measure of Quality of Dying and Death developed by Curtis et al. (2002) is the best tested measure of quality of dying to date, although the developers themselves judged it to be suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The QODD did not meet our goals precisely, because of e.g. the extent of assessing symptoms at the end of life (two physical symptoms only) and the timeframe of reference (one week to one month before death). In addition, it has not been used as a self-completion questionnaire by relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. More recently Mayland (2011) published on the ECHO-D questionnaire (Evaluating Care and Health Outcomes &#x02013; for the Dying), developed to evaluate the impact of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient among bereaved relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. We specifically aim to investigate preferences and experiences in the last three days of life, the inter-relationship of the different domains of quality of life during the last days of life and quality of dying, and their association with bereaved relatives&#x02019; overall satisfaction with the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Therefore, we developed three new questionnaires, taking into account the content of previous questionnaires, to include the perspectives of relatives and health care providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of the intervention</title><p>According to the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for Development and Evaluation of RCT&#x02019;s for Complex Interventions to improve health, the intervention with a network of champions is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Many ingredients contribute to the effects, such as the individual champions&#x02019; knowledge and skills and interdisciplinary collaboration, and &#x0201c;it is not easy precisely to define the &#x0201c;active ingredients&#x0201d; of the intervention&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The performance depends on the activities of the champions in the context of their ward, and the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; to which professionals and patients are exposed to the intervention may differ among the wards. A principal element of the intervention is the transfer of knowledge. Knowledge transfer is an interpersonal and cognitive process that can promote change strategies and the utilization of this knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Coaching the champions to adapt various approaches for the implementation of their newly acquired knowledge is an important tool in our study, in consequence of the need for simultaneous strategies in health care innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To date reported effects of champions&#x02019; networks are limited to increased knowledge and confidence of the champions themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. This study will add information on changes in health carers&#x02019; behaviour and eventually on the impact on the quality of life at the end of life, the quality of dying and proxies&#x02019; satisfaction with care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study will improve the understanding of and attention for patients&#x02019; needs, and the quality of care in the dying phase in the hospital.
