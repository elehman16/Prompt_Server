Hip fracture incidence in the placebo group in our analysis and in the overall ITT population was compared in order to further delineate the efficacy of risedronate in the subgroup of women eligible for inclusion in our study.</p><p>The HIP study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cia-4-445">3</xref> was a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study conducted between November 1993 and April 1998 at 183 study centers in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Ambulatory postmenopausal women were enrolled in two groups: (1) women aged 70 to 79 years on the basis of low BMD; and (2) women aged &#x02265;80 years on the basis of low BMD (16% of the group population) or the presence of &#x02265;1 non-skeletal, fall-related risk factors (58% of the group population) which, at the time, were documented to predispose the patient to osteoporosis-related hip fracture (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-4-445">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cia-4-445">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-4-445">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-4-445">11</xref> These risk factors included difficulty standing from a sitting position; poor tandem gait; fall-related injury during the previous year; psychomotor score of &#x02264;5 on the Clifton Modified Gibson Spiral Maze Test;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-4-445">11</xref> current smoking or smoking during the previous 5 years; maternal history of hip fracture; previous hip fracture; and/or hip-axis length of &#x02265;11.1 cm.</p><p>Women were randomized to daily treatment with 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg risedronate, or an identical-appearing placebo.

A total of 1656 women had low BMD and at least one prevalent vertebral fracture and were, therefore, eligible for analysis. Of these, 1090 received risedronate and 566 received placebo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cia-4-445">Figure 1</xref>). Baseline characteristics of the placebo and treatment groups were similar, and were comparable to the baseline characteristics of the original ITT population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-4-445">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Hip fracture occurred in 7.4% of women receiving placebo in our study compared with 3.9% of women receiving placebo in the ITT population of the HIP study, confirming that women with established osteoporosis are at higher risk of fracture than are those of the same age who do not have established osteoporosis.</p><p>In women with established osteoporosis, the incidence of hip fracture in those receiving risedronate was 3.8% compared with 7.4% in women receiving placebo. Compared with placebo, risedronate 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg once daily reduced the risk of hip fracture by 46% (relative risk [RR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.32&#x02013;0.91; <italic>P</italic> = 0.019) in women aged 70&#x02013;100 years with established osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cia-4-445">Table 3</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cia-4-445">3</xref> This was a numerical larger risk reduction than that found in the overall ITT population from the HIP study (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6&#x02013;0.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cia-4-445">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>In an analysis of the women included in our study, the proportion of women who had any adverse event, who had a serious adverse event, or who withdrew because of an adverse event was similar regardless of treatment group.

The HIP study demonstrated that, compared with placebo, risedronate significantly reduced the risk of hip fracture in the overall ITT population by 30% (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6&#x02013;0.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cia-4-445">3</xref> In women aged 70&#x02013;79 years with low BMD, risedronate reduced the risk of hip fracture by 40% (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4&#x02013;0.9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.009), and in those with low BMD and a prevalent vertebral fracture by 60% (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2&#x02013;0.8; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). In contrast, active treatment did not significantly reduce the incidence of hip fracture compared with placebo among women aged &#x02265;80 years (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6&#x02013;1.2; <italic>P</italic> = 0.35). However, most (58%) of the women aged &#x02265;80 years were recruited solely according to the presence of at least one non-skeletal risk factor, and only a minority (16%) were recruited on the basis of a T-score &#x02264; &#x02212;4 at the femoral neck (manufacturer&#x02019;s reference database for the densitometer). The present study demonstrates that risedronate is efficacious in older postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, reducing the risk of hip fracture by 46% compared with placebo. This significant reduction in fracture risk occurred in a high-risk group of patients, with a placebo fracture incidence of 7.4% (almost double that of patients receiving placebo in the overall ITT population [3.9%]).</p><p>The HORIZON-PFT is the only other study to demonstrate the efficacy treatment with a bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid infused once yearly) in reducing the risk of hip fracture as a primary end point in older (aged 65&#x02013;89 years, mean 73) post-menopausal women. Over 3-years, hip fracture incidence was reduced from 2.5% in the placebo group to 1.4% with annual infusions of zoledronic acid (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42&#x02013;0.83; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-cia-4-445">4</xref></p><p>It has also been documented that drug treatment aimed at improving the bone component of fracture risk is effective when patients have well-defined bone-related risk. For example, in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT-1), in women aged 55 to 81 years with low BMD and at least one vertebral fracture, alendronate was shown to significantly reduce the risk of hip fracture, which was captured as a secondary end point in the prospective study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-4-445">13</xref> However, in the FIT-2 trial, in patients with low BMD and without baseline vertebral fracture, alendronate was not shown to reduce the risk of hip fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-445">14</xref> In the Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis (TROPOS) study, strontium ranelate did not significantly reduce the incidence of hip fracture in the overall ITT population at 3 years (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.61&#x02013;1.19; <italic>P</italic> = 0.333).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-4-445">15</xref> In a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, strontium ranelate was shown to significantly reduce the risk of hip fractures at 3-years compared with placebo in a high fracture-risk subgroup of women aged &#x02265;74 years with a T-score of &#x02264; &#x02212;3.0 (&#x02264;&#x02212;2.4 NHANES III) (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.41&#x02013;1.00; <italic>P</italic> = 0.046).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-4-445">15</xref> A study to demonstrate the efficacy of ibandronate included women aged 55&#x02013;80 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cia-4-445">16</xref> Ibandronate was not shown to reduce non-vertebral fractures in the overall study population but did demonstrate fracture risk reduction in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis in a high-risk group of patients with low BMD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cia-4-445">16</xref> Hip fractures were not assessed separately. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that drug treatment which focuses on the bone component of fracture risk is more effective if bone-related risks are present and documented.</p><p>In addition to addressing the bone component of fracture risk, it is worth noting that most hip fractures result from a fall or stumble,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cia-4-445">17</xref> and an older individual&#x02019;s increased fracture risk reflects not only their reduced bone strength, but also an increased propensity to fall and a loss of protective reflexes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cia-4-445">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cia-4-445">18</xref> Some authors have, therefore, suggested that the focus of fracture prevention should be shifted from the treatment of osteoporosis to the prevention of falls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-cia-4-445">19</xref> In the USA, the Surgeon General guideline on fracture prevention advises an integrated approach to prevent fractures, including lifestyle advice, fall prevention advice, and drug treatment to prevent fractures when appropriate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-4-445">20</xref> However, this should be in addition to, rather than instead of, osteoporosis treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-4-445">21</xref> The hypothesis that a combined bone- and fall-related approach reduces fracture risk more than when only bone-directed drug treatment is given, still needs to be documented. Although there are some data demonstrating the efficacy of focused or multifactorial fall-prevention programs on fall risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cia-4-445">22</xref> none have demonstrated an effect on fracture prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cia-4-445">23</xref></p><p>Our study provides evidence for the efficacy of an oral bisphosphonate in a group of older postmenopausal women at highest risk of fracture. However, there are several limitations to be considered. As 98% of women in the HIP study were white, our results do not necessarily apply to older postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis in other racial groups. Our study also shares the limitations of all subgroup analyses, especially when performed <italic>post hoc</italic>, including diminished power to detect real differences, increase in the variance around the mean estimate, and increasing statistical likelihood of a false finding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-4-445">24</xref> These limitations are, however, mitigated by the fact that hip fracture prevention was the primary end point in the HIP study and the inclusion of a large, clearly defined subgroup of the ITT population in our analysis.</p><p>The findings of this analysis show that risedronate is effective in reducing the risk of hip fracture in elderly women aged up to 100 years with established osteoporosis. It is also acknowledged, particularly in the elderly, that falls are associated with an increased fracture risk. However, it remains to be shown that the addition of fall prevention measures to bone-directed therapy will have further benefit for fracture prevention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors received editorial/writing support in the preparation of this manuscript from The Alliance for Better Bone Health (Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals and sanofi-aventis US, Inc.).
