IDeg forms soluble multi-hexamers at the injection site and is slowly absorbed, while IAsp hexamers dissociate upon injection into rapidly absorbed monomers. This results in a novel pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile compared with premix insulins, characterized by the distinct basal to prandial effect observed with IDegAsp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with a stable basal insulin coverage over a 24-h period due to the IDeg component, and without the need for resuspension. IDegAsp is recommended to be administered once (OD) or twice daily (BID) with main meal(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Two clinical trials in the IDegAsp clinical development program showed that, compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30), treatment intensification with IDegAsp BID over 26&#x000a0;weeks results in fewer confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemic episodes whilst reaching the non-inferiority margin for mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A combined analysis of these two trials reports that estimated rate ratios of overall confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemic events with IDegAsp BID compared with BIAsp 30 were 0.69 [95% CI 0.55; 0.87], 0.38 [95% CI 0.25; 0.58], and 0.16 [95% CI 0.04; 0.59], respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A preceding trial to the current one added further understanding of two different titration algorithms (e.g., a &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; algorithm using twice-weekly dosing adjustments and a &#x0201c;stepwise&#x0201d; algorithm using once-weekly dose adjustment) of the new co-formulation of IDegAsp BID, when used as an intensification regimen in patients inadequately controlled with a basal-only regimen (i.e., insulin glargine OD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After 26&#x000a0;weeks of IDegAsp BID treatment, 67% of patients successfully achieved the recommended HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of less than 7%, accompanied by significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), while rates of hypoglycemia were in line with previous trials of intensification with IDegAsp BID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>At the end of the preceding trial, a small sample of patients were left still experiencing poor glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These represent a group of difficult-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and it raises the question of which treatment pathway is appropriate for those who do not respond to intensification with IDegAsp BID. Therefore, in the current trial, two treatment strategies were investigated as potential intensification options: (a) adding a single injection of bolus insulin at the third main meal (i.e., IAsp OD) in addition to IDegAsp BID, in order to provide additional mealtime glycemic control; (b) switching to a full basal&#x02013;bolus regimen (i.e., IDeg&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp three times a day [TID]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample</title><p>The sample was recruited from 68 male and female patients (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with a body mass index [BMI] &#x02264;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who had failed to achieve glycemic control following 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with IDegAsp BID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Key exclusion criteria were the presence of cardiovascular (CV) events (e.g., stroke) between the start of the preceding trial and consenting to the present trial, uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure &#x02265;180&#x000a0;mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mmHg) and the presence of recurrent severe hypoglycemia (more than one event within the previous 12&#x000a0;months), or hypoglycemic unawareness, as evaluated by the investigator.

The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia was 1.50 episodes/PYE in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD arm and 1.37 episodes/PYE in the IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID arm; RR [95% CI] 1.10; [0.36; 3.42] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Only two patients reported severe hypoglycemia events, both in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD treatment arm.</p><p>There were 33 AEs in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD treatment arm and 45 AEs in the IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID arm. There was one adverse cardiac event (atrial fibrillation) in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD treatment arm and none in the IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID arm. One event of stroke was positively adjudicated in the IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID arm and none in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD arm. There were two SAEs in the IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD treatment arm and three in the IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID arm. None of the SAEs were judged by the investigator to be &#x0201c;possibly&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;probably&#x0201d; related to the trial product or to bolus insulin, and no deaths were reported in the trial. Further safety data are presented in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In previous IDegAsp clinical trials, patients with T2D inadequately controlled on OADs plus an alternative insulin regimen (i.e., basal-only insulin detemir, insulin glargine administered OD or BID; a premix, analogue insulin regimen administered BID; or an insulin regimen containing a rapid-acting component) have shown similar reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fewer hypoglycemic episodes following intensification with IDegAsp BID versus comparator regimens (i.e., basal&#x02013;prandial, premix BID)&#x02014;with the responder rate for HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% following IDegAsp BID treatment ranging from 48.2% to 56.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the preceding titration trial comparing a simple vs. stepwise titration of IDegAsp BID in patients previously inadequately controlled on basal insulin, the overall responder rate for intensification with IDegAsp BID was 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which is higher than that seen in the earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, there was a small population of more difficult-to-treat patients, for whom poor glycemic control persisted despite insulin intensification beyond basal-only treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This scenario is clinically interesting and is commonly encountered in real-world clinical practice. Therefore, the current trial provides relevant treatment information for clinicians regarding the efficacy and safety of further insulin intensification using two different strategies. However, as a result of the low number of patients participating in this exploratory trial, the results should be confirmed by further clinical trials.</p><p>Adding IAsp OD treatment to an IDegAsp BID regimen resulted in the maintenance of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels over the 26-week period, while the switch to an IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID regimen significantly reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.49%. As may be expected for this difficult-to-treat population, a small proportion of patients achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% in both IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD and IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID groups (four vs. five patients, respectively). The reduction in FPG was numerically higher with IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID compared with IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD, although no statistical difference between the groups was observed, and the mean increase in body weight was similar for both treatment arms.</p><p>The frequency of AEs observed during treatment was similar in both treatments and in line with existing trials, with few severe hypoglycemic episodes being reported and no new safety issues being identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>As recommended in the most recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, treatment for T2D should be personalized, culturally appropriate, and take into account the patient&#x02019;s own preferences and expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As demonstrated in the current trial, treatment adaptations may be challenging for some patients. Whilst patients switching to IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID did experience an approximate 0.5% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, alternative combination regimens (e.g., combination insulins plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs] and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) may need to be considered. However, data from clinical trials regarding intensification of IDegAsp BID in combination with such treatments are not currently available.</p><p>The current trial had a number of limitations. The sample was smaller than originally predicted for this exploratory trial, primarily because of the success of the preceding trial in achieving glycemic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], so the results should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, as a result of the participation of a specified trial population (i.e., those who had failed to reach glycemic targets on 26&#x000a0;weeks of IDegAsp BID treatment, following initial failure on basal insulin), the results should not be generalized to the wider population of all patients with T2D.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment intensification of a sample of patients that failed to reach glycemic targets following 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with IDegAsp BID resulted in HbA<sub>1c</sub> being significantly reduced by a subsequent 26-week IDeg OD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp TID regimen compared with a 26-week IDegAsp BID&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;IAsp OD regimen, while no new safety issues were identified. Alternative treatment intensification regimens for difficult-to-treat patients failing IDegAsp BID therapy need to be further studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
