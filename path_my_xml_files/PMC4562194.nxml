We compared exacerbation rates in COPD patients with a history of frequent exacerbations (at least three moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in the past two years) during a 12-week treatment course and over a subsequent 48-week follow up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>292 patients were randomised to one of three treatments for 12&#x000a0;weeks: roxithromycin 300&#x000a0;mg daily and doxycycline 100&#x000a0;mg daily (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;101); roxithromycin 300&#x000a0;mg daily (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;97); or matching placebos (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;94). There were no differences in the annualised moderate and severe exacerbation rates after treatment with roxithromycin/doxycycline (2.83 (95&#x000a0;% CI 2.37-3.40)) or roxithromycin only (2.69 (2.26-3.21)) compared to placebo (2.5 (2.08-3.03)) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.352 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5832 respectively). Furthermore, there were no differences in the annualised exacerbation rates during 12-week treatment with roxithromycin/doxycycline (1.64 (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.17-2.30)), roxithromycin only (1.75 (1.24-2.41)) or placebo (2.23 (1.68-3.03)) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1709 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2545 respectively). There were also no significant differences between groups for spirometry or quality of life scores over either the 12-week treatment or 48-week post-treatment periods. Both active treatments were associated with nausea but otherwise adverse events were comparable among treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Twelve-weeks of prophylaxis with roxithromycin/doxycycline combination or roxithromycin alone did not reduce COPD exacerbations in patients with history of frequent exacerbations. These findings do not support the use of these antibiotics to prevent exacerbations in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12952-015-0034-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a major impact on quality of life and are considered to be a cause of lung function decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce exacerbations rates has had a long history with clinical trials dating back to the 1950s. However a 2003 meta-analysis of clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics in chronic bronchitis found no significant reduction in the frequency of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since then, an improved definition and classification of COPD exacerbations has been introduced, along with several clinical trials of azithromycin and a 2013 Cochrane review indicating a significant reduction in the frequency of COPD exacerbations with prophylactic antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Our study assessed the impact of twelve weeks of the macrolide antibiotic roxithromycin (with and without doxycycline) on exacerbation rate and lung function decline in a COPD population with frequent exacerbations prior to study entry. The study was originally designed to test the hypothesis that <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> (now <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>) was a pathogenic factor in the aetiology of COPD and that eradication of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infection could reduce exacerbation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This hypothesis is now considered unsubstantiated and is no longer believed to be clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, this study allowed us to address the role of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing COPD exacerbations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p>The screening, randomisation, withdrawals and protocol deviations are shown in the CONSORT diagram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In addition there was no significant difference among treatment groups with regard to any of the other efficacy parameters examined i.e. lung function and quality of life scores.</p><p>At the time that this study was undertaken there was a focus on the role of chronic infection with <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> in the pathogenesis of chronic respiratory disorders such as COPD. Subsequently, interest in <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> as an important cofactor in the aetiology of respiratory diseases has dwindled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> seropositivity is seen in up to 77&#x000a0;% of stable COPD patients and is not significantly related to FEV<sub>1</sub> percentage predicted or exacerbation frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the included cohort with positive <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> serology had a greater degree of airflow obstruction and more exacerbations than the excluded patients, these findings are unlikely to have any impact on the efficacy endpoints in this study or the interpretation of these. Therefore it is plausible that the results of this clinical trial might be generalised to other COPD patients with frequent exacerbations.</p><p>The Cochrane review by Staykova et al published in 2003 analysed nine randomised controlled trials (all undertaken prior to 1970) of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in subjects with chronic bronchitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Tetracycline antibiotics predominated the clinical trials (including one trial with tetracycline/macrolide combination) with a variable treatment duration averaging 5&#x000a0;months. The 8.6&#x000a0;% reduction of exacerbations per patient year with treatment was not statistically significant. There was no significant reduction in exacerbation rate seen with tetracycline only studies. The finding of the lack of effect of prophylactic antibiotic use seen in our study is therefore in agreement with the findings from these historical prophylactic antibiotic studies.</p><p>Since this study was undertaken, a number of prophylactic antibiotic trials have been undertaken using newer macrolides and fluoroquinolones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These studies followed the documented efficacy of macrolide therapy in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population and more recently in non-CF bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recent studies of azithromycin or erythromycin in non-CF bronchiectasis showed that 6 to 12&#x000a0;month treatment with these macrolides reduced the rate of exacerbations and prolonged the duration to first exacerbations significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the updated Cochrane review on prophylactic antibiotic therapy in COPD, the largest randomised controlled trial by Albert et al studied 12&#x000a0;months of once daily 250&#x000a0;mg azithromycin in 1577 COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In accordance with our findings, there was no statistically significant difference in COPD hospitalisations (0.34 vs. 0.49 per patient year for azithromycin and placebo respectively), although the overall exacerbation rate was lower in the active treatment group (1.48 vs. 1.83 per patient year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unlike our study, half of the patients did not have history of frequent exacerbations, hence the lower annualised exacerbation rates and longer duration to first exacerbation. A more recent trial by Uzun et al used 500&#x000a0;mg azithromycin three times a week for 12&#x000a0;months in a smaller cohort of 92 COPD patients with history of three or more exacerbations in the previous year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The overall exacerbation rate was significantly lower in the azithromycin group than placebo (1.94 vs. 3.22 per patient year) as was the duration to first exacerbation (130 vs. 59&#x000a0;days). However, the rates of severe exacerbation and hospitalisation were not statistically different. They did not find any significant improvement in lung function and overall health-related quality of life. Both of these one-year azithromycin trials showed that the significant decrease in exacerbation rates between the active and placebo groups was seen within 3&#x000a0;months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although we observed a similar trend in our study, our results were not statistically significant.</p><p>A more recent randomised controlled trial by Brill et al of three different antibiotic regimens (including azithromycin) in patients with stable COPD found that there was no significant reduction in sputum bacterial load following 3&#x000a0;months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This suggests that azithromycin&#x02019;s action in reducing the risk of exacerbations in COPD patients may be due to its immunomodulatory effect as suggested by previous authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Even&#x000a0;though the number of patients who did not wish to continue on the study medications was higher in the roxithromycin/doxycyline group than the roxithromycin and placebo groups, their decisions were not related to the adverse events. We found that the adverse events from prophylactic antibiotics were tolerable and apart from nausea, were comparable between the treatment groups. Macrolides, however, are known to have cardiac side effects (e.g. prolonged QT interval) and could potentially cause malignant arrhythmia, such as torsades des pointes. A retrospective study on azithromycin by Ray et al showed that its use was associated with increased cardiovascular deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Erythromycin and azithromycin are also potent inducers of antimicrobial resistance in both non-CF bronchiectasis and COPD studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Herath et al, although unable to analyse the development of antibiotic resistance in their review, conveyed their concern on the impact of bacterial macrolide resistance as observed in the study by Albert et al. [3 5]. The more recent trials by Uzun et al and Brill et al have also shown the development of antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This resistance may limit treatment options for acute bacterial respiratory infection and even increase respiratory mortality. Our study in which antibiotics were given for twelve weeks did not examine antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>One of the strengths of our study is that it looked at both the 12-week on-treatment period and the 48-week run-out period, in order to see if any sustainable impact was present beyond the treatment period. Another is that even though the number of patients recruited did not reach the target, the dropout rate was lower than expected and therefore the number of patients was adequate in order to achieve statistical significance. This is one of the largest double-blind placebo-controlled trials undertaken on antibiotic prophylaxis in COPD in recent years.</p><p>This study has several limitations. There was a delay in getting the study prepared for publication. This was due a combination of factors which included the untimely death of the principal investigator. However, there was no delay in the analysis of the data and the results remained valid throughout this period. Although the study only included participants seropositive to <italic>C. pneumonia,</italic> as discussed above, our study cohort is likely to be representative of COPD patients with a history of frequent exacerbations. The duration of antibiotic therapy of twelve&#x000a0;weeks is shorter than other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which could limit any possible antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of these antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Twelve weeks of treatment with roxithromycin alone or in combination with doxycycline was tolerable but did not reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with COPD either during the treatment period or in the subsequent 48&#x000a0;weeks. The outcome of this study certainly does not justify the use of these antibiotics to prevent COPD exacerbations. There remains the need for a more targeted approach to reduce exacerbations in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations than the use of prophylactic antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was undertaken between February 2000 and April 2002 in 16 centres across Australia and New Zealand.
