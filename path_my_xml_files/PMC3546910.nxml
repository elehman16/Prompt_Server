Superovulation ensures recovery of multiple embryos during one estrous cycle, thus allowing us to maximally exploit the female germ pool. Reports of synchronization of estrus and superovulation of ewes have been previously discussed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The production of CO2 from glucose by sheep embryos has been determined
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and results have indicated that little glucose is utilized by the embryos of sheep and that blastocysts derived from oocytes, matured and fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic>, oxidized glucose at a lower rate than those developed <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, pyruvate (0.33 mmol/L) and lactate (3.3 mmol/L) together were beneficial to early embryonic development in sheep

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of Crestar for synchronization of estrus and porcine Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH-P) in inducing superovulation of ewes and to compare metabolism of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> derived embryos from the 8-cell to hatched blastocyst stages Enhancing the understanding of metabolic activity of pre implantation embryos with respect to improving the yield and quality of embryos was also an objective of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 23 ewes (Sangsari cross bred) between 2 and 5 years of age that were subjected to standard feeding and management protocols were used. Ewes were isolated from rams except at the time of mating. After deworming, ewes were tagged for identification and assigned randomly to either be bred during the normal breeding season (October through December; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 ewes) or out of season (June through August, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11 ewes).

Day 0 was the day the Crestar implant was removed. Beginning at 8 h after implant removal, ewes were observed for estrus three times each day, both visually and in the presence of teaser rams. When detected in estrus, ewes were mated two to three times with fertile rams. At the time of the first mating, each ewe was administered 1000 IU hCG (Chorulon; Intervet International; to induce ovulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Flushing embryos from oviduct and uterus</title><p>All ewes in the breeding and nonbreeding season were subjected to surgery to allow the oviducts and uterine horns to be flushed on Day 4 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for breeding season and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 for non-breeding season) or Day 6 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for breeding season and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for non-breeding season) using Dulbecco&#x02019;s Phosphate Buffer Saline (ZT156; IMV, France) as the flushing medium. On Day 4 each oviduct and uterine horn was flushed, whereas, only the uterine horns were flushed on Day 6 post mating. The ovarian response of each ewe was recorded with respect to the number of corpora lutea, unovulated follicles and overall ovarian activity as described previously

Anabolic metabolism was estimated by determining the amount of substrate carbon incorporated by the embryos. A specially washed and heat sterilized 20 mL scintillation vial served as the incubation apparatus. Embryos were washed through two changes (2 mL) of energy-substrate-free PBS and placed in a 50 &#x003bc;L drop of radioactive medium for a final wash before being transferred into a sterile, 600 &#x003bc;L micro centrifuge tube (Eppendorf Netheler Hinz; Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) containing 50 &#x003bc;L radioactive incubation medium. This tube was placed in the scintillation vial with the lid of the tube acting as a support. Simultaneously, 0.5 mL of 2.5 mol/L sodium hydroxide was added to the bottom of the vial, which was then closed and incubated at 39&#x000b0;C for 4 h. At the end of the incubation period, the tube with embryos was taken out and the radioactivity trapped as CO2 was determined after the addition of scintillation cocktail. In all experiments, at least two sham incubations were run concurrently to correct for background counts. The metabolic turnover was estimated from the disintegrations per minute detected in the sample and the specific activity of the parent substrate, and converted to picomoles/embryo/h on the basis that each glucose molecule gives rise to 6 molecules of CO2

The most important finding from this study is related to the uniformity in the percentage of ovulating follicles when ewes were given 1000 IU hCG at the time of first mating.

On Day 4 post-estrus only 30 ovulations occurred. When uterine flushing was carried out on Day 6 post-estrus, 17 embryos were recovered and all were morphologically normal. On Day 6 post-estrus only 28 ovulations occurred. During the non-breeding season, a total of 44 ovulations occurred. When the oviducts and uterine horns were flushed on Day 4 post-estrus only 9 embryos at the 4-cell stage were recovered. On Day 4 post-estrus only 31 ovulations occurred. But, when only uterine flushing carried out on Day 6 post-estrus, three embryos were recovered out of 13 ovulations, and all embryos were morphologically normal. These studies were conducted to observed differences between breeding and nonbreeding seasons. The retarded or degenerated embryos could have resulted from either late ovulations or an arrest in their developmental process. However, if they were morphologically normal, such retarded embryos may have the potential to develop further if provided a suitable uterine environment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These results are similar to those reported earlier suggesting that high estrogen output from large unovulated follicles speeds up the rate of transport, culminating in low rates of embryo recovery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On Day 6 one expects to find early, late and expanded blastocysts, and this was the situation here. It has been suggested that somatic cells facilitate growth of embryos by reducing O2 tension and/or increasing concentrations of CO2 in the vicinity of embryos
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Based on the reports from research with several other species including rat, rabbit and monkey
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the intra-uterine O2 concentration appears to be in the range of 1.5 to 7%.</p><sec><title>Flushing of uterine horns and oviducts</title><p>Flushing the uterine horns and oviducts on Day 4 post mating during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons yielded embryos with developmental stages varying between 8-cells to morula, with, two embryos classified as degenerated, but the remaining embryos had normal morphology and were considered as transferable to a recipient ewe.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], washed individually four times in fresh flushing medium and then placed in holding medium (Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline containing 0.4% w/v bovine serum albumin).

The pattern of oxidation was similar between the two types of embryos, but oxidation and CO2 production and lactate production was greater for <italic>in vitro</italic> as compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> derived 8-cell stage embryos (c versus d&#x02009;=&#x02009;(p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In general the two concentrations of glucose did not differ in their metabolic fate, although the rate of glucose incorporation tended to be higher in the presence of 0.56 mmol/L glucose. However, production of lactate and uptake of glucose carbon were higher in the presence of 0.56 mmol/L glucose. No lactate production was detected apart from the higher oxidation of lactate by the <italic>in vivo</italic> derived embryos of both stages (Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> collected morulae and early blastocysts produced lower rates of CO2 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) than their counterparts derived <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, the mid-stage blastocysts cultured for 24 h produced more CO2 as compared to values for freshly collected and cultured mid-stage blastocysts. In general, lactate production by the freshly obtained embryos was about one half that for <italic>in vitro</italic> derived embryos. However, long pre-exposure to culture conditions narrowed the differences between the two sources at the hatched blastocyst stage (72 h of IVC) and were not significant. Incorporation of glucose carbon was independent of the source of embryos, but there was a tendency for a lower uptake by IVM/IVF embryos from mid stage to hatched blastocyst stages (Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The concentration of glucose (0.28 mmol/L) used in the bulk of the present experiments to study embryo metabolism is close to that observed in bovine oviductal fluid
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, the concentration of lactate (2&#x02013;5 mmol/L) seems to be in the physiological range based on reported values for sheep and rabbit oviductal fluid

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The results of the initial experiments for determining the rate of metabolism of glucose up to late preimplantation stages is similar to that reported for sheep embryos
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The first marked increase in the metabolism of glucose by bovine embryos occurs between the 8 to 16-cell stage and oxidation of glucose does not differ between 8- and 12-cell stage embryos
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A higher rate of total glucose metabolism was detected for compacted morulae, but there was no significant increase in the oxidation of glucose after the morula stage, although the number of cells almost doubled between the morula and early blastocyst stages
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The formation of tight junctions at the morula stage may require more energy and other substances derived from glucose. In general, the first significant increase in the metabolism of glucose occurred after activation of the embryonic genome and the second rise is associated with the formation of the blastocoelic activity, probably to meet energy demands of the ion pump involved in the fluid accumulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The expanding blastocysts obtained after 24 h culture of fresh early-stage blastocysts recovered from the uterus had higher rates of O2 oxidation as reported previously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The most surprising feature of glucose metabolism by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> derived embryos was the lack of detectable lactate production until the 12- cell stage. When lactate was detected its production increased continuously through the blastocyst stage. <italic>In vivo</italic> derived embryos produced one-half the quantity of lactate as <italic>in vitro</italic> derived embryos. Lactate production by embryos recovered by flushing the oviduct and uterus was also about one-half that for <italic>in vitro</italic> derived embryos. However, this difference decreased as time in culture increased.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Season and time of onset of estrus did not affect the ultimate number of transferable embryos in ewes. However, results of this study indicate: that ewes exhibit a lower ovulatory response compared with results reported for crossbred ewes in; a previous study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the presence of exogenous hCG, endogenous LH was apparently sufficient to cause ovulation but it was not determined if similar rates of ovulation would have been obtained if hCG was not administered. Metabolism studies of radiolabeled pyruvate and lactate indicated that pyruvate was the preferred substrate up to the 12 cell-stage and its oxidation increased at during compaction and blastulation of morulae. Therefore, results of the present study suggest that a low pyruvate to lactate ratio should be beneficial during culture of ovine embryos from the 12-cell stage to the hatched blastocyst stage in chemically defined media. One of the explanations for high lactate production could be a stress response to a suboptimal culture environment. The culture environment that provided optimum development was due to variability in the pH and oxygen tension, which in this experiment could not be maintained constantly throughout the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr Ahmad Azizimoghadam declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contribution</title><p>Dr AA carried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
