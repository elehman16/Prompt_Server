After thorough PubMed and Medline search we found only one prospective randomized study (Abdelrahman <italic>et al</italic>.) that compared open varicocelectomy with loupe assisted varicocelectomy. Therefore, we have planned a prospective randomized study to compare the efficacy and complication rate of open subinguinal varicocelectomy (OSV) and loupe assisted subinguinal varicocelectomy (LASV) using seminal and hormonal parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized study was conducted in VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi. The study period was between June 2010 and June 2012. The study protocol and procedures were approved by the hospital ethical committee and written informed consent was taken from the participants. All patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (between 15 and 45 years of age with Grade 2 and Grade 3 varicocele) were included in the study. The study included both infertile men and those with symptoms. Patients with epididymo-orchitis, UTI, testicular tumor, retroperitoneal tumor, RCC, previous varicocele surgery were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups Group A (OSV) and Group B (subinguinal loupe assisted varicocelectomy - LASV) using computer generated randomized table.</p><p>Initial evaluation included a detailed clinical history, blood and urine investigations including complete hemogram, liver function test, kidney function test, urine routine microscopy, urine culture sensitivity. Doppler ultrasonography (USG) was used to confirm physical findings and to determine testicular volume (testicular volume = 0.7 &#x000d7; length &#x000d7; breadth &#x000d7; depth). Semen analysis was performed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Serum follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were estimated in all patients by enzyme immunoassay.</p><p>Patients in Group A underwent OSV and those in Group B underwent LASV (&#x000d7;2.5) by same surgeon under spinal anesthesia. Post-operatively patients were followed at 1 week and 3 months. At 1 week wound was examined and sutures were removed. At 3 months, semen analysis, hormonal analysis and color Doppler USG were done. The objective of the current study was to compare the two groups in terms of efficacy (seminal and hormonal parameters, failure rates) and complication rate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17(IBM SPSS Statistics 17.0.3; IBM SPSS, 2009) Students <italic>t</italic>-test was applied for continuous variables and Chi-square test was applied for categorical variables. All <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered to be significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 89 patients between 15 and 45 years of age with Grade 2 and Grade 3 varicocele reported to our hospital between June 2010 and June 2012. Out of which, 20 patients were excluded as they failed to satisfy the eligibility criteria. A total of 69 patients were included in the study and were randomized into two groups using computer generated randomization table: 34 patients in Group A (OSV) and 35 patients in Group B (LASV). Nine patients (4 from OSV group and 5 from LASV group) were lost to follow-up.

Cayan <italic>et al</italic>. prospectively reviewed the long-term results of varicocele repair and compared the complication rates of varicocelectomy techniques according to optical magnification and found that the recurrence rates were 0% in cases managed by microsurgical varicocelectomy, 2.9% in those where loupe magnification was used and 8.8% in those where no magnification was used.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Microsurgical inguinal varicocelectomy is considered as the treatment of choice by many, it is associated with a lower recurrence rate and fewer complications, compared with laparoscopic varicocelectomy or retroperitoneal high-open ligation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, operating microscope is not readily available in all parts of the world particularly developing countries and most surgeons are not familiar with the use of the operating microscope.</p><p>Keeping the above literature and facts in mind, we compared OSV and loupe subinguinal varicocelectomy procedures as we were familiar with the use of loupe due to its use in other reconstructive procedures such as hypospadias, epispadias repair.</p><p>Hsiao <italic>et al</italic>. retrospectively reviewed the records of 272 men who underwent microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy and found that it resulted in significant increases in sperm concentration, total sperm count and testosterone in all age groups.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Aggarwal and Thomas in a meta-analysis reported that the sperm concentration, motility increased after both microsurgery and high ligation varicocelectomy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Abdel-Maguid and Othman in a prospective randomized study including 162 patients compared microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy with non-magnified subinguinal varicocelectomy and concluded that sperm count and motility improved significantly in both groups and results were better in the microsurgical group. We found that varicocelectomy (both open subinguinal and loupe subinguinal) was associated with significant improvement in sperm concentration, motility and morphology which is consistent with results of the above mentioned studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Zohdy <italic>et al</italic>. performed microsurgical varicocelectomy in 141 men with clinical varicocele and found that varicocelectomy significantly improves serum testosterone in infertile men, especially those with hypogonadism.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Tanrikut <italic>et al</italic>. found that men with varicoceles had significantly lower testosterone levels and microsurgical varicocele ligation resulted in a significant increase in serum testosterone levels.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study varicocelectomy was associated with significant improvement in hormonal parameters, the rise in testosterone, fall in FSH, LH was significant following surgery which is in concordance with several studies.</p><p>Although both open subinguinal and subinguinal loupe varicocelectomy were associated with improvement in seminal and hormonal parameters the improvement in patients who underwent subinguinal loupe varicocelectomy was more and there was a statistically significant difference between the two procedures.</p><p>The most common complications of varicocelectomy are hydrocele formation, recurrence and testicular artery injury.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] We found markedly low complication rate associated with subinguinal loupe varicocelectomy as compared to open sub inguinal varicocelectomy; however the former required longer operating time although not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].
