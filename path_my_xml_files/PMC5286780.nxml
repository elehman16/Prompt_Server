The endotracheal tube works as a conductor of the microorganisms of the oropharynx to the lower respiratory tract, and these are frequently identified as etiological agents of the nosocomial pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The interruption of this process, by preventing colonization of pathogenic bacteria, represents a potential procedure for the prevention of VAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Considering that the microbiota of the oral cavity plays an important role in the development process of VAP, some studies have indicated that the topical application of chlorhexidine, initiated before intubation, reduces nosocomial infections in patients submitted to elective cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, although the pharmacological control of bacterial plaque, through the use of chlorhexidine is practical and widely accepted among health professionals, the chemical approach against accumulated plaque is marginal, since the plaque acts as a biofilm in which the bacteria is considerably less sensitive to antimicrobial therapy &#x02013; when compared to the free-moving planktonic form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, mechanical cleansing, through toothbrushing may be the most effective method of removing all pathogens from the plaque, including anaerobes and multiresistant bacteria such as methicilline-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, (MRSA) or <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The mechanical removal of microorganisms can increase the efficacy of the effects of chlorhexidine in the remaining bacteria or in bacterial regrowth, according to Kishimoto and Urade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies suggest a potential relation between deficient oral care and increased incidence of VAP, the available evidence is still limited. This study was designed to verify if oral hygiene through toothbrushing with chlorhexidine in gel at 0.12% reduces the incidence of ventilatior-associated pneumonia, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of hospital stay and the mortality rate in ICU, when compared to oral hygiene only with chlorhexidine, solution of 0.12%, without toothbrushing, in adult individuals under mechanical ventilation, hospitalized in Clinical/Surgical and Cardiology Intensive Care Units. The toothbrushing is the basis for the removal of dental plaque and consequently reduction of oral bacterial load, reducing the risk for VAP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized study of oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution every 12&#x000a0;h (control group) <italic>versus</italic> toothbrushing plus 0.12% chlorhexidine gel every 12&#x000a0;h (intervention group) in three ICU of public hospitals and one ICU of a philanthropic hospital in Recife, Brazil, from July 2013 to January 2014.

Despite this, there was a significant reduction in the mean time of mechanical ventilation in the group of patients who were submitted to toothbrushing (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018). This study identified a tendency for shorter length of ICU stay and reducing mortality for the toothbrushing group, although without statistical significance. However, there was an increase of 41% in the relative risk of death for the control group, which reinforces the trend toward better clinical outcome for the intervention group.</p><p>There are many studies designed to prove the role of mechanical cleansing of dental plaque and its association with the reduction of VAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but the results are limited.</p><p>Systematic revision and meta-analysis, including four studies with a total of 828 patients submitted to oral hygiene with and without toothbrushing, did not demonstrate benefits regarding reduction of VAP, duration of MV or length stay in ICU, for the toothbrushing group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Alhazzani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] recently published a systemic revision and meta-analysis, to formulate a critical analysis of the impact of using toothbrushing as part of oral hygiene for individuals under intensive care and mechanical ventilation &#x02013; analyzing studies published between 1980 and March of 2012. Six randomized studies, involving 1,408 patients &#x02013; from which five compared toothbrushing with standard oral hygiene, and the sixth compared manual toothbrushing <italic>versus</italic> electric toothbrushing &#x02013; fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four studies demonstrated a tendency to lower rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia, although without statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26). One only study, which presented low bias risk estimated by the Cochrane method, suggested that toothbrushing significantly reduced VAP occurrence (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006). No difference was observed between manual or electric toothbrushing. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences regarding length of ICU stay or hospital mortality.</p><p>Although our study has demonstrated significant reduction in meantime mechanical ventilation, one limitation was the small sample size through interruption of the study.</p><p>The study discontinuation, due to lack of inputs for oral hygiene according to the study protocol, contributed to the failure to achieve the number of patients needed to more appropriate analysis of any difference between the groups. In fact, the sample calculation considered an VAP incidence in our region; however, financial resources ended, hospitals could not comply with the acquisition of materials needed to continue the search, and the data were analyzed with discontinuation of the study, what is meant a limitation of the research. Despite of this, like the studies above cited, tendency for lower incidence of VAP for the intervention group was found in our study.</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not work with the ideal number of participants, but even with these difficulties, the results showed trend to better outcomes with the intervention, and significant difference in mean time mechanical ventilation. Thus, operational difficulties relating to financial resources, considering the study in a country with few resources, developing country, and three public hospitals among 04 hospitals, which also involves little financial resources, defined the completion of research ahead of schedule time.</p><p>In spite of this, we consider relevant findings, which indicate a significant difference in mean time mechanical ventilation, and show a tendency to lower risk of death and lower absolute number of VAP in the population under the intervention.</p><p>Also it chose to work with only to study groups and use of chlorhexidine 0.12%, approved and widely used in various studies, which would allow comparison of the control group with the intervention group, to which the only difference is the use of brushing, since also in this group was the dental gel with 0.12% chlorhexidine. Thus, avoiding bias in relation to different concentrations of chlorhexidine and proceeds with the analysis of the differential component that has been the target of research, the role of brushing. The restriction on the number of treatment arms was importante, since the power would not have been suficiente.</p><p>In addition, the high VAP incidence (14.1/1,000 MV-day) pointed out in this study, when compared with data from the National Healthcare Safety Network (2.1 to 10.7 per 1,000 MV-day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], denotes the necessity to adopt more effective proven measures to reduce pneumonia in patients who are undergoing mechanical ventilation in our Intensive Care Units.</p><p>Although the four participating institutions of the study introduced the &#x0201c;bundle&#x0201d; for VAP prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the fifth component of the package of measures &#x02013; oral hygiene &#x02013; was not contemplated in the units before this study, and the justifications found for this gap point to technical difficulties, lack of knowledge about the importance of the measure by the professional team at the ICU, and lack of a standard protocol and adequate material resources. This gave rise to efforts, by the multiprofessional health team &#x02013; made up of nurses, physicians, hospital infection control service professionals, physiotherapists and surgeon-dentist &#x02013; in order to address the technical and material deficiencies, and effective application of a standard protocol for oral hygiene, including toothbrushing, for planning this randomized study.</p><p>In the last two decades, numerous published data has shown that inadequate oral hygiene increases the incidence of pneumonia both in the community and in hospitalized individuals undergoing intensive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dental plaque serves as a reservoir for microorganisms associated to pulmonary infections, and these respiratory pathogens quickly colonize the plaque of patients hospitalized in ICU undergoing mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, care protocols represent an essential component for the reduction of VAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In order to control vies information in our study, a team of dentists performed the dental evaluation in all patients in the study, and have trained all nursing professionals to oral hygiene with toothbrushing with chlorhexidine 0.12%, through a standard protocol for oral care.</p><p>From that oral assessment, another finding was the high DMF index described in this study, despite the limitations of the indicator itself &#x02013; obtained from the clinical examination restricted to the crown of the tooth and not showing secondary tooth losses to periodontal disease or orthodontic reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] &#x02013; denotes the level of oral health impairment for this population group. Measures are necessary to better promote oral health, since these critical patients who undergoing to mechanical ventilation present high risk of infection, especially of the inferior respiratory tract.</p><p>The following question remains: Why measure as effective for plaque rupture fails to demonstrate proven benefit in this patient population? The results of the different studies must be analyzed cautiously. First, establishing the VAP diagnosis for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation is much more complex when compared with community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, opinions among physicians about the diagnostic criteria also differ. Thus, the few studies included in the meta-analysis of Gu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], who used the VAP as the main outcome, could present disappointing results in relation to evidence about the expected superiority of toothbrushing as method of pneumonia prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our study, clinical/radiological criteria were used for the diagnosis of VAP, which could result in misdiagnosis, once the gold standard is represented by microbiological diagnosis. To minimize this possible bias in classification, standardization of clinical criteria, training of physicians responsible for diagnosing and <italic>Kappa</italic> test were used, which enabled the standardization of concepts and validate the diagnosis of VAP in this study. With the objective of minimizing possible bias of information and/or classification, different teams of professionals were defined to apply the oral hygiene protocol (nursing) and definition of VAP diagnosis (medical).</p><p>Another important point is that more precise criteria for investigation of the role of dental plaque rupture should be used when the design of studies which seeking to validate the role of toothbrushing as a primary measure for VAP prevention. The use of scores to evaluate dental plaque, suggested by Wise and Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], helps to prove the efficacy of toothbrushing and makes possible the analysis of its influence in VAP incidence. Observational study demonstrated an increase in the occurrence of dental bacterial plaque along the length of intubation using dental plaque scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is difficult to interpret the studies that do not show a reduction in VAP occurrence. The results of these studies could reflect mistakes during the toothbrushing procedure, that is, no reduction in the plaque score or removal of dental plaque by itself would not affect the incidence of VAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the use of chlorhexidine appears to attenuate the effects of toothbrushing on VAP (<italic>p</italic> for interaction&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. According to Labeau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the well-conducted meta-analysis by Alhazzani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] supports toothbrushing as a potential strategy for reducing VAP and oral care without the application of this method should be considered, at least, an improper practice.</p><p>Improving mouth hygiene represents one of innumerous interventions that can affect VAP occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The ideal would be to design more studies to define the adequate method for oral hygiene in this population of patients, using more precise measurements to validate the removal of dental plaque (plaque score) by toothbrushing, having as the main outcome the mortality rate. This would implicate a great number of recruits before the planning of studies evaluating VAP incidence, with greater probability of bias because of the diagnostic complexity, which is something that would complicate the interpretation of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results obtained showed that, among patients undergoing toothbrushing there was a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation, and a tendency to reduce the incidence of VAP and length of ICU stay, although this last results without statistical significance. Therefore, about the risk of VAP risk and death, the sample no appears to have been large enough to detect differences in this magnitude. More studies are needed in order to define optimal oral hygiene, use of dental plaque score, and observation of the impact of oral hygiene measures, mainly on hospital and ICU mortality rates.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CAAE</term><def><p>Certificate of ethical committee approval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMF</term><def><p>Decayed, missing and filled teeth index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRSA</term><def><p>Methiciline-resistant <italic>staphylococcus aureus</italic>
