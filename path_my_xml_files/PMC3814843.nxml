In contrast with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria, <italic>P. vivax</italic> can cause relapse infections emerging from dormant hypnozoite forms in the liver. Strains in tropical regions such as Sumatera are characterized by frequent (&#x0003e;30%) and early (around 1 month) relapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C2">2</xref>]. Radical cure can only be achieved by adding a hypnozoitocidal drug, and the 8-aminoquinolone primaquine (PQ) is the only widely available drug for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C3">3</xref>]. However, the drug is used infrequently because of concerns about its oxidative side effects causing intravascular hemolysis and methemoglobinemia in populations in whom glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common and facilities for assessing G6PD status are not readily available (ie, most malaria-endemic areas). The G6PD gene is located on the X chromosome and there are &#x0003e;180 genetic polymorphisms, most of which confer reductions in G6PD-enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C4">4</xref>]. The common variants differ importantly in their effect on enzyme activity; hence, the associated risk of hemolysis after PQ treatment varies enormously. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency is approximately 5% in North Sumatra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C5">5</xref>], but which variants are prevalent and the risks vs benefits of deploying PQ are not known.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> resistance to chloroquine is prominent in many parts of Indonesia, ranging from 43% in Sumatera island to &#x0003e;80% in Papua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C8">8</xref>], In 2008, artesunate-amodiaquine (AAQ) and, more recently, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) have replaced chloroquine as first-line treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C10">10</xref>]. However, it has not been established which of these artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) is most effective in Sumatera. We compared the efficacy and safety of AAQ + PQ and DHP + PQ for the treatment of uncomplicated vivax malaria in the operationally realistic context without prior testing for G6PD deficiency to identify the optimal treatment of vivax malaria.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We performed a prospective, open-label, randomized study comparing AAQ + PQ and DHP + PQ for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic <italic>P. vivax</italic> monoinfection in nonpregnant adults and children aged &#x0003e;1 year presenting at a rural clinic in Tanjung Leidong village, Labuhan Batu, North Sumatera, Indonesia. Routine G6PD testing is not available here. Clinical malaria incidence is 400&#x02013;500 per year among a population of 32 837 (in 2010), equally divided between <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections (written communication, July 2011, from Ministry of Health, Indonesia).</p><p>Patients with fever (or recent fever &#x0003c;48 hours) and microscopically confirmed <italic>P. vivax</italic> monoinfection (&#x02265;250/&#x000b5;L) were eligible. Exclusion criteria included any feature of severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C3">3</xref>], severe malnutrition, recurrent vomiting, concomitant infections, pregnancy or lactation, known allergies to the study medication, and inability to follow up. Written informed consent was obtained from patients or their attending relatives before enrollment.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Health Research and Development, Indonesian Ministry of Health, Jakarta, Indonesia; Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand; and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, Oxford University, United Kingdom.</p><p>Parasite density was assessed per 200 white blood cells on a Giemsa-stained thick film, and assumed to be absent if not detected in 200 high-power fields. Gametocytes were counted per 1000 white blood cells. Parasite species was confirmed in thin smear, and 10% of slides were cross-checked at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. Other investigations included hemoglobin measurement (Hemocue201+), hemoglobin-methemoglobinemia by pulse oximetry (Masimo-Set, Masimo), and G6PD genotyping from a filter paper blood spot (Whatman 3M). Genotyping by polymerase chain reaction&#x02013;restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) enabled identification of 3 common mutations (Mediterranean, Mahidol, and Viangchan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C11">11</xref>]. In patients developing hemolysis or methemoglobinemia with no mutation by PCR-RFLP, and in patients identified as G6PD deficient by a fluorescent spot test at the end of the study (see below), sequencing of the whole G6PD gene was performed (Macrogen).</p><p>Patients were not screened for G6PD status before the start of therapy and were managed as outpatients, both current practice in Sumatera. All patients were followed daily for 14 days and then weekly until 42 days, followed by monthly visits up to a year, or in between in case of symptoms. Hemoglobin levels were assessed on days 0, 2, and 7, and then weekly. During PQ therapy, methemoglobinemia was monitored daily. PQ therapy was discontinued in case of macroscopic hemoglobinuria, a drop in hemoglobin &#x0003e;2 g/dL, or when methemoglobin increased to &#x0003e;20% of total hemoglobin. At the end of the study, all patients were invited to test for G6PD status using a NADPH qualitative spot test (SQMMR720 kit, R&#x00026;D Diagnostics).</p><p>Patients randomized to AAQ (Arsuamoon, Guilin Pharmaceuticals) received artesunate 12 mg/kg and amodiaquine 30 mg/kg divided over 3 days. Patients randomized to DHP (Arterakine, Pharbaco Central Pharmaceuticals), received dihydroartemisinin 6.75 mg/kg and piperaquine 54 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days. All patients also received PQ (Phapros Inc) in a dose of 0.25 mg base/kg (or 15 mg for &#x0003e;40 kg) for 14 days started on the first day. All treatment doses were given directly observed and together with some biscuits (ie, cookies). If the patient vomited within 30 minutes, the dose was repeated. Recurrent vivax malaria infections occurring in the first 42 days of follow-up were treated with quinine/doxycycline following Indonesian guidelines; episodes occurring after this point were treated with the same regimen as the initial treatment.

After 1 year, the mean day of recurrence was day 165 (SD, 70) for patients treated with AAQ + PQ and day 203 (SD, 91) for those treated with DHP + PQ (<italic>P</italic> = .23). Among 28 patients with recurrent infections, 24 had monoinfection with <italic>P. vivax</italic>, 2 had monoinfection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and 2 had mixed infection (<italic>P. falciparum/P. vivax</italic>). Cumulative risk of recurrence for the total group during the 1-year follow-up period was 17.5 per 100 person-years.

We compared the efficacy and safety of these combinations in radical treatment regimens with PQ in the normal context of use (ie, without G6PD testing). In the setting of North Sumatera, both treatment regimens were safe and efficacious for cure of the blood-stage infection. Hemolysis after treatment with PQ (0.25 mg/kg for 14 days), not requiring transfusion, was a rare event. This was because the prevalence of G6PD deficiency was relatively low (&#x0003c;5%) by comparison with other areas of the tropics, and the prevalent genotypes were not associated with severe deficiency.</p><p>A study from Thailand found a similar low risk for hemolysis after treatment with PQ in the same dosing scheme, without prior G6PD testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C13">13</xref>]. The Mahidol variant (487G&#x02192;A) is also the most common G6PD variant in the western part of Thailand.</p><p>We screened patients for G6PD deficiency at the end of follow-up with a fluorescent spot test. This identified another 7 patients who were G6PD deficient according to this test, of whom 1 male was hemizygous for the Mahidol variant and another male showed the relatively common 1311C&#x02192;T intron 11 nt93T&#x02192;C mutation, both associated with mild G6PD deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C15">15</xref>]. In total, 3.3% of patients had a variant G6PD genotype, which compares to an earlier study in North Sumatera showing a 5% prevalence of G6PD deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C5">5</xref>]; the slightly lower prevalence in vivax patients in the current study might relate to the protective effect of G6PD deficiency against malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C18">18</xref>]. A total of 4 of 9 (44%) patients with a positive fluorescent screening test denoting G6PD deficiency had a normal G6PD genotype, indicating suboptimal specificity of the test, which could be related to the presence of additional sources of oxidative stress (eg, deriving from food or drugs) not accounted for in the test. Only 5 of 331 (1.5%) patients developed significant intravascular hemolysis (&#x0003e;2 g/dL hemoglobin drop), none of whom required a blood transfusion. Another 3 of 331 (0.9%) had methemoglobin levels &#x0003e;20% related to PQ treatment, without any other clinical signs. Most (7 of 8 [87.5%]) adverse events occurred within the first 7 days of treatment and all quickly resolved. Our findings suggest that both regimens including low-dose PQ can be deployed safely in this setting of low prevalence and &#x0201c;mild-type&#x0201d; G6PD deficiency, provided that the risks are acknowledged and that adequate follow-up can be assured. It should be noted that PQ is contraindicated during pregnancy. Implementation of G6PD testing should be a priority in <italic>P. vivax</italic> endemic settings, but where this is currently not feasible, a suggested follow-up scheme is a daily visit during the first 7 days of treatment with hematocrit or hemoglobin levels measured at diagnosis and 3 and 7 days after start of treatment. If hemoglobinuria occurs, then PQ should be stopped. Simple color cards to aid detection of hemoglobinuria may be useful.</p><p>Both treatments resulted in a rapid clinical and parasitological cure, fast gametocyte clearance, and good therapeutic efficacy at 42 days. Only 1 patient treated with DHP + PQ had early treatment failure. In vivax malaria, genotyping cannot distinguish between relapse and reinfection, as more than half of the relapse infections in endemic areas are caused by reactivation of liver schizonts with a different genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C19">19</xref>]. Because the natural history of relapse infections in North Sumatera is not known and this study did not include a control arm without PQ administration, we cannot assess with certainty the efficacy of this low-dose PQ regimen for preventing relapse infection. In our study, 28 of 289 (9.7%) patients had recurrent infections after 1 year of follow-up. In comparison, in patients returning from highly endemic Papua Indonesia to nonendemic Java, relapse rates were comparable, with 2 of 36 (6%) relapses after treatment with DHP + PQ combined with a higher dose (30 mg) of PQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C20">20</xref>]. However, hypnozoite sensitivity may vary geographically. In our study, the ratio between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections was 6.5:1 during screening and 2:1 during follow-up, suggesting that a proportion of the late recurrent infections were relapse infections. Efficacy trials of ACT regimens with and without PQ are now being planned and implemented throughout Asia to assess the dose-dependent relapse-preventing efficacy of PQ in the treatment of vivax malaria.</p><p>Both relapse and recurrent infections are suppressed by the posttreatment prophylactic effect of the long half-life partner drug in the ACT used for treatment. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite of amodiaquine, desethylamodiaquine, is approximately 21 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C21">21</xref>], compared to 28&#x02013;35 days for piperaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C22">22</xref>]. In our study the earliest recurrence with AAQ + PQ was indeed earlier (at 54 days) than with DHP + PQ (at 83 days), but with longer follow-up this advantage disappeared. After 1 year, the time to recurrent infection was no longer statistically different between treatment groups.</p><p>Both regimens used in this study were well tolerated, although DHP + PQ was associated with significantly fewer (mild) adverse events than AAQ + PQ, as has also been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT407C24">24</xref>]. In addition to its longer posttreatment prophylactic effect, this makes DHP + PQ an attractive alternative to AAQ + PQ for the treatment of uncomplicated vivax malaria, and could be a further step to harmonization of the treatment of falciparum and vivax malaria in Indonesia.</p><p>This study has several limitations: 12% of patients were lost for follow-up at day 42, related to poor accessibility of some areas in rural northern Sumatera, and 22% were not tested for G6PD status at the end of the study, so our prevalence estimate may be imprecise. Patients with hemolysis were not formally assessed for changes in renal function, but no patient reported anuria or developed symptoms of renal failure during follow-up.</p><p>The number of G6PD-deficient patients in the current study was low, and because enzyme activity can vary considerably even within specific genotypes, assessment of the hemolysis risk after low-dose PQ within specific genotypes requires larger studies. Further prevalence studies on the genetic variants of G6PD and their corresponding phenotypes in various parts of Indonesia will be required to generalize our current findings to other parts of Indonesia.</p><p>In conclusion, radical treatment with AAQ or DHP, both combined with low-dose PQ (0.25 mg/kg for 14 days), without prior testing for G6PD deficiency proved a safe and efficacious treatment for uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> in North Sumatera. DHP + PQ was better tolerated and had a longer posttherapeutic prophylactic effect.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Acknowledgments.</italic></bold>&#x02003;We thank all our staff members in the field, and the patients and their family members who participated in this study.</p><p><bold><italic>Financial support.</italic></bold>&#x02003;This work was supported by <funding-source>University of Sumatera Utara, the Indonesian Ministry of Health, and the Directorate General of Higher Education.
