Empathic competencies are important for creating interpersonal relationships with other people and developing adequate social behaviour. The lack of these social components also leads to isolation and exclusion in healthy populations. However, few studies have investigated how to improve these social skills. In a recent study, Kidd and Castano (2013) found that reading literary fiction increases mentalizing ability and may change how people think about other people&#x02019;s emotions and mental states. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of reading literary fiction, compared to nonfiction and science fiction, on empathic abilities. Compared to previous studies, we used a larger variety of empathy measures and utilized a pre and post-test design. In all, 214 healthy participants were randomly assigned to read a book representative of one of three literary genres (literary fiction, nonfiction, science fiction). Participants were assessed before and after the reading phase using mentalizing and emotional sharing tests, according to Zaki and Ochsner&#x02019; s (2012) model. Comparisons of sociodemographic, mentalizing, and emotional sharing variables across conditions were conducted using ANOVA. Our results showed that after the reading phase, the literary fiction group showed improvement in mentalizing abilities, but there was no discernible effect on emotional sharing abilities. Our study showed that the reading processes can promote mentalizing abilities. These results may set important goals for future low-cost rehabilitation protocols for several disorders in which the mentalizing deficit is considered central to the disease, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Empathy is the capacity to share the physiological and emotional states of other people [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Empathy has been recently described as including two dimensions: mentalizing and emotional sharing [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mentalizing is the ability to understand what others are thinking or feeling, while the emotional sharing dimension includes the capacity to emotionally resonate with other people&#x02019;s feelings [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Empathy is a necessary capacity to guide interpersonal relationships and it enables us to interact successfully in social groups [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, people with this competence is more able to adapt and it prevents them from suffering, isolation, loneliness and exclusion. For this reason, it is important to design an intervention aimed at improving empathic ability in healthy populations.</p><p>Recent studies [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have pointed towards reading literary texts as a means of enhancing empathic abilities. The abilities to read, understand and enjoy stories imply both cognitive (e.g., attention and memory) and affective processes (e.g., emotion and empathy) [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Kumschick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that reading and discussing children&#x02019;s books with emotional content increases children&#x02019;s emotional competences. Their findings underscore the role that reading can play in supporting children&#x02019;s development of emotional and social skills [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, reading fiction also seems to improve mentalizing among adults[<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Kidd and Castano [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that reading literary fiction leads to better performance on assessments of mentalizing compared to reading nonfiction, popular fiction, or nothing at all. Their study [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] consisted of five experiments in which the authors evaluated the effects of reading literary fiction compared to reading nonfiction (Experiment 1) and popular fiction (Experiments 2&#x02013;5) on mentalizing skills using three different measuresThis study [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that only reading literary fiction affected mentalizing. Recently, a study has extended Kidd and Castano&#x02019; s results [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The authors [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] evaluated the effects of reading on both social and non-social cognition. In this study [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the participants read two literary short stories and two nonfiction articles: one of the texts used in each condition was taken directly from Kidd and Castano&#x02019; s materials [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the authors [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used only two tests: the <italic>Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task</italic> as a mentalizing measure [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the <italic>Intuitive Physics Test</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as a non-social measure. This study revealed the specificity of the effect to social cognition, and it controlled for pre-reading mentalizing performance. However, the existing studies remain limited by a restricted number of measures of mentalizing and empathy.</p><p>The present research builds on these prior studies by including a more comprehensive battery of mentalizing and empathy tests (all those available in Italy and already used in studies of healthy and clinical Italian populations) during the pre and post reading phases. The pre reading phase offers guarantees with regard to the equivalence of the three groups of participants prior to the manipulation, it is nonetheless useful to further demonstrate that the three groups do not differ a-priori on important measures of empathy. To avoid a learning effect between the pre- and post- measures, we used different empathic measures in the two phases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160254.t001">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, regarding mentalizing, we used measures that evaluated three aspects of this competence: cognitive empathy, perspective taking and mind-reading according to Zaki and Ochsner&#x02019; s model [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regarding emotional sharing components, we assessed: affective empathy, shared self-other representations, and emotional contagion. Given the complexity of empathic abilities, a more extensive, multi-faceted investigation of how they are affected by reading fiction is important. In particular, a more nuanced understanding of the effects of reading is necessary to inform potential rehabilitation treatments for disorders in which a deficit of empathy is central, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0160254.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160254.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Pre and post reading phases measures.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0160254.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0160254.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><italic>Mentalizing</italic></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><italic>Emotional Sharing</italic></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>PRE-READING</italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>POST-READING</italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>PRE-READING</italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>POST-READING</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cognitive Sub-scale (BES)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cognitive Empathy (MET)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affective Sub-scale</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Explicit Emotional Empathy (MET)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fantasy items (IRI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Emotion Attribution Task</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Personal Distress items (IRI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Implicit Emotional Empathy (MET)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perspective Taking items (IRI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cognitive Empathy (EQ)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Empathic Concern items (IRI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Emotional Empathy (EQ)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attribution of intention task</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Social Skills (EQ)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eyes Task</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Faces test</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Advanced Theory of Mind</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">First and second order false belief test</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p><italic>Legend</italic>: BES = Basic Empathy Scale; MET = Multifaceted Empathy Test; IRI = Interpersonal Reactivity Index; EQ = Empathy Quotient</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the present study, we focused on three comparisons: (1) literary fiction versus nonfiction; (2) literary fiction versus science fiction; and (3) nonfiction versus science fiction. The literary fiction versus nonfiction condition was used for two reasons.</p><p>This condition is only briefly reported in Kidd and Castano&#x02019; s study [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and perhaps nonfiction books (at least those that we have selected for our study) could have an effect on the emotional sharing component because we have chosen the nonfiction books that narrate true stories of illness, death or pain. It is also important to underline that there are also nonfiction books such as essays about dinosaurs or geology in which may to lack a social focus.</p><p>The comparison between literary fiction and science fiction was performed because even if both are fiction, these two genres may require different types of imagination and creativity. Indeed, most science fiction books narrate stories based on abstract topics such as space, time, the destiny of man, our place in the universe etc. On the other hand, in literary fiction, the readers can probably imagine the feelings and thoughts of characters, but the context and characters are inspired by real situations. For this reason, we think that is easier for readers of literary fiction identify oneself with the characters of the story, because, literary fiction is more realistic compared to science fiction. In addition, while in most literary fiction the emotional experiences of realistic characters and the relationship between the people are in the foreground compared to events narrate, science fiction may instead focus attention on differences between the real world and the imaginary world and we believe that the emotional aspects of the characters of the science fiction books are in the background compared to the plot of the story. Therefore, reading literary fiction would most likely lead readers to focus on the understanding of the mental and emotional states of the characters. Finally, we compared literary nonfiction with science fiction because these are completely opposite genres. The former narrates true stories, while the latter is based on fantasy and may involve different cognitive mechanisms. Compared to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we added the science fiction condition in order to use a category of fiction which is unrealistic and the scenes are often foreign to one's own experiences. Hence the reader is forced to imagine them. Literary fiction and nonfiction may both require more emotional engagement compared to science fiction books. Moreover, we hypothesize that this lack of emotional engagement in science fiction books could make them more suitable to potential treatments involving individuals with autism [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subject selection and data collection</title><p>The study was carried out using 214 participants (undergraduate students attending the Master Degree course in Psychology at the University of L&#x02019;Aquila). The participants were randomly assigned to read one of six short books (two literary fiction, two nonfiction and two science fiction; see below for details) with pre-and post-reading phase assessments. The University of L&#x02019;Aquila independently conducted the randomisation procedures. A random-number table was used to generate lots that were drawn in sealed envelopes, each assigning the respective participants to the literary fiction, nonfiction or science fiction groups. The random assignment ensures that there are not systematic differences between the groups on a specific measure, which makes it more likely that the groups will be equivalent prior to some manipulation. The students were asked to participate in the intervention as part of their course programme requirements for psychometrics, and participation in this experiment allowed them to obtain an academic credit. In the pre- and post-reading phases, the participants underwent an empathic abilities assessment through a collective administration of tests. The collective administration was characterised by minimising interactions between the examiner and the subject, as well as the need to plan the sequence in which the tests were to be administered simultaneously.</p><p>All empathy measures were implemented using the Powerpoint programme, and for each test a psychologist (the first author of this paper) and the professor of the psychometrics course (the second author) gave the instructions.</p><p>As part of the response protocol, the participants had to provide sociodemographic characteristics (age and gender) and a pseudonym (e.g., a cartoon name) to ensure anonymity. We checked that the participants had not already read the book assigned. In addition, we selected books of the same reading level, difficulty and length. The language of all the books was Italian, and all the participants were native Italian speakers. The participants read the book in their own home over the course of a week.</p><p>After the reading phase, each participant completed a questionnaire with three questions to evaluate how effective the participant was in reading the assigned book. For inclusion criteria, the participants had to answer to all three questions on the questionnaire correctly. If the participants only responded correctly to one or two questions, he or she was excluded from the study. In fact, initially, the total sample consisted of 250 participants. Thirty-six students were excluded because they did not respond to all three questions, and it was unclear whether or not they had read the book.</p><p>The time between the pre- and post-reading phases was 14 days. The participants had one week to read the book. After the pre- reading phase, the participants had from 1 to 5 days to buy the book; only when all the participants had the assigned book could the reading of it begin.</p><p>Therefore, to avoid a learning effect we decided to use different empathic measures during the pre and post-reading phases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160254.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The study was conducted at the University of L'Aquila, according to the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained by the University of L'Aquila.

Examples of items on the CES are: &#x0201c;I can understand my friend&#x02019;s happiness when she/he does well at something&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;When someone is feeling down I can usually understand how they feel&#x0201d;. The participants had to give their ratings on a five-point Likert type scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree).

Baron-Cohen [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] considers this test as a &#x02018;pure&#x02019; theory of mind test, at an advanced level. In brief, participants are given 36 photographs depicting the ocular area in an equal number of different actors and actresses. At each corner of every photo, four emotional descriptors (e.g., dispirited, bored, playful or comforting), are printed, only one of which (the target word) correctly identifies the depicted person's mental state, while the others are included as foils. The test is scored by totalling the number of items (photographs) the participant correctly identifies. Therefore, the maximum total score is 36. The mean and standard deviation for the student sample is, respectively, 28.0 and 3.5 (for details see [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p><p><italic>Interpersonal Reactivity Index cognitive sub-scales</italic> (IRI): the IRI, which Davis [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] developed, is the most frequently used self-administered instrument to assess the different components of empathy. The IRI cognitive sub-scales include 14 items divided into two scales: fantasy (FS) and perspective taking (PT). The FS sub-scale evaluates the tendency of the individual to identify him or herself with fictitious personages, such characters from books, films, or video games (e.g., &#x0201c;When I am reading an interesting story or novel, I imagine how I would feel if the events in the story were happening to me&#x0201d;). The standardized alpha coefficients for the FS scale are .78 for males and .79 for females [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The PT sub-scale evaluates the tendency of an individual to spontaneously adopt the psychological point-of-view of another person (e.g., &#x0201c;I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy's point of view&#x0201d;). The standardized alpha coefficients for PT are .71 for males and .75 for females [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Each answer can vary from 0 (<italic>does not describe me well</italic>) to 4 (<italic>describes me very well</italic>). The scores of each sub-scale are calculated individually. The IRI does not provide a total score because each sub-scale evaluates an independent component of empathy [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p><italic>Advanced Theory of Mind Task</italic>. This task is an Italian adaptation of a cognitive task that Blair and Cipolotti [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] used and was proposed in the literature by Happ&#x000e8; [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The Italian task consists of a short version of 13 vignettes, each accompanied by two questions: the comprehension question &#x0201c;<italic>Was it true; what X said</italic>?&#x0201d;, and the justification question &#x0201c;<italic>Why did X say that?</italic>&#x0201d;. The 12 story-types include Lie, White Lie, Joke, Pretence, Misunderstanding, Double Bluff, Contrary Emotions, Figure of speech, Appearance/Reality, Forgetting, Irony, Persuasion. Each subject earns a score ranging from 0 to 1 for each question. The maximum score is 13. Happ&#x000e8; [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] used the term &#x0201c;advanced&#x0201d; to refer to a story that contains the comprehension question, where the key questions in the task either concerned a character&#x02019;s mental states (the experimental condition). Happ&#x000e8;&#x02019;s task is more advanced than previous tests of theory of mind. The maximum score is 13 and the cut-off for the Italian normative sample is equivalent to 12.</p><p><italic>Attribution of Intentions Task</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]: the concept of attribution of intentions to others is a central element of what is often referred to as theory of mind. Cartoon-type stimuli depicting sequences of intentional actions have thus been utilized to evaluate mentalizing performance. Each scenario showed a character performing a very simple action in order to facilitate identification of the intention that motivated it. This nonverbal test used a picture-sequencing task that includes three conditions: (1) attribution of intentions; (2) physical causality with human figures and (3) a physical causality condition involving objects only. In our experiment, we only consider the attribution of intentions condition (A and B series). In this condition, the stories involve human agents whose intentions must be inferred to select the picture missing from the sequence. The stories were designed to depict simple first-order intentional behaviour. Each subject can earn a score ranging from 0 to 1 for each story. The score range for this task is 0&#x02013;28.</p><p>For the post-reading phase, we used the following measures <italic>Empathy Quotient Scale</italic> (EQ) is a self-report measure that Baron-Cohen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] developed to measure the different aspects of empathy [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The cognitive dimensions of empathy are evaluated by two sub-scales of the EQ: cognitive empathy (CE) and social skills (SS), which measure, respectively, the capacity to take the perspective of the other person and some regulatory mechanisms that keep track of the origins of self and other-feelings. The means (and standard deviations) for CE and SS are, respectively 8.9 (4.3) and 4.7 (2.3) with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.85 and 0.55 [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p><italic>First and Second Order False Belief Test</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These tests were designed to evaluate the ability to solve problems involving either (1) first-order attributions of false belief (of form &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; thinks &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;) and (2) second-order attributions of false belief (of form &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; thinks &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; thinks &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;). We think that the second-order false belief test is a form of <italic>Advanced Theory of Mind</italic>, because the questions of both tests concern the capacity of the people to understand the cause of the behaviour of the character in the story (&#x0201c;<italic>Why did X say this</italic>?&#x0201d;).

In these pictures, taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the stimuli show individuals feeling different emotions: positive emotions (25 pictures that include emotions such as happiness, positive surprise) and negative emotions (25 pictures that include emotions such as sadness, anger, disappointment). Positive and negative emotions are presented in random order. All the stimuli were displayed on a black screen. For each of the 50 stimuli presented, the subjects are required to infer the mental and emotional state of the individual/s depicted in the picture (<italic>What kind of emotion/mental state is/are the person/people feeling?</italic>).

The test is comprised of 10 pictures that represent seven &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; emotions (happy, surprise, sad, angry, afraid, disgust, and distress; surprise, happy, and angry were repeated, using new poses, to make a the set of 10 pictures), and 10 pictures that represent nine &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; mental states (scheming, guilt, thoughtful, admiring, quizzical, flirting, bored, interested, and arrogant; interested was repeated in the set of complex mental states, to make a set of 10, although a new pose was used). Under each photo (full face, eyes, or mouth) a target word was typed, describing the mental state the actress was demonstrating. These words were chosen by a panel of four independent judges (two male, two female), and only those terms that produced unanimous agreement were used.</p><p><italic>Emotion Attribution Task</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]: This is an assessment of the ability to represent the emotions of other people.

to improve the ability to empathize with other people both in healthy and psychiatric populations have been made. Kidd and Castano [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] opened a very interesting branch of research in the social cognition field linked to reading literary texts. Studies on emotional and social components involved during the reading of literary texts, however, are scarce, and only a few studies have specifically investigated the affective processes underlying story processing [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of Kidd and Castano&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Black and Barnes&#x02019;s research [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we have tried to replicate and extend their studies in two important ways: (1) the participants underwent a large variety of empathy tests and (2) compared to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our participants read a whole book and not only part of a book. Unlike reading a short story or an excerpt from a novel, reading an entire book may be more likely to promote narrative competence, which is defined as "the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and predicaments of others" [10, 11 (p. 3)].</p><p>In addition, in our study, participants completed a complex battery of social cognition tests before and after the reading phases. Our study, in line with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that reading literary fiction enhances mentalizing abilities. The explanation of this result can depend on features of the literary fiction (i.e., this type of fiction allows readers to identify with the characters of the story without facing the potentially negative consequences of that involvement) [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, characters are more often the primary focus of literary fiction texts, a feature that is likely to encourage readers to infer and track their mental states [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The science-fiction and nonfiction books did not have effects on any empathic competencies. Regarding science-fiction, we did not expect any effect because this genre narrates imaginative stories that are distant from reality and emotional contexts. We sustain that the pleasure in reading science fiction more often comes from imagining different realities than from understanding characters. Perhaps for this reason the science fiction genre is preferred by individuals with autism, and does not affect social skills [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the contrary, regarding nonfiction books we expected effects on empathic abilities, particularly on emotional sharing competencies because this literary genre recounts real stories about dramas, pain or positive events that have marked the life of the character and that could involve the readers. The possible explanation of this result is that the nonfiction books could induce a "psychological block" in the readers because they know the events of the stories really happened [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Another possible explanation about the effect of literary fiction on mentalizing ability can derive from the main character of the book [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the literary fiction books selected for this study, the main characters have characteristics which are more similar to our readers compared to the characters of the other genres used in the present study. These aspects are important and essential in order to select adequate books when planning the treatment of a clinical population.</p><p>On the basis of the previous results [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and our results, we believe there is support for the notion that reading literary fiction may change how people think about the mental and emotional states of other people [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it does not appear to change our internal emotional sharing, that is the capacity to feel what people feel in a painful situation.</p><p>In general, our study showed the short-term effects of reading processes on mentalizing abilities. These results may set important goals for future low-cost rehabilitation treatment for several disorders in which a deficit of ToM is considered &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; to the disease such as in the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and autism [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>However, our study has several limitations. Regarding the measures used, the mentalizing tests are more numerous compared to the emotional sharing measures, and the tests used during the pre- reading phase are different compared to the tests administered during the post- reading phase. Another crucial difference between mentalizing and emotional sharing measures is that the first are performance-based measures, while the second are self-report measures. In fact, according to Coman and Richardson' s study [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], these measures evaluate different aspects of cognitive and emotional functioning: self-reported functioning reflects the perception that a person has about his/her performance of tasks [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; whereas, performance-based measures are more objective and assess the ability to perform a specific task correctly or incorrectly. We think that these differences depend on the &#x0201c;nature&#x0201d; of the construct that we evaluated through the tests. In our case, the mentalizing tests evaluate the subject&#x02019; s capacity to understand and recognize the mental and emotional states of other people. Thus the tests used evaluate the correct performance of the participants (for example, each subject can earn a score ranging from 0 -wrong response- to 1 -correct response- for each item); whereas, the emotional sharing tests evaluate the perception that the subject has about his/her own capacity to share the emotions of other people and right or wrong responses do not exist. For this reason, the best kind of emotional sharing test is a self-report one. In contrast to Djikic et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and Bal and Veltkamp&#x02019; s [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] results, in our study the fiction group showed significant differences compared to the other two groups in the performance-based measures. In our opinion, these results are more interesting because performance-based measures seem to estimate the real ability of the participants. On the contrary in the self-report measures, the results can to be overestimation or underestimation of actual ability. Based on these findings it can be said that reading literary fiction seems to improve mentalizing performance, but not the perception that the subject has of himself/herself compared to his/her capacity to understand the mental and emotional states of other people. In addition, the mentalizing tasks require a representation of the mental states of other people and they are based on the accurate decoding of specific cues, for example the facial expression and tone of voice. On the other hand, the emotional sharing tasks refer to internal or affective representation of another person&#x02019;s emotional experience which can depend on real-world functioning, i.e., whether participants engage social skills in their daily life. Therefore, when a person predicts an emotional response in someone else he/she generates an internal affective representation of the predicted emotional response. The stronger the affective representation, the more likely he/she is able to experience empathy in the social context [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Another important limitation of the present study is the prevalence of female participants compared to male participants. This limit did not allow us to form conclusions about gender differences. In addition, the within-subject design can offer more detailed and accurate information, but it will be necessary to overcome the &#x0201c;learning effect&#x0201d; regarding the use of the same test during the pre- and post-reading phases. It will be interesting to evaluate the effect of literary fiction compared to other genres using different media, for instance movies. In addition, an important future perspective is to replicate our study in a group of adolescents with autism, using the same literary genres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the main objective of our research was to replicate Kidd and Castano&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Black and Barnes&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0160254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] studies, while overcoming their limits and highlighting the efficacy of narrative competences on social abilities.
