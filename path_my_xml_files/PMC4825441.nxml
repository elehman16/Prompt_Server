The tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) activity is not measured after AZM treatment in periodontitis patients which speaks about the immunomodulatory effect of AZM. The use of AZM in the treatment of periodontitis with known anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial actions is a good venture to understand potential activity of AZM. In the literature, there are studies of AZM used in conjunction with periodontal therapy with inconsistent beneficial benefits. AZM can be administered either systemically or as local drug delivery. The buccal mucosa is permeable with a rich blood supply. A few drugs have been successfully administered via the buccal route. The mouth is an accessible site for placement devices such as a buccal patch.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Scaling root planing (SRP) is considered as the gold standard in improving clinical, microbial, and biochemical parameters of periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Various antimicrobials are used as an adjunct to enhance the effects of SRP considering multiple actions of the drug used either in the local drug delivery or systemic form. Administration via AZM buccal patch delivers the sufficient quantity of drug 90% to systemic circulation compared to oral administration of AZM (37%).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The AZM effect on chronic periodontitis is not consistent in improving clinical and microbial parameter.</p><p>There is a need for definitive, properly controlled clinical periodontal studies that investigate the effects of AZM as a monotherapy and as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment. Medline search using keywords AZM, periodontitis, buccal patch, and the tablet does not reveal similar studies. Hence, the aim of this pilot randomized control trial investigation was to evaluate AZM in the treatment of periodontitis, to compare the clinical, microbial, and biochemical parameters of chronic periodontitis before and after treatment with AZM and to evaluate effect of AZM on clinical parameters during supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) for SRP patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Forty patients, aged 19&#x02013;53 years (19 males and 21 females), who were diagnosed with chronic periodontitis[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] from outpatient section of College of Dental Sciences, Davangere were enrolled in the study. Informed written consent was obtained from patients, and the Institutional Ethics Committee approved this Clinical Trial (Reference Number CODS/2248/21010-2011). Systemically healthy subjects diagnosed with chronic periodontitis (probing pocket depth [PPD] =5&#x02013;7 mm) were included in the study. Patients who gave history of antibiotic or periodontal therapy in the last 6 months, patients with known or suspected allergy to the AZM other macrolides antibiotics, smokers, alcoholics, patients with diabetes, immunocompromised patients, and pregnant or lactating females were excluded from this study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. This pilot study was designed as a single center randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 3 months duration. Forty patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group: SRP only (Group 1), SRP + AZM patch (Group 2), SRP + AZM tablet (Group 3), AZM buccal patch monotherapy (Group 4), and AZM tablet monotherapy (Group 5). Oral hygiene instructions were given and the patients were advised a toothbrush (ICPA Health Products Ltd.) and toothpaste (SENSODENT-R<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Warren Pharma, India). SRP was performed using ultrasonic (Cavitron<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> - Bobcat pro, dentsply USA) and hand instruments (Hu-Friedy, Chicago).

But the solvent casting method was followed in this study for preparation of films.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Films of different composition of polymers were prepared. The films were observed for dispersion of drug, flexibility, and glossy structure. The &#x0201c;film&#x0201d; represents the one, which was prepared from the mould and was bigger in size (5 cm &#x000d7; 3 cm) and patch represents the one, which was obtained by cutting the film and was smaller in size (1 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm). The buccal mucoadhesive films of AZM were prepared using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) polymer by solvent casting method. HPMC polymer (400 mg) was weighed accurately and placed in 4 ml of ethanol. The contents in the beaker were stirred on magnetic stirrer for 10 min for swelling of polymer. Further, 3 ml of ethanol was added to the above polymer solution and stirred the dispersion. Then, ten drops (25 mg) of dibutylpthalate were added to the polymer solution. AZM (300 mg) was weighed and dissolved in 3 ml of ethanol in another beaker. The drug solution was added to the polymer dispersion. The whole mixture was mixed thoroughly with the help of a magnetic stirrer. The glass mould of size 5 cm &#x000d7; 3 cm was placed over a flat surface. The drug-polymer mixture was poured into the glass mould. The mould was covered under inverted funnel overnight for drying and was allowed for slow evaporation to remove the solvent. The film was removed from the mould and packed in aluminum foil and stored in a dessicator.</p><p>The AZM buccal patch administration was done during Phase I periodontal therapy and maintenance phase of those patients in the SRP group at 21 days and followed up to 42 days (3 weeks duration).

The Pg and Pi reduction were similar in SRP alone and SRP + AZM patch group, unlike the SRP + AZM tablet groups which showed no improvement in microbial parameters [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. All the groups had similar GCF TNF-&#x003b1; level amount at baseline. The SRP and SRP + AZM patch treatment demonstrated similar reduction for TNF-&#x003b1; level.

Bioavailability is 37% following oral administration, and its pKa is 8.74. As the bioavailability is 37% the drug available in the systemic circulation and oral administration of 500 mg was 185 mg of AZM. Based on these calculations, buccal films were designed at a concentration of 300 mg/15 cm<sup>2</sup> using 3 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm <italic>in situ</italic> developed glass molds. A film of 15 cm<sup>2</sup> is divided into two patches, each measuring 1.5 cm width and 5 cm length and oral administration of 500 mg of AZM tablet is equivalent to buccaly administration of two patches measuring 1.5 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm on either side of buccal mucosa. AZM is a well-established drug used in the treatment of periodontitis. The results of the present study are discussed as follows: At baseline, no significant difference was observed in clinical, microbial, and TNF-&#x003b1; parameters. On intergroup comparisons [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], the plaque scores, gingival bleeding, gingival inflammation, PPD reduction, and CAL improvement were similar in SRP and SRP + AZM patch group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in plaque and gingival bleeding scores in SRP + AZM tablet group. AZM patch in the treatment of periodontitis has been tried for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in periodontal literature; however, this type of treatment showed similar results as of SRP. Hence, the authors recommend AZM tablet as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. On intergroup comparison, there was no significant difference in Pg and Pi reduction in SRP versus SRP + AZM patch group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in the periodontopathogens in SRP + AZM tablet group suggesting the adjunctive use of AZM to SRP.</p><p>The first periodontal clinical study on AZM was performed in 1996.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There are two groups of results on adjunctive AZM drug trial in periodontal disease treatment. Those authors who reported AZM is an effective drug in combination with SRP are Smith <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Mascarenhas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gomi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Yashima <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Oteo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The current study also supports adjunctive use of AZM tablet 500 mg to SRP. Few authors who reported AZM did not improve the periodontal parameters are Sampaio <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Emingil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The reasons for inconsistent report in the literature could be due to variation in study designs that requires to be analyzed. The microbiological goal of periodontal therapy[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] has been achieved in the present study, although adjunctive systemic AZM did not result in any additional effect on the microbial levels given the antimicrobial activity of AZM <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>There are several <italic>in vitro</italic> reports on the immunomodulatory effects of AZM.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of AZM and its concentration in neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts are well documented, but it is not known how long these effects persists after a single course and what intracellular concentration of the drug is required to exert its immunomodulatory effect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In the present study, TNF-&#x003b1; was evaluated to assess the immunomodulatory effects of AZM. The GCF TNF-alpha levels reduction was similar in SRP and SRP + AZM patch group, whereas SRP group showed higher TNF-&#x003b1; reduction than the SRP + AZM tablet group. The TNF-&#x003b1; level estimation in chronic generalized periodontitis patients does not exist. However, de Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported a significant reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; levels after nonsurgical treatment in aggressive periodontitis.</p><p>Monotherapy in the form of AZM buccal patch and tablet were used without SRP for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in literature. In the present study, clinical parameters within the group (AZM patch and AZM tablet) had no significant improvement in PI, GBI, MGI, PPD, and CAL from baseline. Both the patch and tablet did not significantly reduce the Pg and Pi. The TNF-alpha levels reduction in monotherapy groups was not significantly affected. The role of TNF-alpha to represent the immunomodulant effect of AZM did not show any significant results.</p><p>Monotherapy <italic>per se</italic> would be useful in those patients where mechanical debridement would be contraindicated. AZM was tried as monotherapy based on its triple action as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory that are required for treatment of periodontal disease unlike antimicrobials such as amoxicillin and others that have restricted antimicrobial property. Authors like Lopez and Gamonal (1998) and Lopez <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) have supported the use of systemic antimicrobials as monotherapy.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The current study AZM did not provide any beneficial effects either as an adjunct neither as monotherapy. The nonsurgical therapy with and without AZM demonstrates significantly lower TNF-&#x003b1; levels as compared to monotherapy. The results of the study indicate that the increased TNF-&#x003b1; levels at 21 days in the drug alone groups (AZM patch and AZM tablet) are alarming which requires to be elucidated. Only one study by Ho <italic>et al</italic>. reported the increase of TNF-&#x003b1; levels in periodontally healthy patients.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] He reported that with AZM treatment, GCF volume decreased significantly on days 2 through 7 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) but increased toward baseline levels on day 14. The possible reasoning could be that the AZM-induced suppression of TNF-&#x003b1; production from diseased periodontium cells would have exaggerated the production of TNF-&#x003b1; after the cessation of the 14<sup>th</sup> day action of AZM. The exact reason for increased TNF-&#x003b1; level in periodontitis patients at 21 days during monotherapy requires to be elucidated.</p><p>Periodontal maintenance regular follow-up is required for long-term prognosis. AZM as a chemotherapeutic agent in the maintenance phase has been tried for the 1<sup>st</sup> time. During SPT, when the clinical parameters of periodontitis are stabilized by SRP considerably were provided with AZM [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] tablet/once daily at 21<sup>st</sup> post-SRP to evaluate if there could be any beneficial role of AZM during this phase. At the end of the 60<sup>th</sup> day, there was a significant improvement in all the clinical parameters of SRP growth when compared from baseline to 60<sup>th</sup> day and from 21<sup>st</sup> to 60<sup>th</sup> day except for no significant changes in CAL. To discuss the results of the current study, considering the AZM effect on the 0&#x02013;21<sup>st</sup> day phase. It is unlikely that AZM has any role to play during SPT most probably the significant parameter reduction at the end of 60 days can be attributed directly to the continued effects of SRP. The compliance was good for both AZM buccal patch and tablet. The films did not cause any discomfort to the volunteers. Thus, buccal patch claims the potential clinical usefulness in delivering the drug.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>AZM offers good patient compliance. This is the first report of AZM usage as a buccal patch of AZM compared to tablet form and as monotherapy in the treatment of periodontitis. Considering the results of the study, it is safe to use AZM along with SRP. Further larger sample sizes are required to reassess the outcome of AZM as monotherapy. Studies are required to investigate the concentration and kinetics of AZM present in gingival tissue and GCF. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZM patch in patients with periodontitis whose tissue defenses are compromised and in patients with GIT disorders.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gomi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Yashima</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Iino</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanazashi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagano</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Shibukawa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Drug concentration in inflamed periodontal tissues after systemically administered azithromycin</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2007</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>918</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17470027</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yashima</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>One-stage full-mouth versus partial-mouth scaling and root planing during the effective half-life of systemically administered azithromycin</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2009</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>1406</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19722790</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pradeep</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagar</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name><name><surname>Daisy</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical and microbiologic effects of subgingivally delivered 0.5% azithromycin in the treatment of chronic periodontitis</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2008</year><volume>79</volume><fpage>2125</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18980521</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thimmasetty</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pandey</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Babu</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Design and <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of carvedilol buccal mucoadhesive patches</article-title><source>Pak J Pharm Sci</source><year>2008</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>241</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18614419</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Microbes, inflammation, scaling and root planing, and the periodontal condition</article-title><source>J Dent Hyg</source><year>2008</year><volume>82</volume><issue>Suppl 3</issue><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19275822</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Armitage</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development of a classification system for periodontal diseases and conditions</article-title><source>Ann Periodontol</source><year>1999</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10863370</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal disease in pregnancy.
