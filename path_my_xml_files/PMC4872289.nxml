Many pathogens implicated in these infections have developed resistance to standard antibiotics, thereby limiting treatment options. Moreover, the evolution of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is a growing concern [<xref rid="CIW133C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIW133C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

The current phase 3 investigations demonstrated ceftazidime-avibactam in combination with metronidazole is effective in the treatment of cIAI. Noninferiority compared with meropenem for the primary end point of clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit was consistently achieved across study populations, with the lower limit of the 95% CI for the between-group treatment difference in the mMITT, MITT, and clinically evaluable populations being above &#x02212;10%, satisfying both the sponsor-defined margin (above &#x02212;12.5%) and the FDA requirements (above &#x02212;10%). Furthermore, the lower limit of the 95% CIs in the secondary end point analyses of clinical cure at the end-of-treatment and late-follow-up visits were numerically above &#x02212;10%. Meropenem is a reference standard for treatment of serious ESBL-producing infections and demonstrated efficacy consistent with its known profile [<xref rid="CIW133C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIW133C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In the ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole group, 83.0% of patients with ceftazidime-resistant infections were classified as clinical cures. This was consistent with results seen in patients with ceftazidime-susceptible infections (82.0%) and those with ceftazidime-resistant infections in the meropenem group (85.9%). The ceftazidime-avibactam MIC was left-shifted compared with ceftazidime alone in ceftazidime-resistant isolates in the mMITT population at baseline, and almost all had a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC provisionally within the susceptible range (MIC, &#x02264;8 mg/L). These data suggest that avibactam restores the efficacy of ceftazidime against ceftazidime-resistant pathogens.</p><p>The proportion of patients with clinical cure across patient and disease baseline subgroups was generally consistent between the 2 treatment arms, except in patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, in whom there was a response trend in favor of meropenem. As with other drugs eliminated largely by renal excretion, renal function affects the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime, avibactam, and meropenem [<xref rid="CIW133C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIW133C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To account for this, dose adjustments for these drugs were made for all patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, with the aim of achieving drug plasma levels associated with target attainment while minimizing the risk of overexposure due to impaired renal clearance. Post hoc review of serum creatinine levels indicated rapid improvement of renal function in some patients after enrollment. Dose adjustments were made; however, some patients were potentially underdosed early in the study. Because the protocol-specified reduction in total daily dose in renal impairment for ceftazidime-avibactam (&#x02212;66%) was greater than for meropenem (&#x02212;33%), this increased the risk of underdosing in patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam. These results should be interpreted with caution because patients with renal impairment at baseline represented only a small subgroup (8% of the MITT population); however, similar results have also been noted with ceftolozane-tazobactam, another &#x003b2;-lactamase/&#x003b2;-lactam combination [<xref rid="CIW133C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Subsequent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling has been completed to calculate the probability of target attainment, taking into account improving renal function during the critical phase of treatment [<xref rid="CIW133C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIW133C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Using these models, revised dose adjustments for moderate (and severe) renal impairment at baseline have been established, ensuring that optimal ceftazidime-avibactam plasma levels for target attainment are achieved in the future [<xref rid="CIW133C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Considering the known safety profile for metronidazole, ceftazidime-avibactam had a safety and tolerability profile broadly similar to ceftazidime alone and meropenem. Most AEs were mild or moderate in both groups, with low incidences of discontinuations or deaths due to AEs and few serious AEs.</p><p>A potential limitation of the study is the enrollment of a high proportion of patients (&#x0003e;80%) with an APACHE II score &#x02264;10 and a relatively large proportion of patients (approximately 40%) with cIAI related to the appendix. Nevertheless, these proportions were both somewhat lower in the present study than in a recent study evaluating the cephalosporin-&#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor combination, ceftolozane-tazobactam, in patients with cIAI [<xref rid="CIW133C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The source of infection and pathogens implicated are also similar to those observed in other cIAI clinical studies in recent years [<xref rid="CIW133C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIW133C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There was a small imbalance between groups in the proportion of patients enrolled with bacteremia (4.2% in the ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole group and 2.7% in the meropenem group). However, other markers of more critically ill patients, such as the APACHE II score, tended to be evenly distributed between groups.</p><p>In conclusion, ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole was effective in treating hospitalized adults with cIAI, as demonstrated by noninferiority to meropenem. The clinical cure rate with ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole was comparable to that with meropenem in patients with Gram-negative pathogens resistant to ceftazidime and similar to its own efficacy against ceftazidime-susceptible infections. There were no new safety signals, and the safety profile of ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole was comparable to those of ceftazidime, metronidazole, and meropenem alone. These results support the use of ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole as a potential alternative to carbapenems in the treatment of cIAI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/ciw133/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <uri xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.
