To date the moderators of treatment of postnatal depression have been studied little.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In particular, it is not known whether psychological interventions can reduce depression in women who are very poor and financially dependent on their husbands, or whether these factors limit the effectiveness of the intervention.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p id="P13">In a recent RCT (trial registration: ISRCTN65316374) we tested an intervention, &#x02018;The Thinking Healthy Programme&#x02019;, which was based on culturally adapted cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) principles but also involved the husband and family in supporting the woman with depression during therapy.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The intervention was delivered by local community health workers; these workers were women who were influential and resourceful, and could help the women with depression and their families to mobilise community resources to overcome psychosocial difficulties through problem-solving.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Qualitative evaluations demonstrated that the problem-solving approach in the hands of these resourceful women was useful in addressing some of the socioeconomic risk factors at a practical level, for example, assisting women in obtaining small loans from government microcredit schemes. Through an agenda of effective child-rearing, the intervention also gently challenged gender stereotype and encouraged fathers to play an active role in supporting the mother in child care and interaction. The trial was effective in treating depression (effect size 0.66) but had additional benefits on maternal support, family relationships and infants&#x02019; health.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These benefits are compatible with the underlying theory of our approach, which regards the child as the centre of the intervention with the mother and father working together with the &#x02018;lady health worker&#x02019; (LHW) to achieve child health. The present study was aimed at identifying the moderators of treatment outcome, on the basis that if a treatment has its effects by influencing a particular process this finding establishes the importance of the process in maintaining the disorder and may lead to further refinements of the intervention in a future trial. Specifically, we wished to determine whether poverty, debt or any of the other social variables associated with persistent depression (lack of financial empowerment, lack of social support) moderated the effect of treatment. We wished also to assess whether the intervention reduced the proportion of women with household debt and increased the proportion who were financially empowered.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><sec id="S2"><title>Study area, participants and sampling</title><p id="P14">This study used data from a cluster, randomised, community-based trial of a psychological intervention for perinatal depression in two rural subdistricts (Gujar Khan and Kallar Syedan) of Rawalpindi, Pakistan, between 2004 and 2007. The details of the methods and the main results of this trial have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In a cluster randomised trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), 40 union councils (an administrative unit consisting of 5&#x02013;10 villages and a population of about 20 000) were randomised into an equal number of treatment and control clusters. A total of 3898 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were identified by obtaining official lists from 250 government-employed LHWs, who routinely collect data on new pregnancies. All married women aged 17&#x02013;40 years in their third trimester of pregnancy, who had depression, were considered for inclusion in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Women with a diagnosed medical condition, pregnancy-related illness, significant physical or intellectual disability, postpartum or other form of psychosis and severe depression were excluded. We obtained informed verbal and written consent from the participants. Ethical approval for the study was granted by committees of the University of Manchester, UK, and the Institute of Psychiatry, Rawalpindi.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Data ascertainment</title><sec id="S4"><title>Psychiatric disorder and depression severity</title><p id="P15">Assessments were carried out at all time points by two trained and experienced clinicians (A.M. and S.S.) using a structured clinical instrument for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive episode (SCID)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to assess severity. The former was used to assess the inclusion criteria for the study and whether depressive disorder was still present at follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The HRSD was used to assess the severity of depression at these times. Both of these semi-structured interviews have been used repeatedly in cross-cultural, epidemiological and treatment studies of pre- and postnatal depression. All interviews were carried out in Urdu after translation, back-translation and cultural adaptation of the interview schedule using an established procedure.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Interrater reliability was established prior to the study when both interviewers independently assessed 20 women (10 had clinical depression) and agreed on the diagnosis of 9 (&#x003ba; = 0.90). The interviewers were masked to the allocation status of the union councils and, therefore, the arm of the trial to which each of the women had been randomised. This masking was maintained because the interviewers had no contact with the team that did the randomisation, and throughout the duration of the study they had no contact with the LHWs or any other health personnel in the study area. Mothers were asked not to tell the interviewers anything about their meetings with the LHWs. The HRSD has a maximum score of 57; the mean baseline score in this sample was 14.6 (s.d. = 14.1).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of cluster randomised controlled trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="452f1"/></fig></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Others potential moderators of treatment effect</title><p id="P16">Social support. This was measured with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS),<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> a brief instrument that addresses subjective assessment of social support. The scale consists of 12 items; each is scored on a seven-point scale. Four questions each ask about the source of social support: family, friends, significant other. Thus, for the family support scale the scores range from 4 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater support; the mean score in this sample was 16.3 (s.d. = 6.8). The MSPSS has been locally validated and shown to have satisfactory internal reliability, factorial validity, and test and retest reliability.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In addition, we assessed whether intense social support from family members for 40 days after the birth (<italic>chilla</italic>) was satisfactory.</p><p id="P17"><bold>Sociodemographic variables.</bold> Age, education, employment, family structure and composition were assessed at baseline by the same interviewers using a specially designed Personal Information Questionnaire. Education was categorised into no formal education, 1&#x02013;6 years, 7&#x02013;10 years and 11 or more years of formal education. Family structure was categorised into nuclear family (parents and children only) or extended family (three generations living in the same home).</p><p id="P18"><bold>Mothers&#x02019; nutritional status</bold>. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was measured as an indicator of nutritional status.</p><p id="P19"><bold>Socioeconomic status</bold>. Our study used several sources of information to determine the socioeconomic status of our participants because of the difficulty of measuring this variable in south Asia.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> At baseline we asked LHWs, who lived in the same locality and had intimate knowledge of the families participating in our study, to rate the household on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (least poor) to 5 (poorest). Participants were asked whether their family was in debt and this was verified by asking the LHW, who was generally aware of the nature of the loan, for example, to buy a tractor or to purchase healthcare for a family member. This assessment was repeated at 1-year follow-up. We also asked the participants about the family&#x02019;s monthly income at baseline only.</p><p id="P20"><bold>Financial empowerment</bold>. Maternal financial empowerment within the household was measured at baseline by asking the women whether they were given a lump-sum amount of money for day-to-day household expenses, and whether they could take independent decisions about its use. Mothers who answered &#x02018;yes&#x02019; to both questions were classified as financially empowered within the household. Called &#x02018;<italic>kharcha</italic>&#x02019;, this is a culturally valid concept indicating a degree of empowerment within the household even if the women were not earning. This assessment was repeated at 6 months after baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P21">All analyses were carried out with SPSS for Windows, version 16.

We then performed multiple regression analyses with follow-up HRSD score as the dependent variable. The independent variables were: baseline HRSD, arm of trial (intervention or control), the participant&#x02019;s age, BMI, duration of formal education, family structure (nuclear or joint), socioeconomic status rated by the LHW, empowerment (whether the woman was empowered to manage household finances or not), and debt (yes/no).</p><p id="P22">In further regression analyses we entered in turn each of the following interaction terms: arm &#x000d7; age, arm &#x000d7; BMI, arm &#x000d7; debt (at baseline) and arm &#x000d7; empowerment (at baseline) to identify which of these interaction terms were significant predictors of follow-up HRSD score.</p><p id="P23">We used two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVAR) to test for the effects of treatment arm, being in debt or not, and the interaction term arm &#x000d7; debt on the follow-up HRSD score.

In model 2 of the analysis with debt at 12 months follow-up as the dependent variable, the following measures made at 6 months were included: HRSD score, family support (MSPSS family score), reported relationship with husband and financial empowerment.

The same applied to the relationship with the mother-in-law (details available from the authors on request).

and limitations of the study. The results come from data collected in a large RCT, which was based on a population-based sample of women with clinical depression during the last trimester of pregnancy. The intervention and control groups were similar on a wide range of sociodemographic characteristics and the intervention was effective in reducing depression.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The findings of the current study must be regarded as exploratory, however, as we did not have an <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis with regard to moderators,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> although our study was based on the predictors of persistent depression arising from our previous study in a similar sample.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In our analysis we did us a specific test of the interaction between baseline factors and interventions.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We did not, however, have any test of reliability and validity for our measures of debt and empowerment. Our assessment instruments have been validated in this population.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p id="P43">It has been suggested that identification of moderators should be undertaken whenever possible as this can specify for whom, or under what conditions, the treatment works, to guide the design of future RCTs and to advance our understanding of the nature of clinical disorders.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Kraemer <italic>et al</italic> stated that &#x02018;if a treatment has its effects by influencing a particular process this finding establishes the importance of the process in maintaining the disorder&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Our finding that reducing household debt and increasing the financial empowerment of women are associated with improved depression demonstrates the importance of these factors in maintaining depression. Moreover, we found that these factors, together with low family support and unsatisfactory <italic>chilla</italic>, were more strongly associated with follow-up depression score than those in our previous study (number of young children, a husband with very little formal education, low socioeconomic status and general social support), emphasising the importance of identifying these crucial aspects of the women&#x02019;s environment (debt, empowerment, family support) when treating their depression. The data presented here focus on the moderating effect of household debt and financial empowerment, as the other variables we considered as possible mediators did not fulfilled the requirements of mediators.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Implications</title><p id="P44">The main findings are important as nearly all studies of depression in low-income countries find debt or poverty to be associated with depression so it has been suggested that depression and poverty can interact in a vicious circle.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> More recently it has been observed in a qualitative study of women in India that women&#x02019;s financial empowerment and mental health are &#x02018;inextricably linked&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Our intervention appears to be a way of breaking the vicious circle of depression with debt or lack of empowerment. It is noteworthy that, although low socioeconomic status was associated with a high depression scores at follow-up, it was debt that was a moderator of outcome, hence debt may be more amenable to change than poverty. Although only having a few years of formal education predicted debt at follow-up, this was not so for empowerment, which is a strength of the approach taken by the LHWs in the intervention arm.</p><p id="P45">Our intervention, the &#x02018;Thinking Healthy Programme&#x02019;, was developed to provide a culturally appropriate, feasible and evidence-based psychological intervention for women living in very poor communities in rural Pakistan. It was delivered by ordinary female community health workers to overcome the lack of trained specialist therapists in low-income settings. We believe the community health workers were effective as therapists partly because they could readily engage with the local women, but also because they understood fully their social stressors. This meant they could use problem-solving effectively as part of the therapy to address these stressors.</p><p id="P46">The improvement in financial empowerment can be seen as a direct effect of the intervention, even though it was not a specific focus of the intervention. The intervention focused on the mother&#x02019;s care of herself, including her diet and appearance; it aimed to boost self-esteem. Another specific focus was the modification of family behaviour where it was important for child healthcare. This involved engaging the father as well as the mother. These aspects of the intervention might well have encouraged empowerment of the women, even though this was not a specific aim. Reduction of debt was rather less directly associated with the intervention. It probably arose as a result of the LHWs&#x02019; freedom to seek solutions to the problems faced by many families as part of a child-focused agenda. Thus, debt would have been highlighted as a major problem in approximately half of the families and this could have led to the LHW gently encouraging mothers and families to take small steps to better themselves financially. Future interventions for depression in women in low- and middle-income countries might usefully incorporate this element of problem-solving in addition to the cognitive and behavioural aspects of a CBT-like intervention.</p><p id="P47">The fact that the intervention was associated with the household coming out of debt is immensely important in a low-income setting such as rural Pakistan, where debt can have disastrous effects on a family. In this setting household debt may result from a catastrophic health problem in a family member<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> but the intervention was associated also with infants having fewer episodes of diarrhoeal illness and higher rates of immunisation so the benefits of our intervention go beyond improvement in the mothers&#x02019; mental health. An intervention targeting maternal mental health may have economic benefits for the household.</p><p id="P48">We strongly advocate the case for including mental health interventions, especially those targeting women and children, in programmes of poverty alleviation. Similarly, the use of local non-specialist workers to deliver therapies may be a very effective strategy to deliver psychological interventions in poor communities.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the Human Development Research Foundation, Islamabad, for logistic assistance; the Ministry of Health, Government of Punjab, for their permission to do this study; Fareed Minhas at Rawalpindi for his unflinching support and encouragement; and Zaeem Haq for assistance with the development of training materials and supervision of the lady health workers.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>The study was funded by the <funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source>, UK, through a career development fellowship in tropical medicine awarded to A.R.
