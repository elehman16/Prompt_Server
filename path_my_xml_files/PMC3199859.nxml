Nearly one in five Canadians adults--about 4.6 million people between the ages of 20 and 79--have high blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Almost 50% of patients between the ages of 60 and 79 had a diagnosis of hypertension, with the highest rates of hypertension in elderly women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the United States and Canada, approximately 50% and 35%, respectively, of patients with hypertension are not controlled. These numbers increase to over 60% in patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although awareness and control of hypertension have improved significantly in the last 20 years, there still is a large gap in care.</p></sec><sec><title>The problem in rural communities</title><p>Care of patients with chronic diseases living in rural communities is sometimes difficult given the shortage of rural physicians and the lack of access to specialty care and other healthcare professionals. There is also evidence to suggest that practice guidelines may be implemented to a lesser extent in rural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This provides an excellent opportunity for a multidisciplinary shared-care approach to screening, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacists helping to solve the problem</title><p>There have been a number of interventions by pharmacists to help close these gaps in hypertension management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a recently published study on physician and pharmacist collaboration in a community medical office, there was an adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of -12.0 mm Hg at six months and an absolute improvement in blood pressure (BP) control rates of 34% (from 30% in usual care to 64%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A systematic review conducted by the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] investigated the effects of team-based care for hypertension. Pharmacist recommendations to the physician decreased overall SBP by 9 mm Hg.</p><p>In a recently completed study by our group, Improving blood pressure management in patients with diabetes study (SCRIP<italic>-HTN</italic>), a community pharmacist and nurse intervention (in which the treatment team monitored patients' blood pressures and faxed guideline-concordant treatment recommendations to their primary care physicians if they were above target) produced a 5.6 mm Hg greater decrease in SBP over 24 weeks compared to usual care in patients with diabetes and poorly controlled blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite the improvement in mean blood pressure, only half of the patients reached their blood pressure goal. One potential explanation for this is that traditional pharmacist care can only go so far with recommending appropriate therapy (<italic>i.e</italic>., there is a ceiling effect based on whether or not the physician prescribes the recommended therapy).</p><p>As healthcare costs worldwide increase, pharmacist prescribing is gaining favor as a potentially clinically efficacious and cost-effective means to improve both access and quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Pharmacist prescribing is defined differently depending on the region; it can range from prescribing by protocol to independent prescribing. The Canadian province of Alberta has been a pioneer in the area of independent pharmacist prescribing by being the first jurisdiction in Canada to enact legislation for such. Pharmacists in Alberta now have the ability to apply for additional prescribing authorization. This authorization allows them to prescribe for minor self-limited or self-diagnosed conditions, to modify a prescription written by another prescriber, or to undertake comprehensive drug therapy management, which can include independent initiation of drug therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacist prescribing is a relatively recent innovation, and as such, there is little evidence about its clinical or economic impacts. For instance, work in the United Kingdom has focused generally on attitudes towards pharmacist prescribing and on the value of training programs for pharmacist prescribing authority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>With Alberta being the first province in Canada to allow independent prescribing by pharmacists, it offers a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes in patients who are prescribed antihypertensive therapy by pharmacists.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study overview</title><p>The study is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care, with the unit of randomization being the patient.

Pharmacists assess patients with regards to BP control and cardiovascular risk reduction. The pharmacist also reviews the patient's current hypertensive therapy regimen and decides upon the options for improvement of BP control and implementation of these strategies. Pharmacists encourage adherence to antihypertensives. A fax is sent to the patient's primary care physician outlining the strategies discussed and implemented at the baseline visit. In some cases, depending on the proximity to the physicians, pharmacists may discuss the changes in person. Patients are followed at four-week intervals until achievement of target BP for two consecutive visits and, thereafter, at three-month intervals until study completion. To support pharmacists, there is "hotline" access to hypertension experts via email or telephone. Participating pharmacists submit questions that are either answered by a member of the study coordinating center or are forwarded to one of the hypertension experts on the steering committee.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Components of enhanced pharmacist care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Intervention Component</th><th align="left">Detailed Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Blood pressure control</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Review current blood pressure control and treatment goals<break/>&#x02022; Modify antihypertensive regimen as required (increase dose, additional antihypertensives, change administration schedule)<break/>&#x02022; Order blood work as required with medication changes</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cardiovascular risk reduction</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Assessment of concomitant conditions and appropriate treatment (<italic>e.g</italic>., diabetes management, dyslipidemia, obesity)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Education</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Wallet card to record blood pressure readings, patient-related information from the Canadian Hypertension Education Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]<break/>&#x02022; Lifestyle parameters for implementation (weight loss, salt intake, smoking cessation, alcohol intake, physical activity)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Collaboration with physicians</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Meeting with local physicians prior to study start to discuss collaboration and address any concerns, provide physicians with a communication package<break/>&#x02022; Fax/letter regarding patient's enrollment in the study as well as notification regarding prescriptions</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Adherence</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Simplified regimens, home blood pressure monitoring, and/or identification of adherence barriers</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Close follow-up</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Every four weeks until patient reaches target for two consecutive visits, then every three months</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Patients randomized to the control group receive usual care (which is actually more than typical "usual care" in these settings): a wallet card for BP readings and a pamphlet on BP.

If the pharmacist has a concern regarding control patients' BP during the study, they are to make recommendations to the physician and refer patient to physician, as appropriate.

In order to do this, pharmacists must have at least two years of patient-care experience and have successfully completed an application process. The study team assists pharmacists in implementing documentation systems and accruing the information required to complete their application. To that end, pharmacists attend educational seminars with local hypertension experts that help fulfill the requirement for demonstrating continued education in the area of interest. In addition, pharmacists recruit a run-in of at least three patients and conduct all elements of the intervention except the prescribing portion (patient identification, assessment, education, recommendations to physician). This run-in can serve as the basis for pharmacists to ensure that they routinely perform all the key activities that are required for additional prescribing authorization</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>Based on a two-sample, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test, a sample size of 162 will provide 80% power to detect a minimally important clinical difference (MCID) of 8 mm Hg between intervention and usual-care groups, with a projected standard deviation of 18 in each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

However, with the advancement of pharmacy services to a patient-centered care model, research into other payment models is a priority. A recent review of remuneration systems for pharmacy services demonstrated a wide variety of models in place, with little analysis of outcomes and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this substudy is to evaluate the clinical effect of two pharmacist remuneration models: a payment-for-performance model versus a fee-for-visit model.</p><p>Patients randomized into the intervention arm of the study are further randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either payment-for-performance or fee-for-visit remuneration models for the pharmacist.

One study that specifically focused on patient attitudes towards hypertension found that only 35% of hypertensive patients felt that high BP was a serious health concern, and over 35% also felt that high BP was unavoidable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Patient knowledge of hypertension, its causes and symptoms, and the seriousness of having uncontrolled BP must be improved upon.</p><p>The objective of this substudy is to evaluate the effect of enhanced pharmacist care on patient knowledge. Two surveys are administered to all patients enrolled in the study. One survey is to be completed at the time of enrollment, while the other is an exit survey. Survey questions are designed to determine patients' level of knowledge regarding hypertension and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], as well as patients' level of understanding and experience with pharmacy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>We plan to compare hypertension knowledge at baseline and at follow-up between the control and intervention patients.

These analyses will only be completed for those patients who complete the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Resource utilization</title><p>There is little evidence about the economic impacts of pharmacist prescribing. Yet, if BP is reduced in a sustained fashion, this will reduce strokes and other cardiovascular events, which would likely have a significant economic impact. In a systematic review of pharmacist prescribing in the United Kingdom, none of the included studies had an economic component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A retrospective review of supplementary pharmacist prescribing in the United Kingdom showed that between 2004 and 2006, pharmacist prescribing accounted for 0.004% of all prescriptions and 0.003% of prescribing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This analysis was limited to prescription costs only; there was no consideration of costs related to pharmacist time, healthcare utilization, or other patient-related costs (<italic>e.g</italic>., travel, home BP monitoring).</p><p>The primary objective of this substudy is to evaluate the effect of enhanced pharmacist care on healthcare utilization (hospitalization, emergency room visits, physician visits, use of laboratory testing, use of antihypertensive and other vascular risk-reduction medications). Data will be obtained through Alberta Health Services and Alberta Health and Wellness regarding physician visits and hospitalizations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study organization and management</title><p>The study steering committee consists of pharmacists, researchers, a family physician in rural practice, and physicians with expertise in hypertension. The steering committee is involved in study design, education of pharmacists, and liaising with local physician groups and is available for consultation for difficult cases. The study coordination, including randomization, database design, data entry, and project management, is done centrally through COMPRIS/EPICORE Centre, a nonprofit academic research organization <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epicore.ualberta.ca">http://www.epicore.ualberta.ca</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigator meetings</title><p>In April 2009, the first investigator meeting and training session was held. It consisted of a didactic component on the current guidelines for the treatment of hypertension and was followed by small group discussions on patient cases, study procedures, patient assessment, and applying for additional prescribing authorization.</p><p>Additional pharmacists were invited to participate in the study, and another investigator meeting was held in September 2010 as an update to pharmacists who were already enrolled and a welcome to the new pharmacists.</p><p>An interim meeting will also be held once half the required patients are accrued.</p></sec><sec><title>Site visits</title><p>The sites are spread across the province, with the two farthest points being over 1,000 kilometers apart. In order to offer continued and ongoing support to the pharmacists, site visits are scheduled during recruitment. The first wave of site visits was conducted during May 2010, with each site being visited by one or two study team members. Information regarding community-specific recruitment strategies was provided to each pharmacist.</p></sec><sec><title>Ongoing support</title><p>In order to maintain pharmacist engagement in the study, the study team offers various methods of support. Firstly, monthly newsletters are sent to all sites as well as study sponsors. The newsletters contain study updates, specifically, enrollment to date; clinical pearls; study form reminders; cases; and summaries of recent research. The newsletter format is short (usually three to four pages), and therefore, additional information is often posted on the study website for pharmacists who want further information. Secondly, the study website includes posted information, notices, and discussion boards where pharmacists can post questions and have their colleagues respond. Finally, teleconferences are scheduled monthly, and all pharmacists are invited to participate. The teleconferences are held on rotating days and in the evening, to help accommodate any other commitments the pharmacists may have. An agenda is circulated prior to the teleconference, along with any additional information that may be discussed (a recent study, patient cases, etc.). The study pharmacists can also submit questions or cases that they would like help with. They present the information to the other pharmacists on the call and discussion ensues. Of all the ongoing support mechanisms in place, the pharmacists use the teleconferences most frequently.</p></sec><sec><title>Study status</title><p>To date, one-third of the required sample size has been recruited. There are 15 sites and 17 pharmacists actively screening, recruiting, and following patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study design randomizes patients to enhanced pharmacist care or usual care at the patient level rather than at the pharmacist level. Because of the additional workload inherent in enhanced pharmacist care (including provision of lifestyle counselling, prescribing/titration of antihypertensive medications, and more frequent follow-up) a cluster approach was not seen to be feasible for pharmacists who would have been randomized to enhanced care by this approach. In addition, since all pharmacists involved in the study have additional prescribing authorization, it would not be acceptable for them to be randomized to usual care only. However, the possibility for contamination of the sample is acknowledged. Such contamination may affect the quality of care provided to usual-care patients by each pharmacist and may also affect the pharmacists' responses to the two remuneration schemes since pharmacists will potentially be subject to receiving different payments among their enhanced-care cohort of patients. While contamination may occur, it will bias results towards the null hypothesis; therefore, if a significant difference is found, the result will be more robust.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>TLC, MR, RL, MRK, DC, SKDH, and FAM declare that they have no competing interests.</p><p>NRCC does not have any financial interests that relate to pharmacists caring for people with hypertension.
