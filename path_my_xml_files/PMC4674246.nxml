Until recently CHMI was only carried out by the bite of infected mosquitoes. A parenteral method of CHMI would standardize <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sporozoite (PfSPZ) administration, eliminate the need for expensive challenge facility infrastructure, and allow for use of many <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. Recently, intradermal (ID) injection of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ was shown to induce <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria; however, 100% infection rates were not achieved by ID injection. To optimize ID PfSPZ dosing so as to achieve 100% infection, 30 adults aged 18&#x02013;45 years were randomized to one of six groups composed of five volunteers each. The parameters of dose (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> versus 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ total dose per volunteer), number of injections (two versus eight), and aliquot volume per ID injection (10 &#x003bc;L versus 50 &#x003bc;L) were studied. Three groups attained 100% infection: 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ in 50 &#x003bc;L/2 doses, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ in 10 &#x003bc;L/2 doses, and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ in 10 &#x003bc;L/8 doses. The group that received 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ total dose in eight 10 &#x003bc;L injections had a 100% infection rate and the shortest prepatent period (mean of 12.7 days), approaching the prepatent period for the current CHMI standard of five infected mosquitoes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies have been used as a powerful tool to evaluate malaria vaccine and prophylactic drug efficacy since the mid-1980s. CHMI data inform the decision for or against further clinical development of candidate vaccines, including whether to test in a pediatric population. Although experience is limited, both negative and positive results of CHMI trials conducted in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve individuals have been predictive of field efficacy results to date.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> No vaccine has demonstrated reproducible protective efficacy in malaria-endemic settings without first showing efficacy against CHMI.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Prevention of infection in a proportion of malaria-na&#x000ef;ve persons (as with the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> is considered evidence of partial efficacy, and reason for advancement of vaccine candidates along clinical development pathways. Because of the critical importance of CHMI in assessing candidate malaria vaccines, efforts have aimed to further standardize the model across institutions.</p><p>Obstacles to a fully standardized CHMI for assessing new malaria vaccines and drugs include variability in infection rates between batches of mosquitoes and varying infectivity during the 7-day window when the mosquitoes are most suitable for use in CHMI. These differences can lead to inconsistent prepatent periods (time from CHMI to patent parasitemia) and occasional failures of volunteers to become infected. Many factors restrict access to CHMI to only a few institutions, including the expertise and cost required to maintain mosquito colonies, and the need for secure facilities for CHMI studies, although these limitations can be partly overcome by shipping infected mosquitoes to distant sites. Additional issues include the reactogenicity of mosquito bites due to injection of mosquito saliva and the potential safety concerns associated with using non-sterile mosquitoes. These various obstacles provided a rationale for the development of PfSPZ Challenge<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Sanaria, Inc., Rockville, MD), a good manufacturing practice (GMP) product manufactured by Sanaria Inc. that consists of aseptic, cryopreserved, infectious <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sporozoite (PfSPZ) that meet all regulatory requirements for purity, potency, and consistency, and that are suitable for parenteral injection as a potential replacement for mosquito bites for performing CHMI.</p><p>The first trial of PfSPZ Challenge was conducted at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (RUNMC) in the Netherlands in 2010&#x02013;2011. Eighteen participants were randomized to intradermal (ID) administration of 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, and 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ, in two doses of 50 &#x003bc;L each, and five of six subjects became infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria at all three dose levels.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These results were replicated in malaria-experienced volunteers in Tanzania where 11 of 12 volunteers receiving 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ divided into two doses of 50 &#x003bc;L and 10 of 11 evaluable volunteers receiving 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ divided into four doses of 10 &#x003bc;L developed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitemia after ID injection of PfSPZ Challenge.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The prepatent periods of the three groups in Nijmegen were 13.0, 12.7, and 13.0 days, respectively, and 15.4 and 13.5 for the two groups in Tanzania. Thus in none of the five groups in these two studies did all research subjects become infected, and in none was the prepatent period as determined by microscopy equivalent to the 10.5&#x02013;12 days typical of CHMI by five mosquito bites.</p><p>The results of these two ID CHMI studies posed several questions regarding the administration of PfSPZ Challenge. Were too few PfSPZ administered? Was aliquot volume too great? Would an increase in number of injections improve efforts to mimic the mechanics of mosquito biting, which involve repetitive probing and injection of microaliquots of PfSPZ while biting? The anatomic location of PfSPZ injection or the modalities of delivery, such as intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), or a multi-needle microdose injectable device may also be important variables. Based on a design that manipulated three parameters (dose, injection number, and volume), coupled with an assessment of the kinetics and quantification of parasitemia by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the result of ID administration of PfSPZ was further evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives.</title><p>This study was designed as a dose-ranging, randomized, prospective Phase I cohort study, assessing whether ID administration of cryopreserved PfSPZ of the NF54 isolate of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (PfSPZ Challenge) results in prepatent periods and infection rates similar to those obtained via the bites of mosquitoes. The main objectives were to determine safety and tolerability of parenterally administered CHMI and to discern the optimal dose required to achieve 100% infection in adult subjects. The parameters of 1) dose, 2) number of injections, and 3) aliquot volume were studied.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population and design.</title><p>The clinical study was conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development, at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMB) in Baltimore, MD. Thirty malaria-naive adults aged 18&#x02013;45 years were randomized into one of six groups to receive a total dose of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> (four groups) or 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ (two groups) of PfSPZ Challenge. The total dose was split into either two or eight PfSPZ injections administered parenterally via ID injection in either 10 &#x003bc;L (two groups of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> and two groups of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ) or 50 &#x003bc;L aliquots (two groups of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ) during a single administration session with a total of five subjects per group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The lower limit of injectate by needle and syringe is currently &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;L. As 50-&#x003bc;L injections in two divided doses did not achieve 100% infection,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> this study was weighted toward an injectate volume of 10 &#x003bc;L. Although increasing the volume of injectate above 50 &#x003bc;L would likely contribute to tissue destruction, it might also lead to sporozoites being trapped within the injectate and unable to be distributed systemically. We postulated the combination of multiple injections and microaliquots of sporozoites might simultaneously enhance tissue destruction while enabling sporozoite penetration into the capillary system allowing for hepatic delivery. An upper limit of eight injections balanced the need to increase injection number while preserving practicality in a clinical trial setting. Participants were randomized by an online allocation sequence generated by the EMMES Corporation (Rockville, MD). Study personnel were blinded to group assignment. Participants were previously screened for good health, including laboratory testing for hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, and for pregnancy testing in females of childbearing potential. Baseline complete blood counts, creatinine, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were screened and only volunteers with normal values were enrolled. In addition, volunteers with significant cardiovascular risk were excluded (i.e., &#x0003e; 10%, 5-year risk),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> including evaluation by gender and age for systolic blood pressure (mmHg), smoking status (current versus past or never), body mass index (kg/mm<sup>2</sup>), reported diabetes status, and current treatment of raised blood pressure. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and read by a staff cardiologist. Exclusion criteria included known history of malaria infection, long-term residence (&#x0003e; 5 years) in a malaria-endemic area, travel to a malaria-endemic area within the previous 6 months, the presence of hemoglobin S by electrophoresis, and splenectomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dosage, preparation, and administration of study product.</title><p>The investigational PfSPZ Challenge product was cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen vapor phase at &#x02212;150 to &#x02212;196&#x000b0;C, as a suspension of aseptic, purified, replication-intact PfSPZ formulated in cryoprotectant. The challenge product was administered ID to the deltoid area of the upper arm within 30 minutes of reconstitution by a study nurse unblinded to the number and volume of assigned injections. After randomization to two or eight injections, half were administered in the right arm and half to the left arm, separated by a width of approximately 1 cm when eight injections were given.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Post-administration assessment.</title><p>Participants were monitored for 30 minutes after ID CHMI and asked to maintain symptom diaries until Day 7. They were evaluated in clinic on Days 5&#x02013;7 and admitted to an in-patient ward on Day 8 before the expected time of blood stage parasitemia. Daily histories, vital signs, targeted physical examinations, blood smears, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were performed. Asymptomatic individuals were provided with cell phones, allowed to leave the ward during the day, and return in the evenings for evaluation. Symptomatic or parasitemic individuals remained on the ward under clinical supervision. Inpatient analysis occurred from Days 8 to 18 or until documentation of parasitemia and receipt of 1,500 mg chloroquine (CQ) base as standard first-line therapy over 48 hours (600 mg base/1,000 mg salt at time 0 followed by 300 mg oral base/500 mg salt at hours 6, 24, and 48) and two negative blood smears &#x02265; 12 hours apart. A third negative smear, &#x02265; 12 hours after the previous two negative smears, was documented as an outpatient to affirm malaria cure. As part of a sub-study to evaluate the kinetics of CQ single-dose therapy, CQ and its highly active metabolite, desethylchloroquine (DCQ), levels in blood and urine were measured in a subset of parasitemic volunteers on Days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-malaria diagnosis. The technique for detecting CQ and DCQ has been validated in blood<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and urine<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and was performed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Volunteers who did not acquire malaria were terminally treated with atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) starting on Day 28 post-CHMI. Unsolicited adverse events were recorded for 56 days after the CHMI event.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Assessment of safety and tolerability.</title><p>All adverse events were graded for 1) severity (mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening) and 2) relatedness (associated or not associated to the study product).

The local injection site was assessed and general solicited symptoms or signs evaluated until Day 14 post-CHMI. Local reactions that persisted beyond Day 2 were recorded as adverse events based on previous site experience that erythema, pruritus, and induration are normal responses to mosquito bites within two days of exposure. Solicited systemic symptoms related to the malaria challenge and before malaria parasitemia were recorded until Day 7 post-CHMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and those related to blood stage malaria began on Day 8 post-CHMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) and continued for the duration of the volunteer follow-up or until malaria diagnosis. A comparison was made assessing historical results from our site with a traditional CHMI using aseptically reared <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes infected with the same strain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (NF54) and cultured in the same laboratory facility to eliminate confounding variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

The goal was to use measured levels to model whether directly observed CQ dosing at longer treatment intervals is a feasible option compared with standard weekly prophylactic doses in preventing parasitemia following parenterally administered PfSPZ products. CQ and DCQ levels in blood/urine were measured in a subset of 18 subjects who acquired malaria and had successfully completed CQ administrations as well as follow-up visits that aligned most closely with days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-malaria episode. Participation was limited to 18 volunteers at six time points by contractual agreement and supply of available reagents. The technique for detecting CQ and DCQ was validated in blood<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and urine<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and was performed by collaborators at the CDC. Subject participation began after the diagnosis of peripheral parasitemia by microscopy. Noncompartmental CQ kinetics analysis was used to estimate the slope of the elimination phase, elimination half-life, maximum concentration, time of maximum concentration, and area under the curve. All pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, with the exception of area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to final sample (AUC<sub>last</sub>), were estimated with respect to the fourth dose of CQ. Samples with concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were not included in the PK parameter estimation. Subjects with fewer than three sample concentrations above the LLQ, or with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (square of the correlation coefficient) value for elimination phase samples below 0.8, were not included in the analysis. In CQ and DCQ concentration summaries by subject and time point, concentrations below the LLQ were imputed as 0 ng/mL. Elimination half-life was estimated from the slope of the elimination phase, &#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>. The AUC<sub>last</sub> was calculated from the first dose to the last sample above the LLQ. The analysis variables consisted of baseline variables, safety variables, efficacy data, and laboratory data. Hours of collected samples and administered doses are calculated from the time of the first dose.

The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the inoculation regimens were evaluated. One volunteer was withdrawn post-CHMI due to a work schedule conflict and early termination anti-malaria therapy was provided (Group A). All volunteers completed four weekly safety follow-ups after treatment of malaria or, terminal treatment in the case of volunteers without parasitemia by Day 28 post-CHMI.</p><p>Of the 29 volunteers who completed follow-up through Day 28 post-CHMI, 23 (79.3%) developed patent malaria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Two volunteers missed a follow-up day immediately before their malaria diagnosis and their results are removed from group analysis (Volunteer M11UMD012, Group C; and M11UMD060, Group F). Three of the groups (A, C, and F) demonstrated 100% infectivity, which would be expected of the traditional 5-mosquito CHMI. Notably, Groups B and D, which both had a total of eight injections, did not experience higher infectivity nor did the concentration of PfSPZ/&#x003bc;L appear associated with higher infectivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In addition, the number of PfSPZ injected (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> versus 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>) did not play a role in the resulting quantification of parasitemia at the first positive blood smear (14.8 versus 10.1 parasites/&#x003bc;L [range 2&#x02013;134], <italic>P</italic> = 0.17). These values were comparable to those from prior CHMI studies conducted at our trial site (geometric mean [GM] of 15.7 [range 4&#x02013;70 parasites/&#x003bc;L]).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Parasitemia by qPCR was detected in all 23 volunteers who developed smear-positive malaria. Combined data from the 23 participants who developed malaria demonstrated that qPCR detected patency with a GM of 60.5 hours before microscopy (95% confidence interval = 46.4&#x02013;74.6). However, the kinetics of the malaria infection for ID CHMI appeared different from that observed with CHMI by mosquito bite (traditional CHMI).

This delay in detectable parasites was mirrored in the prepatent period for blood smear detection. A mean prepatent period of 13.5 days (range 12&#x02013;16) by ID CHMI was detected as compared with a prepatent period of 10.9 days by traditional CHMI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The first detectable qPCR value, however, was not significantly different between ID CHMI and the traditional CHMI (161 versus 193 GM parasites/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.40). Parasitemia detection by qPCR was performed daily for diagnostic evaluation compared with more frequent evaluation for kinetic analysis, which limits our interpretation. However, using the method described by Roestenberg and others<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and accounting for time in hours, the GM parasite multiplication rate was 9.0 by ID CHMI compared with 13.3 in infectivity controls in a traditional five-mosquito CHMI (unpublished data derived from previous studies conducted at UMB using mosquitoes infected with the 3D7 clone of NF54 strain <italic>P. falciparum</italic>). These minor differences may be of little clinical relevance. By convention, all participants with fewer than four qPCR positive measurements (<italic>N</italic> = 8), were excluded from multiplication rate analysis for a total of 13 evaluable participants.

The overall prepatent period by blood smear in this study was a mean of 13.5 days (range 12&#x02013;16) and the shortest prepatent period was 12.7 days. This was more than the 10.9 days we have seen in CHMI administered by the bite of mosquitoes,<sup>10,11</sup> but consistent with what has been noted in prior PfSPZ Challenge by the ID and IM routes. qPCR successfully detected parasitemia with a mean of 10.7 days after CHMI (range 8.4&#x02013;11.9). This was longer than the 6.5 days seen in the mosquito bite studies.<sup>10,11</sup> The growth rate in the blood appeared similar to traditional CHMI. Thus, this prolonged prepatent period almost certainly reflected the numbers of PfSPZ that successfully traveled from the skin to the liver, invaded hepatocytes, and fully developed to blood stage.</p><p>On examination of the individual groups, Group F was deemed to have the most parameters aligned with the traditional CHMI administered by the bite of mosquito (prepatent period = 12.7 days [range 12&#x02013;14 days]). The group sample sizes were limited to five individuals, for practical reasons of malaria management, and capped at a total study size of 30 volunteers. Although this was not powered to achieve statistical significance, CHMI is a potent technique with a discrete outcome measure of &#x0201c;infected&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not infected.&#x0201d; Sample sizes of five or six individuals are commonly used as controls in CHMI in which 100% infectivity would be expected. Hence, departure from this expected outcome would be a reliable study outcome. The clinical signs and symptoms associated with mosquito-transmitted malaria were also most similar in the volunteers who received 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ (Groups E and F). Group D: 2/5 subjects, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ in 10 &#x003bc;L/8 doses had the lowest prevalence of malaria transmission (prepatent period = 13.0 days). Thus, in regard to prepatent period, our results with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ were similar to those reported from the Netherlands with fewer PfSPZ, and were consistent with the fact that no dose response was seen in that study.</p><p>Signs and symptoms associated with administration of PfSPZ Challenge included mild and self-resolving local reactions. Symptoms associated with malaria included systemic abnormalities including severe fever, chills, and malaise, most predominant in volunteers receiving 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ. These symptoms were expected and transient in nature, resolving on malaria therapy. In addition, transient laboratory abnormalities associated with clinical malaria were noted, characterized by rises in AST, ALT, bilirubin, and creatinine and transient declines in hemoglobin and white blood cells in some subjects. These laboratory abnormalities were within the expected range of findings associated with mild <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria and were evenly distributed across all groups. All abnormalities resolved without sequelae.</p><p>An isolated finding of a transient positive qPCR after the diagnostic study period is of questionable significance. First, qPCR was a research modality and not a widely accepted means of diagnosis at the time of this study. The presence of gametocytes might be expected after treatment at Day 28 post-CHMI (13 days following therapy) and could account for transient low-level qPCR positivity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Gametocytes being largely resistant to most anti-malarial treatment can persist within the circulation weeks after treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The qPCR detection self-resolved before administration of any anti-malarial product, and the malaria culture (the most sensitive detection method) remained negative at 4 weeks.

The magnitude of net OD 1.0 was &#x0223c;10 times higher in the 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ groups (GM net OD 1.0 of 261 versus 24, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). The responses to PfEXP1 and PfMSP1 were greater than to PfCSP, and almost certainly reflect exposure to these antigens during the &#x0223c;8 days from initial release of parasites from the liver (&#x0223c;Day 5.5) to initiation of treatment (Day 13.5), as the five individuals who did not develop parasitemia did not develop antibodies to these two antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The incidence rate of seroconversion to PfEXP1 (68%) was not significantly different from that to PfMSP1 (50%). However, the magnitude of net OD 1.0 was higher for PfEXP1 and the ratio of post- to pre-net OD 1.0 was higher for PfMSP1. It is unclear as to why antibodies did not develop to PfEBA-175. The IFA results were also consistent with ELISA results (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.15-0341/-/DC6/SD6.pdf">Supplemental Tables 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.15-0341/-/DC6/SD6.pdf">2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.15-0341/-/DC6/SD6.pdf">Supplemental Figure 1A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4269/ajtmh.15-0341/-/DC6/SD6.pdf">B</ext-link>).</p><p>CQ and DCQ levels (sera and urine) were calculated to determine effective dose levels and drug kinetics during the treatment phase of the study. Samples were collected at all six time points to ascertain a kinetic profile of drug detection after a single treatment regimen (1,500 mg CQ base/2,500 mg salt as malaria treatment over 48 hours). It appears, based on these data, that a single CQ dosing regimen results in detectable CQ and DCQ levels above the LLQ (51 and 43 ng/mL, respectively) out to Day 14 post-administration in all 18 volunteers tested; however, the assay was limited in quantification of levels below the LLQ, which was 10-fold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration biologically required to inhibit parasite growth (5 ng/mL). These results may prove valuable in optimizing directly observed therapy in the PfSPZ-CVac model of injecting non-irradiated, fully infective PfSPZ serially under cover of anti-malarial prophylaxis as a means of achieving full protection against malaria.</p><p>In conclusion, ID administration of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) by needle and syringe was safe and transmitted malaria to 100% of human subjects in three of the six groups. About 100% infection with the shortest prepatent period was achieved in the group that received the highest dose (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ) in the most inoculations (<italic>N</italic> = 8), suggesting that a further reduction in the prepatent period should come from increasing the numbers of PfSPZ and inoculations. Administering so many different inoculations by needle and syringe may prove cumbersome, so microneedle array injection is being considered. However, the report that IV or direct venous inoculation of far fewer PfSPZ achieves 100% infection with a prepatent period of 11.3 days<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> establishes a target level of infection with a target number of PfSPZ for those working to achieve similar results by ID injection, a result that may prove difficult to achieve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="external-data" id="SD6"><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/content/96/6/1274/suppl/DC6">Supplemental Datas.</ext-link></p><media mimetype="application/pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="SD6.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e937" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the volunteer population from Baltimore, MD who so graciously consented to participate in this trial.
