Evidence pack &#x02018;A&#x02019; represented the common standard practice of using systematic reviews and lengthy technical reports to inform healthcare policy and guideline development. Evidence pack &#x02018;B&#x02019; represented the recently enriched format for preparing full Cochrane reviews <xref rid="pone.0055067-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Evidence pack C was designed to allow stepwise access (i.e. &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019;) to the evidence. It started with a &#x02018;front-end&#x02019; short interpretation of the main findings and conclusions, drawn from evidence synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055067.s002">webappendix S1</xref>). These front-end concise summaries were followed by a locally prepared, short, contextually framed, narrative report (hereafter called a narrative report) <xref rid="pone.0055067-Improving1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in which the results of the systematic review (and other evidence where relevant) were described and locally relevant factors that could influence the implementation of evidence-based guideline recommendations (e.g. resource capacity) were highlighted. The front-end summary and the narrative report were combined with the full systematic review (e.g. as published by the Cochrane Collaboration) to make a three-component set branded pack &#x02018;C&#x02019;.</p><p>The &#x02018;front-ends&#x02019; in pack &#x02018;C&#x02019; were adapted from existing review-derived formats designed to allow rapid scanning for key messages [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055067.s001">Box S1</xref>]. Further development of these formats was guided by theoretical frameworks on information transfer for non-research audiences <xref rid="pone.0055067-Communication1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055067-Dobbins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Briefly, these frameworks propose that to improve knowledge transfer dissemination materials need to be easy to use, accessible, credible (trustworthy) and desirable. The content needs to be current, relevant, methodologically competent and comprehensive. Finally, the &#x02018;messages&#x02019; need to be tailored to the specific needs and context of the users.</p><p>The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system <xref rid="pone.0055067-Guyatt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> was used to appraise and summarise evidence in summary-of-findings tables. These tables were included in the front-end summaries and narrative reports. The summaries were delivered to participants as pre-reading materials one month before the workshop.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation/Outcome Measures</title><p>Evidence summaries in pack A, B and C formats were prepared for three &#x02018;tracer-interventions&#x02019; relevant to neonatal care where new guidelines were being considered and for which systematic reviews had been recently published: (1) feeding regimens in sick newborns <xref rid="pone.0055067-Edmond1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; (2) hand hygiene for infection prevention <xref rid="pone.0055067-World1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; and (3) kangaroo care for low birth weight babies <xref rid="pone.0055067-CondeAgudelo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example, for feeding regimens we packaged evidence in the format of a systematic review (pack &#x02018;A&#x02019;), a systematic review with summary-of-findings tables (pack &#x02018;B&#x02019;) and a &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; format (pack &#x02018;C&#x02019;); a similar approach was used to assemble differing evidence for hand hygiene and kangaroo care. We then provided all individual participants with evidence on all three tracer topics but used randomisation, within 5 professional strata, to ensure that all participants received one tracer-topic with packaging approach A, one with packaging approach B and one with packaging approach C. This enabled us, when examining which package is most effective at conveying research information, to address the possibility that the relationship is confounded by the nature of the topic and, in subsequent interviews, explore participants&#x02019; views on all the 3 evidence packaging formats.

The trial was designed to have 90% power at an alpha (significance level) of 0.05 to detect a 40% absolute difference in the proportion of correct responses with 35 observations on each evidence pack (calculated using a conventional two-sided Chi-squared test). Assuming a non-response rate of 10% we targeted at least 40 participants for randomisation. All analyses treated the respondent as a unit of clustering.</p><p>The crude odds (likelihood) of correct responses for pack C compared to the odds for pack A (assumed baseline pack) were estimated using logistic regression. The models were also adjusted for the effect of strata and the tracer intervention. Pack by strata interaction terms were included to assess whether the effect of the different evidence packs differed by strata. The secondary outcome measure was the clarity and accessibility score. The mean clarity and accessibility scores of pack C compared to the mean scores of pack A were estimated using linear regression and the lack of normality of the scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055067.s004">webappendix S3</xref>) was accounted for using bootstrapping methods <xref rid="pone.0055067-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Similar processes were used to compare mean scores of pack B to A. To confirm the results of linear regression analysis, an alternative approach to the analysis was undertaken: the odds of a one point increase in the &#x02018;clarity and accessibility&#x02019; scores of pack B and C compared to the odds of pack A were estimated using ordinal logistic regression models. Further tests of interactions between pack and strata were performed using likelihood ratio tests. Where evidence of interaction was found, stratum-specific ORs and 95% CIs were calculated. All analyses were done with STATA (version 11.0).

The quantitative evaluation showed that &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; evidence summary formats which included narrative reviews highlighting local factors relevant for implementation, compared to full systematic reviews, were associated with higher composite scores for clarity and accessibility of information on critical outcomes. However, the proportion of correct answers to questions testing the ability to identify, access and reproduce key messages from the evidence summaries was not improved. This failure may reflect a true lack of effect of format on this outcome. Alternatively, it may be due to inadequate power to detect a smaller but useful effect or inadequate participant preparation in those with limited prior exposure to research evidence (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a1a">Box 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055067-t005">table 5</xref>). Although not statistically significant, results of stratified analyses provide some support for the latter possibility as performance of policymakers and trainee paediatricians, arguably more familiar with interpreting evidence, was somewhat better. This interpretation of the trial findings, seen together with the qualitative data showing difficulties engaging with evidence among some panelists (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a2a">Box 2</xref>), suggests that improving basic skills in evidence-based medicine may be important as we seek to engage wider participation in guideline development. Strategies to enhance panelists&#x02019; skills in evidence retrieval and interpretation may include: (1) involvement of panel members in the preparatory stages of guideline development (e.g. in the conduct of systematic reviews) <xref rid="pone.0055067-Duke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055067-English1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; and (2) education of panel members on guideline development methods (e.g. on the GRADE system).</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec id="s4a1a"><title>Box 1.

<italic>[006]: &#x02018;The mini-review [narrative report] I think was like one of the most useful things I came across, because I found that they had just the right amount of information&#x02026;and also the Cochrane reviews I found were very good&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[010]: &#x02018;&#x02026;this particular one [table-of-key findings] was not very easy for me to understand&#x02026;sometimes making a clear cut difference between especially the quality grades was not very easy&#x02026;alone on itself I found it difficult&#x02026;I needed to go back to the summaries, read a bit and come and compare&#x02026;one needed to have some prior knowledge especially on how to interpret it&#x02026;&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[012]: &#x02018;The systematic reviews give more information on what was done in the research but you will need a lot of time to go through it. So if I were to be asked which one I preferred, I would pick the mini-review [narrative report] because it was very brief and easy to understand. It&#x02019;s easy to understand and you don&#x02019;t go and go until you get tired along the way&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[014]: &#x02018;The Cochrane is good because it&#x02019;s comprehensive and a very good summary of the work that&#x02019;s available as well as what has been done. Its main disadvantage is that it takes more time to read through and digest. The mini-reviews [narrative reports] were the most useful because they were a condensed version, so they are easy to use even when you have limited time they will prove useful. The table-of-key findings is good for a rapid consultation but doesn&#x02019;t give you a feel of how those conclusions were arrived at&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[016]: &#x02018;The problem with the reviews is that most of them had limited data&#x02026;But I was feeling that a lot more other data probably from observation studies could be available and would have been of more value. But at the end of the day you base most of your decisions on randomised controlled trials, but you should know a little more of what was done in the other studies&#x02019;</italic>

</p><p>
<italic>[008]: &#x02018;No, the reading of the materials appeared not to have been exhausting except you backed it up by making presentations&#x02026;&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[010]: &#x02018;Generally I think very few of the participants went through the materials before coming to the workshop. Personally I would say I didn&#x02019;t spend adequate time that would have enabled me to understand the material better, for better participation during the workshop&#x02026;&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[012]: &#x02018;&#x02026;and the volume of the document was another challenge. With the limited time people had and the volume of the document, people had very little time to go through them&#x02019;</italic>

</p><p>
<italic>[011]: &#x02018;Not at all, even being able to synthesize a research paper&#x02026;it&#x02019;s still a process that I would like to learn. For many of the participants I think a short course in that area would be useful and it would help a bit also in the voting&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[013]: &#x02018;Most of us take it [research information] as it&#x02019;s given to us; we don&#x02019;t sieve it and see whether it&#x02019;s of high or low quality&#x02026;the general practitioners don&#x02019;t really know the difference of [between] these studies&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>[015]: &#x02018;&#x02026;I didn&#x02019;t know there is low quality, moderate [quality] or even when I find in the books that it is low quality, I did not know actually what they based it on&#x02019;</italic>
</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Despite an absence of effect on our main outcome, &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; summary formats and their components were reported to: improve clarity of information presentation, improve accessibility to key information, be more reader-friendly (both narrative reports and summary-of-findings tables) and were preferred by participants over systematic reviews. These formats are also likely to be more suited to the different backgrounds, interests and levels of expertise in multidisciplinary guideline panels. For example, those with limited training and skills in research synthesis (such as point of care clinicians) and busy policymakers may only need to scan the &#x02018;front-end&#x02019; summaries for key results. On the other hand, those with expertise in research synthesis may prefer the detail available in narrative reports and systematic reviews to assess the reliability of the results before considering their applicability. These findings are further supported by the qualitative findings (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a1a">Box 1</xref>). A preference for narrative reports may be due to: (1) their abbreviated and plain language nature; (2) incorporation of judgments on the quality of evidence for guideline relevant outcomes; and (3) inclusion of contextual information (e.g. local antimicrobial resistance patterns). A comparison of our findings with related studies is summarised in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a3a">Box 3</xref>. However, it is clear that such &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats are not by themselves an answer to the problem of improving the use of evidence in multidisciplinary guideline panels comprising important policy and provider groups - something that needs to be taken into account when structuring future approaches.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec id="s4a3a"><title>Box 3. Research in context</title><p>To compare current results with related studies we searched The Cochrane Library and PubMed (both from database inceptions up to March 2012) for articles examining ways of presenting evidence for use in healthcare decision-making (full search strategy available from the authors on request). The search identified six related studies: three systematic reviews <xref rid="pone.0055067-Lavis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055067-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055067-Lavis2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, two randomised controlled trials <xref rid="pone.0055067-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055067-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and one qualitative study <xref rid="pone.0055067-Rosenbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Only one <xref rid="pone.0055067-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> of the studies was conducted in a guideline development context. The systematic reviews noted that presentation of results of systematic reviews <xref rid="pone.0055067-Lavis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055067-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and health technology assessments <xref rid="pone.0055067-Lavis2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> using &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats (e.g. one page take home messages, a three-page executive summary and a 25-page report, 1&#x02236;3:25 format) rendered them more useful to healthcare managers and policymakers. Research syntheses using &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats were however reported to be rare (identified in only 7% of 45 websites searched) <xref rid="pone.0055067-Lavis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In the first randomised controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0055067-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> participants attending an evidence-based practice workshop (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72; Norway) and a Cochrane Collaboration entities meeting (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;33; UK) were allocated to receive a Cochrane review with or without a summary-of-findings table. Inclusion of a summary-of-findings table was found to significantly improve understanding and rapid retrieval of key findings. In the second randomised controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0055067-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, paediatricians and trainee paediatricians in private and public practice in Mexico (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;216) were allocated to receive the same clinical recommendation presented using four different grading systems: NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network), GRADE and Oxford CEBM (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine). The primary outcome was mean change (before compared to after reading the guideline) in simulated clinician decision to use a therapy. The findings showed that clinician&#x02019;s decision to use a therapy was influenced most by the GRADE system. However, no significant differences were found between systems in the clarity of presentation of care recommendation (defined as &#x02018;ease of reading and undestanding&#x02019;).</p><p>The qualitative interview (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13) study <xref rid="pone.0055067-Rosenbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> explored health policymakers&#x02019; and managers&#x02019; experiences with short summaries of systematic reviews in five low- and middle-income countries, LMICs (Argentina, China, Colombia, South Africa, Uganda). The findings showed that participants preferred &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats, particularly the section on the &#x02018;relevance of the summaries for LMICs, which compensated for the lack of locally-relevant detail in the original review&#x02019;.</p><p>Overall, observed differences in results across systematic reviews and primary studies examining impacts of evidence presentation formats, including our own, could be explained by differences in: study designs (randomised controlled trials versus user surveys), presentation formats (due to variations in layouts, contents, visual aids), types of participants (multidisciplinary versus unidisciplinary; variations in evidence based behaviors and skills); study contexts (evidence based medicine training versus policymaking environments); definitions of outcome measures (e.g. in Garc&#x000ed;a et al <xref rid="pone.0055067-Garca1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, unlike in other studies, clarity of presentation of recommendation was defined as &#x02018;ease of reading and understanding&#x02019;); and durations of exposure to the evidence summaries. These differences underscore the need for a unified system for evaluating impacts of evidence summary and presentation formats to enhance comparability and interpretation of results of accumulating work in this field.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Implications for Development of Health Systems Guidance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)</title><p>We believe the results of our evaluation provide valuable inputs into methods for summarising and communicating evidence to those charged with formulating recommendations in LMICs. First, there is a need for wider sensitization to the principles of and tools for evidence-informed decision making. We also found our narrative reports, that adapted the GRADE system to synthesize and present evidence on treatment effects and on-the ground (contextual) factors and values that might influence intervention effectiveness, to be liked by busy decision makers. Such narrative reports could be made even more policy-relevant by inclusion of information on wider health systems perspectives such as: potential structural changes needed for effective implementation, equity, feasibility of scaling up and monitoring and evaluation issues. However, current findings could also inform future guideline development work in high-income countries.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Combining a quantitative RCT design with qualitative interviews and using both in our interpretation of data improved our understanding of, and confidence in the study results. Our decision to study multiple tracer-topics rather than focus on a single guideline development topic may be considered a weakness or a strength. Perhaps if participants had only to read the literature provided for one topic, &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats may have proved superior even on the primary outcome. However, in a low-income country setting like ours, it seems unlikely that countries will have the resources in the near future to engage specific panels for meetings for each guideline topic. Thus, we deliberately wished to examine a potentially efficient approach in which the panel considered multiple topics. Finally, although our randomization strategy (stratified by job-type/seniority) may have reduced possible variation in format quality and expertise (within the population enrolled) on the main findings, we cannot rule out the possible influence of these factors on the intended outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Future Research</title><p>Although our findings suggest possible benefits of &#x02018;graded-entry&#x02019; formats, evidence about the best formats for improving actual understanding and use of research findings in decision making processes (a key aim in knowledge translation) appears to be lacking. Thus, further studies are needed to learn more about the relative effectiveness of the various evidence summary formats that are available and how these may be combined with alternative approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>&#x02018;Graded-entry&#x02019; formats were found to improve clarity and accessibility of research evidence, although this was not reflected in the number of correct responses to key clinical questions. Providing a &#x02018;front-end&#x02019; summary of key information linked to locally relevant factors that support implementation, and the full systematic review, may help those developing guidelines access and contextualise research evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0055067.s001"><label>Box S1</label><caption><p>
