The submandibular glands were averted to the submental region in 32 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before they received conventional radiotherapy; a lead block was used to shield the submental region during therapy. Prior to radiotherapy, the function of the submandibular glands was assessed using imaging. Submandibular gland function was measured using 99mTc radionuclide scanning at 60&#x000a0;months after radiotherapy.

Currently, concurrent radiochemotherapy is a mainstay of curative treatment for NPC. Xerostomia is a frequent and relevant side effect for NPC patients after radiation therapy (RT). Xerostomia, although not life-threatening on its own, affects patients&#x02019; quality of life because it causes serious disorders in tasting, chewing, and swallowing, as well as sleeping disorders. After RT, xerostomia can be treated with fluoride, pilocarpine, and some other drugs, but their efficacy is unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Prevention of radiation-induced xerostomia can be achieved by changing the dose-time-splits to improve the biological effects of treatments, such as appropriate RT, intensity-modulated RT and RT plus protective agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; however, most patients will not benefit because of the extra expense entailed in doing this.</p><p>In an effort to prevent radiation-induced xerostomia for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Jha and Seiklay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] first reported on the transfer of the submandibular gland to the submental space, which is an area that can be shielded from radiation without detrimental effects on cure rates in tumors distant from the submental triangle; this approach achieved good results. In a prospective randomized phase III clinical trial, a new way of preventing radiation-induced xerostomia was demonstrated, namely submandibular gland transfer; this was significantly more effective than oral pilocarpine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Based on findings from animal experiments, we transferred the submandibular glands of 32 NPC patients before conventional RT to prevent xerostomia. After a follow-up period of 5&#x000a0;years, it was clear that we had achieved good preventative effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Ethical Committee of the Tumor Hospital of Ganzhou Review Board approved the study protocol (20040311), and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research involving human subjects.

A total of 65 patients with NPC, from March 2004 to August 2006, were randomly divided into two groups; the experimental group consisted of 32 patients and the control group consisted of 33 patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups concerning the general information (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Before RT, the 32 patients in the experimental group underwent unilateral submandibular gland transfer. For those patients with unilateral cervical lymph node metastasis, the contralateral submandibular gland was transferred. For patients with no lymph node metastasis, the contralateral submandibular gland transfer was carried out according to tumor location in the nasopharynx.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>General clinical data for the experimental and control groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Parameters</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Experimental group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">26&#x02013;60<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">23&#x02013;60<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Median age<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">45.6<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">47.8<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Males<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">25<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">24<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Females<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male:female ratio<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3.57:1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2.67:1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" align="left" valign="bottom">Stage<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02009;I<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02009;II<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">13<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02009;III<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">13<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02009;IV<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radiotherapy alone<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">18<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">17<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Concurrent chemoradiotherapy</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">16</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Preoperative examination</title><p>In addition to a special inspection of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the head and neck were examined to check the wetness of the oral mucosa, the saliva pool of the mouth floor, and bilateral submandibular duct saliva secretion in the mouth.

(3) Release of the lower edge of the submandibular gland was accomplished by the following procedure: separation of the digastric belly; location of the facial artery and vein on the edge of the deep surface and their cutoff after double legation; freeing of the posterior pole of the submandibular gland while retaining the facial artery, vein, submandibular ganglion, and the marginal mandible branch of the facial nerve; loosening the edge of the submandibular gland; and freeing the anterior belly of the digastric cutoff region of the mylohyoid muscle (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). (4) The external maxillary artery, vein, and submandibular duct functioned as a pedicle, and the submandibular gland was released and transferred to the submental area of the anterior belly of the digastric deep surface; this was fixed with silver clips around the gland that acted as RT markers (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Approximately 90% of total saliva is produced by the submandibular gland in non-stimulated conditions. The total daily flow of saliva from the submandibular gland is around 200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;ml. A considerable proportion of the saliva is mucus; this contributes to the sensation of oral comfort as a result of the continuous lubrication of the oral mucosa. Saliva also lubricates the mouth during periods of non-eating, and reduces the symptoms of xerostomia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Three major salivary glands are located in the radiation field when NPC patients receive conventional RT, and radiation damage to these glands is permanent. The basic feature of submandibular gland transfer for the prevention of xerostomia is the transfer of the submandibular gland to the submental area. A stopper is set in the submental area, and only approximately 5% of the total radiation dose (30&#x02013;32.5&#x000a0;Gy) is received by the submandibular gland; thus, the submandibular gland remains free from damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, to preserve submandibular gland function, patients with serious damage and lymph node metastasis in region I were not suitable for surgery. In addition, patients who had undergone previous neck surgery and had a history of RT were not suitable for surgery. In the group of 32 patients that received intraoperative cleaning of the 107 lymph nodes, observation of intraoperative rapidly frozen slices and postoperative paraffin biopsy did not reveal metastasis. Consequently, the prerequisite for submandibular gland transfer in patients with NPC was the absence of neck Zone I lymph node metastasis. In the case of cervical lymph node metastasis, the side of the submandibular gland with no lymph node metastasis was transferred. If there was no lymph node metastasis, the contralateral submandibular gland was transferred.</p><p>The key success regarding submandibular gland transfer surgery for the prevention of RT xerostomia lies in patient survival and the sustainability of saliva secretion. In our study, at 60&#x000a0;months after RT, the xerostomia survey results indicated that 26 patients in the control group had varying degrees of xerostomia, with 76.9% of the patients suffering from moderate to severe dry mouth; these results are similar to those reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. At 3&#x000a0;months after RT, the incidence of xerostomia in the experimental group ranged from moderate to severe and was significantly lower than in the control group; with increasing time after RT, their symptoms improved. In the experimental group at 60&#x000a0;months after RT, the average quantity of saliva secretion, checked using submandibular gland radionuclide scintigraphy, was obviously higher than in the control group; there were significant differences between the two groups. In the experimental group, the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia, standard of speech, chewing ability, swallowing ability, changes in eating habits, nighttime xerostomia, need to wake up and drink frequently, sleep quality, and VAS scores were significantly improved relative to the control group. As a result of transfer after RT, the submandibular gland not only survived but also retained a strong secretion function. Thus, submandibular gland transfer was an effective method for preventing xerostomia after RT.</p><p>In NPC patients at 3&#x000a0;months after RT, the experimental group and the control group had no residual lymph nodes, and submandibular gland transfer did not affect the cervical lymph node control rate. There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups regarding the cervical lymph node recurrence rate. Recurrence occurred in Region II but not in Region I. Therefore, submandibular gland transfer did not affect the recurrence rate in the cervical lymph node. There was no significant difference in the 5-year survival rate between the two patient groups and submandibular gland transfer did not affect the 5-year survival rate. Thus, submandibular gland transfer had no effect on the long-term efficacy of NPC treatment using RT. These results are consistent with those of Seikaly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These authors reported that when the submandibular gland was transferred to the submental area of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx during the treatment of malignant tumors using RT, xerostomia did not influence the survival rate or recurrence rate in the lymph nodes of the neck.</p><p>Because the transferred submandibular gland could survive after RT, it retained a strong secretory function and could effectively prevent xerostomia after RT. However, submandibular gland transfer could not fully solve the problem of xerostomia because mild and severe xerostomia still occurred. After 5&#x000a0;years, xerostomia still had an occurrence rate of 15.4%. A number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have shown that when using intensity-modulated RT techniques, the radiation dose delivered to the parotid gland and high-dose irradiation volume can be reduced to protect the functions of the parotid gland. This approach could reduce the degree of xerostomia after RT in NPC patients. Consequently, whether submandibular gland transfer and intensity-modulated RT should be adopted for the protection of the submandibular gland and the prevention of xerostomia after RT in the treatment of NPC requires evaluation in further clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>XMZ and SJL are responsible for the study design.
