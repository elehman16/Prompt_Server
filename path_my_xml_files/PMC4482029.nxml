They can cause blood loss anemia, flea bite and flea allergic dermatitis and they are intermediate hosts of parasites and vectors of bacterial pathogens of zoonotic importance, such as <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic> is generally considered to be the most common flea species parasitizing dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in Greece, <italic>C. canis</italic> has been found to be more prevalent than <italic>C. felis</italic> among dogs admitted to a University Teaching Hospital in the northern part of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recently, when dogs living on dairy goat and sheep farms located in central and southern Greece were examined, the most common flea species found was <italic>Pulex irritans</italic>, followed by <italic>C. canis</italic> and then by <italic>C. felis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Also, a high flea burden has been noticed in some dogs living on sheep farms in central Greece that have been admitted, for various reasons, to the author&#x02019;s University Clinic, probably because no anti-flea interventions had been used on the dogs, the sheep or the environment (unpublished observations).</p><p>Spinosad is a mixture of spinosyns A and D that, after ingestion by the insect during blood meal, targets their nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission, leading to hyperexcitation and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Each dog was combed all over the body with a fine-tooth flea comb for at least 10&#x000a0;min and until no fleas could be recovered for the last minute and all live fleas were captured and counted. The first five fleas were placed in a separate vial with 90&#x000a0;% ethanol for species identification, whereas the remaining fleas were temporarily kept in a zip-closing plastic bag and were returned to the back of the dog at the end of the procedure.

Finally, the prevalence of spinosad-treated dogs with zero flea counts (80-100&#x000a0;%) is similar to that reported after experimental infestation by <italic>C. felis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or <italic>C. canis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in field trials of spinosad alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or spinosad-milbemycin oxime combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, at least for some time points of this study, these figures seem to be higher compared to other field trials testing either spinosad alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or spinosad in combination with an amitraz collar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The separation of the dogs from the flock before flea counting as well as the duration of combing may have led to an overestimation of the percent efficacy of spinosad, of the prevalence of dogs with zero flea counts and/or of the flea count reductions in spinosad-treated dogs. All dogs were removed from the, presumably heavily infested, premises to a nearby open area for at least 4&#x000a0;h before flea counting in order to avoid, as much as possible, infestations by newly-emerged fleas. The 4&#x000a0;h time period was selected based on the results of experimental infestations showing that, due to the fast action of spinosad, a therapeutic efficacy of 80-100&#x000a0;% is anticipated at 4&#x000a0;h, at least for the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after drug administration and because this time is adequate for most newly acquired fleas to a blood meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although the separation from the flock is somehow similar to the movement of household dogs to a research facility for flea counting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], it is logical to assume that spinosad-treated dogs experienced transient flea infestations during their normal daily routine in the farms. The duration of flea combing (at least 10&#x000a0;min and until no fleas were recovered for the last minute) used in the present study was in the range proposed by the recent guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, it cannot be excluded that a lower prevalence of dogs with zero flea counts would have been recorded among spinosad-treated dogs if longer combing periods had been selected, like in some previous field trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the flea counts at the beginning of the present study (geometric mean in group A dogs: 47.14) was higher compared to most previously published field trials of spinosad or spinosad-milbemycin oxime combination (geometric means of spinosad treated dogs: 16.4 to 40.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and this is the only field study where a placebo group has been used. Furthermore, besides the placebo-treated group B dogs, there were additional untreated flea hosts (i.e. sheep) and no environmental control measures were applied. For these reasons, the &#x0003e;98&#x000a0;% efficacy and the 80-100&#x000a0;% prevalence of dogs with zero flea counts throughout this 3-month trial are particularly impressive.</p><p>Three flea species, <italic>P. irritans</italic>, <italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>C. felis</italic>, were recovered from the sheep and there was a clear predominance of <italic>P. irritans</italic> throughout this trial whereas, in a previous study, <italic>P. irritans</italic> was the only species found in sheep living on dairy goat farms in central and southern Greece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Surprisingly, <italic>P. irritans</italic> was not found in any group A or group B dog at day 0, whereas this species has been reported to predominate over <italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>C. felis</italic> when 54 dogs living on dairy goat farms, with or without sheep, were examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This discrepancy may be explained by: a) the absence of goats, which are highly preferred hosts and heavily infested by <italic>P. irritans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], in the three farms of our study; b) temporal differences (the previous study was conducted in June and July whereas the present study started in April); and c) the collection of only 5 fleas per dog (i.e. 6.6-20.1&#x000a0;% of the total flea burden) for species identification which was done in an effort to minimize interference with future flea counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, although it cannot be excluded that some dogs may have been infested by <italic>P. irritans</italic> at the beginning of the trial, it seems that <italic>C. canis</italic> shows a particular preference for these hosts.</p><p>There are two, non-mutually exclusive, explanations for the significant change in favor of <italic>P. irritans</italic> that was witnessed in placebo-treated (group B) dogs during this trial, namely a seasonal effect and an effect of spinosad treatment of group A dogs. At least in goats, the intensity of infestation by <italic>P. irritans</italic> has been shown to increase steadily from May to June [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and if the same applies for the dogs it could explain the increasing relative abundance of this species from the beginning (April) towards the end (July) of the present study. However, the increased relative abundance of <italic>C. canis</italic> in sheep at days 28 and 84 does not seem to be in favor of this explanation. The fast adult flea killing activity of spinosad has a strong negative impact on egg production so that new adult flea emergence progressively declines when all dogs (and obviously other possible hosts) are treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our study, administration of spinosad in some of the dogs in each farm may have reduced the relative abundance of <italic>C. canis</italic>, which was the predominant flea species at day 0, thus leading to an increased relative abundance of <italic>P. irritans</italic>. The observation that this change occurred earlier in farm A (60&#x000a0;% of the dogs received spinosad) than in farm B (50&#x000a0;% of the dogs received spinosad) and even later in farm C (25&#x000a0;% of the dogs received spinosad) is in favor of this explanation.</p><p>Vomiting is the most common adverse reaction of spinosad that has been recorded in both experimental studies and field trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the present study, neither vomiting nor any other adverse reactions were recorded, confirming the high tolerance of this molecule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>When administered at 45&#x02013;69.3&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight every 4&#x000a0;weeks for three times in shepherd dogs living in close proximity to sheep, the efficacy of spinosad for the treatment of infestations by at least two flea species (<italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>C. felis</italic>) and for the prevention of infestations by <italic>P. irritans</italic>, <italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>C. felis</italic> was 98.7&#x000a0;% (arithmetic means) or 99.4&#x000a0;% (geometric means) at 14&#x000a0;days and 100&#x000a0;% thereafter.
