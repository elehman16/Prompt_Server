The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments for biomedical research involving human subjects and the principles of the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The clinical trial was approved by the SFDA (approval No. 2012L01684), and the clinical protocol and the informed consent form were approved by the local ethics committee at Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (approval No. [2012]162). All eligible participants were informed of the aim and risks of the study by the clinical investigators and provided written informed consent before participation.</p><p>Subjects were hospitalized at 10 <sc>pm</sc> the night before the beginning of the study. They were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated table of random numbers, to receive a single 2-mg dose of the test formulation or the reference formulation of repaglinide under fasting condition during Period 1 and the alternate formulation during Period 2. The 2 periods of administration were separated by a 7-day washout period. The test formulation of repaglinide (1 mg; lot No. 120801) was provided by Sichuan Deren Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd (Sichuan, China). The reference formulation of repaglinide (1 mg; lot No. AM70752) was provided by Beijing Novo Nordisk Pharma Co Ltd (Beijing, China).</p><p>During each period, before administration of the drug, an indwelling venous catheter (Becton Dickinson Medical Devices Co, Ltd, Suzhou, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) was placed in a suitable forearm vein, and a 5-mL blood sample was drawn into a vacuum tube with heparin sodium (Tianjin Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory Co, Ltd, Tianjin, People&#x02019;s Republic of China).

The concentration of repaglinide in plasma was measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The LC-MS/MS system was a Shimadzu LC-30AD pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and a SIL-30AC autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to an API QTRAP 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (AB Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The tandem mass spectrometer was operated under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using an electrospray atmospheric pressure ionization source in positive ion mode. The optimized condition consisted of a collision-activated dissociation gas of the medium, a curtain gas of 25 psi, a nebulizer gas of 50 psi, a TurboIonSpray gas of 50 psi, an ionspray voltage of +5500 V, a source temperature of 550&#x000b0;C, and an entrance potential of +10 V for repaglinide and the internal standard (nateglinide). Quantification was operated in MRM of the transitions m/z 453.1 &#x02192; m/z 230.2 for repaglinide, and m/z 318.0 &#x02192; m/z 166.1 for nateglinide.

There were no significant differences between formulations in pharmacokinetic properties in this small, selected, fasting, healthy Chinese male volunteer population. Although the branded repaglinide tablet formulation was already marketed in China, published information regarding the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide and the bioequivalence of these formulations in Chinese populations had never been reported. No significant differences were observed between the 2 oral formulations in terms of pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>The peak plasma concentrations occurred 1.2 to 1.5 hours after single-dose administration of 2 2-mg tablet formulations of repaglinide. Both formulations were apparently readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and repaglinide was measurable at the first sampling time (at 0.25 hour). The mean plasma profiles and bioavailability of the volunteers were similar between the 2 formulations of repaglinide in this single-dose pharmacokinetic analysis.</p><p>In our study, no period or sequence effects for any pharmacokinetic property were found using ANOVA in the healthy Chinese male volunteers. The absence of a sequence effect in both parameters suggests that there was no carryover effect for these 22 subjects. These results indicate that a washout period of 7 days was adequate for total elimination of the drug between the 2 administration periods.</p><p>There are several studies on the clinical pharmacokinetic properties of repaglinide published in the literature. However, most of them have been performed with Western volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies of repaglinide conducted with Asian races have seldom been reported. In a study of pharmacokinetics of a single-dose administration of 2-mg tablet formulations of repaglinide in healthy American volunteers (N = 24), the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide were similar in healthy young adult and elderly subjects. In the study, the AUC for repaglinide was 69.0 ng<sup>&#x02022;</sup>h/mL and C<sub>max</sub> was 47.9 ng/mL.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The T<sub>max</sub> value was 0.8 hour, and the t<sub>1/2</sub> value was 1.0 hour. In another pharmacokinetics study of a single-dose administration of 2-mg tablet formulations of repaglinide carried out in Germans, the AUC for repaglinide was 36.03 ng<sup>&#x02022;</sup>hour/mL and C<sub>max</sub> was 30.96 ng/mL.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The T<sub>max</sub> value was 0.8 hours. Thus, the repaglinide values of C<sub>max</sub> were higher in whites than in our Chinese subjects and the values of T<sub>max</sub> were much lower. However, drug was not administered with water containing glucose and followed by administration of oral glucose solution at specified intervals in the studies performed with Western volunteers. Therefore, additional glucose solution in our study may have resulted in the reduction of C<sub>max</sub>. However, the prolonged T<sub>max</sub> and changed AUC may be attributed to the difference between Asians and whites.</p><p>Repaglinide is first taken up from the blood to hepatocytes by OATP1B1 and then metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, which are genetically polymorphic enzymes. In 1 study in China,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> the results showed that the polymorphism of SLCO1B1 (the encoding gene of the human OATP1B1) has significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide. The SLCO1B1 variants were found to be relatively common in Chinese patients. These frequencies were found to be similar to those observed in healthy Chinese and Japanese individuals, but significantly different from whites and blacks.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The CYP2C8 enzyme, which is another genetic factor effect on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, has been mainly found in Africans (frequency, 0.04&#x02013;0.18) and whites (frequency, 0.10&#x02013;0.23), but such frequencies have not been observed in Asians.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Some studies indicate that there are ethnic differences in the expression levels of adult liver CYP3A mRNAs between Japanese and whites, and that the mechanism regulating the hepatic CYP3A expression may be different between these ethnic groups.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In our study, the intersubject variation in the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide was relatively large. The high intersubject variation maybe explained by the natural interindividual variation in activity of OATP1B1, CYP3A4, and CYP2C8.</p><p>No subject withdrew from our study, and no adverse events were found on analysis of vital signs or laboratory test results. However, the study was limited by its short duration, its inclusion of only healthy male volunteers under fasted conditions, and by its single-dose, open-label design. The mean age of our healthy subjects was 24.2 years (range, 20&#x02013;29 years) and, therefore, the study results cannot be extrapolated to an older population. The results also cannot be used to predict performance in patients in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0070"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our single-dose study found that the test and reference formulations of repaglinide met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence in these fasting, healthy Chinese male volunteers. Both formulations appeared to be well tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>This research was sponsored by Sichuan Deren Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Sichuan, People&#x02019;s Republic of China.
