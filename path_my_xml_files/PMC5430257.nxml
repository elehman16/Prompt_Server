Methods] A total of 18 stroke patients with dysphagia were enrolled in the study. All
participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=9) or a control
group (n=9). All participants performed traditional-swallowing rehabilitation therapy in
30-minute sessions five times a week for four weeks; however, only the experimental group
received expiratory muscle strength training. [Results] Both groups showed significant
improvements after mediation. When compared with the control group, the functional
dysphagia scale, vallecular residue, and penetration-aspiration scale were significantly
improved in the experimental group. [Conclusion] Expiratory muscle strength training is an
effective intervention for impaired swallowing function in acute strike patients with
dysphagia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dysphagia</kwd><kwd>Expiratory muscle strength training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is known to be a common cause of neurological diseases and disorders that cause
swallowing, with incidence of swallowing disorders after stroke reportedly being as high as
30&#x02013;50%<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Swallowing disorders due to stroke increase the risk of death due
to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tracheal aspirations are commonly found in
swallowing disorders; therefore, early prognosis appropriate treatments are important<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Respiratory and swallowing occur by several anatomical structures and provide important
functions associated with airway protection, such as coughing and swallowing action. These
airway-protective actions are initiated by a signal that passes from the medulla oblongata
to the pharynx, larynx, and trachea, and the receptors of the agency signal to training
start by communicating and share the brainstem network called the behavior control
assemblies (BCAs)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke is often
accompanied by a central diaphragmatic dysfunction, with movement disorders caused by stroke
imposing limitations on diaphragmatic motion, which leads to decreased lung volume<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study evaluating the risk of
tracheal aspiration through a quantitative measure of voluntary cough, the maximal
expiratory volume during inspiratory and expiratory airway suction in stroke with aspiration
was reported to be lower than in the normal group<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. As such, the maximum expiratory volume in patients with swallowing
disorders is closely related to tracheal aspiration, which is often used as an indicator to
predict swallowing disorder<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) has consistently been reported as a remedial
approach to swallowing treatment that strengthen muscles associated with swallowing by
exhalation through the oral<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The suprahyoid muscle causes the anterior-superior
movement of the hyoid bone in the swallowing process and facilitates airway protection and
normal swallowing during opening of the cricopharyngeal muscle<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMST is a strength training method that employs
resistance and it is known to effectively improve activation of suprahyoid muscles and
movement of the hyoid bone<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wheeler et al. reported that EMST is an effective way to
induce suprahyoid muscle activation through surface surface electromyography (sEMG)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is reportedly effective in patients
with swallowing disorders caused by decreased movement of the hyoid bone. EMST also has been
reported as an effective method of suprahyoid muscle activation in Huntington&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although EMST is a potential remedial approach for swallowing disorder, it has only been
investigated in the elderly and in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and Huntington&#x02019;s
disease<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, while its effects in stroke patients have yet to be evaluated.
Therefore, in this study, acute stroke patients with dysphagia were monitored and examined
to determine the effects of EMST. The specific purpose of this study was to identify the
effects of EMST on swallowing in acute stroke patients with dysphagia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 18 stroke patients with dysphagia and was performed at I Hospital in

used in this study were approved by Gachon University. Before participation, the procedures,
risks, and benefits were explained and all participants gave their informed consent. The
participants&#x02019; rights were protected according to the guidelines of the Gachon
University.</p><p>All participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=9) or a control
group (n=9). All participants performed traditional swallowing rehabilitation therapy in 30
minute sessions five times a week for four weeks. Expiratory muscle strength training was
only provided to the experimental group in 30 minute sessions. Traditional swallowing
treatment was composed of orofacial exercises, thermal-tactile stimulation, the Mendelson
maneuver, effortful swallow, and supraglottic maneuver. All swallowing treatments were
carried out by the responsible therapists.</p><p>The experimental group was trained using the EMST 150 (Aspire Products LLC., USA). First,
patients were provided with a mouthpiece to blow into, after which the nasal cavity was
closed using forceps. The personal maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) was then measured using
a manometer. Wheeler et al. were trained with a threshold value of 70%, it based on the
personal MEP<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The training consisted of
taking a deep breath and biting a mouthpiece, during which time the patient was told to blow
faster and stronger. Each patient received seven trainings per session, five times a week
for four weeks. Breaks of 30 seconds were provided after one session.</p><p>To evaluate the swallowing function of patients with dysphagia, functional dysphagia scale
(FDS), penetration-aspiration scale (PAS), vallecular residue (VR), and pyriform sinuses
residue (PR) were assessed. The evaluation was conducted by an occupational therapist with
5&#x02005;years of experience with swallowing rehabilitation.</p><p>Functional dysphagia scale (FDS) is a quantification of the degree of swallowing disorder,
and testing to determine the effect of swallowing disorders quantitatively. A score of 0 was
considered normal, while a score of 100 indicated the greatest severity. The inter-rater
reliability of FDS (r=0.59) was also estimated<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) was divided into eight stages depending on laryngeal
penetration and trachea aspiration based on the vocal fold, with a higher stage indicating
increased severity of aspiration<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also
PAS after swallowing the food, the score is determined by the presence or absence of
invasion or aspiration of food comes out through coughing. The inter-rater reliability of
the PAS was 0.911<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vallecular and
pyriform sinuses residue was divided into 0&#x02013;3 grades, with higher grades indicating greater
swallowing dysfunction. Specifically, Grade 0 indicating no residue, grade 1 indicated 25%
or less, grade 2 indicated 25&#x02013;50%, and grade 3 was more than 50%<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 18.0. The differences between
before and after intervention were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and differences

stroke patients. The experimental group showed a significant improvement in all evaluated
factors, while the control group showed a significant improvement in all factors except
pyriform sinuses residue. Comparison between groups revealed significant improvements in the
FDS, VR, and PAS in the experimental group relative to the control group. These results
provide evidence that EMST improves the swallowing function of patients with acute
stroke.</p><p>In this study, the resistance level of EMST was 70%. Yoon et al. reported laryngeal lift
and pharyngeal residue and a significant improvement in the pharyngeal transit time of food
when applying 75% EMST resistance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These findings are consistent with the decreased vallecular residue observed in the present
study. In this study, pyriform sinuses residue did not differ between groups. It is believed
that the pyriform sinuses residue is related to upper esophageal sphincter opening, which is
caused by a hyolaryngeal excursion to pull forward the hyoid bone and posterior contraction
of the longitudinal pharyngeal muscle<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, this study did not measure changes in the upper esophageal sphincter opening.</p><p>In this study, intervention of EMST was carried out for four weeks. Pitts et al. was
reported reduced aspiration applied to Parkinson&#x02019;s patients over a four-week EMST<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, while Troche et al. reported a
significant reduction in aspiration following EMST for four weeks<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, the present study confirmed the effectiveness
of EMST for four weeks at reducing aspiration and vallecular residue, as well as improving
FDS, which is similar to the results of previous studies.</p><p>Reduced respiratory function is commonly observed in stroke patients<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, acute stroke patients in need of intensive
rehabilitation will be feel fatigue easily during aerobic exercise. Moreover, problems due
to fatigue will have adverse effects on quality of life and interfere with functional
recovery. Accordingly, EMST training has the potential to improve respiratory function, as
well as swallowing disorders, thereby improving overall treatment of stroke patients.</p><p>It should be noted that this study had several limitations. Specifically, it targeted only
18 stroke patients that met the selection criteria. Moreover, the total study did not
evaluate a long period of time. Accordingly, future long-term studies of more patients are
needed. In conclusion, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of EMST
intended for patients with acute stroke on swallowing. The results revealed that EMST may
have a positive effect on the swallowing of acute stroke patients.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kidd</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Nesbitt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et
