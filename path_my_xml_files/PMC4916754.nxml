There are a number of advantages of this technique including reduced pain and bleeding, shorter recovery time and hospital stay, and over all reduced healthcare costs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The type of pain after laparoscopic surgery differs considerably from that occurs after laparotomy. Usually patients experience diffuse pain in abdomen, back and shoulder.</p><p>Pain intensity usually peaks during the first postoperative period and usually declines over the following 2-3 days.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Pain after laparoscopic surgery results from the stretching of the intra-abdominal cavity,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] peritoneal inflammation and phrenic nerve irritation caused by residual carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the peritoneal cavity. Pain can prolong hospital stay and lead to increased morbidity. Intraperitoneal injections of local anaesthetic have been proposed to minimize postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist provides sedation, anxiolysis, analgesia and sympatholysis. Dexmedetomidine has become one of the frequently used drugs in anaesthesia due to its hemodynamic, sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, neuroprotective and anaesthetic sparing effect. High selectivity of dexmedetomidine to &#x003b1;<sub>2-</sub> receptors has been exploited in regional anaesthesia practice.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the antinociceptive effect of intraperitoneal application of bupivacaine and bupivacaine in combination with dexmedetomidine after laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval from Institutional Ethics Committee 100 patients posted for laproscopic surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled for the study. Inclusion criteria: patients belonging to American Society of Anaesthesioly (ASA) I and II, age between 25 to 60 years, elective laproscopic surgeries. The patients with previous abdominal surgery, drug allergy, cardiac patients, significant pulmonary diseases and leaving intra-abdominal drain at the end of the surgery were excluded from the study. In the operating room (OR) intravenous (IV) line was secured. Inj. Ringer Lactate infusion started with 8 ml/kg patients were premedicated with Inj. Glycopyrrolate 4 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v., Inj Ranitidine 50 mg i.v., Inj. Ondansetron 4 mg i.v.</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG), saturation of oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and non invasive blood pressure were monitored. All the patients received fentanyl in dose of 1.5 mg/kg i.v. Anaesthesia induction done with sodium thiopentone 4-6 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5-2 mg/kg i.v to facilitate intubation. All patients were intubated with appropriate sized oral cuffed endotracheal tube. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture (50:50) with sevoflurane. Ventilation is adjusted to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 36-42 mm of Hg. Pneumoperitoneum pressure was kept between 8-12 mm of Hg throughout the surgery. Vecuronium was used to maintain intraoperative neuromuscular blockade. Intravenous 75 mg diclofenac sodium was given intraoperatively in all patients. Intraoperative pulse, mean blood pressure (MBP), SpO<sub>2</sub> and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were monitored. Complete revisions of haemostasis were confirmed before the intraperitoneal instillation of the drug.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated (using table of randomization) into two equal sized groups (<italic>N</italic> = 50):</p><p>Group (B): Intraperitoneal 50 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (125 mg)</p><p>Group (B+D): Intraperitoneal 50 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (125 mg) + 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine</p><p>The drugs were prepared and given to the investigators who were blind to the identity of drugs.</p><p>In the two study groups, at the end of surgery, intraperitoneal instillations were guided by the camera on the surgical site and under both the copulae of the diaphragm. The intensity of the pain was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) at 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h. Where zero score corresponds to 'no pain' and 10 corresponds to the 'maximum' or 'worst pain'. Rescue analgesia in the form of inj. diclofenac sodium AQ 75 mg i.v. Total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h postoperatively and occurrence of nausea, vomiting and sedation were also recorded.</p><p>Results were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

There are numerous arguments for a procedure-specific assessment of the evidence of analgesia treatment after laparoscopic surgery. Postoperative pain is reduced more speedily compared with open traditional surgeries, but effective analgesic treatment after laparoscopic surgeries have remained a clinical challenge. The patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery tend to expect a painless postoperative period because of common beliefs about this type of surgery. Pain is the main reason for staying overnight in the hospital on the day of surgery and pain is the dominant complaint and the primary reason for prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic surgery. So, it is an essential task to provide adequate postoperative analgesia. For that we can use various analgesics (opioids and nonopioids) via various routes, for example oral, intravenous, neuraxial blockade and intraperitoneal instillation. In addition, growing evidence suggests that the treatment of postoperative pain should be multimodal and opioid sparing to accelerate recovery and avoid potential side effects.</p><p>Pain is a highly personal experience a subjective sensation or emotion and it may be estimated by VAS score.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a 10-cm horizontal line labelled as 'no pain' at one end and 'worst pain imaginable' on the other end. The patient was asked to mark on this line where the intensity of pain lies. The distance from 'no pain' to the patient's mark numerically quantifies the pain. The VAS is a simple and efficient method that correlates well with other reliable method.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The rationale for intraperitoneal administration of drugs for the treatment of the pain that follows laparoscopic surgery is that the small incisions at the abdominal wall cause visceral component of the pain and shoulder pain. With this in mind, many authors have tried to diminish pain via the peritoneal route. Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic is likely to blockade free afferent nerve endings in peritoneum. Systemic absorption of local anaesthetic from the peritoneal cavity may also play a part in reduced nociception although this would be expected to occur after any local anaesthetic technique.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, postoperative VAS score was observed up to 24 h. There was statistically significant difference in VAS score between two groups after 12 h that was lower when dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine. Similar results were observed with study done by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] who compared the antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine or meperidine with bupivacaine to bupivacaine alone intraperitoneally after the laparoscopic gynaecological surgery found that intraperitoneal instillation of meperidine or dexmedetomidine in combination with bupivacaine significantly decreases VAS score.</p><p>Bakhamees <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] evaluated the patients who received dexmedetomidine and found that they had less VAS score as compared to placebo in the postoperative period. Ahmed Mostafa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] observed that the patients who received intraperitoneal levobupivacaine instillation had profound postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Our study results also show that the duration of analgesia was higher and had less need of rescue analgesia in bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine group as compared to bupivacaine alone which were statistically significant.</p><p>Also Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] observed that intraperitoneal instillation of meperidine or dexmedetomidine in combination with bupivacaine significantly decreases total rescue analgesia requirement in postoperative period. Rajni Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared postoperative analgesia with intraperitoneal bupivacaine and fentanyl with bupivacaine after laparoscopic surgery and observed that there is decrease total analgesics consumption in fentanyl with bupivacaine group.</p><p>Arain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and morphine administered through intravenous route for postoperative analgesia after a major surgery. They found that dexmedetomidine patients group had better pain control compared to morphine patients group postoperatively. Bakhamees <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] observed the patients who received dexmedetomidine had less postoperative analgesia demand (morphine) as compared to placebo in postoperative period.</p><p>In our study, there is decrease in heart rate in groups B+D due to the effect of dexmedetomidine on heart; our results were comparable with the study done by Bhattacharjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who compared the effects of dexmedetomidine on haemodynamics in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They found postoperatively significant decrease in heart rate in dexmedetomidine group than saline group. Similar findings were observed in study done by Arain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who studied the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and morphine for postoperative analgesia after a major surgery. They concluded that there is significant decrease in heart rate in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in dexmedetomidine group than morphine group.</p><p>Arain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] studied the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and morphine for postoperative analgesia after a major surgery. Bhattacharjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] concluded that dexmetedomedine improves intra and post operative hemodynamic stability during laproscopic surgeries without prolongation of recovery and similar results were obtained by Bakhamees <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>9]</sup></p><p>In our study, among group B patients, nausea/vomiting was found in 3 patients out of 50 patients and 4 patients out of 50 patients in groups B+D that is comparable to a study done by Bhakhamees <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the incidence of shoulder pain was significantly low in groups B+D compared to group B. We found that in group B 6 patients out of 50 patients and in groups B+D, 2 patients out of 50 patients had postoperative shoulder pain that is comparable to the study done by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intraperitoneal instillation of dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine [50 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (125 mg) + 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine] through ports produces prolonged duration of postoperative analgesia and less requirement of rescue analgesics in postoperative period compared to that with bupivacaine alone [intraperitoneal 50 mL bupivacaine 0.25% (125 mg)].
