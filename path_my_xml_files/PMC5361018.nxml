training employing the bracing method on the trunk control and balance of stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 46 stroke patients whose strokes had occurred six
months or more prior to the study. The subjects were divided into two groups. One group
underwent upper extremity task training with symmetric abdominal muscle contraction
(bracing) applied. The other group simply underwent upper extremity task training, without
bracing. [Results] The experimental group&#x02019;s Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) significantly
increased after the intervention, whereas the control group did not see any significant
difference. There was significant improvement in balance after the intervention in both
the experimental group and the control group. According to the between-group comparisons,
the improvements in the experimental group were significantly greater in the control
group, except in the Postural Assessment Scale (PASS). [Conclusion] Based on the results
of this study, upper extremity task exercises with symmetric abdominal muscle contraction,
conducted as part of adult hemiplegic patients&#x02019; trunk stabilization exercises, can be
applied to a diverse range of hemiplegic patients and implemented as an exercise program
after discharge from hospital.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Abdominal muscle</kwd><kwd>Trunk stability</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a central nervous system disease that has a serious impact on individuals&#x02019;
lives<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Depending on the lesion area,
strokes cause diverse and complex functional disabilities, including decreased motor
function, sensory loss, and impaired balance ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients also experience
restricted performance of the functional motions necessary for ordinary life, and reduced

muscle strength and endurance are very important<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The abdominal and trunk muscles maintain the stability of the lower
trunk, and they are important for trunk movement and motor control<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dickstein et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated the significance of trunk muscles by verifying a
decrease in anticipatory postural adjustments in hemiplegic patients compared to healthy
subjects, based on a comparison of left and right trunk muscle onset time through movement
of the upper and lower extremities. Therefore, to improve the abilities of chronic stroke
patients, it is important to ensure functioning postural stability during movement training.
This requires activation of the trunk muscles. A representative technique for achieving this
is the bracing method. Bracing involves stabilizing the trunk by increasing internal
abdominal pressure through the action activation of 29 pairs of deep and superficial
muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study
examined the effects of upper extremity task training with the bracing method applied on
trunk adjustment ability and balance in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>As subjects, this study selected 46 non-traumatic hemiplegic stroke patients in at R, H,
and B hospitals whose onset of stroke had occurred at least six months earlier. All
demonstrated an understanding of the experimental process before they agreed to participate
in the experiment. (All scored at least 24 on the Korean version of the mini-mental state
examination.) They were able to sit unassisted for five minutes or longer without special
equipment. The subjects were able to understand and follow the therapist&#x02019;s directions and
had no other neurological problems (vision, hearing, other senses) or orthopedic damage

All protocols were approved by the University of Daejeon. Before
participation, the procedures, risks, and benefits were explained to the participants, who
gave informed consent. Participant rights were protected according to the guidelines of the
University of Daejeon.</p><p>The subjects of the experimental group (upper extremity task-training group with symmetric
abdominal muscle contraction) received upper extremity task training while maintaining
symmetric abdominal muscle contraction (referred to here as &#x0201c;bracing&#x0201d;). They made brief &#x0201c;ch&#x0201d;
sounds while they concurrently contracted left and right and forward and backward trunk
muscles isometrically for five seconds as if force was given to the abdomen reflexively, and
while maintaining hallow respiration. The subjects also engaged in upper extremity task
training.</p><p>The control group (general upper extremity task-training group) received upper extremity
task training. During the training, each subject sat on a chair with the back. They flexed
the hip, knee, and ankle joints of both lower extremities by 90 degrees and placed both feet
on the floor. They were instructed to utilize only the paretic upper extremity and were
assisted in the movement so that they did not exert compensatory strategies. Six numbered
tasks were performed in sequence for five to six minutes. The order and duration of the
tasks were adjusted according to the subject&#x02019;s function. For example, subjects who showed
good function in one task were asked to stop and move on to the next task. If they were not
able to perform the next task due to poor function, they performed the previous task for an
extended amount of time.</p><p>The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) and Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) were
utilized to evaluate subjects&#x02019; postures and assess balance. The Balance Performance Monitor
(BPM) was employed and BioRescue software (AP 1153 RM Ingenierie, Rodez, France) was
utilized to evaluate static balance ability and limit of stability (LOS).</p><p>PASW Statistics 18.0 for Windows (IBM/SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all
statistical analyses performed in this study. The general characteristics of each group were
analyzed using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and an independent t-test. To compare differences in
pre- and post-training results between the two groups over time, an independent samples
t-test was utilized. To determine the statistical significance of data over time within each
group, a paired t-test was employed. A statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05 for
all data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>A comparison of postural assessment scale for stroke, trunk impairment scale

contraction as a method of improving postural adjustment in adult hemiplegic patients and
examined its effect on postural adjustment. The pre- and post-exercise values of TIS scores
were significantly different in both groups, and a significant difference was seen between
the two groups. A study by Allison et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> featuring bracing-assisted trunk stabilization exercises showed
heightened activity of the trunk muscles and improved trunk function, which is consistent
with the results of the present study. The stroke postural evaluation scores of both groups
increased, but no significant difference was seen between them. This is consistent with a
study of sub-acute state patients by Benaim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, which showed that a short intervention period of six weeks
resulted in no significant difference. In the static balance test, significant differences
were seen within both groups in pre- and post-exercise results, as well as in the scores
between the two groups. This is consistent with the results of research by Brown et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, which show that short muscle contraction
initiation times enabled anticipatory postural adjustments, and that postural adjustment
affected balance. In the LOS test, both groups saw significant differences in pre- and
post-exercise results; a significant difference was also seen between the results of the two
groups after the exercise. Hodge and Richardson<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> report that intervention in the deep abdominal muscles through
trunk stabilization exercises was more effective than other forms of exercise in achieving
improved movement of the four limbs and postural adjustment ability; this is consistent with
the present study&#x02019;s results. The limitations of this study were the short intervention
period of six weeks and the small number of experimental participants satisfying selection
criteria. Based on the results of this study, upper limb task training with symmetric
abdominal muscle contraction, applied as part of trunk stabilization exercises in adult
hemiplegic patients, may be applied to diverse hemiplegic patients in the clinical field and
be implemented as an exercise program for them after discharge from hospital.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Deajeon University research fund (2015).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Warlow</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gijn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dennis</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group>: Stroke: practical management, 3rd ed.
