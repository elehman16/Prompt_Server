In 2011, there were 366 million people with diabetes globally, a figure projected to rise to 552 million by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The human and economic burden of illness associated with type 2 diabetes contributes significantly to ill health, disability and premature death, and is further exacerbated by the onset of micro- and macrovascular complications. Thus, there is a need to develop safe, effective and sustainable population-based prevention and management strategies that collectively improve multiple risk factors associated with this disease.</p><p>Lifestyle modification combining energy restriction, weight loss and physical activity remains the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While a reduction in body weight and improvements in glycaemic control have been observed following energy restriction and aerobic or endurance activity, a concomitant loss in muscle mass can also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Skeletal muscle is critical for people with type 2 diabetes, as it is the largest mass of insulin-sensitive tissue and the predominant reservoir for glucose disposal. Losses in muscle mass can negatively impact metabolic rate, compound the problems of insulin resistance and lead to reduced physical function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, current international consensus exercise guidelines recommend that progressive resistance training (PRT) be incorporated into the overall physical activity plan for people with type 2 diabetes, owing to its positive effects on muscle mass and glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, our previous research has demonstrated that high-intensity PRT is safe and effective for improving glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels and lean tissue mass in older adults with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This work led to the development of a national community-based PRT programme, entitled <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]<italic>,</italic> with the goal of providing greater access for adults with, or at risk, of type 2 diabetes, to participate in an evidence-based PRT programme within existing community health and fitness centres through the development of a network of accredited providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since nutritional management is also an important component in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, combining PRT with dietary modification may offer a synergistic and incremental effect on glycaemic control as well as body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors. While the optimal macronutrient composition of the diet for the management of type 2 diabetes remains uncertain, emerging evidence suggests that there are health benefits associated with high-protein diets in overweight and obese adults and those with type 2 diabetes. For instance, a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials ranging from 4 to 24&#x000a0;weeks reported that high-protein diets had beneficial effects on weight loss and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and tended to reduce blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes, with no adverse effects on blood lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite these positive findings, dietary studies controlling for macronutrient composition are often difficult to implement in the &#x02018;real-world&#x02019;, as they require an individual to follow a prescribed meal plan, and adherence often relies on self-reported dietary intake. Therefore, the addition of a protein supplement might be a more practical and effective approach, as it does not require individuals to make marked changes in their usual dietary habits. This approach was used in a study of overweight and obese adults and showed that a daily intake of greater than 30% energy from protein achieved through a whey-protein supplement, compared with a diet containing approximately 16% of energy from protein through habitual intake, was more effective for improving lipid levels and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Importantly, energy intakes remained similar between the groups throughout the study, and there was no effect of the intervention on body composition. A number of other short-term studies have also reported that whey-protein has insulinotropic properties that can improve insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In non-diabetic adults, there is compelling evidence that ingestion of whey-protein soon after exercise can augment the anabolic benefits of PRT on muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While there is still ongoing research into defining whether there is an optimal dose of protein needed to elicit a synergistic skeletal muscle response with PRT, particularly in older adults, several recent studies and reviews have recommended that 20 to 40&#x000a0;g of high-quality, rapidly digested, leucine-rich protein, such as whey-protein, be consumed soon after each bout of PRT to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Given that skeletal muscle is the primary site of glucose disposal, and is highly responsive to exercise as a stimulus to increase glucose uptake, we hypothesize that combining PRT with whey-protein might represent an optimal strategy to enhance muscle hypertrophy and glycaemic control, and improve cardiometabolic risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>There are also other lifestyle factors that might have beneficial effects on skeletal muscle. For instance, there is mounting evidence that treatment with vitamin D can have positive effects on muscle, including strength and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels might also play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with reports that vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired &#x003b2;-cell function, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although the findings from randomized controlled trials examining the effects of supplemental vitamin D, alone or with calcium, on measures of glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and secretion have been inconclusive, there is some evidence for a beneficial effect in adults with or at increased risk of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are also reports that vitamin D might have anti-inflammatory properties, particularly in people with various pathological conditions, such as type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This is important because chronic low-grade inflammation has been linked to accelerated muscle loss and has emerged as the common denominator linking type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While the optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration for muscle and health benefits remains hotly debated, we hypothesize that vitamin D treatment combined with whey-protein supplementation and PRT will be more effective for improving glycaemic control, body composition and various inflammatory and cardiovascular risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes than PRT alone.</p><p>The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine whether a community-based PRT programme combined with additional whey-protein and vitamin D can promote greater improvements in glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity than PRT alone in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Secondary aims of the study are to assess the effects of the intervention on changes in: (1) total body and regional lean tissue mass and fat mass, thigh muscle cross-sectional area and muscle density (as a surrogate measure of intramuscular fat infiltration), muscle strength and functional performance; (2) cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure and blood lipid levels, (3) levels of adipokines and inflammatory markers, and (4) quality of life and cognitive function. In addition, we will examine whether changes in lean tissue mass, muscle size, density and strength and a reduction in metabolic or inflammatory markers are predictive of any exercise-induced improvements in glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a 6-month, two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Participants with confirmed type 2 diabetes will be asked to participate in a structured PRT programme, based on the community-based <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme, and randomly allocated to receive either a whey-protein powdered drink plus vitamin D supplements, or no additional powder or supplements. A matched placebo powder was deemed inappropriate for this trial, as the use of food additives, such as maltodextrin, has the potential to influence the outcome measures (for example, glycaemic control). The selection of a two-arm design (for example, the lack of a true &#x02018;non-exercise&#x02019; control arm) is consistent with our primary research aim, which seeks to examine whether whey-protein plus vitamin D can enhance the health benefits of PRT in older adults with type 2 diabetes. The trial is managed by the Centre for Physical Activity and Nutrition Research at Deakin University, Burwood, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia and is funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant (ID1046269). The study has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2013&#x02013;050), and is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000592741).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Men and women aged 50 to 75&#x000a0;years with established type 2 diabetes, treated with diet alone or any oral hypoglycaemic agents (except insulin), will be invited to participate in the study.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants living in the Melbourne metropolitan and surrounding areas in Victoria, Australia with type 2 diabetes will be recruited into the study via state and local media campaigns, including newspaper and radio advertisements, flyers, web-based media and word of mouth. This will be further supplemented with letters sent to local doctors, endocrinologists, pharmacists, diabetic educators and support groups, asking them to place advertisements in their facilities and inviting them to refer patients with type 2 diabetes to the study. A letter will also be sent to participants with type 2 diabetes who are registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme, which is an initiative of the Australian Government administered by Diabetes Australia, to participate in the trial. All participants who express an interest in the study will undergo screening to determine their eligibility to participate in the trial based on the outlined criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Screening and eligibility</title><p>Eligibility for the study will be based on a two-step screening process. First, all participants will be screened via a telephone questionnaire and ineligibility will be based on the following criteria: (1) HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;10%; (2) current or prior participation in a structured PRT programme &#x0003e;1 session per week or moderate-intensity physical activity &#x02265;150&#x000a0;min/week in the previous 3&#x000a0;months; (3) vitamin D or calcium supplement use &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;IU/day and &#x0003e;600&#x000a0;mg/day, respectively, in the previous 3&#x000a0;months; (4) severe orthopaedic, cardiovascular or respiratory conditions that would preclude participation in an exercise programme, or those with absolute contraindications to exercise, according to American College of Sports Medicine guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; (5) renal impairment (eGFR &#x0003c;45&#x000a0;ml/(min 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>)) or disease; (6) regular use of protein supplements; (7) conditions that may affect vitamin D or calcium metabolism; (8) current smoker, or (9) body mass index &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Participants will be encouraged and monitored to keep constant throughout the study any use of lipid-lowering or anti-hypertensive medication and not modify their lifestyle habits other than necessary for the study. To increase the external validity of the study and because of a lack of consensus with regard to the optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration for health benefits, vitamin D status will not be an inclusion or exclusion criterion but will be assessed as part of the biochemical analysis. Data from the 1999 to 2000 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study, involving more than 11,000 Australians, indicates that 89% of adults with type 2 diabetes had insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (&#x0003c;75&#x000a0;nmol/l) and 55% were vitamin D deficient (&#x0003c;50&#x000a0;nmol/l) (RMD, unpublished observation). Participants who pass the initial telephone screening will be required to obtain approval from their local doctor to clear them of any contraindicated medical conditions to exercise, based on American College of Sports Medicine guidelines, to participate in the programme. Participants will also be asked to provide a fasted, morning blood sample to confirm that their HbA<sub>1c</sub> level is &#x0003c;10%. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to commencing the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Following completion of baseline testing, participants will be randomized, stratified by sex and diabetes treatment (diet or oral hypoglycaemic agents), in blocks of four using a computer-generated random number sequence by an independent researcher. All research staff involved in the assessments will be blinded to the group allocation. The programme coordinator will be solely responsible for the distribution of the protein powder and vitamin D supplements.

The <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme is a structured, evidence-based PRT programme that is designed for people with, or at risk, of developing type 2 diabetes. It has been developed from a series of previous laboratory and community-based exercise intervention studies demonstrating that PRT is safe and effective for improving glycaemic control and body composition in people with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The programme will consist of moderate to high-intensity PRT (three sets of eight to ten repetitions at a weight that cannot be lifted for more than eight to ten repetitions) involving dynamic concentric and eccentric contractions targeting all the major muscle groups and with an emphasis on weekly progressive overload (increments of 2 to 10%). Participants will train twice a week for the first 8&#x000a0;weeks, and three times weekly for the remainder of the programme. Training sessions will last 45 to 60&#x000a0;minutes and will be supervised by qualified trainers (accredited exercise physiologists, physiotherapists and experienced Certificate IV personal trainers). All participants enrolled in the study will be charged a fee by each local provider to undertake the 24-week programme, at a cost of approximately Australian $5 to $13 per session, but will be eligible for reimbursement up to the value of Australian $240 at the completion of the study based on their level of exercise compliance (for example, 80% compliance will equate to a $192 rebate).</p><p>The 24-week <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> PRT programme is divided into three phases (bronze, silver, gold), each 8&#x000a0;weeks in duration. During the initial phase (bronze), participants receive education on the benefits of the programme, safety and correct exercise techniques and are asked to attend two supervised exercise sessions per week. After 8&#x000a0;weeks, all programmes will be reviewed and a new customized programme will be designed for each participant (silver), but with the aim of participating in one additional unsupervised exercise session to achieve the goal of three PRT sessions per week. The final 8-week phase (gold) is a replication of the previous phase with a new customized and progressively challenging programme. Throughout the programme, all completed exercises, sets and repetitions for each session will be recorded on <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> exercise cards, to monitor progression and compliance. Further details of the programme, including examples of the exercises and intensity prescribed, have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>One of the challenges when implementing exercise programmes in community settings is that of enhancing adoption and adherence to these programmes. At the foundation of <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> and central to its success are individually tailored PRT programmes and supervised training sessions. The supervised sessions serve two purposes. First, the programme aims to emulate the level of attention received by participants in the previous trials on which the exercise guidelines and <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme are based. Second, previous research demonstrates that unsupervised training is less effective in translating to health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Exercise programmes prescribed as part of the <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme are individually tailored, so comorbidities or complications (for example, knee osteoarthritis) can be taken into consideration with exercises appropriately modified on a case-by-case basis. Further, to enhance compliance and retention, all participants will receive monthly follow-up phone calls, and will be eligible to receive a reimbursement (as indicated previously) to cover the costs associated with their participation in the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Whey-protein drink and vitamin D supplementation</title><p>Participants randomized to the protein and vitamin D group will receive a 3-month supply of a whey-protein enriched powder and vitamin D supplements at their baseline testing appointment and again after 12&#x000a0;weeks. The protein powder will be provided in a single-use sachet form (OmniBlend, Campbellfield, Victoria, Australia). Participants will be instructed to add 150&#x000a0;ml of cold water to a calibrated &#x02018;shake-and-take&#x02019; container and then add one sachet (powder) containing 20&#x000a0;g of whey-protein concentrate 80%, containing approximately 2.4&#x000a0;g of leucine, to the water, close the lid and shake vigorously for at least ten shakes and consume immediately. Participants will be instructed to consume one drink every morning before breakfast and one drink within two hours of each PRT session. Thus, they will consume a total of seven drinks per week, with an extra drink on each of the two training days during the first 8&#x000a0;weeks. This will increase to ten drinks per week when participants move to three sessions per week. This will raise the total supplemental protein dose from 20&#x000a0;g on non-training days to 40&#x000a0;g on training days. Each protein drink will provide approximately 335&#x000a0;kJ of energy, 2&#x000a0;g of lactose, 1&#x000a0;g of fat and 5&#x000a0;g of fibre. Participants will also be asked to take two 1000&#x000a0;IU capsules of Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Ostelin, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) every evening for the duration of the study. The goal of vitamin D treatment is to raise serum 25(OH)D concentrations to at least 75&#x000a0;nmol/l. All supplements and the protein powder will be provided free of charge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>A summary of the proposed outcome measures is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Participants will attend Deakin University twice throughout the duration of the study for assessment (at baseline and after 24&#x000a0;weeks), with an intermediary assessment of anthropometry, muscle strength, physical and cognitive function and repeat questionnaires conducted on-site at each health and fitness centre after 12&#x000a0;weeks. With the exception of the fasted blood sample collection, which will occur at local pathology clinics at baseline, 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks, and the intermediary assessment, all other outcome measures will be assessed within the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences at Deakin University, Burwood, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

A peripheral quantitative computed tomography scanner (XCT 3000, Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) will be used to measure muscle cross-sectional area, subcutaneous fat cross-sectional area and muscle density, as a surrogate measure of intermuscular adiposity, at the 25% femur site using methods previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Briefly, after performing a scout view of the distal end of the femur, scans will be taken at the 4% and 25% position of the femur. The slice thickness will be 2.3&#x000a0;mm, and the voxel size will be set at 0.3&#x000a0;mm at a scanning speed of 10&#x000a0;mm/s. Subcutaneous fat cross-sectional area will be determined by selecting the area with thresholds -40 to +40&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>3</sup> hydroxyapatite density (contour mode 3, peel mode 1), and the muscle cross-sectional area will be determined by subtracting the total bone cross-sectional area (threshold, 280&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>3</sup>; contour mode 1, peel mode 2) and subcutaneous fat cross-sectional area from the total area of the distal femur (threshold, -40&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>3</sup>, contour mode 3, peel mode 1). For consistency, all analysis of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography will be undertaken by a single investigator. The short-term coefficient of variation for repeated measurements of total body lean mass and fat mass in our laboratory ranges from 1.0% to 1.7%.

HbA<sub>1c</sub> will be assessed by cation exchange HPLC using a Bio-Rad VARIANT II turbo HbA<sub>1c</sub> kit-2.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Fasting plasma glucose will be assessed using the hexokinase method (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Levels of C-peptide will be assessed using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and of high sensitivity C-reactive protein by an Immunoturbidimetric assay from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany).

Prior to the three-repetition maximum muscle strength test, participants will complete a 5-minute warm-up on an exercise bike. To determine the three-repetition maximum strength, each participant will initially perform a warm-up set of eight to ten repetitions with a light load. After successful completion of a further six to eight repetitions at a heavier weight selected by the instructing researcher and following a brief rest (&#x02248;2 to 3&#x000a0;minutes), the workload will be increased incrementally until only three repetitions with correct technique can be completed. For each participant, the formula employed by Wathen <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] will be used to calculate each participant&#x02019;s leg and back one-repetition maximum strength. In addition, isometric knee extensor strength will be measured on the participant&#x02019;s dominant leg using Lord&#x02019;s strap assembly, incorporating a strain gauge (Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia). Participants will have one practice trial followed by two maximal tests with a 60&#x000a0;second rest between each test.

This is important because most current lifestyle approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes focus on general physical activity (typically aerobic training) and calorie restriction to manage body weight. While such approaches have been shown to improve glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipid levels and reduce weight and fat mass, they are often associated with a loss in lean tissue (muscle) mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that skeletal muscle is the largest mass of insulin-sensitive tissue and the predominant reservoir for glucose disposal, there is a need to develop, evaluate and disseminate approaches that are safe and effective for optimizing muscle mass as well as glycaemic control and other cardiometabolic related risk factors in people with this disease, particularly older adults with type 2 diabetes who experience an accelerated loss in muscle mass with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>Progressive resistance training is one strategy that is now widely recommended for people with type 2 diabetes because of its beneficial effects on muscle mass, glycaemic control and other cardiometabolic risk factors that contribute to the development of diabetes and its complications. In non-diabetic adults, there is a growing body of evidence that post-exercise ingestion of a protein-rich source, such as whey-protein, can maximize the anabolic benefits of PRT on muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that supplementation with vitamin D can have beneficial effects on muscle and measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, this study will provide new information as to whether combining PRT with additional protein and vitamin D can promote a synergistic and incremental effect on glycaemic control, muscle mass and cardiometabolic risk factors compared with PRT alone in older adults with type 2 diabetes. If successful, this study will broaden the knowledge base and contribute to best practice guidelines on exercise and nutrition for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, along with the ongoing refinement of community-based initiatives for the management of this condition. In addition, the findings from this study will provide evidence to inform policy and translational activities of the existing community-based <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme, which is currently implemented throughout Australia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is currently underway and a number of participants have commenced the study.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2014_2296_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>25(OH)D</term><def><p>25-hydroxyvitamin D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p>estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA<sub>1c</sub></term><def><p>glycated haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOMA</term><def><p>homeostatic model assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLC</term><def><p>high performance liquid chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-1&#x003b2;</term><def><p>interleukin-1&#x003b2;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p>interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-8</term><def><p>interleukin-8</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-10</term><def><p>interleukin-10</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRT</term><def><p>progressive resistance training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>DM is employed by Fitness Australia, who are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the <italic>Lift for Life&#x000ae;</italic> programme.
