We aimed to assess the effects on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of walking down a busy street with high levels of pollution compared with walking in a traffic-free area with lower pollution levels in older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised, crossover study, we recruited men and women aged 60 years and older with angiographically proven stable ischaemic heart disease or stage 2 Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD who had been clinically stable for 6 months, and age-matched healthy volunteers. Individuals with ischaemic heart disease or COPD were recruited from existing databases or outpatient respiratory and cardiology clinics at the Royal Brompton &#x00026; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and age-matched healthy volunteers using advertising and existing databases. All participants had abstained from smoking for at least 12 months and medications were taken as recommended by participants' doctors during the study. Participants were randomly assigned by drawing numbered disks at random from a bag to do a 2 h walk either along a commercial street in London (Oxford Street) or in an urban park (Hyde Park). Baseline measurements of participants were taken before the walk in the hospital laboratory. During each walk session, black carbon, particulate matter (PM) concentrations, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between October, 2012, and June, 2014, we screened 135 participants, of whom 40 healthy volunteers, 40 individuals with COPD, and 39 with ischaemic heart disease were recruited. Concentrations of black carbon, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and ultrafine particles were higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Participants with COPD reported more cough (odds ratio [OR] 1&#x000b7;95, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;96&#x02013;3&#x000b7;95; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;1), sputum (3&#x000b7;15, 1&#x000b7;39&#x02013;7&#x000b7;13; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05), shortness of breath (1&#x000b7;86, 0&#x000b7;97&#x02013;3&#x000b7;57; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;1), and wheeze (4&#x000b7;00, 1&#x000b7;52&#x02013;10&#x000b7;50; p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05) after walking down Oxford Street compared with Hyde Park. In all participants, irrespective of their disease status, walking in Hyde Park led to an increase in lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) and a decrease in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index up to 26 h after the walk. By contrast, these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street. In participants with COPD, a reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC, and an increase in R5&#x02013;20 were associated with an increase in during-walk exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, ultrafine particles and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and an increase in PWV and augmentation index with NO<sub>2</sub> and ultrafine particles. In healthy volunteers, PWV and augmentation index were associated both with black carbon and ultrafine particles.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Short-term exposure to traffic pollution prevents the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of walking in people with COPD, ischaemic heart disease, and those free from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Medication use might reduce the adverse effects of air pollution in individuals with ischaemic heart disease. Policies should aim to control ambient levels of air pollution along busy streets in view of these negative health effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>British Heart Foundation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="para10"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para20"><bold>Evidence before study</bold></p><p id="para30">We searched PubMed without language restriction for reports published up to July, 2017, using the following search terms: &#x0201c;air pollution&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;particulate matter&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;diesel exhaust&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;walking&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;physical activity&#x0201d;, in addition to the terms &#x0201c;COPD&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ischaemic heart disease&#x0201d;. We found no studies that have examined the effect of walking in a polluted area on cardiovascular and respiratory responses. Most of the reports analysed the effect of submaximal exercise, usually cycling or running, in relatively young volunteers. No studies looked at the effect of walking at a normal pace, apart from our own study in a group of asthmatic participants (McCreanor et al, 2007). The effect of exercising in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or ischaemic heart disease in polluted areas has not been studied, apart from one study by Superko et al (1984) that looked at COPD participants during brisk walking on a treadmill.</p><p id="para40"><bold>Added value of study</bold></p><p id="para50">Our findings show for the first time the detrimental effect of air pollution on walking at a normal pace. We document the beneficial cardiorespiratory benefits of walking in healthy volunteers aged 60 years and older, an effect that is lost when walking in a polluted environment. Our results show that this similar phenomenon is happening in participants with COPD and ischaemic heart disease, although the cardiac medication taken by the ischaemic heart disease participants might be protecting them against the detrimental cardiovascular effects of air pollution.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para70">Our findings suggest that healthy people, as well as those with chronic cardiorespiratory disorders, should minimise walking on streets with high levels of pollution because this curtails or even reverses the cardiorespiratory benefits of exercise. Instead, walking exercise should be enjoyed in urban green space areas away from high density traffic. Patients with chronic cardiorespiratory disorders should be encouraged to use appropriate medication to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution. Current ambient levels of air pollution along busy streets are unacceptable and need to be controlled.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para80">Air pollution currently represents one of the world's most important environmental health risks and has been associated with an increase in premature deaths, mostly caused by ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Air pollution caused by emissions from diesel-powered vehicles and from tyres and brakes of motor vehicles comprises of particulate matter (PM) such as PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and ultrafine particles (PM with a diameter &#x02264;10 &#x003bc;m, 2&#x000b7;5 &#x003bc;m and 0&#x000b7;1 &#x003bc;m, respectively) as as noxious gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>).

We also tested whether medication modified the location effects on pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, assuming the modification effect was the same across all timepoints, and noted no significant interaction between location and medication for pulse wave velocity (p=0&#x000b7;718), but the interaction of location and medication for augmentation index was significant (p=0&#x000b7;005). The results were consistent with those of the three-way interaction, which allowed for medication to modify location effects differently by timepoint. In the stratified analyses of pollutant-endpoint associations, participants with ischaemic heart disease who did not use medication showed significant associations of pulse wave velocity with black carbon, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ultrafine particles, while those who used medication did not show such associations; however, this was not recorded with augmentation index (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">figure 8C</xref>).</p><p id="para340">We checked the effect of smoking history measured by the pack-years of smoking (number of 20 cigarette-packs smoked per day multiplied by years of smoking) on the changes of health outcomes between the two sites as an independent variable. We found no significant effects of smoking in the site analysis (p values ranging from 0&#x000b7;093 to 0&#x000b7;984), such that smoking did not modify the site effects on the walk-induced changes in health outcomes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para350">In healthy volunteers, walking for 2 h in a relatively less polluted urban park (Hyde Park) was associated with a bronchodilator response present up to 26 h, accompanied by a smaller increase in FVC sustained at 5 h, but with no changes in small airways function. By contrast, after walking in the more polluted commercial roadside (Oxford Street), there were no significant changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC from baseline, suggesting that pollutant exposures suppressed the walking-induced increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Both COPD and ischaemic heart disease participants experienced the beneficial effect of walking in both locations in terms of an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>, although this was less than that recorded in healthy volunteers. This is consistent with our findings on the significant associations between FEV<sub>1</sub> and pollutant concentrations in participants with COPD. There was also an increase in small airways obstruction measured as R5&#x02013;20 in association with pollutants in COPD participants but not in healthy and ischaemic heart disease participants. This greater effect of walking in a commercial roadside on lung function of participants with COPD was associated with more respiratory symptoms of cough and sputum, shortness of breath, and wheeze, while participants with ischaemic heart disease and the healthy volunteers were mostly asymptomatic walking on a commercial roadside except for increased cough in individuals with ischaemic heart disease.</p><p id="para360">The findings related to the cardiovascular parameters of pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, which are measures of arterial stiffness,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> are also of significant interest. In healthy participants, walking in Hyde Park led to a reduction in arterial stiffness that persisted up to 26 h, a benefit that was not only lost but even reversed after walking on Oxford Street. Participants with COPD or ischaemic heart disease also exhibited a reduced pulse wave velocity after walking in Hyde Park but increased pulse wave velocity after walking on Oxford Street. All three groups showed reductions in augmentation index following Hyde Park; and this beneficial change was significantly attenuated (even reversed at a few timepoints) after the Oxford Street walk. Moreover, we noted pollutant effects on pulse wave velocity and augmentation index mostly in participants with COPD and healthy volunteers but not in participants with ischaemic heart disease. This counter-intuitive finding could be due to the protective effect of the use of medications such as statins, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, which improve arterial stiffness.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Sensitivity analyses of ischaemic heart disease participants, stratified by medication use versus no medication use, confirmed that only those who did not use medication had attenuated reductions in pulse wave velocity and augmentation index after the Oxford Street walk compared with those after Hyde Park walks. By contrast, participants with ischaemic heart disease who used medications did not show differences in pulse wave velocity and augmentation index changes between the Oxford Street and the Hyde Park walks. The stratified analyses of pollutant associations showed significant associations of pulse wave velocity, but not augmentation index, with components of pollution, supporting a protective effect of cardiovascular medication.</p><p id="para370">While there was no association of pollutants with spirometric measurements in healthy and ischaemic heart disease participants, the fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC was related to changes in noise, black carbon, and ultrafine particles. These results are in agreement with our previous asthma study where the reductions in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were associated with ultrafine particles but not with PM<sub>2.5</sub>.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Examination of the cardiovascular parameters also showed an association of black carbon, and ultrafine particles, and not PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with increases in pulse wave velocity and augmentation index in healthy and COPD participants. Overall, we found that participants with COPD were especially sensitive to black carbon and ultrafine particles in terms of both pulmonary and cardiovascular effects. Our findings are in line with the cohort analyses showing an association between traffic related air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, black carbon and ultrafine particles) and cardiovascular disease and mortality.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This supports the view that pollutants emitted from fossil fuel combustion are particularly toxic for individuals with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.</p><p id="para380">The effect of exposure to pollution in natural environments on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems has been reported in young fit volunteers during high-intensity or submaximal exercise such as cycling or running. Running along or near busy highways or cycling during the rush hour has been shown to cause a reduction in lung function such as FEV<sub>1</sub>.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> On the other hand, the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on the cardiovascular system has been documented with submaximal exercise causing a reduction in arterial distensibility and thus arterial stiffness in normal volunteers.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Our study extends the respiratory and cardiovascular benefits of normal walking exercise in older healthy adults and in patients with chronic stable respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. It also shows how there are detrimental effects of road traffic pollution on these benefits of short-term walking, and implicates most of the components of the pollutants being associated with the changes in lung function and indices of arterial stiffness.</p><p id="para390">There are some limitations to this study. Because we did not include a resting control group, it would not be possible to be certain that walking contributed to the changes in lung function or arterial stiffness. Another consideration is the potential contribution of diurnal variation on the spirometric measurements.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> However, because the first baseline measurements were made at 11&#x02008;00 h, which is 1 h before the peak increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> that has been reported,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> the increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> measured after the first hour in Hyde Park in healthy participants were not related to diurnal variation but most likely induced by the walk. Second, the gender imbalance between the groups might have had an effect on the responses, but no significant differences in endpoints were recorded between sexes. Finally, the effect of medications taken by participants with either ischaemic heart disease or COPD on the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to walking cannot be excluded; however, a study in which therapies were discontinued would not be ethically justifiable. Indeed, our data suggest that cardioprotective drugs taken by participants with ischaemic heart disease are beneficial when walking in polluted areas.</p><p id="para400">Our short-term study is unlikely to inform on the long-term benefits of exercise in relation to pollution. Moderate physical activity might protect against the adverse effects of air pollution on arterial stiffness,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> providing support that regular walking could lead to restoration of the protective pulmonary and cardiovascular benefits of walking. Data from other studies suggest that air pollution risks do not overcome the benefits of active walking in urban areas using all-cause mortality outcome.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, the use of mortality as the main outcome has its limitation, because pulmonary and cardiovascular parameters that are indicative of development of potential respiratory and cardiovascular conditions caused by exposure to pollutants would probably be more relevant, especially in participants with chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of pollutants.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The long-term effects of regular walking in polluted environments in these chronic conditions need to be established.</p><p id="para410">We have noted that adults free of chronic cardiopulmonary diseases lose the benefits of walking on pulmonary and cardiovascular function in a polluted environment. In participants with COPD and ischaemic heart disease exposed to traffic pollutants, the pulmonary benefit from walking seem to be lost too, but the improvement in arterial stiffness caused by walking is relatively well preserved in ischaemic heart disease participants, likely due to concomitant routine medication use. Given that walking at a normal pace provides these cardiovascular and respiratory benefits, our results support the advice that healthy participants and patients with COPD and ischaemic heart disease should avoid highly polluted areas to walk in, if the benefits of walking exercise are to be fully reaped. Walking is a preferred daily natural and essential activity highly suited for older adults and for people with chronic lung and heart disease, and patients with chronic heart disease should preferably be on cardioprotective medications. Although further studies are needed, particularly looking at the effect of regular walking in polluted environments, the current data are sufficiently compelling to advise older adults and chronic pulmonary and cardiac participants to avoid walking in highly polluted environments such as city streets with high traffic density. Exercise such as walking should be done in urban green space areas away from high density traffic or in indoor facilities with effective air filtration if located near polluted streets. Finally, it is important to impose policies and measures that can reduce traffic pollution so that every individual can enjoy the health benefits of physical activity.</p><p id="para490"><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p id="para500">This online publication has been corrected.
