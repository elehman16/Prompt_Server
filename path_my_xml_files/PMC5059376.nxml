concentration-time data after its intravenous and oral administration in order to propose
the oral administration of DF as effective route to avoid long withdraw period. DF was
intravenously and orally administered at 1 mg/kg to cattle using a crossover design with a
4-week washout period. Plasma concentrations of DF were determined by a HPLC analysis. The
mean absorption time (MAT) and absorption half-life (t<sub>1/2ka</sub>) were 1.61 &#x000b1; 0.61
and 1.51 &#x000b1; 0.38 hr, respectively, and bioavailability was nearly 100%. The oral
pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen (AAP) were also evaluated in cattle. Plasma
concentrations of AAP were determined by a HPLC analysis. MAT and t<sub>1/2ka</sub> were
2.85 &#x000b1; 0.93 and 1.53 &#x000b1; 0.28 hr, respectively, and bioavailability was approximately 70%.
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that DF and AAP are rapidly
absorbed from the forestomach of cattle. Therefore, the appropriate efficacies of these
drugs may be achieved via their oral administration, even in cattle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetaminophen</kwd><kwd>cattle</kwd><kwd>diclofenac</kwd><kwd>oral absorption</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>An intravenous, intramscular or subcutaneous injection is typically employed as the
administration route of drugs in cattle. However, the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes
often lead to a long withdrawal time due to their long residues at injection sites. Although
this issue may be overcome by oral administration, the oral absorption of drugs may be
extremely slow because of the large forestomach, and thus, this route may not be appropriate
for cattle and other ruminants.</p><p>The main drug absorption site in many animal species after oral administration is the upper
small intestine. The forestomach of cattle is a large volume compartment with a capacity
ranging between 100 and 225 l [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This large volume may
result in slow gastric emptying and thus the markedly slower absorption of drugs after their
oral administration than that in monogastric animal species. Elbadawy <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that the mean absorption time (MAT) of
sulphamonomethoxine was very long (approximately 15 hr) following its oral administration to
Shiba goats, which are relatively small ruminants, and concluded that this long MAT may be the
result of slow gastric emptying.</p><p>On the other hand, some drugs may be absorbed not only from the small intestine, but also the
stomach. When lipid-soluble drugs exist in an unionized form in gastric fluid, they may be
absorbed in large amounts from the stomach even though the effective surface area of this
organ, which contributes to drug absorption, is markedly smaller than that of the small
intestine. This has also been demonstrated in rats for salicylic acid [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], sulphaethidole and barbital [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>],
and metoprolol [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The extensive absorption of drugs,
such as salicylic acid, aspirin, thiopental, secobarbital and antipyrine [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], from the stomach has also been reported in humans.
Elbadawy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that, after
it oral administration to Shiba goats, the absorption of diclofenac (DF; MAT of approximately
6 hr) was markedly faster than that of sulphamonomethoxine (MAT of approximately 15 hr). This
finding suggests that DF is rapidly absorbed from the forestomach.</p><p>DF is a highly lipid-soluble drug. It has a high partition coefficient between octanol and
buffer solution at pH 6.5, which corresponds to that of rumen juice [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This property may facilitate the rapid diffusion of DF from rumen juice
to the membranes of the forestomach. Therefore, the oral administration of DF may achieve
appropriate efficacy as an antipyretic or analgesic, even in cattle.</p><p>In a preliminary study, we examined the antipyretic effects of DF after its oral
administration to cattle with infectious disease and found a relatively rapid decrease in the
body temperature of most cattle examined. Since this finding suggested the rapid absorption of
DF after its oral administration, we examined its pharmacokinetics following its oral and
intravenous administration to cattle in order to clarify oral absorption profiles. As a
reference, we also examined the oral pharmacokinetic profiles of acetaminophen (AAP). Although
the lipid solubility of AAP is less than that of DF, it is still rapidly absorbed from the
small intestine of humans [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and other animal species,
such as dogs [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and rats [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, it may be absorbed from the forestomach, because the pH of
rumen juice is similar to that of intestinal fluid. In addition, a previous study indicated
that AAP was absorbed rapidly after its oral administration to Shiba goats [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Animals</italic>: Ten castrated male Holsteins (1.5&#x02212;2 years old, 600&#x02212;810 kg), which
were fattened in Hitachi farm (Ibaraki Town, Japan), were used in this study. They were
given rice straw at 0.5 kg/head and mixed feed (Beef Up<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Meiji Feed Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) at 5.5 kg/head twice a day. Water was given <italic>ad libitum</italic>.
Animal care was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the &#x02018;Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x02019; approved by the Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of
Agriculture and Technology.</p><p><italic>Chemicals</italic>: The sodium salt of DF and flufenamic acid were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). AAP was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical
(Osaka, Japan). All other reagents and chemicals used in this study were of HPLC or
analytical grade.</p><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p><italic>Pharmacokinetic study</italic>: The intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of DF
were examined in 5 animals using a crossover design. DF was administered at 1 mg/kg. There
was an approximately 4-week interval between the first and second legs of the study. In
the case of intravenous injections, DF was dissolved in a mixture of injectable distilled
water and DMSO (99:1, v/v) at 40&#x000b0;C, and its concentration was then adjusted to 50
mg/m<italic>l</italic>. The temperature of the drug solution was maintained at 36&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C
before being injected into the right jugular vein. In the case of oral administration, the
drug was dissolved in distilled water at 2.5 mg/m<italic>l</italic> and administered
orally using a nasogastric catheter. Blood samples (5 m<italic>l</italic>) were collected
from the left jugular vein immediately prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hr
following the intravenous injection of DF, and 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 24 and 32 hr after its oral
administration. Immediately after the blood sampling, the blood was placed in a test tube
containing EDTA and centrifuged to separate the plasma. After blood sampling at 4 hr, the
animals were given rice straw.</p><p>The intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of AAP were examined in another 5 cattle using
a crossover design with a 4-week washout period. AAP was administered at 10 mg/kg. AAP was
dissolved in propylene glycol at 40&#x000b0;C. The solution was diluted with injectable distilled
water, and its concentration was adjusted to 50 mg/m<italic>l</italic>. The solution was
injected into the right jugular vein or administered orally using a nasogastric catheter.
Blood samples (5 m<italic>l</italic>) were collected from the left jugular vein
immediately prior to and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hr following the intravenous injection of
AAP, and 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10 hr after its oral administration.</p><p>Blood samples were centrifuged at 1,600 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the plasma
obtained was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until the HPLC analysis.</p><p><italic>Stability test</italic>: Since the oral bioavailability of DF was complete and,
thus indicated good stability in the rumen juice of cattle, the stability of only AAP was
determined in rumen juice as described previously [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, approximately 100 m<italic>l</italic> of rumen fluid was collected
from two cattle using a catheter, pooled and then processed for an incubation immediately
after its collection. Two hundred microliters of the drug solution (1
mg/m<italic>l</italic>) was added to 1.8 m<italic>l</italic> of rumen juice to give a
final concentration of 100 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> in the incubation
mixture. The mixture was incubated in a thermostatic shaking water bath at 39&#x000b0;C for 24 hr
under anaerobic conditions. The incubated mixture was then centrifuged at 20,000 &#x000d7;
<italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant
obtained was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until the HPLC analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of drugs</title><p><italic>DF concentrations:</italic> DF concentrations in the plasma were determined by
HPLC with UV detection, as described previously [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
Briefly, 100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of flufenamic acid solution (10
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) was added as an internal standard to 500
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the plasma sample, followed by the addition of 200
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of phosphoric acid (0.15 M). Subsequently, 4 m<italic>l</italic> of
diethyl ether was added to the mixture and shaken for 3 min. The sample was centrifuged at
3,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 5&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The supernatant obtained (organic layer) was
evaporated to dryness by an evaporator (Rotavapor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> R-114, Shibata Scientific
Technology, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 30&#x000b0;C. The residue was reconstituted in 200

HPLC filter (Chromatodisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 4P, Kurabo Biomedical Industries, Ltd., Osaka,
Japan). Fifty microliters of the filtrate was injected into the HPLC column.</p><p>The HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) consisted of a pump (LC-10AD), UV
detector (SPD-6A), integrator (Chromatopac C-R7A plus) and loop injector (Model 7125). The
mobile phase was a mixture of 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 6.3) and acetonitrile (65:35, v/v).
Analytical separation was accomplished using a reversed-phase ODS column (TSK-gel
ODS-120T<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 4.6 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m &#x000d7; 250 mm, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan). The
flow rate was 1 m<italic>l</italic>/min. The wavelength of the detector was 278

samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection, as described previously [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, 200 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of perchloric acid
(0.15 M) was added to 200 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the plasma or rumen juice samples and
stirred. The mixtures were centrifuged at 20,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The
supernatants were obtained and filtered using a 0.45-<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m HPLC filter
(Chromatodisc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 4P, Kurabo Biomedical Industries). Fifty microliters of the
filtrate was injected into the HPLC column.</p><p>The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) and acetonitrile (90:10,
v/v). Triethylamine was added to the mobile phase at 150
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/<italic>l</italic>. Analytical separation was accomplished using the
ODS column (TSK-gel ODS-120T<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 4.6 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m&#x000d7;250 mm, TOSOH Co.,
Tokyo, Japan). The flow rate was 1 m<italic>l</italic>/min. The wavelength of the detector
was 248 nm. Sample preparation and analyses were conducted at room temperature. AAP was
found to be accurately resolved as a single sharp peak with a retention time of 5&#x02013;6 min.
The recovery of AAP from plasma samples was 92.1 &#x000b1; 1.2% at 1

related to oral absorption indicated the rapid absorption of DF; MAT and t<sub>1/2ka</sub>
were less than 2 hr (1.61 &#x000b1; 0.61 hr and 1.51 &#x000b1; 0.38 hr, respectively). These values of AAP
were similar to those of DF, as is clearly shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, indicating rapid oral absorption. The oral bioavailability of DF was
nearly 100%, whereas that of AAP was approximately 70%. CL of DF and AAP was 0.0121 &#x000b1; 0.0032

was almost complete, its stability was not examined in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that the oral absorption of DF was rapid, even in
cattle. After its oral administration, the average value of T<sub>max</sub> was 2 hr, and
those of MAT and t<sub>1/2ka</sub> were less than 2 hr. This rapid absorption may be due to
extensive absorption from the forestomach.</p><p>Ehsani-Kheradgerdi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]
examined the pharmacokinetics of AAP after its abomasal administration to Holstein-Friesian
heifers. They demonstrated that T<sub>max</sub> was 80 min. This value was mainly determined
by the abomasal emptying rate, because AAP is hardly absorbed from stomach juice in abomasum
under low pH conditions, but is extensively absorbed from small intestinal fluid under
markedly higher pH conditions in other animal species [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The T<sub>max</sub> value of DF after its oral administration to cattle was
similar to that of AAP after its abomasal administration. The residence time of drugs in the
forestomach must be markedly longer than that in abomasum, if they are not extensively
absorbed from the forestomach. Therefore, DF may have mainly been absorbed from the
forestomach in cattle following its oral administration, and this may have been due to its
high lipid solubility, as suggested in Shiba goats by Elbadawy <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the oral pharmacokinetics of AAP were also examined in cattle. The
results obtained suggested no significant difference in absorption rates between DF and AAP,
because the T<sub>max</sub>, MAT and k<sub>a</sub> of APP were similar to those of DF (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, AAP may also have been absorbed
rapidly from the forestomach of cattle. The oral pharmacokinetics of AAP have been examined
in order to evaluate gastric emptying profiles in monogastric animal species. The reported
values for T<sub>max</sub> were similar to those obtained in the present study: 0.5&#x02013;1 hr in
humans [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 0.5&#x02013;3 hr in dogs [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 1&#x02013;3.5 hr in
pigs [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which appears to support our suggestion
that AAP was rapidly absorbed from the forestomach of cattle.</p><p>Since most drugs are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract through a lipid barrier by
passive diffusion, lipid solubility is an important factor for oral absorption. The apparent
lipid solubility of AAP in rumen juice is markedly weaker than that of DF. The partition
coefficients of DF and AAP between octanol and pH 6.5 buffer solution were previously
reported to be 91.8 and 2.07, respectively [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since
a pH value of 6.5 is typically observed in rumen juice from cattle, the marked differences
in their absorption rates from the forestomach may be due to the large difference observed
in the partition coefficient between DF and AAP. However, the results of the present study
suggest that both drugs were absorbed from the forestomach at a similar rate after their
oral administration. This result may be explained as follows; the smaller molecular size of
AAP (151.17) than that of DF (296.15) as well as its lipid solubility may enable its rapid
absorption from the forestomach in cattle, as suggested in Shiba goats by Elbadawy
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Morishita <italic>et
al</italic>. already suggeted that physicochemical factors including molecular size
affected the absorption of sulfonomides in rats [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The oral pharmacokinetic profiles of DF obtained in the present study suggest that its
appropriate efficacy as an antipyretic is obtained via its oral administration, even in
cattle, because these profiles were similar to those in other animal species, such as
humans, dogs and pigs. The values of T<sub>max</sub> have been reported to be 0.6&#x02013;2.5 hr in
humans [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], 1 &#x02212;2 hr in dogs [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 0.75 hr in pigs [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These values are similar to 2 hr in cattle. Therefore, rapid efficacy may
even be obtained in cattle.</p><p>To date, only the intramuscular use of DF has been approved for cattle in the EU. When DF
is intramuscularly injected into cattle, its elimination half-life is approximately 30 hr
[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is markedly longer than that after its
oral administration (5.69 hr in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This
long half-life is due to its slow absorption from the injection site. Slow absorption may
require higher doses to obtain appropriate efficacy than rapid absorption to achieve
effective concentrations. As a result, a longer withdrawal time may be required. The
withdrawal time of DF is long in cattle (15 days), but may be shortened by its oral
administration due to its markedly shorter half-life and faster absorption via this route.
Therefore, oral administration may be better than intramuscular injections of DF in cattle.
The lowering dose of DF by oral administration for cattle might be useful to reduce the
environmental impacts and the effect on wild animals.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Al-Jenoobi</surname><given-names>F.
