These findings suggest that the breakage of an apical seal is related to the extent of epoxy polymerization, although the flexibility of a partially polymerized sealer seems to maintain the integrity of the apical seal until 72 hours despite the rotational force generated during the removal of the GP transferred to the region. Thus, the null hypothesis that the post space preparation timing does not affect the quality of the apical seal was rejected.</p><p>When the epoxy prepolymer and hardener are mixed, the C&#x02013;O bond in the original epoxide group is converted to a reactive &#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub> site and subsequently, crosslinks to the amine molecule, forming a highly &#x02018;crosslinked&#x02019; 3 dimensional polymer network.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The cure time of an epoxy resin system is dependent on the reactivity of the amine hydrogen atoms and thus, determined by the kinetics of the particular amine used in the hardener.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> AH Plus is composed of an epoxide paste containing an epoxy resin and an amine paste containing three different types of amine hardeners.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A long setting time of 8 hours allows good flow and penetration into the orifices of the dentinal tubules of the root canal wall during obturation by clinicians.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, it forms good adhesion to the root dentin through mechanical interlocking although the material does not chemically bind to GP or the root dentin.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although extensive crosslinking makes the epoxy resin hard and brittle, the DEC is usually less than 100% in actual epoxy reactions.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The FTIR and microhardness analyses demonstrated that AH Plus was polymerized to some extent (DEC 51.2%) after 8 hours of mixing, but still remained too soft to allow microhardness measurements due to the presence of unreacted epoxy groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The dye leakage test, which presented no significant difference between G<sub>I</sub> and G<sub>8H</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggests that when the rotary instrument is introduced into the obturated canal to remove GP, the sealer is still within its working time (G<sub>I</sub>) or still flexible (G<sub>8H</sub>), allowing the sealer to set without causing microfractures.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The epoxy polymerization reaction continued after the setting time (8 hours) over the experimental period (up to 1 week), implying a post-setting conversion.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Nonetheless, the leakage value did not significantly increase with time (until 72 hours) except under the 1 week condition (G<sub>1W</sub>).</p><p>The physical and mechanical properties of epoxy resin are influenced by DEC.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

The FTIR and microhardness analyses presented gradual progress of the epoxy polymerization with time during the experimental period (even until 1 week). On the other hand, the DSC had a distinct <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> until 72 hours after mixing, suggesting that the material was still relatively soft and flexible. In contrast, the G<sub>1W</sub> specimens did not present a clear <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> value, indicating that the material 1 week after mixing formed a very hard and brittle polymer network. As a result, it seems that the rotary force applied to create a post space resulted in the formation of microcracks in the material and the breakage of the bond at the interface,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> leading to significantly higher leakage values than in the other cases.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, we recommend that the post space preparation of root canals filled with a GP/epoxy resin sealer be performed prior to extensive epoxy conversion in order to avoid potential microfractures of the sealer during GP removal using a rotary instrument. Solano et al. suggested immediate post space preparation following root canal obturation in clinical practice because the clinician is intimately familiar with the root canal anatomy.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, such post space preparation procedures involving drilling and rinsing with water may dilute the uncured epoxy resin and potentially damage the apical seal. Thus, to avoid such complications, some delayed post space preparation may produce a better apical seal than an immediate one as long as the epoxy sealer is flexible. However, further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are required to clarify the optimal clinical post space preparation timing of a root canal sealed with epoxy resin-based sealers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> values of AH Plus gradually increased with time, the preparation 1 week after mixing specimens presented no clear <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> value.
