The lifetime population prevalence of physical and sexual violence against women varies internationally from 15% to 71%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> This large variation reflects different measures of abuse, as well as actual differences in national, regional and local prevalence. Survivors suffer chronic health problems including gynaecological problems,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> gastrointestinal disorders,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> neurological symptoms,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> chronic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and cardiovascular conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> The impact on mental health, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and substance abuse,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> can persist long after the violence has ceased. In 2008, the aggregate UK cost estimate for DV, including medical and social services, lost economic output and emotional costs, was &#x000a3;15.7 billion ($29.1 billion).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> While estimates of the cost burden can help highlight the importance of the issue in policy terms, we also need to link the size of the economic impact to estimates of how this can be reduced through interventions in order to make an economic case for investment in DV programmes. To do this, we need to combine evidence of the costs experienced by groups with and without a DV intervention with evidence of the outcomes experienced by those two groups in an economic evaluation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Here, we report an economic evaluation of DV interventions based on a randomised controlled trial, the least biased method for measuring the effect of an intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p><p>Healthcare may be a survivor's first or only point of contact with professionals, and abused women are more likely to contact health services than any other agency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The magnitude of the health consequences of DV contrasts starkly with its virtual invisibility within primary healthcare; in one UK general practice-based questionnaire study, only 15% of women with a history of DV had any reference to violence in their medical record.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> If women disclose DV to a clinician, whether in a primary care or specialist setting, there is evidence of an inappropriate poor-quality response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Doctors and nurses are largely unaware of appropriate interventions and have seldom received effective or, in the UK, any training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>; yet abused women identify doctors as the professionals from whom they would most like to seek support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p><p>The Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> tested the effectiveness of a training and support intervention for general practice teams, including training within the practice, a prompt to ask about DV embedded in the electronic medical record, a care pathway including referral to a specialist DV agency and continuing contact from that agency. Recorded referral in the medical record was 22 times greater in the intervention practices compared with the control practices and referral received by DV agencies was seven times greater. These agencies provided specialist advocacy to women experiencing DV: access to refuges/shelters, emergency housing, psychological services and ongoing support, as well as provision of information on legal, housing and financial options. In this paper, we present an economic evaluation of the IRIS programme (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">box 1</xref>), refining a previous model based on a pilot study of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Description of the Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) programme</title></caption><p>The primary intervention consisted of two 2&#x02005;h multidisciplinary training sessions, targeted at the clinical team. The training sessions were designed to address the expressed and tacit barriers to improving the response of clinicians to women experiencing abuse through improved identification, support and referral to specialist agencies. These sessions incorporated case studies and practice in asking about violence and responding appropriately. They were delivered by an advocate educator based in one of the two collaborating specialist agencies, and either a clinical psychologist specialising in domestic violence or an academic general practitioner. The advocate educator was central to the intervention, combining a training and support role to the practices with provision of advocacy to women referred from the practices. The training sessions were followed by periodic contact with the practice in clinical meetings, feeding back anonymised practice data on disclosure and referral to the advocacy service, and reinforcing guidance on good practice with regard to domestic violence, as well as ad hoc telephone conversations and email exchanges with clinicians about referrals or advice. One-hour training sessions with administrative staff focused on issues of confidentiality and safety for patients experiencing abuse and introduced the IRIS information materials signposting domestic violence agencies. Ongoing support to clinicians and reception staff in the practices was provided by the named domestic violence advocate educator, with the aim of consolidating the initial training. Intervention practices also were asked to identify a &#x02018;champion&#x02019; for the project; with the agreement of the practice, a member of staff from any of the clinical disciplines was invited to attend an additional 2.5&#x02005;days of training about domestic violence and to integrate this into the work of the practice. Other components of the intervention included a template in the electronic medical record linked to diagnoses (such as depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain and assault), an explicit referral pathway to a named domestic violence advocate and publicity materials about domestic violence visible in the practices. Clinicians were trained to have a low threshold for asking about domestic violence as a &#x02018;clinical enquiry&#x02019;, not screening.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a comparison of the 24 intervention with 24 control practices in the IRIS trial (143&#x02008;868 eligible women patients). We constructed a Markov model to estimate lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs from a UK national health service and a societal perspective. Markov modelling is a technique for estimating the costs and outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of women over time. We simulated a cohort of 10&#x02008;000 UK representative women with and without the IRIS programme and used the differences between the two simulations to calculate the incremental costs and outcomes associated with IRIS. We report our findings in terms of costs, QALYs and incremental costs per QALY gained. In the UK, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the ratio of differences between the costs of two alternatives and the difference between their effectiveness, of less than UK&#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;30&#x02008;000 (US$37&#x02008;122&#x02013;US$55&#x02008;683) is generally thought to be cost-effective by policy makers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> To construct the Markov model, we defined a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states experienced by women in relation to DV. The model then simulated the hypothetical cohort of women moving between the states, using a matrix of transition probabilities reflecting the likelihood of moving from each state to every other state within each discrete time period (in this case, 6&#x02005;months, as this is the average amount of time a woman stays in contact with advocacy services).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> In order to aid comparison with the model for the pilot intervention,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> a 10-year time horizon was used, and future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><sec><title>Model structure</title><p>We drew upon the model that was developed to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the pilot intervention, Prevention of Domestic Violence (PreDoVe).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> The IRIS model was based on fewer assumptions about women's trajectories into and out of abuse and we used trial data instead of pilot data. In the IRIS Markov model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>), the possible states of individual women were as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>No abuse</italic>: women not experiencing DV</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Abuse unidentified</italic>: women who are experiencing abuse but have not been identified by a healthcare professional</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Advocacy</italic>: women who are experiencing abuse and have seen or are seeing a DV advocate</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Identified existing victim</italic>: women who are experiencing abuse and have been recognised as such by a healthcare professional but are not seeing an advocate</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Death</italic>: women who have died from DV or other causes</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Markov model diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001008fig1"/></fig><p>We excluded states that could not be informed by contemporary reliable data. For example, PreDoVe included a state to represent the medium-term improvement of women whose condition had improved but had not yet reached the point where they were completely free of abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> This state was intended to reflect a stage on the trajectory to living without abuse, and we hoped that in the IRIS model the costs and quality of life (QoL) associated with this state would be informed by new studies. No relevant epidemiological studies have been reported, so we omitted this intermediate state and incorporated the effects of the intervention in the remaining states in order to reduce the number of transition probabilities based on assumptions.</p><p>The states are simplified in relation to available data. For example, the advocacy state includes identification and referral of women to an advocate. There are some transitions between states that we know might exist in the long term, such as between <italic>identified existing victim</italic> and <italic>advocacy</italic> (denoting self-referral of women to advocacy after they have disclosed to a healthcare professional), but for which we have no data. We envisage that this transition rate would be very small and so we do not expect any material changes in the model results if this transition was included. In other key areas, however, the IRIS model was able to distinguish more clearly the movement of women over time, as a result of improved data collection within the trial. For example, IRIS data distinguished between a referral recorded in the clinical record, a referral received by the agency and actual attendance by the patient, whereas the PreDoVe model was not able to distinguish between these outcomes.</p><p>This model structure is informed by the epidemiology of DV, including a cross-sectional study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> of prevalence in general practice populations similar to the IRIS sample, the trajectory of abuse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and estimates of the effect of DV advocacy on cessation of abuse and improvements in QoL and psychological outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Research by Bybee and Sullivan has contributed both to the small group of longitudinal studies of women experiencing DV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and provided the most robust estimates of the effects of advocacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Transition probabilities</title><p>In the IRIS model, the <italic>advocacy</italic> state only included those women who had contact with the advocate, a more accurate estimate of exposure to advocacy than the primary outcome of the trial, which was referral to advocacy noted in practice records but did not necessarily indicate that the woman saw an advocate. The <italic>advocacy</italic> state also included women who self-referred to advocacy as a result of a poster or card in the practice drawing attention to the service. The <italic>identified existing victim</italic> state consisted of women identified as experiencing abuse but not having contact with the advocate.</p><p>The number of women being identified (ie, the transition probability from <italic>abuse unidentified</italic> to <italic>identified existing victim</italic>) and seen by an advocate (<italic>abuse unidentified</italic> to <italic>advocacy</italic>) was significantly different for women in the intervention and control practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>). The transition probabilities for recovery from abuse were drawn from a systematic review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> of the rate of recovery from physical abuse for women in intensive advocacy, which was largely based on a trial by Sullivan and colleagues recruiting IPV survivors in shelters (refuges) and following them up in the community for 3&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> In our model, we reduced the probability of transition to the non-abused state by 75% to account for the lower intensity of the IRIS intervention compared with those in the

We found that the IRIS programme is likely to be cost-effective and possibly cost saving from a societal perspective and a healthcare perspective in the UK. The relatively modest costs of the primary care-based intervention and its projected long-term cost benefits means this is likely to be the case in other developed healthcare economies.</p><p>We have minimised bias in estimating the effect size of the IRIS programme by basing it on a randomised controlled trial that evaluated a crucial link between healthcare and access of women to specialist DV services. By using epidemiological and cost data external to the trial, we were able to extrapolate from directly measured trial outcomes (DV disclosure and referral rates) to QoL, health and economic outcomes. The uncertainty of the transition probabilities based on assumptions was addressed by PSA, contributing to the robustness of the model. By reporting societal as well as healthcare cost-effectiveness, our findings can inform societal prioritisation of investment in relation to DV as well as specific decisions at a healthcare commissioning level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p><p>This model was an improvement on the previous version developed in the pilot study, which preceded the Cochrane review of advocacy trials to inform some of the key transition rates. This pilot study only involved four practices and was based on a non-randomised comparison, and the model did not use a PSA to characterise the uncertainty of the cost-effectiveness estimate.</p><p>The DV prevalence of 17% came from women attending general practice rather than all women registered at the practice. As not all women see their GP and as women experiencing abuse are likely to see their GP more often than the general population, this figure is potentially higher than it should be for the population of women in our model. This may have overestimated the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Research by Fishman and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> in the USA indicates that we may be underestimating the higher healthcare costs in women in the years following cessation of abuse, but no research has quantified these costs in a UK setting. Our model does not include any benefits of the intervention for children who are exposed to DV,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> underestimating the potential cost-effectiveness. The downstream benefit of the intervention on women is crucially dependent on trials from one centre in the Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of advocacy, which evaluates women receiving intensive (60&#x02005;h) DV advocacy in the context of a refuge (shelter). To guard against a potential overestimate of benefit in our model, we used this effect reduced by 75% to extrapolate the Cochrane review findings to community-dwelling women referred to less intensive advocacy from primary care. Our projections of longer term benefit of DV advocacy were problematic because trials in this field measure relatively short-term outcomes. Moreover, there is a dearth of longitudinal studies measuring the medium- to long-term trajectory of DV events in terms of continuing or repeated abuse and no prospective medium- or long-term data on QoL and health status following abuse.</p><p>As Gold and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> argue in their methodological paper on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of healthcare programmes for partner violence, the resources required to provide effective interventions that reduce violence and improve outcomes for women could be used for other healthcare interventions or social care programmes. Despite the growth in the number of randomised controlled trials, the analysis of cost-effectiveness within the field of DV research is still embryonic. Given the long-term benefits of cessation of violence and the necessarily limited follow-up in trials, as well as the particular challenges of following up participants who have experienced DV,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> models such as the one we have reported here are essential in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DV programmes in healthcare and other settings. The robustness of these models will be improved by longitudinal studies characterising the different trajectories of abuse and their sequelae. Notwithstanding the need for better longitudinal data to populate these models, the analysis that we have reported in this paper is evidence of cost-effectiveness that can inform the commissioning of the IRIS programme in the context of primary healthcare services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001008-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e1335" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e158" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001008.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e159" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001008.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Clare Rutterford, statistician for the IRIS trial, for providing all the trial data used in this paper.
