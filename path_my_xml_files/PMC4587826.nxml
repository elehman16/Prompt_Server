The most abundant naturally occurring CLA isomers are CLA<sub>c9,t11</sub> (76&#x000a0;%) and CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> (1&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and are derived from food sources containing ruminant fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early studies demonstrated that supplementation of CLA in the diets of mice caused massive losses of body fat, essentially creating a lipoatrophic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, such findings fueled a subsequent interest in supplemental CLA as a potential tool to combat obesity. However, the weight loss effects of supplemental CLA in humans is much more modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, an unexpected outcome of the earlier CLA studies was an increase in indices of insulin resistance, which was evident in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and overweight humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and generally attributed to the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> isomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Conversely, there is evidence that the CLA<sub>c9,t11</sub> isomer may confer insulin sensitizing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The majority of studies to date have examined the effects of supplemental CLA, as opposed to examining the outcome of consuming food naturally enriched with CLA. More specifically, almost no studies have examined the metabolic consequences of consuming a food source in which the CLA isomer content has been naturally altered i.e. not merely adding CLA isomer in the chemical form to a food. To this end, we recently examined the impact of feeding a CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter (60&#x000a0;% of total kcal) to lean, healthy female rats. Our findings indicated that feeding the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter resulted in small, but significant increases in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, as well as impaired insulin tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there was no effect of the enriched butter on glucose or pyruvate tolerance, or on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Shortly after our study was published, there was another report showing that feeding butter enriched in the CLA<sub>c9,t11</sub> isomer to lean rats prevented the hyperinsulinemia induced by a high fat diet; interestingly, there was also no effect on oral glucose tolerance in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Collectively, these two studies demonstrate a potential, albeit relatively small, effect of consuming natural food sources with altered CLA isomer content on indices of insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Given the relatively small effect of CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter on indices of insulin resistance in lean, healthy rats in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we decided to next examine the impact of feeding this potentially &#x0201c;less healthy&#x0201d; butter to fatty female Zucker rats, which develop insulin resistance when placed on a high fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We speculated that the general lack of negative consequences to feeding SARA butter in our previous study was due to the choice of lean rats as a model, and that a rodent model with a predisposition towards diabetes would be more likely to show negative effects on glucose and insulin tolerance, and insulin signaling. As in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we fed dairy cows a high grain, low forage diet to induce a condition known as subacute rumenal acidosis (SARA), which is defined as a decrease in rumenal pH below 5.6 for 4&#x02013;6 hrs during a 24-h period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This decrease in pH results in a significant increase in the production of the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> isomer due to incomplete biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Overall, our goal was to extend our previous findings by investigating the impact of a CLA <sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter on glucose and insulin tolerance, as well as insulin signaling in muscle (oxidative and glycolytic), adipose (subcutaneous and visceral) and liver tissues, in an obese, diabetes prone rat model. To this end, female fatty Zucker rats were fed custom diets containing high amounts of fat (45&#x000a0;% of total kcal) derived from SARA and non-SARA butter for 8 weeks. We hypothesized that, unlike lean insulin sensitive rats, fatty Zucker rats would demonstrate a clear worsening of both glucose and tolerance, as well as impaired insulin signaling in muscle, adipose and liver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council of Animal Care, and were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Guelph (Animal Utilization Protocols 09R046 and 1515).

Six lactating Holstein cows housed at the Ponsonby Dairy Research Centre, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario were used in this study. The cows were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments for a total of 21&#x000a0;days. The two diets were: i) a high-forage/low-grain diet (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 cows) designed to promote a stable and optimal rumenal pH, or ii) a SARA-inducing high-grain diet containing readily fermentable carbohydrates (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 cows) intended to reduce rumen pH resulting in a shift in the biohydrogenation pathway leading to elevated levels of CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> in milk fat. Milk collection took place on days 13 through 21. Two to four cows provided sufficient milk to make the necessary quantities of butter to perform the current and previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The milk from each cow was collected separately, placed on ice, and transferred to the University of Guelph Food Technology Centre where it was pooled by treatment and processed to make unsalted butter; the fatty acid profiles were analyzed and previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All animals were handled and cared for in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care regulations, and as approved the Animal Care Committee at the University of Guelph.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Experimental animal groups</title><p>Eight female lean Zucker rats and 36 female fatty Zucker rats from Charles River (Quebec, Canada) were used in this study. Rats were 10&#x000a0;weeks old upon arrival and were randomly assigned 2&#x02013;3 rats per cage in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were allowed free access to water and a low fat (10&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal) diet for a 1-week acclimatization period. Subsequently, for an 8-week period, the lean Zucker rats were fed the low fat diet and the fatty Zucker rats were randomly assigned to one of four diet treatments: i) low fat (10&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal, LF), ii) 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal lard (LARD) as a positive control <italic>i.e.</italic> one in which we expected to see the development of glucose and insulin intolerance, iii) 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal SARA butter (SARA), or iv) 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal non-SARA butter (non-SARA). Animals were allowed ad libitum access to food and water.

A purified low fat diet (Research Diets D12450B, New Brunswick, New Jersey) containing 10&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal from fat (5.5&#x000a0;% soybean oil and 4.5&#x000a0;% lard) and a purified high fat diet (Research Diets D12451) containing 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal from fat (5.5&#x000a0;% soybean oil and 39.5&#x000a0;% lard) were used for this study. A premix (Research Diets D12451px) identical in composition to the high fat diet, excluding the fat content, was used to prepare the custom 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal non-SARA and SARA butter diets. To make each custom butter diet, 1.61&#x000a0;kg of each type of butter was mixed with 5.12&#x000a0;kg of premix.

Insulin tolerance was significantly impaired by feeding the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter, but we did not observe any significant impairment in either glucose tolerance or insulin stimulated muscle glucose uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Altogether, these findings demonstrated a minimal impact of consuming large amounts of a food naturally enriched in the specific CLA isomer believed to cause insulin resistance. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to extend these initial findings by examining the metabolic impact of feeding a CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter to female fatty Zucker rats, which are known to develop insulin resistance and diabetes when fed a high fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To this end, we i) performed whole-body glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and ii) examined acute insulin signaling in response to a maximal insulin dose in skeletal muscle (red and white gastrocnemius), adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral depots), as well as liver. Finally, we iii) assessed changes in metabolic rate (oxygen uptake) and physical activity in a metabolic caging system.</p><p>Our current findings extend our previous observations that feeding a butter naturally enriched in CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> has a negative impact on whole body glucose homeostasis. However, unlike our previous study in which insulin, but not glucose tolerance was impaired by the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> enriched butter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], both glucose and insulin tolerance were impaired by the SARA (high CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>) butter in the present study. The impairment of glucose and insulin tolerance was essentially identical to that induced by a diet containing similar amounts of lard. The negative impact of the diets containing lard and SARA-butter was most apparent with the insulin tolerance tests, as there was essentially no decrease in blood glucose in response to an <italic>in vivo</italic> insulin injection. In the current study, the amount of fat (butter, lard) provided by the diet was reduced to a more realistic content compared to our previous study (45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal vs. 60&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal). Therefore, the reason for the more consistent negative effect of CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched butter in the present study was almost certainly the choice of rodent model. We utilized fatty female Zucker rats in this study as they develop overt diabetes when placed on a moderately high fat diet i.e. 45&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;kcal from fat, and are a commonly used model for human obesity. Thus, our primary hypothesis appears to be correct in that a more obesity/diabetes prone animal demonstrated a more consistent impairment in glucose homeostasis (both glucose and insulin tolerance) compared to the lean healthy rats used in our previous study in which only insulin tolerance was impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>As an extension to our previous work, we also assessed insulin signaling in two muscle fiber types (oxidative and glycolytic), two adipose tissue depots (subcutaneous and visceral), as well as the liver. In both muscle fiber types, AKT phosphorylation was consistently impaired in response to a maximal acute insulin injection in all fatty Zucker rats, regardless of their diet. Therefore, impaired maximal insulin signaling in skeletal muscle could not account for the fact that the greatest degree of glucose and insulin intolerance was observed in the LARD and SARA groups. Certainly, it is possible that insulin sensitivity rather than maximal response was affected, and that our choice of a maximal insulin dosage precluded our ability to detect any differences between groups. However, as evident in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the increase in AKT phosphorylation in either muscle fiber was quite small in the fatty Zucker rats, and in some cases, the increase in response to insulin was not significant. Therefore, changes in AKT phosphorylation in the Zucker rats in response to a lower submaximal concentration of insulin would likely have been undetectable. Interestingly, AKT phosphorylation in visceral adipose tissue generally appeared to be most impaired in the LARD and SARA groups. However, this was not true in subcutaneous adipose tissue in which insulin signaling did not appear to be as consistently or robustly inhibited. Finally, AKT phosphorylation in liver was generally uniformly decreased amongst the various fatty Zucker groups, with no differences between dietary groups. Overall, differences in maximally stimulated insulin signaling in any of the main insulin-responsive tissues do not account for the difference observed in our whole-body tolerance tests.</p><p>One of the limitations in our previous study was that we did not include an assessment of physical activity or oxygen consumption (metabolic rate). Therefore, in the current study, animals were placed in a metabolic caging unit to assess these parameters. As expected, all fatty Zucker groups, regardless of diet, demonstrated a significantly reduced oxygen uptake during both light and dark phases. In fact, only the lean Zucker group showed a significant increase in oxygen uptake during the dark (awake) phase. Generally, there were few differences between dietary treatments, although interestingly, both butter-fed groups (SARA and non-SARA) had a lower oxygen uptake than the LARD or low fat fed fatty Zuckers. Overall, physical activity tended to match the patterns in oxygen uptake and was greatest in lean Zucker rats regardless of light or dark phase. Physical activity was also the lowest in the butter-fed groups. Although this decrease in physical activity was not statistically significant, the percent decrease in the butter-fed groups (~25-40&#x000a0;% decrease relative to LARD), would explain the ~20&#x000a0;% decrease in oxygen uptake in these groups. As seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, there were no significant differences in physical activity or oxygen uptake between the SARA and non-SARA groups; therefore, the impairment in glucose and insulin tolerance cannot be explained by changes in these parameters.</p><p>Collectively, our results from two studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and present) suggest that the consumption of high amounts of a food naturally enriched CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> increases the risk of developing impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, although the degree of impairment is not as great as that achieved in studies providing higher amounts of purified CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This may be due to several reasons including i) a lower consumption of CLA in our two studies (&#x0003c;0.5&#x000a0;g CLA/100&#x000a0;g diet) compared to previous rodent studies using supplemental CLA (&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), ii) the fact that all CLA isomers, and not just CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> were altered in the SARA butter, and iii) a relatively shorter duration of feeding compared to other studies which extend up to 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that mixed isomer CLA supplementation in obese Zucker rats can improve insulin sensitivity and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and recently, that a CLA<sub>c9,t11</sub> naturally enriched butter prevented high-fat diet induced hyperinsulinemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, since the CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> isomer is the most greatly affected CLA isomer in the SARA butter, demonstrating an ~10-fold increase, it is reasonable to suggest it is this isomer that is causing the impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, being a naturally altered food, other constituents may have been responsible as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The outcome of this study indicates that the consumption of large amounts of a food naturally enriched in CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub> content can significantly impair whole body glucose and insulin tolerance in a diabetes-susceptible rodent model. This outcome cannot be explained by changes in maximal insulin response in major insulin responsive tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue), or by changes in physical activity or energy expenditure. Although we cannot comment on whether the consumption of small of amounts of CLA<sub>t10,c12</sub>-enriched foods might have similar undesirable consequences, it may be prudent to examine this possibility over longer periods of time in humans.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CLA</term><def><p>Conjugated linoleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARA</term><def><p>Subacute rumen acidosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RG</term><def><p>Red gastrocnemius</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WG</term><def><p>White gastrocnemius</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SQAT</term><def><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAT</term><def><p>Visceral adipose tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LF</term><def><p>Low fat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARA</term><def><p>Subacute rumenal acidosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GTT</term><def><p>Glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Insulin tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AAC</term><def><p>Area above the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LZ</term><def><p>Lean Zucker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FZ</term><def><p>Fatty Zucker</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MH conducted rodent feeding experiments, analyzed data, performed statistical analyses and helped to edit the manuscript.
