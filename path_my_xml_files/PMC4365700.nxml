Early cytogenetic and molecular responses were superior in the dasatinib group, with a tendency that imatinib patients caught up with time. For instance, MR<sup>3.0</sup> was reached at 3&#x000a0;months in 36% vs. 8% (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.02), at 12&#x000a0;months in 81% vs. 46% (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.02) and at 18&#x000a0;months in 73% vs. 65% (n.s.) of the patients in the two groups. In contrast, MR<sup>4.5</sup> was consistently superior in the dasatinib group at all time points from 6&#x000a0;months onwards, reaching 61% vs. 21% (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.05) at 36&#x000a0;months. Sixty-four vs. 71% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively, remained on assigned drug. Dasatinib dose was frequently reduced, but with maintained excellent effect. One imatinib patient progressed to blastic phase, but no CML-related deaths occurred. In conclusion, our data compare favourably with those of the dasatinib registration study, DASISION. The fast and deep molecular responses induced by dasatinib compared with imatinib may be exploited to increase the proportion of patients who can achieve a treatment-free remission after treatment discontinuation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dasatinib</kwd><kwd>imatinib</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>deep response</kwd><kwd>toxicity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib efficiently induces rapid haematologic and cytogenetic responses in most newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In general, these studies demonstrate that the second-generation TKIs (2GTKIs) induce deeper and faster molecular and cytogenetic responses than imatinib when given in first line, but in spite of this, there is no clear improvement in overall survival. 2GTKIs prevent disease progression to advanced phase CML compared with imatinib, although disease progression is rare with any TKI. Side effects vary between these drugs. All have varying degrees of haematological toxicity, of which nilotinib and bosutinib have least and dasatinib most <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Non-haematological toxicity is generally different between these drugs, and cross-intolerance is uncommon. Consequently, patients with side effects have excellent alternatives. Of interest, dasatinib treatment is associated with the appearance of clonal NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and this phenomenon is frequently accompanied by pleural or pericardial effusions dominated by lymphocytes <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Despite periods of discontinuations and dose reductions, patients with these phenomena have very good treatment responses compared with other patients, and it has been postulated that the clonal lymphocytosis is part of an anti-leukaemic immune response <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>We conducted a randomised phase-2 trial (NordCML006) in which the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome positive leukaemic stem and progenitor cells (CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>+</sup>respectively) in bone marrow aspirates from 46 newly diagnosed patients with CML was analysed both at diagnosis and during dasatinib and imatinib therapy <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Briefly, at diagnosis, the proportion of leukaemic stem cells varied markedly (1&#x02013;100%) between individual patients but correlated with leukocyte count, spleen size, haemoglobin and blast percentage. A low leukaemic stem cell burden at diagnosis was associated with less therapy-related haematological toxicity and superior cytogenetic and molecular responses during the first year of therapy. Of interest, and in contrast to <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, TKI therapy very rapidly depleted most of leukaemic stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. We here provide a detailed report on the clinical data from this trial, with emphasis on deep molecular responses and adverse events with a minimum of 36&#x000a0;months of follow-up for all randomised patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients, randomisation and treatment</title><p>Newly diagnosed (not more than 3&#x000a0;months from diagnosis) chronic-phase (CP) CML patients at least 18&#x000a0;yr of age were eligible for the study. Pretreatment with hydroxyurea, but not TKI, was allowed for up to 60&#x000a0;d. Hydroxyurea treatment was given to 54% of included patients (mean 16&#x000a0;d in these 54%). Mean time from the diagnosis of CML to start of TKI was 33&#x000a0;d. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the relevant ethics review boards and medicinal products agencies in Finland, Norway and Sweden and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00852566). Imatinib was prescribed and reimbursed as commercial drug, while dasatinib was provided as study drug by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1), starting with standard dose of imatinib 400&#x000a0;mg QD (daily) or dasatinib 100&#x000a0;mg QD. In the case of toxicity, two dose reduction steps were allowed: 70 and 50&#x000a0;mg for dasatinib and 300 and 200&#x000a0;mg for imatinib. In case of insufficient response, dose escalations were permitted, but not above 140&#x000a0;mg QD of dasatinib or 400&#x000a0;mg twice daily (BID) of imatinib. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CD34&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CD38&#x02212; bone marrow cells after 6&#x000a0;months of treatment as reported previously <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.

MR<sup>3.0</sup> rates were superior for the dasatinib group as compared to the imatinib group all through the first year of therapy (3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A). The largest difference, 4-fold higher, was seen at 6&#x000a0;months (68% for dasatinib and 17% for imatinib). However, at later time points, from 18&#x000a0;months and onwards, the MR<sup>3.0</sup> rate was not significantly different between the two cohorts, as the imatinib-treated patients caught up and both groups plateaued around 80%. With regard to deep molecular responses, MR<sup>4.0</sup> and MR<sup>4.5</sup>, a different pattern was seen. The fraction of patients reaching MR<sup>4.0</sup> was higher for dasatinib at all measured time points throughout the study, (although not reaching statistical significance at 9 and 36&#x000a0;months) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>B). Similarly, an even deeper molecular response, MR<sup>4.5</sup>, was reached by significantly more dasatinib-treated patients at all time points after 3&#x000a0;months (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>C).

Despite this, no improvement of the excellent overall survival of imatinib-treated patients has been observed with 2GTKIs, even though a small but significant benefit with regard to progression to advanced phase is notable, at least with nilotinib <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In many respects, data from the current smaller study are in line with previous studies and even appears to compare favourably with these. Furthermore, dasatinib showed a clear benefit over imatinib with respect to depth of molecular response. As an example, at 12&#x000a0;months, MR<sup>3.0</sup> rate was 80% with dasatinib compared to 45% with imatinib, and MR<sup>4.0</sup> rates were 60% and 17%, respectively.

Again, comparing with DASISION, the MR<sup>4.5</sup> rates by 24&#x000a0;months were 17% and 8% and after 36&#x000a0;months 22% vs. 12% <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>There is no clear explanation to this difference between our and previous studies of similar design. We applied a strict ITT analysis with complete follow-up, which is a strength of this study. ITT analysis also includes patients who progressed or discontinued study drug and subsequently received highly efficacious rescue treatment by alternative TKIs or allogeneic transplantation. In other studies, discontinuation for whatever reason may be denoted as treatment failure and excluded from further analysis. Also, classification of missing or inconclusive response assessments as &#x02018;no response&#x02019;, may lead to falsely low estimates of response rates compared to our study. The ITT approach provides a clinician the best reflection of expected treatment course and outcome in real life. We have also previously noted in our imatinib+/-pegylated interferon-&#x003b1;2b study NordCML002, that responses in Nordic patients treated both with imatinib alone or the combination were superior to those in studies with similar design (IRIS, French SPIRIT, CML-IV) (see also supplementary table in ELN treatment recommendations 2013) <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In addition, in the recent update from the Swedish population-based CML registry, very good responses to TKI therapy were reported <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Particular characteristics of Nordic patients related to drug compliance and/or genetic variation are possible explanations for these results. The treatment groups in the current study were representative of Nordic CML patients with an ordinary distribution of Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS risk scores. Notably, our patients with a mean age of 56&#x000a0;yr were clearly older than patients in most published CML studies (in DASISION patients were median 47&#x000a0;yr of age, i.e., 9&#x000a0;yr younger) and thus also in this respect is more in accordance with the everyday clinical setting.</p><p>Dasatinib was in the present study highly efficacious despite treatment interruptions, dosing reductions and a high rate (27%) of serosal effusions. From earlier studies with dasatinib, the occurrence of pleural effusions has been associated with a better treatment response, and our data are in line with this <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In the current study, only 36 % of patients randomised to dasatinib remained on full dose of the drug after 36&#x000a0;months, while another 27% were on a reduced dosing schedule mainly due to toxicity. However, also patients that were dose-reduced exhibited deep molecular responses. In fact, when comparing the patients remaining on full-dose dasatinib and those on reduced dose of the drug, their molecular responses at 36&#x000a0;months were equally good (median MR4.5 in both groups, <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.53). This supports other retrospective reports where it has been suggested that dasatinib at reduced or intermittent dosing improves tolerability of the drug without loss of efficacy <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. These observations pose the question whether dasatinib at 100&#x000a0;mg QD is the optimal dose for long-term use. A lower dose from diagnosis of CP-CML or alternatively an induction phase with standard dose followed by a lower maintenance dose which might optimise the side effect profile without compromising efficacy and also improve affordability of the drug. Prospective studies to address this issue would be of interest.</p><p>In recent years, discontinuation of TKI therapy in CML patients with very good therapeutic responses has become a topic of high interest in academia and pharmaceutical industry <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. One example is the ongoing pan-European discontinuation study EURO-SKI, in which patients with stable deep molecular responses (MR<sup>4.0</sup> for at least 1&#x000a0;yr) can be included. The treatment responses achieved primarily with dasatinib in our study are promising in this respect. Our results indicate that a substantial proportion of patients reach minimal residual disease levels that may allow for a future attempt to discontinue TKI therapy. Of note, 67 % of the dasatinib-treated and 23% of imatinib-treated patients were in MR<sup>4.0</sup> at 3&#x000a0;yr and would be eligible for participation in EURO-SKI. If discontinuation is the goal of treatment, our data support the use of dasatinib rather than imatinib as first line therapy in newly diagnosed CML. Aiming for maximal response is also supported by a recent report which showed that achievement of MR<sup>4.5</sup> on TKI therapy at 4&#x000a0;yr was associated with a better survival at 8&#x000a0;yr as compared to lower degrees of molecular response <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the treatment outcome in the current study was very good in both treatment groups, both by cytogenetic and by molecular evaluation, and the results compare favourably with data from similarly designed larger trials. The data give a realistic picture of the patient treatment results as analysis is strictly on an intention-to-treat basis and no patients were lost to follow-up. With respect to cytogenetic response and achievement of MR<sup>3.0</sup>, there was a short-term benefit of dasatinib, but imatinib patients caught up with time. With respect to achievement of MR<sup>4.0</sup> and MR<sup>4.5</sup>, there was a clear advantage with dasatinib. In our opinion, the optimal dose for long-term use of this potent drug still is an open question, but dasatinib appears to have an advantage if the treatment goal is to induce a deep response. This may possibly influence long-term survival, but more importantly may allow for a larger proportion of patients to attempt discontinuation of TKI therapy and be operationally cured. Future studies are needed to clarify whether achieving a deep molecular response with potential treatment-free survival should be a standard clinical treatment goal in line with, for example, achievement of CCgR and MR<sup>3.0</sup>. Issues such as quality of life, economy and toxicity will be important in this context.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank our patients for their participation, the Department of Applied Clinical Research, NTNU for data management and development of the web-based CRF, study nurses and lab technicians for their contributions and Bristol-Myers Squibb for financial support.
