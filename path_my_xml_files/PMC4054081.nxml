Increased concerns about preservation of healthy tooth structures favored the use of resin composite rather than amalgam.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Thus, the use of amalgam has decreased dramatically in many countries despite its mechanical properties, low material price, rapid application and excellent long-term results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Composite resins are mercury-free and thermally non-conductive and they match the shade of natural teeth and bond to the tooth structure through the use of adhesive systems.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, polymerization shrinkage remains a major drawback. As a result of polymerization shrinkage, marginal leakage generally occurs at the interface between the restorative material and the tooth, which leads to post-operative sensitivity, recurrent caries and pulpal complications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, the ability to produce a uniform, long lasting seal to the tooth structure is a challenge in dentistry.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Today, many new adhesives have been introduced in the dental market. Adhesive systems can be classified as either &#x0201c;etch-and-rinse&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;self-etch.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Contemporary adhesive systems (&#x0201c;three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive systems&#x0201d;) comprise separate conditioning, priming and bonding steps. Most modern adhesive systems combine these functions into two steps; the priming and bonding steps are combined.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] With the self-etch adhesive systems, no separate etching or rinsing steps are needed. Conditioning and resin monomer infiltration in enamel and dentine occur simultaneously; thus, reducing the potential for degradation over time[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and eliminating the critical post-etch rinsing and drying steps of total etching adhesive systems.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although the literature on this matter is controversial,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the self-etch adhesive systems reduce the technique sensitivity during handling and application.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Successful bonding to hard tissues is a fundamental requirement before placement of resin composites. It is important to note that the success of adhesive restorative treatment relies not only on the improvement of the material properties and handling technique, but also on the skills and knowledge that general practitioners possess in regard to a material's properties, limitations and correct use.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>This study evaluated the effect of operator variability on microleakage of two etch-and-rinse and three self-etch adhesive systems after operators&#x02019; calibration. The null hypothesis tested was that operator skill and experience would not influence the success of adhesive restorative treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Samples, cavity preparation and restoration</title><p>In this study, 90 extracted human premolar teeth without decay, cracks or previous restorations were used. The teeth were stored for less than 3 months in 0.1% thymol solution and then scaled and cleaned.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A total of 180 standardized Class V cavities without bevels (4 mm width, 2 mm height, 2 mm depth) were prepared with a water-cooled high-speed handpiece at the cement-enamel junction on the buccal and lingual surfaces. The teeth were randomly assigned to five groups according to the adhesive systems used (<italic>n</italic> = 36): Two etch-and-rinse adhesives (Prime and Bond NT [PB] and Single Bond [SB]) and three self-etch adhesives (Futura Bond NR [FB], Xeno III [XE], Adper Prompt-L-Pop [LP]). The adhesive groups were then further ascribed to three operators with different levels of clinical experience (<italic>n</italic> = 12): An undergraduate dental student with 1 year of clinical experience, a research assistant with 4 years of clinical experience and a faculty member with 19 years of clinical experience [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Each adhesive was applied by each operator according to the manufacturer's instructions and light cured with the same halogen light-curing unit (Hilux Expert, Benlio&#x0011f;lu Dental, Ankara, Turkey).

All these variables might be influenced by the operator and are likely to cause variations in results.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Working steps, such as the etching of enamel and dentine, drying of the cavity, application of adhesive systems-composites and light curing, may show differences even between experienced clinicians. In an attempt to control the variables associated with the stresses from polymerization shrinkage, the same resin composite was used for all samples in this <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Previous studies have shown that there is no significant difference in microleakage between buccal and lingual enamel surfaces and buccal and lingual cementum/dentine surfaces.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Application technique and waiting time before curing will also affect bonding reliability since resin diffusion is time dependent. The adhesive systems used in this study were applied according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.</p><p>The performance of light-activated restorative materials is related to the effectiveness with which they are polymerized. Depth of cure has been reported to be related to a logarithmic function of the total amount of exposure &#x02013; the product of light intensity and irradiation time.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Operator controlled factors governing the extent of cure include a light source characteristics, irradiation time, increment thickness and correct light guide position during the irradiation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] All the operators in this study used the same curing light, which was checked before the start of the study.</p><p>The need for a moist dentine surface is more important when using acetone-based adhesive systems than water-based adhesive systems,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] because water can rewet and expand a collapsed collagen network.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Acetone as a solvent is not effective on over-wet dentine.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, utmost care is required with acetone adhesives when air drying the dentine. It was thought that the undergraduate student would have difficulty in obtaining the optimum degree of dentine wetness before applying PB, but there was no significant difference between the operators.</p><p>A total of 5 years are required to earn the DDS degree at the school where the study was conducted. Students provide intensive patient care at the clinics in their 4<sup>th</sup> year. They use both etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesive systems, but adhesive systems except PB and SB were not used in the dental clinics of this faculty routinely. Miyazaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that dental students using dental adhesives for the 1<sup>st</sup> time tended to read the instructions more carefully and to make the bonding specimens more meticulously. Therefore, inexperience can apparently be an advantage. Adebayo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that the operator's skill in handling a material and/or using the test apparatus may affect the measured micro-shear bond strength and operator skills may improve with repeated testing and material use.</p><p>Very few reports are available regarding such technique sensitivity issues, especially with regard to the level of experience of the clinicians. Giachetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated the influence of the operator's skills on microleakage of Class V restorations using two types of adhesive. Contrary to our study's results, the microleakage score for the one-step self-etch adhesive was better for the student group than for the expert group. Miyazaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] studied the effect of operator variability on bond strength of dentine, with university based dentists, undergraduate students and general practitioners as subjects. They concluded that technique sensitivity is the main factor in dentine bonding. Sano <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that while clinical experience may play a part in the outcome of bond strength testing, material technique sensitivity may be of more consequence in obtaining optimum bonding performance.</p><p>In the present study, the etch-and-rinse adhesives tested gave similar results both with the expert operators and the undergraduate student, showing little sensitivity to operator skill. On the other hand, although the self-etch adhesive did not require any preliminary etching and this reduces the margin of error by the undergraduate student, two of the self-etch adhesives tested (XE, LP) were especially sensitive to operator skill and demonstrated their efficacy when used by the expert operators. The present study showed that the results are more dependent on the operator and interactions between the operator and materials, rather than the choice of material.
