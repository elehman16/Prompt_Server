Endodontic treatment is considered the last option for keeping a primary tooth that has irreversibly affected pulp tissue due to caries in a child. The aim of pulpectomy is to preserve teeth in a symptom free state until they are replaced by their successor naturally during the transition from primary to permanent dentition, thus avoiding extraction. The adequate restoration of the involved teeth may preserve the arch length, reestablish the masticatory function and esthetics and prevent harmful tongue habits and speech alterations due to anterior teeth decay. The rationale includes the chemical and mechanical removal of irreversibly inflamed or necrotic radicular pulp tissue, followed by root canal filling with a material that can resorb at the same rate as the primary tooth and be eliminated rapidly if accidentally extruded through the apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Zinc oxide&#x02013;eugenol (ZOE) was reported to more successfully manage those hyperemic primary pulp teeth than iodoform containing Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> pastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless it has been reported to have a possibility to alter the path of eruption of the succedaneous tooth when it extrudes beyond the apex of the tooth because of forming a hard mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As far as resorption rate was concerned, ZOE often showed characteristic of slower rate than that of the primary teeth root resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Various clinical and radiographic success rates (65&#x02013;100%) of iodoform have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, Moskovitz et al. found that root resorption of primary molars is accelerated following pulpectomy with iodoform filling material in comparison with teeth without endodontic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The success rate with calcium hydroxide varied between 86.7 and 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Its main disadvantage is when used in primary teeth with hyperemic pulp, calcium hydroxide can come in contact with some vital pulp tissue remnants and can trigger the cascade of inflammatory root resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Vitapex, which mainly contains calcium hydroxide and iodoform, were also discovered the early intraradicular resorption of the material, which means that the resorption rate is faster than that of the primary teeth root resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Though Nurko et al. found Vitapex was resorbed extraradicularly and intraradicularly without apparent ill effect, whether this affects the prognosis of pulpectomised teeth requires confirmation by further studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">These root canal filling materials for primary teeth available at present do not fully meet the ideal requirements of primary teeth root canal treatment. The failure of root canal therapy in many primary teeth is due to inappropriate degradation of the material. The hypothesis of the study was adding the more resorbable materials (iodoform and calcium hydroxide) into ZOE would get favourable absorbability results of the mixture and improve the success rate of treatment. In this prospective study, a modified primary root canal filling (MPRCF), a mixture of ZOE, iodoform, and calcium hydroxide, was made and used in pulpectomies of primary molars in clinic. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the success rate of MPRCF, ZOE and Vitapex, which were the popular choose of dentists, as primary molar root canal filling materials and to compare the resorption rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of MPRCF</title><p id="Par14">In an in vitro study, the preparation of MPRCF was tested. The proportions of ZOE and iodoform were determined by the consistency of the paste and manufacturers guidance, approximately 1:1 in volume. Five different weight of calcium hydroxide, 0.01&#x000a0;g&#x03001;0.02&#x000a0;g&#x03001;0.03&#x000a0;g&#x03001;0.04&#x000a0;g and 0.05&#x000a0;g, was added and the applicable setting time of mixture was recorded. Calcium hydroxide could accelerate the setting process and the more calcium hydroxide added, the shorter the setting time. The final amount of calcium hydroxide was determined in as low as 0.01&#x000a0;g. The eventual proportion of ZOE: iodoform: calcium hydroxide in the MPRCF was 0.28&#x000a0;g: 0.18&#x000a0;g: 0.01&#x000a0;g. The working time was 6&#x000a0;min and 50&#x000a0;s and setting time was 31&#x000a0;min, which was suitable for clinical use. The pH of MPRCF was 9.8.

At the first appointment, the molar was isolated with a rubber dam following local anaesthesia. The pulp chamber was accessed after removal of all carious tooth structures. Pulpal debris was removed with barbed broaches. The working length was determined by superimposing an endodontic instrument over the preoperative radiograph and keeping it 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mm short of the radiographic apex. Cleaning and shaping of the root canals was carried out using Mani k files (MANI Inc., Tochigi, Japan). The files were used sequentially in a pullback direction up to a maximum size of 35&#x02013;40.

A tooth was categorized as overfilled even if other roots were filled short or adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The bacterial leakage test model of Sisodia R et al. indicated that Zinc Oxide Eugenol showed no bacterial leakage and better resistance to bacterial leakage than Apexit plus (a calcium hydroxide based root canal sealer paste) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. ZOE showed better inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated than Vitapex, Calcium hydroxide and Metapex, which proved by Harini PM et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These characteristics may be the cause of good clinical manifestations of ZOE, and was also the reason why the present study chooses the ZOE as the main component of the mixed paste.</p><p id="Par37">However, particles of extruded material remained evident after 18&#x000a0;months in most cases in the ZOE group, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several researchers found that ZOE extruded extraradicularly was resorbed slowly and might need several months or even years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Allen explained the reason might be the ability of ZOE to resist phagocytising macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. With respect to the negative effect of extruded ZOE, Ozalp et al. and other investigators observed that ZOE caused the permanent tooth germ to erupt abnormally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The relatively high number of overfilled molars for the ZOE (41.2%) and MPRCF (41.5%) groups was caused by the use of lentulo spirals and the consistency of pastes. There is no apical constriction of root in primary teeth and measuring the working length in primary teeth is relatively difficult also contributed to the extrusion of material.</p><p id="Par39">In this study, patients with Vitapex that extruded beyond the apex all exhibited complete resorption within six months, which consisted with other researchers&#x02019; findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Vitapex had been used as root filling material in primary tooth pulpectomies for many years until rescently researchers have observed that Vitapex resorption was faster than root canal in follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Ramar reported 56.6% of Vitapex treated teeth showed material resorption ahead of the roots in 9&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present study, when Vitapex was resorbed faster than roots, 55% teeth failed in radiographic evaluation and 61% the radiographic-failed cases exhibited clinical signs and symptoms. Our study confirmed that the excessive resorption rate of root canal filling affected both clinical and radiographic success rate. Though Nurko et al. found Vitapex was resorbed faster than roots without apparent ill effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the authors mentioned a longer follow-up is recommended to evaluate if there is any effect on the permanent succedaneous tooth. Actually the early resorption of Vitapex may form a narrow channel for bacterial growth and cause reinfection in the root canal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nakornchai and Banditsing also revealed the clinical success rate of Vitapex could as high as 96%, but the 6- and 12-month radiographic success rates were 80 and 56% respectively; their findings were similar to ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Root canal filling material of primary teeth should be resorbed at an identical rate, or as similarly as possible, to that of physiological root resorption. This study used a modified paste comprising a mixture of ZOE, iodoform, and calcium hydroxide as root canal filling material in primary molars. Our results indicated that the modified paste with a success rate of 92.5% is a much better material compared with Vitapex and had better absorbability compared with ZOE alone. The possible reason was that the mixture does not set into a hard mass. The potential mechanism lied in two aspects. Firstly, the essence of formation of ZOE is the reaction of eugenol and bivalent zinc ions to form insoluble chelation, wrapping remanent zinc oxide in it and forming a solid mass. Because calcium ion dissolves more easily than zinc ions, adding calcium hydroxide forms divalent metal chelate salt containing mainly eugenol calcium. Owing to the high solubility of calcium hydroxide, the reaction time is shorter, but strength of chelation was slightly low, thus degrade more quickly. Secondly, iodoform dissolves easily upon contact with solutions and tissue fluid, changing the structure of the filling mass to a porous and loose state that might be resorbed more easily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Interestingly, Endoflas, produced in South America, also comprising of triiodomethane, zinc oxide eugenol, calcium hydroxide, has been reported having the resorption limited to the excess material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and resorbs at the same pace as the physiological resorption of root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The antimicrobial efficacy in-vitro study showed Endoflas had good antimicrobial potential against eight microbial strains including E. faecalis compared to other primary root canal filling materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Specifically, MPRCF had the advantage of resorption that was limited to the material extruded extraradicularly without intraradicular early resorption. As the property of resorption, the MPRCF fulfilled the basic requirement of an ideal root canal filling material for primary molars more compared with ZOE. However, further in-depth study is need to complete the in-vitro antibacterial effects of this combination and understanding the degradation mechanism of this mixed root filling material and longitudinal study involving a larger sample size is necessary to evaluate the success and resorpsion rate until the teeth&#x02019; eventual exfoliation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Endodontic treatment using a mixture of ZOE, iodoform, and calcium hydroxide in primary teeth has shown better clinical and radiographic success than Vitapex at 12 and 18&#x000a0;months and had similar success rate with ZOE. The MPRCF can be considered an effective root canal filling material in primary teeth due to its better resorbable characteristics.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>MPRCF</term><def><p id="Par6">Mixed primary root canal filling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ZOE</term><def><p id="Par7">Zinc oxide&#x02013;eugenol</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the residents and the nursing staff at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, First Dental Center, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology who were involved in the management and care of our patients.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par43">This research received grant from the Funds Program for New Clinical Techniques and Therapies of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par44">The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and its additional file.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par45">XC contributed to the implementation of the study, analysis and writing of this manuscript.
