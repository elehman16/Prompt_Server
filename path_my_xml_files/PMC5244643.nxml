Magnesium (Mg) sulfate is a candidate for muscle relaxant substitute. This study was designed to determine the effect of Mg sulfate accompanied with propofol and fentanyl in patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a double-blind randomized protocol and before tracheal intubation, Mg sulfate 40, 45, or 50 mg/kg in 100 ml of saline (Groups 1&#x02013;3, respectively) or saline alone (Group 4) were administrated intravenously in 100 patients (<italic>n</italic> = 25 in each group) with the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical Status I, II, or III.

However, they are accompanied with some side effect, and it is extremely important for the anesthesiologist to have an appropriate tracheal intubation without using neuromuscular blocking agents. Aissaoui <italic>et al</italic>. designed a double-blind study in patient with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASAs) I and II, and they reported that Mg sulfate improved intubation without using the neuromuscular blocking drug.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hans <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that intravenous administration of 50 mg/kg of Mg reduced the train-of-four ratio in patients when compared with control group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In patient undergoing thyroidectomy, 30 mg/kg of Mg sulfate administration prevented remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while in patient undergoing thoracotomy, a bolus dose of 30&#x02013;50 mg/kg of Mg sulfate followed by continuous dose of 500 mg/h during the operation reduced intraoperative analgesic requirement.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It is suggested to find the role of Mg intracheal intubation old patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of Mg sulfate accompanied with propofol and fentanyl as anesthesia induction in 60&#x02013;85-year-old patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was designed as a double-blind clinical trial in 100 patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery in Feiz Hospital during the year of 2013, and it was approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Ethic Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient after introduce them with study detail and design. The including criteria was 60&#x02013;85 years old, physical Status of I, II, or III based on ASA, Class of 1, 2, or 3 from modified Mallampati test, Class of 1, 2, or 3 from upper lip bite test (ULBT), body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 30, and thyromental distance (TMD) &#x0003e;6.5 cm. As excluding criteria, the patients with a history of hyper reactive airways disease, treatment with calcium channel blockers, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory or hepatic diseases, or allergy to any of study drugs were excluded from the study. All patients were in non per oral (NPO) condition for 8 h, and during this period they were received 1/3&#x02013;2/3 crystalloid solution based on 4, 2, 1 law. They were subjected to Mallampati test, ULBT and TMD determination. The Mallampati class was assessed by asking the patients in sitting posture to open his/her mouth and protrude the tongue as much as possible. The Mallampati classes were classified as Class 1: Soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillaris visible; Class 2: Soft palate, uvula, fauces visible; Class 3: Soft palate, base of uvula visible, and Class 4: Only hard palate visible. ULBT was achieved by asking the patients to bite their upper lip with lower incisor, and it was categorized as Class 1: Lower incisor can hide mucosa of the upper lip; Class 2: Lower incisor can partially hide mucosa of the upper lip, and Class 3: Lower incisor unable to touch mucosa of upper lip. The TMD was measured from the thyroid notch to the tip of the jaw with head extended. Blood samples were obtained before the operation for determination of serum Mg. Before and during the operation, all patients were monitored via electrocardiogram, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation, and noninvasive blood pressure; systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) determination.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into four groups using the random table numbers list. The first number was assigned to the first group and so on. The randomization and drug infusion were blind for the anesthesiologist. Before infusion of any drugs, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured and recorded (Applanation Tono-Pen, Avia, Reichert Inc., Depew, NY, USA). The patients (total = 100) received 40 (Group 1, <italic>n</italic> = 25), 45 (Group 2, <italic>n</italic> = 25), 50 (Group 3, <italic>n</italic> = 25) mg/kg of Mg sulfate in 100 ml of saline, and saline alone (Group 4, <italic>n</italic> = 25). The infusion time for Mg sulfate/or saline was 10 min, and 7 min after the beginning of Mg sulfate infusion fentanyl (3 &#x003bc;g/kg) was administrated intravenously in the period of 3 min accompanied with oxygenation. Finally, propofol (2.5 mg/kg) was infused intravenously in 15 s, and 1 min later, the patient was subjected to tracheal intubation. The time from laryngoscope entrance to the end of tracheal intubation was recorded. Ten min after tracheal intubation, the second blood sample for Mg determination was obtained. The serum level of Mg was measured by an autoanalyzer using Pars Azmoon (Tehran, Iran) kit.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on the previous study, the acceptable intubation condition (IC) in was 60%[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and need to improve to 90% by Mg sulfate.

Our finding indicated that MVF qualification was better in Mg sulfate 45 group (Group 2). This factor was not determined in Aissaoui <italic>et al</italic>. study.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, similar result to Aissaoui <italic>et al</italic>. study was found for VCM data indicating the positive effect role of Mg sulfate during laryngoscopy. Each dose of Mg sulfate caused the lesser needs of MRR. Similar to our study, Hans <italic>et al</italic>. used rocuronium for tracheal intubation, and they reported that administration of Mg reestablishes the degree of muscle paralysis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Other study demonstrated that 10 and 20 mg/kg of Mg before rocuronium reduced the overall movement in patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the contrary, some of our findings such as LD, CL, IC, or ITR are different from other studies,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and possibly the non-similarity is related to our study power. Regarding hemodynamics response, we did not find a significant decrease in SBP, DBP, or HR after drugs infusion and after anesthesia induction while Puri <italic>et al</italic>. showed that Mg sulfate infusion reduced mean arterial pressure by 17%.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Similar to our results, Aissaoui <italic>et al</italic>. study also did not indicate any significant difference in HR and mean arterial pressure between Mg sulfate receiver and control groups.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Mg sulfate administration increased the serum level of Mg after intubation. However, no significant difference in serum level of Mg was observed when different doses of Mg sulfate (40, 45, or 50 mg/kg) were infused. Aissaoui <italic>et al</italic>. did not measured the serum level of Mg,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but other studies demonstrated that Mg sulfate (50 mg/kg) increase the serum level of Mg.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, the serum level of Mg was increased about 40% which is not clinically significant with any adverse effect.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>When clinical limitation is existed to use muscle relaxant, intravenous infusion of Mg sulfate could be a choice to facilitate tracheal intubation, and the infused Mg sulfate does not elevate the plasma level of Mg to clinical significant.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This research was supported by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Grant number: 292191).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>HAS was involved in study design, collecting the data and in preparing the article.
