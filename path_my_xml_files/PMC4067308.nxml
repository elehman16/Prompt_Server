MBL-HCV1 is a fully human monoclonal antibody recognizing a linear epitope of the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (amino acids 412&#x02013;423). The ability of MBL-HCV1 to prevent HCV recurrence after liver transplantation was investigated in a phase 2 randomized clinical trial evaluating six MBL-HCV1-treated subjects and five placebo-treated subjects. MBL-HCV1 treatment significantly delayed time to viral rebound compared with placebo treatment. Here we report results from high-throughput sequencing on the serum of each of the eleven enrolled subjects prior to liver transplantation and after viral rebound. We further sequenced the sera of the MBL-HCV1-treated subjects at various interim time points to study the evolution of antibody-resistant viral variants. We detected mutations at one of two positions within the antibody epitope&#x02014;mutations of N at position 415 to D, K or S, or mutation of N at position 417 to S. It has been previously reported that N415 is not glycosylated in the wild-type E2 protein, but N417S can lead to glycosylation at position 415. Thus N415 is a key position for antibody recognition and the only routes we identified for viral escape, within the constraints of HCV fitness in vivo, involve mutating or glycosylating this position. Evaluation of mutations along the entire E1 and E2 proteins revealed additional positions that changed moderately before and after MBL-HCV1 treatment for subsets of the six subjects, yet underscored the relative importance of position 415 in MBL-HCV1 resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by MassBiologics, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA.

Unfortunately, recurrence of hepatitis C infection post-transplantation is nearly universal. While serum HCV RNA levels initially decline with removal of the infected liver, circulating virions infect the donor liver within hours and viral concentrations increase rapidly in most patients, often exceeding pre-transplant levels <xref rid="pone.0100325-GarciaRetortillo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100325-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recurrent HCV disease is often more aggressive in the setting of post-transplant immunosuppression, with accelerated cirrhosis, increased risk of graft failure, and death <xref rid="pone.0100325-Crespo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100325-GallegosOrozco1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>MBL-HCV1 is a novel fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody (MAb) isolated from mice expressing human antibody genes (Medarex, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb). MBL-HCV1 binds a highly-conserved linear epitope of the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (amino acids 412&#x02013;423) and neutralizes a broad range of genotypes in vitro <xref rid="pone.0100325-Broering1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. MBL-HCV1 is capable of preventing HCV infection in a chimpanzee model of acute HCV <xref rid="pone.0100325-Morin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Treatment of chronically-infected chimpanzees with a single dose of MBL-HCV1 led to suppression of viral load in a subset of animals for up to 14 days, with viral rebound coinciding with the emergence of antibody-resistant virus. Alterations at amino acid positions 415 (N415K and N415D) and 417 (N417S) within the MBL-HCV1 epitope dominated the viral population in chimpanzees post-treatment <xref rid="pone.0100325-Morin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The ability of MBL-HCV1 to prevent HCV recurrence after liver transplantation is being investigated in clinical trials as current treatment options are limited. In a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in this target population, treatment with MBL-HCV1 significantly delayed median time to viral rebound compared to placebo treatment <xref rid="pone.0100325-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The strong selective pressure of this neutralizing antibody resulted in the emergence of MBL-HCV1 resistance-associated variants (RAVs), as determined by conventional cloning and Sanger sequencing methods in all subjects receiving MAb monotherapy. The time to emergence of detectable RAVs varied from 6 to 42 days and was associated with a rebound in circulating viral titer.</p><p>In this article, we use high-throughput next generation sequencing to investigate the presence of resistance mutations to MAb pre-transplant and examine the post-transplant evolution of HCV variants in the presence and absence of MBL-HCV1 antibody (SRA study accession number SRP037575).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of HCV E1/E2 Variants at Time of Viral Rebound</title><p>Eleven enrolled subjects underwent liver transplantation in a phase 2 clinical study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100325-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0100325-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Six subjects were randomized to receive MBL-HCV1 (subjects A&#x02013;F) and five subjects were randomized to placebo (subjects G&#x02013;K). To assess viral RNA sequences found in serum samples obtained during the clinical study, a high-throughput sequencing methodology was developed. We initially applied high-throughput next generation sequencing to samples obtained following 2 log<sub>10</sub> viral rebound in MBL-HCV1-treated subjects. For placebo subjects, samples obtained 7&#x02013;21 days post-transplantation were also sequenced. The frequencies of amino acid alterations at the positions associated with resistance to MBL-HCV1 neutralization were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100325-t001">

The amount of template in these samples was limited by the low viral load at these early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100325-g001">

On Day 4 post-transplantation, none of the subjects had detectable levels of variants associated with resistance to MBL-HCV1. By Day 7 post-transplant, neither Subject B nor Subject C had detectable 415 or 417 variants, but Subject A had a dominant population of RAVs (a mixture of N415D and N417S) (data not shown). High-throughput sequencing of additional samples obtained from Subject A during the first post-transplant week revealed detectable resistance-associated variants on Day 3 (N417S, 6.9%), but not on Day 4 or Day 5 (data not shown). By Day 6, however, resistance associated variants (N415D 26.5% and N417S 53.7%) predominated the viral pool, even before the viral load had appreciably increased in this subject).</p><p>Given the limited amount of starting template in serum samples from MAb-treated subjects in the first week post-transplant, multiple samples with viral titers &#x0003c;3, 000 IU/ml were sequenced a second time to assess the reproducibility of these results. For subject A when library DNA from the Day 3 sample (1,930 IU/ml), in which low-level RAV (N417S) were detected in the initial analysis, was recreated with the same sets of primers and re-sequenced, the N417S resistance-associated variant was no longer detected. For the Day 4 sample (1,213 IU/ml), E1/E2 DNA sequences were amplified from the original RNA preparation, subjected to 2 additional rounds of re-amplification with subject-specific primers, and sequenced. This technique resulted in the detection of 2 resistance-associated variants that predominated the eventual viral rebound: N415D (1.9%) and N417S (17.4%). The Day 5 sample was extracted from a new aliquot of serum from that time point and amplified using the same techniques as the original Day 5 sample. The repeat of sequencing from this timepoint revealed N415D (13.9%) and N417S (2.8%) resistance-associated variants that were not detected in the original sequencing run. Finally, re-extraction of RNA and re-sequencing of the Day 6 timepoint yielded the same resistance associated variants as the prior run, but at significantly lower frequencies compared with the previous sequencing run (N415D 16.2% vs. 26.5% and N417S 19.0% vs. 53.7%).</p><p>These inconsistencies were also observed when low titer samples from a second subject were re-sequenced. For Subject B, the Day 4 sample (2,704 IU/ml) was amplified from the same RNA preparation and analyzed by high throughput sequencing. Interestingly, there were detectable levels of N415K (7.82%), the variant that eventually dominated the viral population at the time of rebound, when this Day 4 sample was re-sequenced. However, when the RNA from the Day 7 sample (1,010 IU/ml) from the same subject (Subject B) was re-extracted, amplified, and re-sequenced, there were no detectable 415 or 417 variants. These findings demonstrate the limitations in the reproducibility of detecting low-level variants contained within low-titer samples.</p><p>When serum samples with titers &#x0003e;10,000 IU/ml were subjected to repeat sequencing however, the results were quite reproducible. For example, subject A had a post-rebound viral titer of 35,530,988 IU/ml on Day 14 after transplantation. Two independent amplification and sequencing runs yielded a frequencies of 78.53&#x02013;83.37% for the N415D variant and 15.54&#x02013;20.47% for the N417S variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sequence evolution within the MBL-HCV1 epitope</title><p>Having analyzed positions 415 and 417, we also interrogated the entire MBL-HCV1 epitope (amino acids 412&#x02013;423) to assess whether there were combinations of positions that likely contribute to resistance.

Two of the MAb-treated subjects had a high frequency of the I414V variant of this canonical sequence (26.2% in subject A and 91.3% in subject D). By the day of viral rebound, the pre-transplant dominant epitope sequence dramatically declined in all MAb-treated subjects.

For each position, we performed a chi-square test to quantify the change in the amino-acid distributions between day 0 and the day of rebound, using the day 0 distribution as the expected frequencies and the distribution at rebound as the observed frequencies. A larger chi-square value would therefore correspond to a greater deviation from the day 0 distribution.</p><p>We performed this analysis on all 621 sequenced positions across 6 MBL-HCV1-treated and 4 placebo-treated subjects; subject J in the placebo group could not be analyzed due to low post-rebound viral titers (&#x0003c;10,000 IU/ml). The degree of variation at each amino acid position post-viral rebound was ranked by comparing the difference in the average chi-square values among the MAb-treated subjects and the average chi-square values among the placebo-treated subjects.

Owing to very high coverage and the sensitivity of this method to coverage, we found that many positions changed significantly between day 0 and the day of rebound. However, the difference in average magnitudes of the amino acid variation between MAb- and placebo-treated subjects at position 415 was 10 times higher than the next highest position, 417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100325-g003">

Moreover, the heatmap shows that positions 415 and 417 are highly significant across all six MAb-treated subjects and the other positions were only highly significant among subsets of patients. Changes at these other positions co-occur with alterations at position 417 in a subset of MAb-treated subjects (A and D) and could either interfere with MBL-HCV1 binding through an indirect or allosteric effect or could potentially represent compensatory changes which enhance infectivity of the RAVs.

As resistance-associated variants to MBL-HCV1 were not detectable in MAb-treated subjects prior to therapy, we are unable to evaluate the virologic response in subjects with pre-existing variation in E1/E2 that could potentially impact neutralization. Given the time required for three of the six subjects to present with viral rebound (&#x0003e;14 days), either RAV were not present in the viral population at the time of treatment or any RAV present prior to treatment required additional mutations to acquire replication fitness in at a minimum these three treated subjects. Given the rapid replication rate of the Hepatitis C virus within in the host, it is unlikely that the differences in time to viral rebound observed within the MAb cohort were a result of varying levels of pre-existing resistance-associated variants prior to transplantation.</p><p>We attempted to evaluate the evolution of the viral population in the early post-transplant period; however, our evaluations were severely limited by the low HCV viral load in these samples. This effect was most pronounced in the MAb-treated group, where serum samples with HCV RNA concentrations &#x0003c;1000 IU/ml were unable to be successfully amplified. In addition, the biologic reproducibility of sequencing results from samples containing HCV RNA serum titers between 1000&#x02013;10,000 IU/ml was poor. Although deep sequencing significantly increases the sensitivity and resolution of sequencing in clinical samples, the ability to draw conclusions from samples with low viral concentrations remains limited by the starting amount of viral template.

Sequence analysis of the 412&#x02013;423 epitope in its entirety revealed that the 415 and 417 changes were never observed in the same virus. Interestingly, the N417S mutation mostly likely affected neutralization through its impact on the 415 position, by shifting the N-X-S glycosylation site to the asparagine at position 415. Recent in vitro studies have also confirmed this in vivo observation. Pantua et al. <xref rid="pone.0100325-Pantua1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> synthesized the N417S variant of E2, observed decreased ability to neutralize virus in vitro with epitope I-directed antibodies, and confirmed glycosylation of the 415 asparagine by mass spectroscopy. The change at position 415 also appeared to be sufficient to confer resistance, in an otherwise replication competent virus, as there were no other sites on the E1/E2 glycoprotein that were consistently mutated at the time of rebound in multiple subjects. This is supported by the exposed &#x0201c;flap-like&#x0201d; structure of the MBL-HCV1 epitope <xref rid="pone.0100325-Kong2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that is apparently not embedded in the E2 core structure <xref rid="pone.0100325-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, reducing the likelihood of interaction with other residues at least within the main core structure (positions 412&#x02013;645).</p><p>There are both pre-clinical as well as emerging clinical evidence to suggest that addition of a second antiviral agent with a discrete mechanism of action can impair the development of resistance.

Given that the baseline frequency of HCV variants with resistance associated mutations in E2 412&#x02013;423 appears to be low and that post-transplant viral rebound is delayed until after day 7, antibody-based peri-transplant treatment could provide a safe, well-tolerated therapy that can be started at the time of transplant surgery and allow a window of a few days for a small molecule antiviral agent targeting a different stage of the viral life cycle to be added once the patient has stabilized and graft function is established.

Reamplified products were prepared for high-throughput sequencing as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>High-Throughput Sequence Acquisition and Data Analysis</title><p>All samples were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to yield 100-nucleotide paired-end reads. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100325.s003">Table S3</xref></bold> provides detailed statistics on the sequencing datasets of all samples. Sequence quality was assessed using the FastQC software {<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>} and samples with inadequate quality were re-sequenced. In order to maintain comparable sequencing accuracies between samples, only reads with a quality score of 28 or higher for the first 50 bases were included in the analyses. These reads were mapped to a database of 581 E1/E2 HCV1 sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing from 27 HCV-infected individuals, including the 11 subjects in the current protocol. The BWA software <xref rid="pone.0100325-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> was used for read mapping, allowing a maximum of 5 mismatches per read. Datasets with an average fold-coverage of less than 40,000 reads per base were discarded. If multiple sequencing runs of the same sample passed the above criterion, the dataset with the greatest fold coverage was used for downstream analysis.</p><p>Sequencing error for each dataset was estimated by computing the mean and standard deviation of error per base (percentage of reads with incorrect base calls) in the invariant 3&#x02032;-end primer region. The detection threshold for each sample was defined as the mean plus one standard deviation of the error rate, i.e., a nucleotide variant is considered to be present in a sample if its frequency is higher than the detection threshold. The sensitivity thresholds ranged from 0.5&#x02013;3.5% across the datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100325.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100325.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
