Adequate pain control can have a substantial impact on morbidity and patient satisfaction. To date, no standard of care exists and management is based on surgeon preferences. The purpose of our study is to examine the role of intercostal nerve block and local bupivacaine injection in pain management following subpectoral breast augmentation.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> This study was a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial with ethical approval. Thirty-two consecutive women undergoing subpectoral breast augmentation were enrolled. Patient received general anesthesia and were allocated randomly to two study groups. Patient in group 1 received intercostal nerve block using 10&#x02009;ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine in one side of the breast and normal saline in another side prior to implant placement. Patient in group2 received locally administered of 20&#x02009;ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine at the surgical site in one side of breast and placebo infiltration of normal saline in the contralateral breast. Both the patient and evaluator were blinded to the side given anesthesia and method of anesthesia used. Primary outcome was pain measured with the visual analogue scale recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours at rest and after movement. Pain score was compared between breasts (anesthesia vs placebo) and between types of anesthesia. By comparing analgesic outcomes in the same patients, we could control for the subjectivity of pain assessments. A p-value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> Postoperative pain gradually decreased with time in all patients. No difference in pain scores was found over time at rest or on movement when comparing Intercostal nerve block to placebo or local infiltration to placebo. There was also no statistically significant difference in pain between intercostal nerve block and local infiltration of bupivacaine. All patients can return to normal activities within 48 hours after surgery.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Our study did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in postoperative pain when comparing those receiving intercostal nerve block versus placebo and those receiving local administered bupivacaine versus placebo. No beneficial effect of reducing postoperative pain demonstrated regardless of the type of local anesthetic used.</p></body></article>
