The increased relative risk of an individual developing a smoking-related disease is associated with both the number of years in which they have been smoking as well as the number of cigarettes smoked daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The principal factor in this elevated risk is exposure to a number of smoke toxicants which are present in cigarette smoke following the combustion of tobacco in the cigarette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Reducing the deleterious individual and population-level impacts of cigarette smoking on health has become a public health priority, leading to the development of a variety of different initiatives across the world to encourage reducing toxicant exposure through smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Despite these efforts, smoking rates in adult populations worldwide remain at 15%&#x02013;25%. Although numbers are declining slowly in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the World Health Organisation (WHO) has forecast that there will be around 1.5 billion tobacco smokers worldwide in 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Current scientific study and public policy debate, therefore, are concerned with whether public health gains could arise from reducing future exposure to toxicants in people who continue to use tobacco through the development of new tobacco products.</p><p id="Par49">Smoke from conventional cigarettes is a complex and dynamic mixture of more than 5600 identified chemical constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], in both its particulate and vapour phases. Some of these chemicals have been identified as potential contributors to the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and can be evaluated by measuring the levels of these chemicals themselves, or their metabolites, in urine. Nicotine, a chemical also found naturally in tobacco leaf and which transfers into cigarette smoke, is primarily responsible for the addictive properties of cigarette smoking. Nicotine is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream during cigarette smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], from where it is rapidly distributed causing both systemic and central effects. In the central nervous system, nicotine acts at neuronal nicotinic receptors and this interaction may underpin its effects on mood and relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic profile of nicotine during cigarette smoking is a rapid rise and fall in plasma nicotine concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Correspondingly, the delivery of nicotine to the brain, and the consequent pleasurable effects experienced by the smoker, are also rapid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">In the 2001 report by the US Institute of Medicine (IoM) entitled &#x02018;<italic>Clearing the Smoke: the scientific basis for tobacco harm reduction&#x02019;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the development of potential reduced-exposure products (PREPs) was suggested as a possible way to achieve tobacco harm reduction. PREPs were defined at that time as products that result in substantial reductions in exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants and that can reasonably be expected to reduce the risk of developing one or more specific diseases or adverse health effects as compared with risks conferred by use of traditional tobacco products. Although the development of a reduced toxicant combustible cigarette with the properties of a PREP has been described, a long-term clinical study failed to show many significant changes in biological indicators of cigarette smoke exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since that time, the development of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and their rapid evolution has led to a significant body of evidence being developed in support of e-cigarettes as PREPs, evidenced not least by several public health bodies in the UK suggesting that e-cigarette use is likely to be significantly less harmful than cigarette smoking (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). The uptake of e-cigarettes by smokers however has not been universal, suggesting that perhaps in those smokers who would prefer a more cigarette-like experience, other forms of reduced toxicant nicotine delivery systems may be needed to encourage a behavioural change towards a reduced exposure form of tobacco and nicotine use.</p><p id="Par51">Tobacco heating products (THPs) are electronic devices that heat a specially designed tobacco stick, typically to temperatures lower than 350&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. It is important to distinguish THPs from e-cigarettes, which heat a tobacco-free nicotine solution. This temperatures at which THPs operate do not facilitate tobacco combustion and as a consequence far fewer chemical toxicants are formed and of those formed, the majority are reduced significantly. However, data from this and other similar tobacco products suggests that nicotine is still released into the inhaled aerosol to a level not dissimilar to that of conventional cigarettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. THP sticks are similar in appearance to a conventional cigarette and include a filter section at the mouth end of the tobacco stick and contain processed tobacco wrapped by paper. Less is known concerning the properties of THPs compared to conventional cigarettes when actually consumed by humans, both in terms of nicotine delivery and toxicant exposure. In studies in subjects who have switched from smoking to using a commercially available electrically-heated THP, reductions in exposure to a wide range of smoke chemicals have been reported. These effects were rapidly attained and sustained for a period of at least one month of continued use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study we propose to examine exposure to smoke toxicants, using biomarkers of exposure, as well as nicotine pharmacokinetics, in smokers who use a newly-developed THP.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par52">The primary aim of this study is to examine biomarkers of exposure (BoE; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to cigarette smoke toxicants in the breath and urine of smokers who either remain smoking combustible cigarettes, or switch to using a THP device, for 5&#x000a0;days. This will be benchmarked against the reductions seen when a cohort of smokers abstain from the use of any tobacco product for the 5-day period. We further aim to investigate the effect of switching from a cigarette to using a THP on 2 biomarkers of biological effect (BoBE), to determine the pharmacokinetics of nicotine delivery in subjects smoking a conventional cigarette or using a THP, and to examine additional endpoints related to safety, product use, satisfaction and the nicotine metabolite ratio (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study endpoints</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>BoE</td><td>Abbreviation</td><td>Associated Toxicant</td><td>Matrix</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Carbon monoxide</td><td>CO</td><td>Carbon monoxide</td><td>Exhaled breath</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Total nicotine equivalents (nicotine, cotinine, 3-hydroxycotinine and their glucuronide conjugates)</td><td>TNeq</td><td>Nicotine</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol</td><td>Total NNAL</td><td>4 (methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Total N-nitrosonornicotine</td><td>Total NNN</td><td>NNN</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid</td><td>3-HPMA</td><td>Acrolein</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid</td><td>HMPMA</td><td>Crotonaldehyde</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;S-phenylmercapturic acid</td><td>S-PMA</td><td>Benzene</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Monohydroxybutenyl-mercapturic acid</td><td>MHBMA</td><td>1,3-butadiene</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid</td><td>CEMA</td><td>Acrylonitrile</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;4-aminobiphenyl</td><td>4-ABP</td><td>4-Aminobiphenyl</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o-toluidine</td><td>o-Tol</td><td>o-Toluidine</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;2-aminonaphthalene</td><td>2-AN</td><td>2-Aminonaphthalene</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;1-hydroxypyrene</td><td>1-OHP</td><td>Pyrene</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;2-hydroxyethylmercapturic acid</td><td>HEMA</td><td>Ethylene oxide</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)cysteine and N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethyl)cysteine</td><td>AAMA and GAMA</td><td>Acrylamide</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>BoBE</td><td>Abbreviation</td><td>Biological Effect</td><td>Matrix</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;8-Epi-Prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; Type III</td><td>8-Epi-PGF2<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> Type III</td><td>Oxidative stress</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;White blood cell count</td><td>WBC count</td><td>Inflammation</td><td>Whole blood</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Nicotine pharmacokinetic parameters</td><td colspan="2">Abbreviation</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">&#x02003;Time to maximum observed plasma concentration for nicotine</td><td colspan="2">t<sub>max</sub>

This study will be conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Consolidated Guidance, April 1996) and Japanese laws, including those relating to the protection of subjects&#x02019; personal data. All subject names and other potential identifiers will be filed confidentially by the Principal Investigator (PI). Subjects will be identified in documentation and throughout evaluation by the number allotted to them during the study (see section on Randomisation).</p><p id="Par55">The PI will ensure that participants are given full and adequate oral and written information in non-technical terms about the nature, purpose, potential risks and any possible benefits of study participation. Participants will be given time to consider all the information, the opportunity to ask questions and will be required to read, sign and date the informed consent form (ICF; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) that summarises the discussion before participating in any procedures related to the study. The protocol (Version 2.0 dated 17th November 2016) and the ICFs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) were submitted for review to the Hakata Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB), Medical Co. LTA, Fukuoka, Japan<bold>.</bold> A favourable opinion from the IRB was obtained on 16th December 2016 (reference number 1684CP). All substantial protocol amendments will be approved by the IRB responsible for the study and the IRB will be informed of minor amendments to the protocol which do not require their approval.</p><p id="Par56">The study has a forced-switching design to enable data to be obtained about changes in exposure to tobacco smoke toxicants and related biological effects. The effects of THP use will thus be evaluated within individuals (switching smokers serve as their own control) and between individuals (switching versus non-switching smokers). A cessation group will provide information on changes in biomarkers in subjects who quit smoking or use of any tobacco products. The cigarette and cessation comparators were chosen to enable comparison of toxicant exposure in THP users with those of combustible cigarette smokers and smokers who have completely refrained from smoking, respectively.</p><p id="Par57">Financial compensation for the inconvenience to and effort of participants will be offered as part of the study, but the Sponsor does not wish this approach to incentivise participants to smoke. Stipends will, therefore, be calculated independently by the clinics according to the usual rates for this type of clinical study and will be approved by the Hakata Clinic IRB. The stipend therefore offers fair compensation for the inconvenience and effort required of the subjects. Other than subjects in the cessation group, who will receive slightly increased compensation due to the additional discomfort of ceasing all nicotine use for five days, all subjects will receive the same amount of compensation on completion of the study.</p><p id="Par58">Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been carefully tailored so as not to recruit any smoker who is planning to quit smoking in the next 12&#x000a0;months. This study does not force smokers to smoke. The ICF to be signed by each subject will specify the requirements of the study and the risks associated with participation in the study. During the exposure phase of the study there are no specified smoking times, the smoker chooses if and when they smoke. At in-clinic evaluations the subjects must request a cigarette/THP when they wish to smoke. A maximum daily limit of product use will be specified, based on 120% of subjects&#x02019; usual cigarette consumption, to prevent subjects from smoking to a degree greater than they would normally. Such an uplift in smoking behaviour has been observed during clinical studies with cigarettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. During the pharmacokinetic phase, subjects will be requested to smoke 1 cigarette/THP at a specified time.</p><p id="Par59">The age of each subject will be verified using appropriate identification documentation prior to inclusion in the study to ensure subject age restrictions specified in this protocol are complied with.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Selection of study population</title><p id="Par60">In total, 180 male or female smokers will be enrolled in this study.

Any subject who decides to quit smoking will be directed to appropriate stop smoking services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Withdrawal from the study</title><p id="Par66">All subjects will be reminded of the harms associated with smoking prior to enrolment onto the study and that they are free to voluntarily quit smoking and/or withdraw from the study at any time. If they do so, they will receive a pro-rata stipend. Investigators may also at any time withdraw a participant from the study if they deem this action to be in his or her best interest or that of other participants. The end-of-study examination will be undertaken when a participant leaves the study, if he or she agrees, and reasons for withdrawal will be recorded. If a subject cannot be assessed because he or she cannot be contacted after non-attendance of a scheduled event, they will be reported as lost to follow-up.</p><p id="Par67">Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prematurely for the following reasons: if a subject experiences an intolerable adverse event (premature discontinuation will be at the discretion of either the PI or the subject, independent of the relationship of the AE to the study test product); if a subject develops a non-fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria or concurrent disease, which at the discretion of the PI, no longer justifies the subject&#x02019;s participation in this study; or if any deviations occur during the conduct of the study- this may include the subject&#x02019;s erroneous inclusion in the study. Any protocol deviations detected during the study will be corrected when possible and the subject will be allowed to continue. All protocol deviations will be fully documented and considered for their effect on study objectives. Deviations that could lead to subject discontinuation from the study include: deviations which could affect subject&#x02019;s safety (e.g. illness requiring treatment[s]) which in the clinical judgement of the PI (or after discussion with the Medical Monitor) might invalidate the study by interfering with the allocated test product or the willingness of the subject to comply with the study activities; deviations involving the use of any nicotine/tobacco products other than the intended conventional cigarettes or THPs; or deviations involving the use of any nicotine/tobacco products by the cessation group during the exposure period. A subject may also be withdrawn from the study: if the subject is uncooperative, including non-attendance (in these cases, efforts should be made by the PI to ascertain the reason and to ensure subject&#x02019;s attendance as soon as possible); due to pregnancy; due to premature cancellation of the study; or at the subject&#x02019;s personal request: the subject could decide, at any moment of the study, to stop his/her participation. The PI should ensure this is not due to AEs, in which case, this reason should be documented. Subjects do not have to provide a reason for withdrawing from the study if they do not wish to do so. Although withdrawals or dropouts are not expected to be replaced, the Sponsor will consider replacing participants to maintain the power of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Smoking advice and support</title><p id="Par68">Information will be provided regarding the health risks associated with smoking.

To ensure product use compliance in the clinic, all products will be used by subjects under the supervision of suitably qualified staff. Study products will be dispensed by clinic staff each time a study subject wishes to smoke a cigarette or use a THP. Records will be kept of all product usage and these records will be checked by the Clinical Research Associates (CRAs). Subjects in the cessation arm will neither be provided with cigarettes/THPs nor be allowed to enter the smoking rooms. Subjects randomised to one of the THP groups will receive training by clinic staff on how to operate their assigned THP device.

After this period and according to the randomisation code, subjects will either remain smoking regular cigarettes, switch to using a THP, or refrain from using any tobacco products, for a period of 5&#x000a0;days. During this period we will continue to collect 24&#x000a0;h urine samples for BoE analysis. At the end of this 5&#x000a0;day period those in the cessation group will be discharged from the clinic following safety assessments. Subjects in the smoking and THP groups will remain in the clinic for a further day, in order for us to determine their nicotine pharmacokinetic parameters during a single use of their allocated tobacco product. This will be obtained following at least a 12-h abstention from the use of any tobacco products. Following blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis subjects will be discharged from the clinic following safety assessments. All subjects will further be followed up by telephone 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days after their last in-clinic day, to capture any adverse events.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Outline of study procedures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2017_4678_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

We have previously demonstrated exposure reductions in smokers who switch to smoking cigarettes with modified tobacco blend and physical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The current study primarily aims to objectively quantify any changes in exposure when smokers switch to using a THP compared to those who remain smoking conventional cigarettes. Data from this study are expected to increase our understanding of toxicant exposure in users of novel tobacco products and the results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p><p id="Par174">Should any such reduction in exposure be observed, this cannot be extrapolated to a reduction in harm or risk and our previous work has shown that significant reductions in exposure had little or no effect on BoBE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, such an exposure change may be used to add support to a weight of evidence approach to providing a more global assessment of the relative individual risks of using a THP compared to smoking a cigarette, and this would support a follow-up study utilising a broader suite of BoBE to gain an understanding of any risk reduction as a consequence of the change in exposure.</p><p id="Par175">This study will also allow us to determine nicotine pharmacokinetic parameters for the THPs. While such data are readily available for cigarettes and electronic cigarettes few studies have been reported describing nicotine delivery from THPs. Such data are important since effective nicotine delivery is considered to be a potential determinant of both the uptake and continued use of alternatives to cigarette smoking by current smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec57"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par176">The data obtained in this study may be limited by various factors. Firstly, any observed changes in BoE and BoBE could be limited to the types of subject recruited into this study. Daya may not easily be extrapolated into other populations (eg. Westerners) or cohorts (eg. those with a different smoking history or who exhibit different smoking behaviours than those who are recruited into this study). Secondly, although this study will examine a comprehensive suite of BoE the data obtained may not be representative of all smoke chemicals to which smokers may be exposed. Thirdly, due to nature of this short-term clinical confinement study, data obtained may not be presentative of those seen in a real-world (ambulatory) setting over a prolonged period. Finally, although this study will examine a single BoBE, this study will not be able to discern whether switching to any of the study products will have any beneficial health effects or to determine whether any of the test products used will present a lesser risk of smoking-related disease than continued smoking.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec58"><p>
