The testes in men should move slightly due to this contraction. Focus should be on the force of the contraction at the urethra.

So any disturbance in the functioning of this <italic>Chakras</italic> may lead to various sexual dysfunctions. PE also caused by the dysfunction of <italic>Mooladhara</italic> and <italic>Swadhishtana Chakras</italic>. To correct this, various <italic>Asanas</italic> were selected, which basically act on <italic>Mooladhara, Swadhishtana</italic>, and <italic>Ajna</italic> Chakras.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>PE is an extremely common disorder affecting young males. Although an exact mechanism is not known by which Yoga is useful in PE, several postulations could be made about its putative mechanisms of usefulness. Yoga asanas and breathing exercises have long been considered in obtaining the &#x0201c;optimum mental and physical health state.&#x0201d; <italic>Yoga</italic> could perhaps be causing better anxiety control. This assertion is supported by several studies. Measurable decline in anxiety scores could be achieved as early as within 10 days if the patients adopt healthy life style interventions consisting mainly of <italic>asanas, pranayama</italic>, and relaxation techniques. Others have reported that <italic>yoga</italic> promotes well-being, improves quality of life, and has an anti-depressant effect. Relaxation induced by meditation helps to stabilize the autonomic nervous system with a tendency toward parasympathetic dominance. Additional mechanisms contributing to a state of calm alertness includes increased parasympathetic drive, calming of stress response systems, neuroendocrine release of hormones, and thalamic generators.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] But in the present study, no improvement was observed in both <italic>yoga</italic> and <italic>naturopathy</italic> groups on the questions like PESI 7 (how upset is your sexual partner because of your PE?) PESI 8 (how upset are you because of your PE?), and PESI 9 (how much has your PE affected your life in general?) which generally measures the anxiety, depression, and stress levels of the patient and his partner.</p><p>The <italic>yoga</italic> asanas selected in the present study were aimed at improving the muscle tone and plasticity of pelvic and perineal muscles. <italic>Asanas</italic> supposedly improve blood flow to these muscles and thus aid in better contraction. It has been observed that a regular practitioner of <italic>yoga</italic> shows parasympathetic dominance. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves causes contraction of epididymis, ejaculatory ducts, and seminal vesicles and leads to ejaculation of semen. Increasing parasympathetic stimulation is beneficial in enhancing ejaculatory control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In the present study also, in the <italic>yoga</italic> group, 14.6% of improvement was observed in PESI 4 (IELT), which is in line with the findings of the earlier studies.</p><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Causes for negative results</title><p>Both <italic>Yoga</italic> and <italic>Naturopathy</italic> procedures were proved ineffective in providing relief in PE based on total scores of PESI.
