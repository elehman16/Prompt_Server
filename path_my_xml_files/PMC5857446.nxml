exercises using flexi-bar (FB) on pain, functional disability, transverse abdominis muscle
(TrA) activation capacity and thickness in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned to an experimental (14
patients performing stabilization exercises with flexi-bar (FB)) or control (13 patients
performing stabilization exercises) group. The patients in both groups then underwent
stabilization exercises with or without FB 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. The
main outcome measures were perceived disability based on the pain, Oswestry disability
index (ODI), TrA activation capacity and thickness. [Results] Both groups showed improved
ODI, VAS, and TrA activation capacity performed for 6 weeks in patients with CLBP, but all
outcomes, except for TrA thickness, showed greater improvements in patients following
stabilization exercises with FB than following stabilization exercises. [Conclusion] Based
on the above results, lumbar stabilization exercises with FB could restoring pain,
functional disability and improving TrA activation capacity in CLBP patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Flexi-bar</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Transverse abdominis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Squatting Major factors that trigger low back pain include obesity, decrease in spinal
mobility, increase in lumbar lordosis, tension in the hamstring muscle, weakening of the
abdominal muscles, imbalance in trunk muscle strength, and differences in the lengths of the
legs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is characterized by
instability in the lumbar vertebrae, which triggers problems in postural maintenance and
trunk stability, thus causing functional problems in the body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Instability in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients may be reduced
by muscular adjustment through exercises<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
and selective exercise of transverse abdominis muscle (TrA), lumbar multifidus muscle,
pelvic floor muscle, and diaphragm muscle, which all engage in stabilization<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, spinal stabilization
exercises that increase the contraction capacity of the TrA and lumbar multifidus muscles
alleviate pain and improve function<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stabilization exercises based on the abdominal drawing-in maneuver are widely used to
contract the TrA<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method retrains
the deep muscles using isometric contractions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, minimal contractions of the large muscles, and selective
contraction of the TrA<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It increases
tension in the lumbar and thoracic fasciae, providing stability to the lumbar spine and the
pelvis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The vibrations caused by the flex-bar (FB) are effective in the movement perception through
the generation of proprioceptive stimulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercises with FB increases trunk muscle activity, and
increases the activity of the abdominal muscles and the muscles around the spine<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. But few studies implemented lumbar
stabilization exercises using FB. Therefore, the purpose of this study intends to examine
the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises using FB in patients with CLBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 31 patients of B Hospital. Subjects were excluded for
refusal to participate and one for not enough time to attend. Therefore, the sample
consisted of 27 subjects with CLBP. Subjects were randomized into two exercise groups,
lumbar stabilization exercises with or without FB. The exclusion criteria were: 1) unable to
tolerate the training positions (standing, hook-lying, quadruped, and prone) 2) significant
neurologic involvement (myotomal weakness, impaired sensation, or diminished reflexes) 3)
history of surgery in the area of the lumbar spine, pelvis and lower extremities, 4) any
sickness that could affect the training of the participants (uncontrolled hypertension and
cardiomyopathy) 5) becoming pregnant during the study 6) had a rheumatoid disease.</p><p>All study subjects received explanations about the study procedures, voluntarily
participated, and provided written informed consent. The experimental procedures were
designed and conduced in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Both groups will receive exercise intervention three times a week for 6 weeks, and each
session will involve a warm up for 5 minutes and cool down for 5 minutes.</p><p>Prior to the exercise, the both group was instructed to pull the belly upward and backward
so that the abdominal area was in a slightly concave position, and then maintain a neutral
posture by conducting an abdominal drawing-in maneuver for 10 seconds<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the lumbar stabilization exercise, the experimental group conducted the abdominal
drawing-in maneuver in standing, hook-lying, quadruped, and prone positions by maintaining
each motion for 10 seconds. It was used both hands holding the FB. In quadruped position
were carried out with both hands alternately. Each motion was conducted 10 times in sets of
three repetitions. The patients were instructed to rest in intervals of three minutes
between each set<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FB (Flexi-bar Inc., Germany) used in this study was 1,530&#x02005;mm in length with a thickness
9&#x02005;mm, with a weight 650&#x02005;g. It was used to cause vibrations with a 270 times per minute
(4.6&#x02005;Hz).</p><p>A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the severity of the pain and the effects
of the exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Korean version of the Oswestry disability index (ODI) was used to evaluate functional
disabilities that the subjects experienced because of lumbar pain during daily
activities<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TrA activation capacity was assessed by using the pressure biofeedback unit (PBU,
Chattanooga Group, Australia). The subject will be asked to lie in prone position over a
rigid surface, then a PBU device was placed under the TrA (above the anterior superior iliac
spines). Before subjects were asked to contract the muscle, the device was inflated to a
pressure of 70 mmHg. The subjects are asked to contract the lower stomach for 10 seconds
without moving the back or the hips<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects were positioned supine hook-lying position (hips flexed up to 45&#x000b0; and knees flexed
up to 90&#x000b0;) and the examiners on the right side of the subjects. The thickness of the TrA was
evaluated using the ultrasound measurements (Terason T-3000, Teratech Corp., USA). The
forward lateral margin of the abdomen, a middle area between the 11th costal cartilage and
the iliac crest, was marked, and a 12.5&#x02005;MHz linear transducer was located. For
standardization, the area where the TrA and lumbar and thoracic fasciae met appeared at the
right end of the ultrasound imaging<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
images were collected at the end of the exhalation.</p><p>Data were analysed with the SPSS statistical package (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). The Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test demonstrated a normal distribution of quantitative data
(p&#x0003e;0.05). Paired sample t-tests were conducted to determine if pain, functional
disability, TrA activation capacity, and TrA thickness were significantly different pre to
post for both groups and independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare group
differences. Results were reported as mean and standard deviation. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was
used as an indicator of statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group (5 males, 9 females) had a mean age of 32.47 &#x000b1; 7.89&#x02005;years, weight of

increase in muscle activity, and not significant change of TrA thickness were observed
following lumbar stabilization exercise using FB for six weeks, when compared to
stabilization exercise only.</p><p>The FB is a oscillating exercise device and is effective in the control of nerve roots,
proprioceptive feedback, and muscle strengthening<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study noted that double oscillating exercise device
generates higher levels of activation in the erector spinae muscle than that generated by a
single oscillating device<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous
study reported that bridging exercises with FB exercises increases activation of the trunk
muscle<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreside, Vera-Garcia and
McGill<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> commented to be careful for
using FB for the purpose of spine stability in the subjects with lumbar spine pathology,
while Kim et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> showed high level of
muscle activity with the exercise using FB as a result of tonic vibration reflex occurred by
vibration stimulus.</p><p>Mayer, Mooney and Dagenais<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> observed
that the activation patterns of the abdominal and multifidus muscles of CLBP patients were
different from those of normal people and that stabilization exercise could improve these
activation patterns<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Andrusaitis et
al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that trunk stabilization
exercises triggered co-contraction of the abdominal and multifidus muscles and could be
applied in different postures. Macedo et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that stabilization exercises were effective in alleviating
pain and improving function. Andrusaitis et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that stabilization exercises were more effective than
strengthening exercises in a study where pain and functional disability. VAS decreased from
5.08 to 0.23, and ODI decreased from 11.8 to 3.4 after stabilization exercises. In the
present study, VAS decreased from 6.63 to 1.37 and ODI decreased from 16.35 to 5.21 in the
experimental group. VAS decreased from 6.55 to 3.33 and ODI decreased from 16.02 to 7.23 in
the control group, which showed results similar to those of the previous research. As a
result, the lumbar stabilization exercises with FB have been shown to be more effective in
pain and functional disability.</p><p>Hides, Richardson and Jull<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> insisted that
deep muscles did not recover after pain decreased in CLBP patients, and therefore exercise
to recover these muscles was necessary. Fran&#x000e7;a et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that training of the TrA should be included in
rehabilitation protocols for CLBP patients. A representative method to measure muscle
contraction is a PBU test, which was used in this study to measure the activation capacity
of the TrA. The values ranged from &#x02212;4 to &#x02212;10 mmHg in contractions of normal TrA<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fran&#x000e7;a et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the contraction capacity of TrA when
stabilization exercises and stretching exercises and reported increased contraction capacity
of TrA in stabilization exercises. Stabilization exercise using FB was more effective to
show from &#x02212;3.08 mmHg to &#x02212;6.41 mmHg in the test group than from &#x02212;3.65 mmHg to &#x02212;4.58 mmHg in
the control group in this study, whose exercise method was different from that of the
previous study. This result is consistent with the previous study result that the exercise
using FB with quadruped position developed the equilibrium reaction by continuous vibration
stimuli in the unstable condition, and the muscle activation levels were increased in both
superficial and deep muscles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mannion et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that measuring
the thickness of the TrA to evaluate core stability was important. Their results showed that
the thickness of the TrA of low back pain patients was 21% smaller than that in normal
people<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hides et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> verified the relation between weight load
and the thickness of the TrA, noting that the thickness of the TrA was 4.0&#x02005;mm at rest and
increased to 4.5&#x02005;mm at 25% weight load and to 4.9&#x02005;mm at 45% weight load. Teyhen et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the thickness of the TrA
increased from 3.8&#x02005;mm at rest to 6.1&#x02005;mm during lumbar stabilization in unilateral low back
pain patients. The thickness of the TrA increased from 4.1&#x02005;mm at rest to 6.8&#x02005;mm during
lumbar stabilization in normal subjects, with no difference between the two groups. However,
in a study where abdominal resistance training was conducted for 12 weeks, Noormohammadpour
et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that special TrA
training was necessary that showed TrA played an important role in the stabilization of the
spine. They observed that the thickness of the TrA increased from 0.42&#x02005;mm prior to the
intervention to 0.48&#x02005;mm after the intervention<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the TrA increased from 3.43&#x02005;mm to 4.56&#x02005;mm in
the experimental group and from 4.02&#x02005;mm to 4.94&#x02005;mm in the control group. This result
increased the neuromuscular activities in both the experimental and the control groups,
resulting in increased TrA thickness.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study was its inability to blind the subjects and the
therapist with regard to training allocation. The small number of samples, the relatively
short intervention period of six weeks, and the fact that TrA activation capacity and
thickness in dynamic conditions was not measured. The present study sample is likely not
representative of all CLBP patients. In addition, the changes in the thickness of muscles
and the quality of muscles in relation to age and muscle power should be also studied. Since
only the thickness of the TrA was measured in the present study, measuring and comparing the
thickness of other muscles may different results. Finally, the effects of the exercises
performed by large participants for long-term should be examined in future studies.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bayramo&#x0011f;lu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Akman</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><name><surname>Kilin&#x000e7;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Isokinetic measurement of trunk muscle strength in women
