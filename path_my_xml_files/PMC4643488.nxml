Early antifungal treatment reduces mortality rates in patients with documented IC [<xref rid="CIV707C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but a swift definitive diagnosis is difficult [<xref rid="CIV707C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although prophylaxis or preemptive treatment strategies should be used in patients at high risk for IC [<xref rid="CIV707C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], their identification is clinically challenging, because preemptive intervention markers have not been fully defined.</p><p>Risk factors for IC in critically ill patients include broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, cancer chemotherapy, fungal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, total parenteral nutrition, surgery, renal failure, hemodialysis, and prolonged ICU stay [<xref rid="CIV707C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although these factors can be present in patients who do not have IC and individually are not sufficiently discriminatory, together they can still be used to identify high-risk patients. Risk identification strategies, such as <italic>Candida</italic> colonization index [<xref rid="CIV707C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], clinical predictive rules [<xref rid="CIV707C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a <italic>Candida</italic> score [<xref rid="CIV707C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have been proposed to aid in deciding when to initiate early antifungal therapy [<xref rid="CIV707C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Antifungal prophylaxis in patients at high risk for IC has been investigated in several randomized, controlled trials. Trials in homogenous populations, such as surgical patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages [<xref rid="CIV707C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and severe acute pancreatitis [<xref rid="CIV707C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], showed prophylaxis to be an effective strategy, because infection rates were high with placebo and significantly lower with active antifungal therapy. Studies with heterogeneous ICU patients, however had low incidences of infections in the placebo arms, and treatment differences between placebo and active therapy were not shown [<xref rid="CIV707C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV707C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, antifungal prophylaxis should be used only in specific subgroups where there is clear evidence of benefit [<xref rid="CIV707C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For the majority of ICU patients at high IC risk, a preemptive antifungal strategy, based on clinical risk factors and microbiologic evidence of substantial colonization, is proposed [<xref rid="CIV707C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Patients requiring ICU management after emergency surgery for intra-abdominal infection have a high IC risk [<xref rid="CIV707C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a commensal of the digestive tract, <italic>Candida</italic> may leak into the peritoneal cavity after perforation or during surgical resection of the intestine. Peritoneal seeding can result in intra-abdominal <italic>Candida</italic> infection with risk of dissemination to the bloodstream and extra-abdominal tissue and organs [<xref rid="CIV707C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The INTENSE (Invasive Candidiasis &#x02013; Pre-emptive Treatment in High Risk Surgical Subjects) study assessed the strategy of preemptive antifungal therapy versus placebo in hospitalized patients requiring surgery for intra-abdominal infection. Micafungin was used as the active therapy, and the efficacy and safety of its use in that setting was assessed.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p>INTENSE (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01122368) was an exploratory, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy in adults (aged &#x02265;18 years), who presented with a generalized or localized intra-abdominal infection requiring surgery and an ICU stay. Patients were included if they had a community-acquired (CAI) or nosocomially acquired (NAI) intra-abdominal infection. Patients with CAI were those who presented with intra-abdominal infection before or within 48 hours after hospital admission. Patients with NAI were those who developed intra-abdominal infection &#x0003e;48 hours after hospital admission and were hospitalized for reasons other than infection. Key exclusion criteria were acute pancreatitis, infected intra-peritoneal dialysis, solid organ transplantation, severe liver disease, or neutropenia at randomization. Exclusion criteria included receipt of a systemic antifungal within 14 days before study drug, documented IC at randomization, or expected survival &#x0003c;48 hours. The study was conducted from 13 July 2010 to 15 December 2011.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to intravenous micafungin (100 mg/d) or saline solution as a placebo. Patients were included within 48 hours (NAI) or 72&#x02013;120 hours (CAI) after surgery providing they had an expected minimum ICU stay of 48 hours. Patients were treated for 6 weeks unless they experienced an end of treatment (EOT) event: confirmed IC, improvement in surgical condition (as indicated by recovery of gastrointestinal function allowing enteral feeding of up to 50% of daily calorie requirement), alternative antifungal treatment, or death. If IC was confirmed, study medication was discontinued and alternative antifungal medication was given. The type of surgery and antibiotic required for the treatment of the intra-abdominal infection were prescribed according to center policy. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written or witnessed informed consent was obtained for all patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome Measures and Assessments</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Evaluation for IC</title><p>Patients were evaluated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ707/-/DC1">Supplementary Appendix 1</ext-link>) for IC at baseline, during treatment, at EOT assessment, and at the end of study (EOS). The EOT assessment visit occurred within 1&#x02013;3 days after the last dose of study medication, and the EOS visit occurred 28 days after the last dose. Blinded assessments and confirmation of IC were made by an independent data review board (IDRB) (P. E., C. L., and P. M.), as well as the investigators, based on histologic evidence at biopsy or positive culture from blood, from a freshly placed peritoneal drain or biliary catheter or intra-abdominal abscess.</p><p>The coprimary efficacy variables were the incidence of IDRB-confirmed IC diagnosed between baseline and EOT assessment and the time from baseline to first IDRB-confirmed IC. The start date of a confirmed case was provided by the IDRB, and the time to IC was calculated relative to the date of first dose of study drug. The incidence of IC according to the investigator was also calculated. Post hoc analysis of the incidence of IC confirmed by the IDRB or an investigator (hereafter &#x0201c;any-confirmed&#x0201d; IC) was conducted for all patients and subgroups, as described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ707/-/DC1">Supplementary Appendix 2</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Biomarkers</title><p>The fungal biomarkers (1,3)-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan (&#x000df;DG), <italic>Candida</italic> antibody, mannan antigen, and <italic>Candida</italic> were measured in blood samples at baseline, during treatment and at the EOT assessment; <italic>Candida</italic> antibody and mannan antigen were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and <italic>Candida</italic> was detected by polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Safety</title><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including death, were recorded up to 90 days after EOT.

Similarly for any-confirmed IC (confirmed by the IDRB or investigator), a modified FAS was used, which took into account the any-confirmed IC at baseline. The incidence and time to IDRB-confirmed IC were further assessed in the per-protocol set (PPS), defined as all FAS patients (1) who had an assessment of IC, as confirmed by the IDRB at EOT; (2) received &#x02265;3 days of study medication; (3) had no confirmed IC before baseline, according to the IDRB; and (4) had no major protocol violations.

The differences in IC incidence between micafungin- and placebo-treated patients and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using the Newcombe&#x02013;Wilson method without continuity correction. The time to IDRB-confirmed IC was modeled using the accelerated failure time model, a general model for time-to-event data. The time to IDRB-confirmed IC was presented graphically by nonparametric Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves, with patients without IDRB-confirmed IC during the treatment period censored either on the day of the EOT event or at the EOT assessment. Statistical comparisons were performed using log-rank tests.</p><p>Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of biomarkers on the binary response for IDRB-confirmed IC. All 4 biomarkers were included in the model: &#x000df;DG (&#x02265;62.5 pg/mL for positive response vs &#x0003c;62.5 pg/mL for negative), <italic>Candida</italic> polymerase chain reaction (positive vs negative after &#x0003e;30 cycles), <italic>Candida</italic> antibody (5.0&#x02013;10.0 or &#x0003e;10.0 antibody units [AU]/mL for intermediate or positive, respectively, vs 5.0 AU/mL for negative), and mannan antigen (62.5&#x02013;125 or &#x0003e;125 pg/mL for intermediate or positive vs &#x0003c;62.5 pg/mL for negative). Other covariates (continuous and categorical) included in the model were age, sex, study drug, CAI or NAI, and time from ICU admission to first study drug dose.

In the FAS, the patient selection criteria successfully identified an IDRB-confirmed incidence rate of 8.9% in the placebo arm. However, the incidence of 11.1% in the micafungin arm was unexpected. Because micafungin is an effective treatment for candidemia and IC, this suggests that IC might have been established in these patients and preemptive therapy was administered too late. This supposition is supported by the relatively high number of baseline IC cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="CIV707F1">1</xref>), with the majority of emergent IC cases within the first few study days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="CIV707F2">2</xref>).</p><p>A similar lack of evidence for a prophylaxis antifungal strategy in at-risk ICU patients was found in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of caspofungin [<xref rid="CIV707C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A lower-than-expected IC incidence resulted in a lack of difference between placebo (16.7%) and caspofungin (9.8%). A comparison between preemptive and empiric antifungal therapy with anidulafungin also showed no difference between strategies in the incidence of IC in ICU patients [<xref rid="CIV707C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Antifungal treatment administered in the absence of a proven IC diagnosis was found to have no effect on mortality rates or IC occurrence compared with no treatment in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation, possibly owing to the absence of actual IC [<xref rid="CIV707C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These studies, together with ours, highlight the challenge of demonstrating the benefit of antifungals in the absence of proven IC, even in ICU patient populations with multiple risk factors for IC.</p><p>The challenge of early IC identification in the surgical setting is widely recognized [<xref rid="CIV707C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and for this reason we used blinded assessment and confirmation of IC by an independent panel of experts. The incidence was higher with investigator-diagnosed IC (16.5% for placebo in the FAS), and only some diagnosed infections overlapped with those assessed by the IDRB. The disparity between the IDRB and investigators in the incidence of confirmed IC, a phenomenon observed in other studies [<xref rid="CIV707C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], again illustrates the difficulty in early identification of IC.</p><p>Preliminary studies investigating &#x000df;DG in ICU patients found higher &#x000df;DG levels in those with IC than in those without IC [<xref rid="CIV707C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and its detection has been shown to precede a microbiologic diagnosis by several days [<xref rid="CIV707C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIV707C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, &#x000df;DG was the only biomarker correlating with confirmed IC, although &#x000df;DG measurements were not available for all patients.</p><p>Micafungin was well tolerated in these patients, with one-half the incidence of pyrexia, wound infection, vomiting, and pleural effusion compared with placebo. The incidence of anemia was slightly higher in micafungin-treated patients than in those receiving placebo. No hepatobiliary AEs were related to micafungin. There was no clinically relevant difference in mortality rates between micafungin and placebo.</p><p>Statistical powering of prophylaxis and preemptive trials in ICU patients is difficult, and for this reason INTENSE was designed to be an exploratory study and was not formally powered. We recognize this as a limitation of our study. Any <italic>P</italic> values are considered nominal and only hypothesis generating rather than conclusive. Other limitations include the possible inclusion of patients who already had established IC and difficulty on the part of the investigators in deciding which patients should be enrolled in this study, as highlighted by the fact that 31% of patients in the FAS were excluded from the PPS.</p><p>Several key findings from the INTENSE study should be considered in future studies of preventive antifungal strategies in critically ill patients. The type of treatment strategy needs to be classified by current definitions as prophylactic, preemptive, or empiric [<xref rid="CIV707C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], because this classification determines the timing of treatment. These definitions have evolved from when the INTENSE study was designed, and with hindsight it could be considered a prophylaxis study. Identification of ICU patients at high risk for IC is challenging and requires careful selection of patients. In our study for example, the overall incidence of IC (any-confirmed cases) in the NAI subgroup was 21%, confirming that this might be a population worth focusing on in future studies, whereas the infection rate in the CAI group was very low. We echo a point made by Montravers et al [<xref rid="CIV707C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], that additional tools and prediction rules to identify patient populations with the highest risk are required. Our data add to the evidence that, in conjunction with risk factors, &#x000df;DG has potential use as a marker to help physicians select high-risk patients who might benefit from early antifungal treatment. Our findings support the need for further investigations on these measures as criteria in prediction rules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ707/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
