Medication regimen complexity index scores may be predictive of readmissions; however, few studies have examined this potential association. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether medication regimen complexity index is associated with all-cause 30-day readmission after admission for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2050312116632426"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was an institutional review board&#x02013;approved, multi-center, case&#x02013;control study. Patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were randomly selected for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they discharged against medical advice or expired during their index visit. Block randomization was utilized for equal representation of index diagnosis and site. Discharge medication regimen complexity index scores were compared between subjects with readmission versus those without. Medication regimen complexity index score was then used as a predictor in logistic regression modeling for readmission.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2050312116632426"><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred and fifty-six patients were randomly selected for inclusion, and 101 (13.4%) readmitted within 30&#x02009;days.

Among these re-hospitalizations are unplanned readmissions that account for more than US$17&#x02009;billion in Medicare health care expenditures annually.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Consequently, hospital readmissions have become a national focus for health care systems and health care payers alike. In an effort to reduce unwarranted readmissions, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has subjected hospitals to financial penalties for excess readmissions due to (1) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (2) elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, (3) acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (4) heart failure (HF), and (5) pneumonia (PNA).</p><p>Hospitals across the nation are working to identify risk factors for readmissions and searching for tools to aid in the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted interventions. However, few studies have examined medication-related risk factors and hospital readmission, despite the fact that drug-related problems are a known cause of readmission. A study conducted by Ruiz et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> in 2008 found that adverse drug reactions may be the cause of up to 35% of hospital readmissions. In a prospective study of community-dwelling elders, those with post-hospital medication discrepancies had higher 30-day readmission rates compared to those without medication discrepancies (14.3% vs 6.1%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Several medication-related factors have been associated with increased risk of hospitalization including the use of traditional &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; medications (i.e. warfarin, insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and sedatives), medication count, and potentially inappropriate medications in elderly individuals.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In recent years, there has been interest in defining the &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; medication regimen and understanding how the complexity of a medication regimen may affect various patient outcomes including hospital readmissions. The medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) is a tool developed and validated to measure the complexity of a medication list. The MRCI been shown to have good inter-rater and test-retest reliability and provides a weighted complexity score based on individual component scores for dosage form (Section A), dosing frequency (Section B), and additional directions required for administration (Section C). It is an open-index tool in which higher scores indicate greater regimen complexity. In Section A, higher weights are assigned for medications with less convenient or more difficult to administer dosage forms (e.g. an oral tablet receives 1 point while a metered-dose inhaler receives 4 points). In Section B, medications administered more frequently or at more strict time intervals receive more points (e.g. &#x0201c;twice daily&#x0201d; receives 2 points, while &#x0201c;every 12&#x02009;h&#x0201d; receives 2.5 points). Finally, in Section C, further points are assigned if the medication regimen indicates any additional instructions such as &#x0201c;break/crush tablet&#x0201d; (1 point) or &#x0201c;taper dose as directed&#x0201d; (2 points).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Studies analyzing MRCI score and readmission have utilized varying methodologies, populations, and outcomes and offer somewhat conflicting findings. While some studies have shown MRCI to have predictive validity with regard to re-hospitalization or acute care utilization (ACU), other studies have shown no significant relationship.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Therefore, a large study encompassing a wide patient demographic with varying discharge dispositions and index diagnoses was necessary to better understand the impact of MRCI on these outcomes.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine the association of MRCI with increased risk of 30-day, all-cause hospital readmission, in patients with index admission for HF, AMI, PNA, or COPD. Secondary objectives were to (1) determine whether medication regimen complexity is associated with increased risk of all-cause, 30-day ACU defined as a composite of readmission, emergency department (ED) visit, or outpatient observation stay and (2) identify demographic, admission, and/or medication-related covariates that are associated with readmission and/or ACU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-2050312116632426"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-2050312116632426"><title>Design and sample</title><p>This study was a retrospective chart review that utilized a parallel-group, case&#x02013;control design.

In an analysis of medication records from 15 home care agencies, Dierich et al. concluded that high-risk medication regimens were composed of polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medication use, and medication regimen complexity. In another study focusing on home health, Schoonover et al. looked more broadly at the effects of medication regimen complexity and examined the association between MRCI score and health care utilization. Schoonover et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> concluded that higher MRCI scores increased the odds for a potential ADE and for 30-day hospital readmission; however, higher scores did not significantly elevate the odds for ED use.</p><p>To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine the predictive ability of MRCI for all-cause readmission in key high-risk disease states (HF, AMI, PNA, and COPD) that are currently the focus of nation-wide readmission reduction efforts, in a diverse patient population with regard to patient age and discharge disposition. Additionally, few other studies have examined ACU more broadly as opposed to readmission exclusively. A more complete picture of unplanned care is important to examine, and there is concern that efforts to avoid readmission penalties may result in increased utilization of outpatient observation stays in inpatient facilities. A retrospective study of Medicare Part A claims for Rhode Island Medicare beneficiaries from 2009 through 2011 found that ED and inpatient admissions rates decreased, while corresponding observation stay rates increased.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The primary finding of this study was that when controlling for demographics and other patient variables, MRCI does not significantly affect the odds of readmission. Nor does MRCI appear to improve the discriminative ability of prediction models beyond what can be obtained utilizing patient demographics along with basic index admission information and a common measure of comorbidity (Charlson score). This is consistent with the results of a prospective study by Wimmer et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to control for similar covariates, and concluded that MRCI was not associated with readmission. Unlike Wimmer et al., however, we did find MRCI to be significantly related to readmission in unadjusted bivariate analyses. Unadjusted MRCI scores in our study were significantly higher in the readmitted subjects than in those not readmitted within 30&#x02009;days, as was the case in the studies by Willson et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Dierich et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and Schoonover et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Nevertheless, given the limited utility of MRCI as a predictor in the context of other covariates, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence for the use of MRCI, in its current form, in all-cause readmission risk prediction. Furthermore, Charlson score appears to be a much stronger readmission predictor in our models and is much more easily calculated than MRCI score.</p><p>One possible explanation for why MRCI may not be a useful predictor for readmission when controlling for other variables is that perhaps this tool is missing important measures of complexity that may contribute to readmission risk. While more complex dosage forms, frequencies, and additional administration directions likely increase the risk of non-adherence and medication misadventures such as ADEs, perhaps other factors are more likely to increase this risk sufficiently in order to translate into re-hospitalizations. These factors may include the knowledge and abilities of the individual carrying out the regimen, level of health literacy, as well as clinical comorbidities and high-risk medications with particular comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease). These additional factors may be particularly important to take into consideration in the regimens of patients with the high-risk disease states examined in our study. In the AMI and HF population, for example, patients are very likely to be prescribed high-risk medications known to cause ADEs, such as antithrombotics and diuretics. In PNA and COPD, a lack of understanding or inability to adhere strictly to instructions, for example, inability to complete an antibiotic regimen or demonstrate proper inhaler technique, may contribute significantly to readmissions. Perhaps the creation of a modified regimen complexity index which takes into consideration these additional clinical and patient-specific factors would prove more valuable in readmission prediction.</p><p>Interestingly, discharge to other non-SNF facilities (relative to home self-care) appeared to be a protective factor against readmission in our study. Those discharged to non-SNF facilities such as rehab facilities or long-term acute care were much less likely to be readmitted within 30&#x02009;days than those sent to home with self-care. One possible explanation for this is that some of these patients, particularly those sent to acute long-term care, may have expired during the 30-day period after their discharge.</p><p>Another surprising finding was that a significantly higher proportion of readmitted and ACU patients were Caucasian in the bivariate analyses. Some studies have identified socioeconomic factors, such as race/ethnicity, income, and payer status, to be significant predictors in readmission. However, those of minority racial groups have generally been associated with increased risk of readmission. A recent study by Vivo et al. compared 30-day and 1-year re-hospitalization for &#x0003e;47,000 HF patients among racial/ethnic groups. When controlling for clinical, hospital, and other socioeconomic status variables, relative to Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanics had higher 30-day and 1-year readmission rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In multivariate analyses, &#x0201c;other race/ethnicity&#x0201d; (non-Caucasian, non-African American, and non-Hispanic) appeared to be protective against ACU; however, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding this finding as greater than 50% of individuals in this group were of unidentified race/ethnicity.</p><p>With regard to income and payer status, no significant differences were found with regard to readmission; however, those with a Medicaid payer had significantly higher rates of ACU relative to those with a commercial payer when controlling for other variables.</p><sec id="section18-2050312116632426"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study was limited due to a retrospective design, the authors utilized a large sample size and block randomization to increase the internal validity. Only readmissions and ACU within Sharp Healthcare could be assessed; therefore, the possibility exists that some individuals in the no-readmission and no-ACU groups did indeed readmit/revisit elsewhere. Likewise, the Charlson score may have been underestimated as these scores were calculated based on diagnoses documented only within the Sharp Healthcare network. Inconsistent methods with regard to documentation of prior-to-admission and discharge medications may have affected the accuracy of MRCI scores. However, no significant changes were made to these processes within the health system during the study time period, and it is unlikely that the documentation methods were different between study groups. Additionally, a high inter-rater reliability ensured that MRCI scoring was consistent among disease states and study sites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section19-2050312116632426"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The addition of MRCI to a multivariate regression model with more traditional readmission predictors does not appear to improve discriminative ability. Therefore, there is little evidence to support the use of MRCI, in its current format, in all-cause readmission risk prediction. Comorbidity, however, does improve readmission models, which suggests that Charlson score or another validated comorbidity measure should be included when developing readmission risk prediction tools. Significant disease state and study site differences were identified, thus supporting the need for disease-specific and institution-specific identifiers in prediction models.</p><p>MRCI may be useful in the prediction of drug-related readmissions, such as those due to ADEs and adherence problems, as opposed to all-cause readmissions. MRCI may also prove useful in long-term or short-term prediction models, such as 7-day or 90-day readmission/ACU. Further research is needed to validate these hypotheses.</p><p>Additional studies are also needed to better understand the impact of medication-related predictor variables, such as potentially inappropriate medications<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312116632426" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in the elderly and high-risk medication use, on readmission and ACU. Finally, the development of a more sensitive tool than the MRCI, perhaps one that incorporates clinical and/or patient-specific factors, may prove useful for capturing an effect of regimen complexity on readmission or ACU.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was presented as a platform presentation at the Western States Conference in San Diego, CA, 20 May 2015.</p></ack><fn-group><fn
