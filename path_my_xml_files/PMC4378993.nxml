It has an incidence of 31 per 104 person-years and in some countries it is the most common fracture occurring in elderly, namely almost 500 per 100.000 [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The literature reports that this fracture accounts for 25% of all fractures in adolescent and for 18% of all fractures in the elderly. In the United States alone more than 640.000 radius fractures were documented in 2001 [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the incidence of this fracture has not changed considerably since 1997, the frequency of surgical therapy and thus the number of in-hospital treatments for this injury has increased considerably [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For non-dislocated fractures conservative therapy with immobilization of the wrist in a plaster cast also called plaster of Paris for 6 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] is usually described. For displaced fractures the recent literature mostly recommends surgery, largely performed with plates [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whose increasing availability also contributes to the increase in surgical treatment for this fracture [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. But there are also tendencies to treat these fractures conservatively, as the results in elderly patients are described as comparable[<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>While surgical treatment has meanwhile become the gold standard [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and depending on the type of fracture is usually performed from volar [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] under utilization of locking plates [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], to date hardly any studies have been conducted with regard to postoperative therapy and especially the effect of immobilization during the postoperative period. Some of the authors do not mention postoperative immobilization at all, some seem to completely dispense postoperative immobilization [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and others perform postoperative immobilization in a circumferential cast or a splint for 2 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], three weeks [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or even up to four weeks [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>For treatment of injuries of the lower extremities various removable, sometimes vacuum-fit dynamic stabilizing systems are already available, some of which have also been evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In one study involving conventional therapy patients reported removable orthoses to provide clearly better wearing comfort [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, to date no data have been published on dynamic postoperative immobilization of the forearm and wrist following surgical stabilization of a distal radius fracture or the wearing comfort of such an orthosis and its effect on postoperative outcome in a comparison with customary plaster cast immobilization.</p><p>We thus decided to conduct a prospective, randomized cross-over study to examine these issues. The primary endpoint was patient satisfaction based on the 7 parameters of aesthetics, handling, sense of hygiene, activity limitations, physical resilience, accuracy of fitting and postoperative pain with the particular form of immobilization. The secondary endpoints were mobility of the wrist and finger function as determined by the range of motion (ROM) and the DASH Score, the period of time during which the patient was disabled and the radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0117720.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0117720.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Protocol, <xref rid="pone.0117720.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0117720.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Raw Data</xref>.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of Tuebingen University under the No. 196/2011 B02 and conducted in conformity with the principles of good clinical practice.

The sheets were folded to conceal the writing and subsequently blended. Afterwards they were randomly inserted into an envelope which was sealed. The envelopes were blended once again and thereafter they were consecutively numbered with number 1&#x02013;30.

A control for age or other factors except the described inclusion criteria was not performed beforehand.</p><p>The VacoHand, as from now on named orthosis, was designed by OPED and is a vacuum fitted orthosis with a wrist hinge which can be used either in a blocked position or in an unblocked, flexible mode allowing several degrees of range of motion.</p><p>Independently of the randomization, each of the devices was applied in the operating theatre by the surgical team. Irrespective of the method used, all patients initially underwent total postoperative immobilization of the wrist. After seven days at the first postoperative check-up (time-point 1) the immobilizing device was removed and the complementary orthotic device applied, as foreseen by the cross-over study design. The "new" device ensured immobilization for another seven days in both groups. The patients underwent a second check-up 14 days postoperative (time-point 2). From this time on, the patients were allowed to exercise wrist mobility out of the splint under the supervision of a physical therapist in case of the plaster of Paris group. The group treated with the orthosis which was deblocked at time-point 2 was allowed to exercise limited wrist movement in the orthosis at all times themselves in addition to the physiotherapy sessions. At the third follow-up examination four weeks postoperative (time-point 3) the plaster splint or orthosis was removed. The final examination was conducted at 12 weeks postoperative (time-point 4).

We only found a meta-analysis of 8 studies comparing dynamic versus static fixation of distal radius fractures with an external fixateur device with respect to complications and malunion [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], reporting of superior but non-significant range of motion and better radiological outcome in the dynamic group [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some investigators retrospectively compared dynamic splinting after surgically treated distal radius fractures versus nonsurgical treatment coming to the conclusion, that dynamic splinting is directly responsible for gains in ROM [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With regard to treatment of contractures after distal radius fractures one study did not find a reduction in the rate of contracture by using a dynamic orthosis and thus concluded them to be difficult to justify for this diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>For therapy of fractures of the upper extremity, the plaster cast or synthetic casts are still assumed to be the therapy most frequently used. Although there seem to be advantages of the synthetic materials [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] the plaster cast is still preferred in a lot of hospitals.</p><p>Despite the availability of a flexible vacuum-fitted orthosis for the upper extremity it is so far rarely used in hospitals. The reason for this might be the absence of evidence of effects and results of a flexible orthosis in case of postoperative treatment of forearm fractures.</p><p>The main focus of this study was patient satisfaction with regard to the two different devices used for immobilization, which was investigated using the described questionnaires. These questionnaires only comprised of 5 steps and were self designed. Retrospectively we should have used a scale from 1 to 10 for each item to receive a more detailed graduation and a better reproducibility.</p><p>The study design does not include a wash-out period and therefore does not totally correlate to the design of a standard cross-over trial. Thus we could not completely avoid carry&#x02013;over effects, but due to the injury related and therefore essential therapy we were not able to fulfill all the requirements.</p><p>The study design did not include a one year follow up, because we did not expect a significant difference concerning the function postoperatively and because the main target point of the study was patient satisfaction and comfort. Therefore we are not able to judge how the differences in range of motion which already seemed to have leveled after 12 weeks would perform after a one year period.</p><p>For the answers concerning patient satisfaction with the device this design was sufficient. For the evaluation of the questions concerning final ROM and radiological results another examination after 12 month would have been reasonable, but as mentioned before these were only secondary target points in this study.</p><p>The therapy regimen for postsurgical treatment of a distal radius fracture employed in our Level I Trauma Center and University Clinic calls for two weeks of immobilization after operative stabilization followed by two weeks of mobilization in the splint under attendance of a physiotherapist. The splint is removed after four weeks and light mobility is prescribed for the subsequent two weeks without strain.</p><p>The study was conducted according to this therapy regimen and the study design adapted to ensure fair comparison of the two treatment methods, because the deblocked and thus flexible orthosis would permit mobilization after two weeks.</p><p>We purposely did not add a third group without any postoperative immobilization as this would have contradicted our well-established treatment regimen and we believe that this might lead to secondary displacement or implant loosening especially in patients with reduced bone quality.</p><p>Of course in other hospitals the postoperative treatment of distal radius fractures is handled differently [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], sometimes even with no immobilization at all [<xref rid="pone.0117720.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. With increasing age of our future patients and thus reduced bone quality the confidence into postoperative stability might decrease and therefore postoperative immobilization to safeguard the operative result might be used more often in future even by those not doing it presently.</p><p>Using the SF 36 questionnaire and the DASH Score and several individually developed questionnaires we detected no significant differences concerning pain, overall functional ability and resilience. In relation to change of activity limitations when changing the treatment after week 1 the group changing from orthosis to plaster splint reported a significantly worse result compared to the other group. Also we found a significantly superior evaluation of accuracy of fitting, aesthetics, and hygienic feeling in favour of the orthosis. The main question and target point of the study, namely which treatment (orthosis or plaster splint) would be preferred in future after this cross-over study, was clearly and thus significantly (p = 0,017) answered in favour of the orthosis. Of the 29 study participants, 23 would request the vacuum fitted orthosis as postoperative fracture immobilization in case of another distal radius fracture.</p><p>As the orthosis was deblocked after the second week the patients were able to perform some limited movements themselves at all times in addition to the physiotherapy treatment both groups received. We assume that this additional exercises accounts for the superior functional outcome compared to the plaster splint group after 4 weeks and the better, yet not significant ROM after 12 weeks.</p><p>From a financial point of view, the flexible orthosis is more economical for hospitals in Germany at this time, because it calls for neither material nor personnel to apply or remove it as the plaster splint does. Currently, the social health insurance carriers and not the hospital itself pay for the flexible orthosis. One negative point is certainly the fact that this is thus an added expense for German social health insurance carriers, whereby a comparison of costs for the provision of a plaster room, personnel and material will not be entirely transparent and thus not comparable. The costs of the plaster splint for example are taken over by the hospital itself.</p><p>The study demonstrates that there are some advantages in functional outcome after 4 weeks and in postoperative management when using a functional orthosis, and that patient satisfaction clearly is superior with the vacuum-fitted flexible orthosis we used in this study. After twelve weeks the functional advantages seem to have almost leveled. Consequently, the study data suggests the flexible orthosis to be an alternative to the plaster splint if postoperative immobilization is wanted.</p><p>All data underlying the findings described in this manuscript are fully available without restriction.
