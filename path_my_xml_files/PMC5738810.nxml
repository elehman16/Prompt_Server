It is highly prevalent in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with 20% of the canine population over one year old affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This musculoskeletal disease is related to chronic pain, lameness, loss of joint function and mobility, functional disability and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The management of OA in dogs is a lifetime commitment, involving a multimodal approach. The main recommendation is to control symptoms by reducing pain, improving mobility and hence quality of life; whilst protecting joints from OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">To decrease pain and inflammation associated with OA, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, in clinical practice, many dogs suffering from OA are long term treated with NSAIDs such as carprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. NSAIDs act mostly by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase and thus reducing the concentration of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Unfortunately, the use of NSAIDs may be associated with adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal tract ulcerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Corticosteroid injection in dogs is usually reserved for severe end stage OA and for cases that have become refractory to other treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Beside pain relief, preventing cartilage degradation is an important objective for treatment. This requires the long term use of safe therapies, while the absence of any cure reinforces the importance of prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such prevention and alternative solutions could come from nutrition or from dietary supplements. Indeed, these latter present the advantage of having few or no known side effects.</p><p id="Par18">In a preliminary in vitro study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we have demonstrated that a mixture of curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract (CCOT) inhibited inflammatory and catabolic mediator&#x02019;s synthesis by bovine and human chondrocytes. These findings suggest a scientific rationale for the evaluation of these natural ingredients in a clinical trial. Curcumin is the major component of turmeric, a yellow spice derived from the rhizomes of the plant <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>. Evidence has been published for its potency to target multiple inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The main characteristic of hydrolyzed collagen is its amino acid composition, which is identical to collagen, thus providing high levels of glycine and proline, two amino acids essential for the stability and regeneration of cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Green tea contains polyphenolic fractions called catechins and, among them, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, which exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-tumoral and anti-mutagenic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">This randomly allocated, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a diet containing CCOT mixture on client owned dogs with OA using objective variables such as force plate analysis and serum OA biomarkers (Coll2&#x02013;1 and Coll2&#x02013;1 NO<sub>2</sub>) as well as subjective variables such as orthopedic evaluation and owner assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Dogs</title><p id="Par20">Dogs with OA were recruited among the patients of the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Liege, or through advertisements in pet stores, veterinarians&#x02019;, dog magazines, daily papers, websites with animal news, grooming salons and pet associations.

Both dry dog food products had similar nutritional and energy content (3515&#x000a0;kcal/kg) and similar visual aspect.

All owners received a detailed written description of the protocol and provided written informed consent before the inclusion of their dog in the study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of the University of Li&#x000e8;ge (reference 12&#x02013;1330) and by the Royal Canine Ethics Committee. They adhere to a high standard of veterinary care. Investigators collected blood samples at the first screening visit for serum biochemistry which validated dog eligibility for the study. Eligible dogs were randomly assigned (using Microsoft Office Excel 2013) to receive either the control diet or the CCOT supplemented diet. A statistician generated the random allocation sequence. Block size was 10. Allocation ratio was 1:1. The allocation sequence was not concealed but neither pet owners, neither veterinarians nor investigators had knowledge of the diet to which dogs were assigned. A veterinarian enrolled dogs. Upon enrollment in the study, pet owners were instructed to feed their dogs on a transition diet (same composition as control but kibble of a different shape) over 14&#x000a0;days. In this way, all eligible dogs received the same diet (without any potential active compound included within the diet) before starting the study. Feeding guidelines were provided to owners with the intent for dogs to maintain a constant body weight and condition as well as to be fed according to their usual feeding regimen (free choice or meal). An investigator assigned dogs to interventions. Dogs were weighed each month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par26">During the study, all adverse events were reported to the investigator, who noted the event characteristics including severity, occurrence and suspected association with the food.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objective measurement: force plate analysis</title><p id="Par27">Ground reaction forces were measured with kinetic analysis using biomechanical force platforms (Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland) at the Laboratory of Human Motion Analysis at the University of Li&#x000e8;ge.

Dogs were acclimated to the force plate before data collection. Data for the right and left sides were collected from separate passes across the plate. The limb most affected by lameness, as shown by PVF gait analysis and orthopedic examination, and with radiographic OA lesions was considered as the most affected limb and its contralateral limb was considered as less affected limb (compared to its contralateral most affected limb). Ground reaction forces were recorded at T0 and after 3&#x000a0;months of diet (T3). The owner trotted dogs across the force plate, and an investigator observed and filmed each pass to confirm foot strikes and gait. A test was considered valid when only one limb landed on the force plate at a time, while the dog was trotted across it at a velocity of 1.8 to 2.2&#x000a0;m/s and acceleration-deceleration variation of &#x000b1;0.5&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>.

Dog was defined as a random term in mixed models. PS and PI were assessed using generalized linear model. Diet, defined as the main effect, was investigated on &#x00394; T3-T0. Generalized linear model or mixed model were analyzed using SAS 9.3. According to data features and residuals distribution of each model, the outcomes were previously rank transformed or not. Homoscedasticity was checked on residuals with a white test at a level of 1%. All data were expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation. The analysis was two-sided.

Two dogs in the CCOT and 4 in the control groups were excluded from the study for the following reasons: development of an illness that required treatment (such as NSAIDs) or surgical intervention (3 control dogs), appearance of neurologic deficit (1 CCOT dog), lack of owner compliance with study restrictions (1 control dog), and death of the dog because of owner-elected euthanasia due to deterioration of general condition of the dog (1 CCOT dog). Consequently, 42 dogs completed the study, including 21 from the CCOT group and 21 from the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

These data are consistent with that of a study evaluating the effects of curcuma extract in owner&#x02019;s dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study evaluating the effect of undenatured type II collagen also demonstrated a decrease in pain upon limb manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Pain improvement was not associated with lameness improvement. Indeed, constraints and movement amplitudes are different. This may also be explained by the fact that manipulation investigates pain coming from the peri-articular tissue while lameness could be partially generated by pain triggered by subchondral bone loading.</p><p id="Par49">Assessments by owners are subjective measures but, when such measures are used, a composite score is more effective than individual scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the present study, we used the validated CBPI which includes two composite scores: PS and PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding owner&#x02019;s assessment, the evolution for PS, as assessed by &#x00394;T3-T0, was significantly different between CCOT and control groups, with the CCOT group staying stable and the control group worsening. In contrast, no significant difference was observed for PI between CCOT and control groups. This suggests that CCOT could affect pain but not limb function. Nevertheless, when questions corresponding to PI were analyzed separately, we found that change (&#x00394;T3-T0) in the ability to rise to standing from lying down was significantly improved in the CCOT compared to the control group. This is consistent with a study showing that fish oil induced a significant improvement on the ability to rise from a resting position, to play and to walk in OA dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has been shown that the CBPI was not correlated with changes in force plate data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Pain mechanism during the weight bearing is different. Moreover, owners considered that showing improvements in quality of life (performing activities of daily living) is much more important than demonstrating enhancements in force plate data and increased or decreased use of a single limb at a walk or trot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Gait analysis has the limitation of only evaluating an animal at one specific time point, outside of its normal environment. On the contrary, CBPI quantifies the owners&#x02019; assessment of clinically relevant chronic pain&#x02013;related behaviors with the dog in its routine environment over an extended period of time as well as how their dog is doing &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">However, PVF is often recognized as the most appropriate measure for assessing the effects of therapeutic modalities in OA dogs and is frequently used in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PVF was increased by a diet supplemented with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], with type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and with green lipped mussel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] but not by an extract of curcuma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PVF presents some weaknesses, however. It is less reliable when used in owner&#x02019;s dogs. The fact that data for the most and less affected limbs were mostly collected from separate runs could also bring a bias. Minimal body weight of included dogs was 10&#x000a0;kg. It may have been better to start with higher body weight of dogs (e.g. 20&#x000a0;kg). Historically the weight limitation was related to the ability for the force plate to record a single stride (the size of the plate was too big to have only one leg striking the plate at the same time). Indeed, a small dog will have a faster joint angular velocity than a big dog. That is why we compared the difference between T0 and T3 on the same dog, at the same velocity. We were based on a study in which minimal body weight was 11.4&#x000a0;kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, the gait analysis data combined thoracic and pelvic limbs. This was problematic because PVF for the front limb is higher than PVF for the hind limb. There was a higher number of front limb OA dogs in control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) than in COT group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). Therefore PVF was calculated as &#x00394; T3-T0 but this heterogeneity may add a bias to our study.</p><p id="Par51">Moreover, PVF decrease has been demonstrated to be more important in dogs affected by stifle OA than by hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. So we can speculate that the low ratio of stifle OA in our population explains in part the absence of effects of CCOT on PVF. Indeed in our study, 19% of dogs had stifle OA while 62% had hip OA. Our population was heterogeneous in terms of OA location. Some dogs also had indirect signs of OA (such as a decreased range of motion or discrete discomfort on manipulation) in multiple limbs. An improvement in one limb could hidden pain in others limbs. This is a limitation of this study. However heterogeneous groups of dogs mimics the real clinical situation in veterinary medicine. One could consider this heterogeneity as a strength of our study.</p><p id="Par52">The owner was the leash-driver for kinetics gait analysis. This is good for lowering stress associated with the manipulation for the dog. But this could be another source of inter-individuals variability, which may be controlled by the same manipulator for each dog. Before the beginning of the study, we compared kinetic analysis when dogs were guided by their owners or by the manipulator. We concluded that dogs were less troubled when they were guided by their owners. It was the same owner who guided his/her dog at T0 and at T3. Indeed, the dog response to a foreign manipulator is another inter-individual variability. Anyway, all the trials were recorded at the same velocity, acceleration (with the dog not turning its head). Dogs were also guided by their owners in other similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Because mean changes often obscure the individual change, we presented individual changes in PVF for both control and CCOT groups.

However, when expressed relatively to baseline values, the MDC<sub>95</sub> was found to be 3.6% BW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Coll2&#x02013;1 and Coll2&#x02013;1 NO<sub>2</sub> serum concentrations were correlated with the macroscopic and histological changes in dogs with OA induced by transection of the anterior cruciate ligament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We failed to observe an effect of CCOT on Coll2&#x02013;1 and Coll2&#x02013;1 NO<sub>2</sub> serum levels. This may be explained by the higher heterogeneity of biomarker values in our population than in a model of surgically induced OA dogs.</p><p id="Par56">No age effect was observed (data not shown) on the outcomes of interest but the study was not designed for this purpose.</p><p id="Par57">Our study presented some limitations such as its short duration and the number of dogs included. Even though the number of dogs needed was statistically calculated a priori based on the PVF data, the lack of information to fully represent targeted population variability (i.e. breed effect, gender effect&#x02026;) might have underestimated required sample size. Additionally, higher numbers are required for subjective veterinary and owner assessments compared to gait analysis. A larger number of dogs and a reduced inter-individual variability could increase the benefit of the CCOT diet and subsequently reinforce the likelihood of measurable improvements of PVF and OA biomarkers serum concentrations. Moreover, the fact that the bags were clearly marked with codes that differentiated the groups and that the randomization sequence was not concealed could add bias to the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">Objective variables measured, such as ground reaction forces and OA biomarkers, did not show statistical differences. Regarding the objective outcome PVF, the positive responder&#x02019;s rate was greater in CCOT group than in control group whereas the negative responder&#x02019;s rate was greater in control group than in CCOT group, albeit not statistically tested. The study reveals that dogs receiving diet supplemented with CCOT mixture for 3&#x000a0;months showed less pain at manipulation. The three other parameters evaluated by veterinary subjective assessment (lameness, pain at palpation and joint mobility) did not show statistical differences. Regarding the subjective owner assessment, the evolution of PS showed significant difference between CCOT and control groups. No statistical difference was found for PI, except for the ability to rise to standing from lying down, which was significantly improved in the CCOT compared to the control group. These results suggest that, even if the CCOT diet does not seem to improve lameness (on kinetics and clinical rating) in our studied OA dogs, it could present some benefits on chronic pain and its impact on activities of daily living in OA dogs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BW</term><def><p id="Par4">body weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBPI</term><def><p id="Par5">Canine Brief Pain Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCOT</term><def><p id="Par6">a mixture of curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p id="Par7">coefficient of variation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p id="Par8">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p id="Par9">osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par10">Pain Interference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PS</term><def><p id="Par11">Pain Severity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVF</term><def><p id="Par12">peak vertical force</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p id="Par13">at study start</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T3</term><def><p id="Par14">after 3&#x000a0;months of diet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMB</term><def><p id="Par15">3, 3&#x02032;, 5, 5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Royal Canin SAS who funded the present research.
