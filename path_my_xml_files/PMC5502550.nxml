Clinical studies performed in a 25-year period concluded that CHX mouth rinses were found to be effective in controlling plaque and gingivitis and as an effective adjunct to mechanical plaque control.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The result of this study was in accordance with that of the systematic review.</p><p>CHX is considered gold standard among antimicrobial agents which has been constantly evaluated chemical agent for the reduction in the formation of plaque and plaque-induced gingival inflammation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Positively charged CHX molecule is rapidly attracted to bacterial cell membrane that is negatively charged resulting in the damage and leakage of intracellular components is considered its antibacterial mode of action.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>An environment is created where the antibacterial properties of CHX are maintained for several hours depending on factors such as dosage, time of rinsing, oral temperature, the presence of natural or artificial teeth, organic material and salivary pH.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This is due to the attachment of CHX to the teeth, biofilm, tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary proteins which is then slowly secreted into the saliva. The efficacy of CHX is directly proportional to its efficacy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The current study concluded that CHX levels were maintained in the oral cavity and its efficacy outcomes confirmed rinsing with 10 ml of either solution to be better effective for controlling plaque and gingivitis compared to warm saline alone.</p><p>Essential oils and CHX mouth rinse delivered in combination with or without alcohol base have long been known to exert useful effects against plaque formation and plaque-induced gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The results of 6 weeks, randomized, double-blinded study proved that CHX/fluoride rinse (0.12%) as an adjunct to routine tooth brushing concluded that there was a significant reduction in plaque and gingivitis scores when it was compared to the control rinse.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another large-scale clinical trial concluded that there was a significant reduction in the plaque and gingivitis score when CHX mouthrinse when it was compared with a thymol-containing mouth-rinse solution after 14 days of treatment.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A reduction of about 28% in plaque accumulation and of about 25% in gingival inflammation was seen in a randomized double-blind study which was conducted in general dental practices in the United Kingdom where CHX mouthrinse was used over 12-week.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A marked reduction was seen in the gingival and plaque index scores for both the mouth rinses, i.e., with or without alcohol in the present study as well.</p><p>In a study conducted recently, a significant reduction was seen in the mean GI, Periodontal Index and bleeding on probing at 1, 2, and 3 months interval using CHX versus the placebo solution.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The results of the present research conclude that the use of CHX mouth rinse as a supplement to fluoride containing toothpaste may significantly reduce dental plaque and improve gingival inflammation compared to brushing with fluoride toothpaste alone.</p><p>With prolonged use of CHX mouth rinse, high percentage of individuals reported with features of TRAEs that included taste sensation alteration, tongue and oral tissue discoloration, burning sensation in the oral cavity, reduced salivary flow, oral desquamation, and loss of sensitivity to sensory stimuli in the mouth. A study conducted by Charles <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] observed that people found to have significantly greater extrinsic mouth stain by the end of the 6-month study, a finding that is usually observed in other long-term observational studies [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] although there were significant reductions of plaque and gingivitis. From the evidence that are available, it is suggested that precipitation of negatively charged dietary chromogens, for example, those from tea, coffee, or red wine, onto positively charged CHX adsorbed onto biofilm coated surfaces results in the variation in the degree of staining from person to person.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] the resultant stain that is observed is extrinsic in nature and can be easily removed by regular prophylaxis. Other characteristic features that have been reported in the literature that generally resolve once the use of CHX is discontinued include taste sensation alteration, burning sensation in the oral cavity, reduced salivary flow (dry mouth), oral desquamation and loss of sensitivity to sensory stimuli in the mouth. These long-term effects of CHX could not be evaluated as the duration of the present study was very short.</p><p>Previously, tests conducted by chromic acid and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy tests confirmed the presence of ethanol in essential oil mouthwash and its percentage was confirmed to be 24.5% by gas chromatography testing. Ethanol in the mouthwash, although therapeutically inactive, produces various other effects that do not have any beneficial effects. Epithelial irritation through topical application of alcohol resulted in irritation to the epithelium and had been linked with increased occurrence of tumors, which has been proved in various animal studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Inflammatory changes may also develop that may induce hyperkeratosis and atrophy of mucosa.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The Student's <italic>t</italic>-test results showed that the postrinsing PI and GI values were statistically significant between Group A and Group C as well as Group B and Group C patients. This indicates that the alcohol-based and nonalcohol-based mouthwashes are superior than normal saline mouthrinses.</p><p>In ANOVA test also it showed that alcohol-based and nonalcohol-based mouthrinses are superior to normal saline. However in the present study, we have found no significant results between alcohol-based and nonalcohol-based mouthrinses.</p><p>The results showed in the bar diagrams states that the postrinsing plaque index score was reduced in both Group A and Group B patients (In comparison to the prerinsing plaque score). However, the reduction value was found to be more in Group B than in Group A. Whereas in the case of Group C, patients using normal saline the postrinsing plaque score was increased.</p><p>On the other hand, the postrinsing GI showed a slightly greater reduction in the scores in Group B patients than Group A patients. However, the Group C patients have a slight increase in their postrinsing score in comparison to the prerinsing score.</p><p>Furthermore, studies that include both microbial analysis and salivary sampling should be carried out to substantiate the results of this study. The study duration is short for evaluating the long-term effects of mouthrinses, therefore long-term studies are needed to be carried out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>CHX mouthrinse containing nonalcohol base 0.2% CHX gluconate and essential oils containing alcohol as the base used twice daily resulted in decreased formation of dental plaque and gingivitis as measured using GI and periodontal index (PI) after 4 days of treatment.
