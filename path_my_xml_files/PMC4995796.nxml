Adequate calcium consumption and physical activity are the two major modifiable risk factors. This paper describes the major outcomes and efficacy of a workplace-based targeted behaviour change intervention to improve the dietary and physical activity behaviours of working women in sedentary occupations in Singapore.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cluster-randomized design was used, comparing the efficacy of a tailored intervention to standard care. Workplaces were the units of randomization and intervention. Sixteen workplaces were recruited from a pool of 97, and randomly assigned to intervention and control arms (eight workplaces in each). Women meeting specified inclusion criteria were then recruited to participate. Workplaces in the intervention arm received three participatory workshops and organization-wide educational activities. Workplaces in the control/standard care arm received print resources. Outcome measures were calcium intake (milligrams/day) and physical activity level (duration: minutes/week), measured at baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months post intervention. Adjusted cluster-level analyses were conducted comparing changes in intervention versus control groups, following intention-to-treat principles and CONSORT guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Workplaces in the intervention group reported a significantly greater increase in calcium intake and duration of load-bearing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared with the standard care control group. Four weeks after intervention, the difference in adjusted mean calcium intake was 343.2&#x000a0;mg/day (95&#x000a0;% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;337.4 to 349.0, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0005) and the difference in adjusted mean load-bearing MVPA was 55.6&#x000a0;min/week (95&#x000a0;% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;54.5 to 56.6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0005). Six months post intervention, the mean differences attenuated slightly to 290.5&#x000a0;mg/day (95&#x000a0;% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;285.3 to 295.7, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0005) and 50.9&#x000a0;min/week (95&#x000a0;% CI =49.3 to 52.6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0005) respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This workplace-based intervention substantially improved calcium intake and load-bearing moderate to vigorous physical activity 6&#x000a0;months after the intervention began.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12616000079448.aspx">ACTRN12616000079448</ext-link>.

Evidence suggests that physical activity and calcium intake can affect not just bone mineral density, but also risk of osteoporotic fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prospective longitudinal studies have estimated that 23&#x000a0;% of osteoporosis is attributable to physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and that almost 10&#x000a0;% of osteoporotic fractures are attributable to low dietary calcium intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This suggests that there are substantial preventable fractions in the order of 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, and that efforts to develop intervention strategies to improve calcium intake and physical activity to achieve this are warranted.</p><p>Previous research suggests that health education or health promotion interventions have the potential to influence selected health behaviours that affect bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interventions designed to enhance knowledge and self-efficacy showed increased calcium intake in the short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Physical activity outcomes, however, were less positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The majority of population-based interventions addressing osteoporosis prevention have not referenced past evidence to determine the level of behaviour change required to make an impact on the disease and its consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Workplaces with predominantly sedentary employees present unique opportunities for osteoporosis prevention, as occupational sitting has been associated with low bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Women in sedentary occupations are a priority group for osteoporosis prevention, as being both female and sedentary are independent risk factors for low bone mass and osteoporosis.</p><p>Existing evidence points to unrealized potential in both intervention design and use of the workplace setting in osteoporosis prevention.

Three day recording was selected as recording periods of more than 3 or 4&#x000a0;days were reported to be unreliable due to respondent fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Details of dietary record procedures have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity was measured using the EPIC Norfolk Physical Activity Questionnaire 2 (EPAQ-2): a self-reported questionnaire designed to measure different sub-dimensions of physical activity including load-bearing activity of relevance to osteoporosis prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The EPAQ-2 has been validated for use in large-scale epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The content of the EPAQ-2 was assessed for cultural appropriateness and ease of reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Minor modifications were made to the list of recreation activities. Activities that were not relevant to the local context, such as &#x0201c;digging, shoveling or chopping wood&#x0201d; were removed, and replaced with common local activities not included in the version developed for use in Europe, such as practicing Tai Chi.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Self-efficacy data and other information</title><p>As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], data on calcium intake and exercise self-efficacy scores were collected using the osteoporosis self-efficacy scale developed and evaluated by Horan et al. in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The content of the questionnaire was assessed for appropriateness to local context by a panel that included experts internal and external to the Health Promotion Board (Singapore). It was also validated for internal consistency and test-retest repeatability as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Socio-demographic and additional health information was collected at baseline using a questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention description</title><p>Subjects from workplaces assigned to the intervention group received three intensive workshops with strong focus on behavioural strategies guided by Bandura&#x02019;s Self&#x02013;Efficacy Model. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] The workshop design focused on individual goal setting and on participatory skill-building activities, goal-setting exercises, peer support and problem-solving discussions to attain individual goals and overcome individual barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The intervention addressed diet and physical activity as different entities that required different behavioural strategies. Though guided by the same principles, the workshops for diet and physically activity were unique in the nature and design of their activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Calcium intake intervention</title><p>Past studies that reported positive outcomes for calcium intake describe participatory activities that target the participants&#x02019; lifestyles and tastes and incorporation of local food sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Evidence also suggested that the provision of calcium intake feedback might be an effective tool to improve behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These elements were used to guide the development of intervention content. Food sampling, nutrition label reading and group activities with exchange of ideas were key activities in the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The baseline dietary records were inspected to identify common calcium food sources and consumption patterns amongst the study population.

Our study included these elements in the design of our intervention activities. Emphasis was placed on providing opportunities to sample a variety of the targeted physical activities.

A definition of load-bearing MVPA has been provided in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Data collection and intervention timeline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3506_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Stage one of the analysis involved linear regression modelling of follow-up outcome measures (as dependent variables) adjusting for baseline outcome measures and potential confounders, ignoring intervention status and cluster. Personal income, education and religion were identified as a priori confounders and were included in regression models individually and in combination. Individuals&#x02019; residual outputs, the differences between the observed values and the model predicted values, from each analysis (4&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months follow-ups) were saved to be used in stage two of the analysis.</p><p>Stage two entailed analyses of cluster-level summaries to compare differences between the intervention and control groups. Individual residuals calculated at stage one were used to generate cluster means, yielding eight observations for intervention and eight for control sites (or clusters).

Though these improvements attenuated to some degree at the 6-month follow-up, they continued to be significantly and substantially better for intervention versus control groups. The magnitude of change in both calcium intake and physical activity was greater than that reported in previous studies addressing osteoporosis prevention behaviours.</p><p>Calcium intake improvements in the intervention group attenuated to 300&#x000a0;mg 6&#x000a0;months post intervention but this is still valuable from a public health perspective as the population attributable fraction of hip fracture has been estimated to decrease by 3.34&#x000a0;% with every 300&#x000a0;mg increase in calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This increase is particularly valuable for women who have low calcium intake. In our study cohort, the mean calcium intake at baseline was 458.5&#x000a0;mg. About a quarter of osteoporotic fractures are independently attributable to low dietary calcium intake (&#x0003c;391&#x000a0;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In our study, 50&#x000a0;% of the women reported calcium intake under 391&#x000a0;mg/day at baseline. The reported osteoporotic fracture relative risk (RR) is 1.66 for a low dietary calcium intake (&#x0003c;=391&#x000a0;mg/day) when compared to a higher intake (&#x0003e;/=648&#x000a0;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our study saw an almost two-fold increase in the proportion of women who met calcium RDA (800&#x000a0;mg) in the intervention group. The intervention strategies implemented in this study have demonstrated the potential to reduce women&#x02019;s risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures appreciably.</p><p>The study targeted the specific measure of physical activity - moderate to vigorous load bearing physical activity - that has been proven to affect bone mass and osteoporosis prevention. The increase in load-bearing MVPA in the intervention group was 63.6&#x000a0;min greater than the control group immediately after the intervention and 51.2&#x000a0;min 6&#x000a0;months later. The risk of hip fracture declines 6&#x000a0;% for every increase of three MET hours/week, which is equivalent to 60&#x000a0;min per week walking at an average pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. If sustained, the increase in load bearing MVPA observed in this study has the potential to decrease fracture risk. The decision to target and measure load bearing MVPA makes it challenging to find comparable studies. Existing studies on osteoporosis prevention behaviours are not comparable in experimental design and methodological rigor. Most measure a less specific domain of physical activity. When designing the intervention, this study drew on recommendations from meta-analyses of general physical activity interventions. Despite targeting such a specific domain of physical activity, the intervention group showed results comparable with other well-designed physical activity studies targeting less specific types of activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The improvement in load-bearing MVPA, compared with the control group, was similar to the improvement in MVPA reported in two other well-designed workplace studies with similar intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A possible explanation is that the majority of the MVPA reported in our study falls under the subset of load-bearing MVPA, which means that the load-bearing MVPA in our cohort is representative of the general MVPA.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Strengths</title><p>This study has several strengths. First is the strong study design with a control group who only received print resources and individual calcium feedback without the behavioural strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first osteoporosis prevention behaviour study to use a cluster randomized design conducted and analyzed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. This study design eliminated the problem of contamination, which is important for an intervention that has a strong social component. The study design incorporated a highly conservative data analysis strategy to account for clustering effect by comparing cluster summaries instead of analyzing individual values. It adopted the approach of excluding values outside two standard deviations and adjusting for baseline outcome values and socioeconomic factors. The results stood up to the rigor of this approach and the intervention effects remained statistically and clinically significant. Attenuation for both outcome measures was higher with exclusion of outliers than with adjustment for socioeconomic factors. This is likely due to over-reporting in a small number of subjects in the intervention group.</p><p>Another strength of this study is the integration of evidence-based elements into the intervention design to develop a strong behavioural strategies, rather than cognitive strategies, for osteoporosis prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Diet and physical activity were treated as unique behaviours and were addressed using unique evidence-based intervention strategies.</p><p>A novel component of the study was the utilization of qualitative dietary information at baseline to guide the intervention. It was noted that women who already included a wide range of calcium-rich foods in their diet were still unable to meet the RDA due to a shortfall in quantity. The amount of calcium in a serving of food can be a very abstract concept, which is challenging to convey through mainstream media campaigns. Participants in the intervention group were supported to achieve sufficient quantity without substantial changes to their dietary habits. Local food sampling was a very economical and efficacious exercise to address portion sizes and common barriers such as taste aversion and cost concerns. It is worth noting that the control group subjects also received feedback on their calcium intake accompanied with education resources but made minimal improvements in their intake.</p><p>This study incorporated cumulative 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min blocks of load-bearing MVPA, in between or during daily routines to address the barrier of time. Daily short duration load-bearing activities of adequate intensity have been proven to increase bone mineral density especially in pre-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Evidence points to other long-term physiological benefits from short duration load-bearing MVPA for sedentary adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] who are more likely to adhere to this pattern of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>The focus on ownership of individual&#x02019;s goals and behaviour strategies, and the encouragement of incorporating changes with minimal disruption to existing lifestyle may have limited the attenuation in physical activity outcome after 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>To our knowledge, this first osteoporosis prevention behaviour change study utilized the worksite as a delivery platform. While individual goal setting and problem solving was the central component of the intervention, the delivery platform was chosen for its capacity to incorporate social models to facilitate behaviour change. This is a possible explanation for stronger outcomes compared to previous community-based cluster physical activity trials that intervened primarily at the individual level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p>While a strong randomized controlled design was used for this study, there are elements that could have been better controlled for a more stringent comparison, such as providing the same level of attention to both groups with variation only in the content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The presence of a control with &#x0201c;attention intervention&#x0201d; is recommended for future studies to examine the efficacy of the intervention described more rigorously.</p><p>Another limitation of this study was the non-availability of bone mineral density as an outcome measure. The outcomes measures in this study were derived from self-reports, which may incur potential bias. Steps were taken in this study to ensure the self-report measurement tools used were valid and reliable for the study population. Nevertheless, the osteoporosis preventive potential of the intervention would be more accurately and precisely assessed using objective bone mass density or other biomarkers. The observed changes in physical activity behaviour in this study may have led to improvements in site-specific bone mineral density such as in the hips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Objective outcome measures would also have eliminated the precision and accuracy issues posed by self-reported outcome measures. However, resource and feasibility limitations excluded these possibilities. The positive results of the present study might help to justify the use of bone mineral density measurements in future trials with longer duration of follow up.</p><p>Not targeting workplace policies and working conditions as part of the intervention was a third limitation. Inclusion of organization-level actions would have complemented and better supported individual behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] but it would have been harder to recruit worksites into the study and would have entailed greater complexity in the intervention process. Future studies could integrate job and work station modifications such that both work-related and non-work-related risk and protective factors, with the potential to further improve the prevention of osteoporosis as well as other chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Collection of individual process data in future studies is also recommended so the efficacy of different components within the intervention can be examined.</p><p>Future studies could also extend follow-up beyond 6&#x000a0;months to assess the effect sustainability. At the time of the study, published ICC values for the targeted outcome and mediators were either limited or absent. In retrospect, it is now known that ICCs were overestimated in the sample size calculations. The ICC estimates published in this study can be used in the design of future intervention studies in this area.</p><p>Potential selection bias due to subject attrition is a common limitation in population-based studies. This study reported loss of subjects due to work factors such as resignation and corporate restructuring, and due to personal factors like pregnancy. Over-recruitment of subjects within cluster subjects was a strategy used to maintain cluster sample size.</p><p>Another limitation is that this study did not have sufficient data about the non-responders to compare with the participants in this study. This means that the conclusions cannot be generalised to the general female working population from which our sample was taken. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a targeted intervention that focused on behavioural strategies. Future research should progress to effectiveness trials that incorporate methodological strategies for reporting on external validity data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The women in the intervention group reported significant and meaningful improvements in both calcium intake and physical activity that may have a positive and measurable impact on the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Considering the ease of widespread dissemination at workplaces, additional studies should progress to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention on women from a more diverse sample of workplaces, including bone mineral density or other objective outcomes to complement behavioural outcome measures.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2016_3506_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Physical activity definition.
