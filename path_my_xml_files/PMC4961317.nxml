Ethical approval was obtained from the regional ethical board in Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden (Dnr: 2010&#x02013;344&#x02013;31 M), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Potentially eligible participants were identified by screening medical records from three hospitals in Sweden (Norrlands University Hospital, Ume&#x000e5;; Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge; and &#x000d6;rnsk&#x000f6;ldsvik Hospital, &#x000d6;rnsk&#x000f6;ldsvik) and primary-care centres in the vicinity of each hospital.

Potential participants were excluded if they had a musculoskeletal, rheumatic, cardiac, or neurological disorder; had previously undergone lung surgery; were on long-term oxygen treatment; or had a body mass index of less than 18 (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Measurements were performed at Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital and at Karolinska University Hospital. Measurements were assessed by the same researcher for all participants at each location and were performed on two occasions. Each test occasion lasted between 1 and 2 hours. Information and encouragement were standardized, and the tests were conducted in the same order for all participants.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Measurements used in this analysis were performed at baseline, before the resistance exercise programme started.</p><sec><title>6-minute walk test</title><p>The 6MWT was used to measure LL functional capacity. The walking course was 30 m in length, and participants were instructed to walk as far as possible in 6 minutes. To minimize the learning effect, participants first performed a practice test; standardized instructions and encouragement were given according to American Thoracic Society guidelines for the 6MWT.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Test occasions were separated by more than 24 hours. The test with the longest distance walked was used for the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>6-minute pegboard and ring test</title><p>Unsupported arm function was measured using the 6PBRT, which uses a pegboard with two pegs set at participants' shoulder level (lower pegs) and two pegs set 20 cm above shoulder level (upper pegs). The pegs are positioned shoulder width apart for each participant. Ten lightweight wooden rings (6 g each) were placed on each of the lower pegs, and participants then moved one ring at a time from each lower peg to the corresponding upper peg, using both hands simultaneously. After moving all 20 rings from the lower to the upper pegs, participants moved them back, one at a time, from the upper pegs to the lower pegs. The participants were asked to move as many rings as possible in 6 minutes; the total score was the number of rings moved during the 6-minute period. Standardized encouragement was given every minute. Before testing, participants were allowed to move 20 rings from the lower to the upper pegs and vice versa to familiarize themselves with the procedure.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Unsupported upper limb exercise test</title><p>The UULEX was used to assess unsupported UL functional capacity. Participants sat on a chair with the UULEX chart attached to the wall in front of them. The UULEX chart consisted of eight horizontal levels. Each level was 84 cm wide and 8 cm high, and the distance between the centers of the levels was 15 cm. The lowest was placed at the level of the participants' knees. Participants held a plastic bar (0.2 kg) with their hands shoulder-width apart and moved it from the hips to the different levels on the UULEX chart in front of them. Each movement began and ended with the bar on the participant's hips. After 2 minutes at the first level, participants changed to a higher level every 1 minute, always returning the bar to the hip, regardless of level. The bar was lifted at a rate of 30 beats per minute, guided by a metronome. When participants reached their individual maximum height, the 0.2 kg bar was replaced with a heavier one (0.5 kg), and they continued to lift the bar to the highest level. Thereafter, the weight of the bar was increased by 0.5 kg each minute up to 2 kg. Participants were instructed to continue the test until symptom limitation.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, we included both 6PBRT and UULEX measurements of UL functional capacity because we expected them to measure somewhat different properties of functional capacity. Although the 6PBRT includes a small dynamic movement, it is mainly an isometric endurance test of the shoulders because it is performed with arms held in at least 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion. The UULEX is more of a dynamic measurement of functional capacity, including a large range of motion.</p></sec><sec><title>Limb muscle function</title><p>Muscle strength and endurance were measured during isokinetic knee extension and shoulder flexion, using two interchangeable stationary dynamometers: the Biodex Multi-Joint Systems 3 and 4 (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, NY). The tests were performed on the self-reported dominant side and were undertaken after the 6MWT, which was considered a warm-up. Before the maximal tests, participants performed five submaximal contractions to familiarize themselves with the procedure, followed by 2 minutes of rest before the test started. In both maximal strength and endurance tests, shoulder flexion was performed between 0&#x000b0; and 100&#x000b0; with the elbow held extended, the forearm semi-pronated, and the handle of the dynamometer placed in the hand. Knee extension was performed between 90&#x000b0; of flexion and full extension minus 5&#x000b0; to lower the risk of passive resistance from the hamstring muscle. The maximal strength test measured peak torque (in Newton metres) from the highest contraction, generated during five maximal contractions.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> After 5 minutes of rest, participants performed the endurance test, which consisted of 30 repetitions measuring total work (in joules). Both tests were measured with an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0; per second, which is considered ideal for evaluating isokinetic muscle strength in COPD and has also been found to be reliable in endurance tests.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Assumption of normal distribution of parameters was assessed using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilks test, which revealed that some parameters were not normally distributed. These parameters were transformed logarithmically to stabilize the variance. To investigate the relationship between two parameters, we performed bivariate correlations using Pearson correlation analysis. Partial correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between two parameters while controlling for a third (e.g., the correlation between walking distance and knee endurance while controlling for knee strength). The strength of the correlation coefficients was categorized as low (0&#x02013;0.25), moderate (&#x0003e;0.25&#x02013;0.50), strong (&#x0003e;0.50&#x02013;0.75), or very strong (&#x0003e;0.75).<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Because we expected a strong correlation between limb muscle strength and endurance, we performed a linear regression to investigate the presence of multicollinearity, that is, the loss of power to measure for a variable when it occurs alongside other variables with similar properties. To avoid multicollinearity, the variance factor should be below 4, according to previous literature.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Data are presented as means and standard deviations, with the threshold for significance set at <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The linear regression showed a variance factor of 3.6, which indicates no multicollinearity in the results.

This result highlights the importance of assessing limb muscle endurance, as well as strength, before beginning pulmonary rehabilitation. It also suggests that when designing exercise training programmes to improve functional capacity of people with COPD, clinicians should include limb muscle endurance training to a greater extent.</p><p>Functional capacity in people with COPD seems, as expected, to be correlated with both limb muscle strength and limb muscle endurance. Interestingly, the positive correlation with functional capacity only remained for limb muscle endurance when controlling for limb muscle strength. In fact, when controlling for limb muscle endurance, there was no longer any correlation between muscle strength and the 6MWT or UULEX, and the correlation between limb muscle strength and the 6PBRT was negative.</p><p>The negative correlation between muscle strength and the 6PBRT was unexpected, but a likely explanation is that those participants with better shoulder muscle strength measurements also had larger or heavier arms. It is known that muscle cross-sectional area is important for muscle strength in COPD,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> but although a large and heavy arm may be an advantage for muscle strength, it is likely to be a disadvantage for 6PBRT performance, which requires holding the arms almost static in at least 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion throughout, with only a small dynamic movement. However, arm size and weight were not measured in the original study, so we could not confirm this speculation with the measurements available. Ours is the first study to examine the correlation between limb muscle endurance and functional capacity in both ULs and LLs in people with COPD, and the results need to be confirmed in additional studies. The relationship and importance of limb muscle strength and endurance for functional capacity have also been demonstrated in people with chronic heart failure.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Previous studies have reported a correlation between limb muscle strength and functional capacity,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but only a few have also measured limb muscle endurance. Leite Rodrigues and colleagues<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> found that LL muscle strength was the only variable that could predict the distance walked in the 6MWT. Butcher and colleagues<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> found strong to very strong correlations between LL muscle strength and functional capacity as measured with the TUG and STS; this finding is in line with the results of our bivariate correlation analysis between LL muscle strength and functional capacity as measured with the 6MWT. But neither of these studies measured or controlled for limb muscle endurance. Vilaro and colleagues<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> found strong relationships between LL muscle endurance and 6MWT performance as well as between LL muscle strength and 6MWT performance, consistent with the results of the bivariate correlation analysis in our study. Although Vilaro and colleagues did not perform the further analysis that, in our study, suggested that limb muscle endurance may be more closely related to functional capacity, both their findings and ours highlight the need for separate assessments of muscle strength and endurance.</p><p>In contrast to Janaudis-Ferreira and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> who found moderate to strong correlations between shoulder flexion strength and the 6PBRT and UULEX, we found no positive correlations in either bivariate or partial correlation analysis; 6PBRT and UULEX performances were moderately correlated with shoulder flexion endurance, but not with shoulder flexion strength. These contradictory results may to some extent be explained by the angle used in the strength measurements: Whereas Janaudis-Ferreira and colleagues<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported isometric peak measurement in 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion, our isokinetic peak torque values were obtained much earlier in the movement, at approximately 30&#x000b0;&#x02013;40&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion. However, participants who are strong at 30&#x000b0;&#x02013;40&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion are also arguably strong at 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion, which would minimize the importance of shoulder angle to the results.</p><p>UL muscle endurance was more closely related to UULEX than to 6PBRT performance, which may be explained by a greater resemblance in arm movements between the UL muscle endurance test and the UULEX than between the UL muscle endurance test and the 6PBRT. The differences between movements in the tests and the moderate correlation between the 6PBRT and UULEX indicate that, as expected, they probably measure somewhat different properties. Whereas the UULEX seems to measure dynamic endurance capacity, the 6PBRT appears to reflect isometric endurance capacity. If this is the case, the stronger correlation we found between UULEX performance and isokinetic limb muscle endurance is not surprising. It is important to note that instruments designed to measure similar constructs can generate different results if they were designed for different purposes. A low correlation between tests underscores the fact that each instrument is providing unique information. Lack of strong correlation between tests does not imply that they are not valuable outcome measures in COPD.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> When clinicians are choosing an appropriate test to evaluate UL function, our findings may guide them to choose the UULEX if they are targeting dynamic functional endurance capacity or the 6PBRT if isometric endurance is of interest.</p><p>The strengths of our study are the comprehensive standardization of the testing procedure, with all tests led by the same researcher, at the same time of the day, with the same interval between testing occasions for all participants. The investigated tests are reliable, valid, and commonly used in research with this population.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Apart from the isokinetic limb muscle and endurance test, clinicians can easily use all measures because as they do not require expensive equipment or time.</p><p>Although the correlation between limb muscle strength and functional capacity has been demonstrated before, no study has reported the correlation between limb muscle endurance, strength, and functional capacity in both ULs and LLs in COPD.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, our results are valid only for patients with moderate to severe COPD; to broaden their applicability, it would be interesting to investigate whether the same relationship obtains for patients with more severe disease, especially given that limb muscle weakness is more prevalent with more severe disease.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Second, although assessment of limb muscle strength and endurance in our study targeted muscles that most likely play an important role in the functional tests performed, other potentially important muscles, such as the biceps brachii muscle and the soleus muscle, for which results might differ, were not assessed.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study found moderate to strong correlations between functional capacity and muscle strength and endurance in both ULs and LLs. When we controlled for muscle strength, muscle endurance was moderately correlated with functional capacity in both ULs and LLs. When we controlled for muscle endurance, however, we found no significant positive correlation between muscle strength and functional capacity in either ULs or LLs. Functional capacity thus seems to be more closely related to limb muscle endurance than to limb muscle strength. Our findings emphasize the importance of assessing limb muscle endurance and of incorporating limb muscle endurance training when designing exercise training programmes in pulmonary rehabilitation for people with COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Key Messages</title><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><p>Limb muscle dysfunction, including reduced maximal muscle strength and endurance, is a well-known consequence in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A correlation between limb muscle strength and functional capacity has been reported in several previous studies, but very few of them have measured muscle endurance.</p></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><p>One primary goal of exercise training for people with COPD is to improve functional capacity. The results of this study suggest that functional capacity is more closely related to limb muscle endurance than to limb muscle strength.
