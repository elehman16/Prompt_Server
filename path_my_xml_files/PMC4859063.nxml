Participants were 19 volunteer older adults, who received 15 1-h video game training sessions with a series of video games selected from a commercial package (<italic>Lumosity</italic>), and a control group of 20 healthy older adults. The results showed that the performance of the trainees improved significantly in all the practiced video games. Most importantly, we found significant enhancements after training in the trained group and no change in the control group in two computerized tasks designed to assess visuospatial WM, namely the Corsi blocks task and the Jigsaw puzzle task. The episodic memory and short-term memory of the trainees also improved. Gains in some WM and episodic memory tasks were maintained during a 3-month follow-up period. These results suggest that the aging brain still retains some degree of plasticity, and that video game training might be an effective intervention tool to improve WM and other cognitive functions in older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>brain plasticity</kwd><kwd>cognitive aging</kwd><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>training</kwd><kwd>video games</kwd><kwd>visuospatial working memory</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="23"/><ref-count count="91"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="11581"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related brain changes occurring mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe system (including the hippocampus and the cerebellum) are associated with cognitive declines (Raz et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) in several functions, including processing speed (Salthouse, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), peripheral vision (Mui&#x000f1;os and Ballesteros, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), dynamic visual acuity (Mui&#x000f1;os and Ballesteros, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), working memory (WM), executive control functioning, and episodic memory (e.g., Baltes and Lindenberger, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Hoyer and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Nilsson, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Park and Gutchess, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; R&#x000f6;nnlund et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, other cognitive functions, including implicit memory, verbal abilities and world knowledge, are mostly spared with age (e.g., Park et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Mitchell and Bruss, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Craik and Bialystok, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Osorio et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ballesteros and Mayas, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Experience-related changes induced by the modification of the social environment, physical activity, and cognitive training affect brain structure and function (for a recent review see, Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Research on brain plasticity in older adults and its relationship to experiential changes is currently attracting substantial public interest (Raz and Lindenberger, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, several studies have found brain plasticity not only in healthy older adults, but also in patients suffering chronic traumatic brain injury (Sacco et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), schizophrenia (Fisher et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and intellectual disability (S&#x000f6;derqvist et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recently, research on training-induced changes in brain and behavior has attracted a great interest in cognitive neuroscience across lifespan, especially in the older age. Studies on this field might contribute to improve our knowledge on brain plasticity and result of a great help for designing effective interventions (see Karbach and Schubert, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Training intervention studies suggest that the older human brain maintains a certain level of neural plasticity (Bialystok and Craik, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Based on this idea, an active line of research concerns ways of maintaining and/or improving cognitive skills (Green and Bavelier, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), delaying cognitive and brain declines as much as possible (Hertzog et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Park and Reuter-Lorenz, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Park and Bischof, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Reuter-Lorenz and Park, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The observed increase in neural volume in response to cognitive training is an indicator of brain plasticity (see, Boyke et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Park and Bischof, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Based on the assumption that the older brain retains at least some degree of plasticity and still has the capacity to modify its structural and functional patterns to meet new environmental demands, researchers are intensively exploring different types of intervention for older adults.</p><p>One of the most popular computerized intervention approaches is training older adults with video games. Some intervention studies have reported improvements in the trained group but not in the control group in several cognitive functions, including processing speed (e.g., Clark et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Dustman et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), visuo-motor coordination (Drew and Waters, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), attention (e.g., Goldstein et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Belchior, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mayas et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), memory (e.g., Craik et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hampstead et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), WM (e.g., Edwards et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Erickson et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Anguera et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and global cognitive function (Torres, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). By contrast, other studies have failed to find any positive effects of training with video games on cognition (e.g., Ackerman et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Owen et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Boot et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>).</p><p>Video games are designed with two aims: enjoyment and sustained player engagement (Anguera and Gazzaley, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). They can be classified as simple (non-action games) and complex (action games). Complex video games are fast, intense, unpredictable, and require more perceptual and cognitive skills than non-action games (e.g., Green and Bavelier, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Feng et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Some researchers have used complex video games to train older adults (e.g., Basak et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Stern et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), while others have used non-action games, which seem more appropriate for older adults (e.g., Torres, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; van Muijden et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>An important question in this context is whether training with video games transfers to other untrained cognitive functions. This is a critical issue for its practical significance, but remains debatable. A systematic review conducted to examine the effectiveness of computer-based interventions in cognitively healthy older adults found that video game training improved processing speed and global cognition but was less efficient for improving executive functions (Kueider et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). More recently, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the hypothesis that training older adults with video games enhances their cognitive functioning (Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The studies included in this meta-analysis were 20 experimental video game training interventions with pre- and post-training measures, published between 1986 and 2013. The mean effect size was moderate [0.37 (SE 0.05) with a 95% CI of between 0.26 and 0.48]. The results indicated that training older adults with video games produces moderate positive effects on several cognitive functions (e.g., reaction time (RT), attention, memory and global cognition), but does not improve executive functions. This meta-analytic study (see also Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also found that these positive results were moderated by variables such as the age of the trainees and the frequency or length of the training program (the amount of time needed to induce cognitive improvement).</p><p>WM is a capacity-limited system that stores and processes information needed for ongoing cognition. This capacity-limited workspace is necessary to keep things in mind while performing complex tasks such as comprehension and reasoning (Baddeley and Hitch, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). This key component of cognition, central to many cognitive functions, including concentration, problem solving, and impulse control, declines significantly with age (e.g., Park et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Bopp and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Park and Reuter-Lorenz, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Many recent reviews and longitudinal computerized cognitive training studies have investigated the effectiveness of computerized training approaches aimed at improving WM (e.g., Dahlin et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Perrig et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Klingberg, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Shipstead et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Takeuchi et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Boot et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Morrison and Chein, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Unfortunately, the results of these studies are at best mixed, with some articles reporting the effectiveness of WM training (e.g., Borella et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Klingberg, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Morrison and Chein, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), while others concluded that it is ineffective (e.g., Shipstead et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Redick et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Several recent meta-analytic studies (Karbach and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have noticed the great variability in the interventions in terms for example of the intensity and duration of the training regimes, whether they are carried out at home or in the presence of the trainer, and the age of the participants. Our meta-analytic study (Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed that a small number of training sessions is more effective than a large number, possibly because older adults get tired and lose motivation after many training sessions. We also found that the benefits of training increased with the age of participants. The lower baseline scores of the older participants can explain this result. Lampit et al. (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also found that computerized cognitive training can improve the cognitive performance of healthy older adults, but that its effectiveness varies across domains. They suggested that training more than three times per week is ineffective. Karbach and Verhaeghen (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) examined the effects of executive-function and WM training in older adults, suggesting that the inconsistencies of the results were due to differences in the type, intensity, and duration of the intervention, and to the methods used to compare different studies. Their results suggest that WM and executive-function training produces significant and large improvements in the performance of the trained tasks and reliable small to medium-sized transfer effects in the process trained, at least in healthy older adults.</p><p>A recent randomized controlled trial study conducted to investigate the effects of training older adults with non-action video games on a series of cognitive functions that decline with age and on subjective wellbeing (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found significant improvements in the experimental group after training in processing speed, attention, immediate and delayed visual recognition memory, as well as a tendency to improve in some dimensions (affection and assertiveness) of the wellbeing scale. However, visuospatial WM and executive control did not improve after training. Overall, these pre-/post-training results support the view that training older adults with non-action video games improves some cognitive abilities but not others. Moreover, the assessment conducted after a 3-month no-contact interval showed that the benefits in processing speed, attention and long-term memory vanished and that only the effects on wellbeing were maintained 3 months later (see Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). However, participants in the trained group showed no transfer to either executive control or spatial WM from pre-test to 3-month follow-up. These results suggest that cognitive plasticity can be induced in healthy older adults, but that periodic boosting sessions are needed to maintain the training benefits.</p><p>In view of the importance of WM for the daily life activities of older adults, we designed this longitudinal intervention study taking into account the results of our previous study (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>) and the findings of several recently published meta-analyses (Karbach and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The program was composed of 15 1-h sessions. An important variable is the number of video games included in the training schedule (see Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and we therefore selected just six non-action video games to train mainly WM. Importantly, all the participants in the experimental group were trained in group sessions at the municipal senior center and in the presence of an experimenter (as recommended by Kelly et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref> and Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to investigate whether cognitively healthy older adults could benefit from training with non-action video games. We addressed two main questions. First, would training older adults with non-action video games improve their visuospatial WM as well as short- and long-term memory? Secondly, would any improvements persist after a 3-month no-contact period? Based on the results of previous studies, we hypothesized that: (1) video game training would improve the visuospatial WM of older adults; (2) the effects of training would transfer to episodic memory; and (3) memory improvements would persist 3 months after finishing the training program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty cognitively healthy volunteer older adults were recruited from a municipal senior center in the Madrid suburbs to participate in this training study. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing and informed that they did not have previous experience with video games. After signing a consent form, participants were randomly assigned either to the trained (experimental) group or to the control group. Participants in both groups regularly attended cultural activities at the senior center (e.g., painting classes, lectures, cultural visits). The control group continued their routine lifestyle activities at the senior center. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Nacional de Educaci&#x000f3;n a Distancia. The inclusion criteria were to obtain a score of 26 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>) and a normal score on the Information subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS III; Wechsler, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The two groups did not differ in age, years of education, or in the Information subscale and MMSE scores (all <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.05).

The participant had to point to the blocks in their order of presentation. The length of the sequence increased until recall was no longer correct in terms of order or position (Berch et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In this study, we used the same computerized version of the Corsi task as in our previous study (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with four levels of increasing difficulty (2, 3, 4 and 5 cube positions) and 10 trials per level. The stimuli were black squares on a 3 &#x000d7; 3 matrix that appeared one after the other, for 1 s each. The positions in each sequence were selected randomly, with the restriction that stimuli could not appear in the same position in two consecutive sequences. In each trial, the participant reproduced the previously presented sequence of cubes (the black squares in the 3 &#x000d7; 3 matrix) by writing down their order of presentation on a separate response sheet. To familiarize participants with the task, they performed a practice block of trials.

We designed a computerized version of this task with puzzles consisting of 4, 6 or 9 pieces. Each piece was numbered and the participant had to write down on a response sheet the number corresponding to the pieces in the correct spatial positions. The stimuli were 15 pictures with similar visual complexity (mean = 2.4, SD = 0.32) and familiarity (mean = 4.3, SD = 0.26) selected from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>) picture set. Each picture was fragmented into 4, 6 and 9 pieces to produce 45 different puzzles. The pictures were enlarged to fit a 12 cm &#x000d7; 12 cm area and were cut into four 6 cm &#x000d7; 6 cm pieces, six 6 cm &#x000d7; 4 cm pieces, or nine 3 cm &#x000d7; 3 cm pieces using Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe Systems Software, Ireland Ltd.). We generated three different counterbalanced orders. Different pictures were used at pre-test, post-test and follow-up assessments. Participants were presented with 15 puzzles representing all possible combinations and number of pieces. The response sheets contained grids of the same size as the original pictures with the appropriate number of squares (4, 6, 9 squares). We used two puzzles as practice items and their results were not included in the analysis. For each trial, a fragmented picture appeared on the computer screen and the participant wrote down on the response sheet the appropriate numbers to form a spatially correct picture. The jigsaw was presented on the computer screen for 90 s. Participants were allowed to correct errors within that time. Performance was assessed in terms of the proportion of correct puzzles per level (4, 6 and 9 pieces).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Short-Term Memory</title><p>Short-term memory was assessed with the Digit Span Test of the WAIS III scale (Wechsler, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Digit Span Test</title><p>This test has two parts: Digit span forward and Digit span backward<italic>.</italic> For each part, the test administrator says a series of numbers aloud at the rate of one per second.

Second, and most important, the trainees performed the Jigsaw puzzle, Corsi Blocks, Digit forward, and Faces I and II tasks better than the control group. Third, the improved performance of the trained group was maintained from baseline to the 3-month follow-up for the Jigsaw puzzle task, which is a visuospatial WM task, and on the Digits forward, and Faces I and II tasks, but not on the Corsi Blocks, the other visuospatial WM task. These results are encouraging considering the age-related declines that occur in these memory functions.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Non-Action Video Games Training Transferred to Working Memory</title><p>The improvements found in the present study are in line with previous findings reported in other video game training studies conducted with older adults (e.g., Basak et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Anguera et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Basak et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) found improvements on working memory tasks after training older adults for 23.5 h with a real-time strategy video game (action video game). Anguera et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) trained older adults (60&#x02013;75 years) for 4 weeks with an adaptive version of <italic>Neuroracer</italic>. Participants reduced multitasking costs at the post-training evaluation compared to an active control group and a no-contact control group. Moreover, the benefits of training were extended to an untrained WM task, and gains persisted for 6 months.</p><p>The results of this longitudinal study are in agreement with those of other researchers who trained older adults using computerized training programs. For example, Buschkuehl et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) conducted an adaptive visual WM training study with oldest-old adults (mean age = 80 years). They found substantial gains in the trained task and improvements immediately after training in visual WM, which disappeared at the 1-year follow-up. Li et al. (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) also investigated the effects of WM training on performance improvement, transfer and short-term maintenance of practice gains. In their study, young and older adults practiced a spatial WM task for 45 days, about 15 min per day. In both age groups, these researchers found improvements on the practiced tasks, and near transfer to spatial and numerical <italic>n</italic>-back tasks. Moreover, practice gains and near transfer effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up, but performance after training was lower in older than in young adults. Dahlin et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) conducted a computer&#x02013;based training study with young and older adults based on updating information in WM. The results showed that both trained groups showed significantly greater improvement on the letter memory criterion task than the control group. Interestingly, gains were maintained 18 months later in young adults but not in older adults. Recently, Zinke et al. (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) trained WM in older adults in nine sessions over 3 weeks and found near transfer effects in a Corsi blocks task at post-test compared with pre-test.</p><p>The results of the present study also agree with findings of a recent meta-analysis (Karbach and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The authors showed that executive functions and WM training led to significant improvements in performance in the trained tasks as well as large near transfer effects in older adults. However, the findings of the present study do not agree with the results of Maillot et al. (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) who found that after a 24-h training program the trainees improved more than controls in measures of executive control and processing speed functions, but not in visuospatial measures. The present results conflict with those of Ballesteros et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), who did not find any improvement in visuospatial WM tasks (Corsi Blocks and Jigsaw puzzle tasks) or executive functions after 20 1-h training sessions with 10 non-action video games selected from the <italic>Lumosity</italic> platform, although the video game training intervention was effective for improving RT, attention, and episodic memory.</p><p>The trained group improved digit span forward performance after training while the control group performed similarly across the three assessment sessions. However, in digit span backward test (a more difficult task), the trained group did not improve after training while the performance of the control group declined. It is important to note that the age-related declines in digit span backward performance is greater than that in digit span forward. This result is in agreement with the meta-analysis of Babcock and Salthouse (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). This result supports the idea that with advancing age, the digit span forward test tends to remain stable while the digit span backward task tends to decline (Lezak, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). This might explain the performance of our control group in the forward and backward span digit tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Video Game Training Enhanced Some Episodic Memory Tests</title><p>The present study also found improvements in some episodic memory tests after training, similar to the results of our previous study (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), in which we found effects of training in episodic memory (Family Pictures I and II). However, in the present study we found improvements after training in Faces (I and II), which were maintained over a 3-month period without contact. We found improvements in Faces I and II (two recognition tests) after training but not in Family Pictures (two recall tests). This result might be explained because free recall requires greater resources than recognition and this effect increases with age (Craik and McDowd, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). In Faces, the recognition test, the information is present while performing the memory task. However, in Family Pictures, a recall test, very few cues are provided and participants have to initiate a series of mental operations, which require more effort. In the trained group, video game training could help participants to recall features although they did not improve after training. The results obtained in Faces suggest that the task was easy for both groups. The trained group improved after training and controls were able to maintain their performance over time.</p><p>Our results are in line with those of Buschkuehl et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) who conducted a WM training study with 80-year-old adults who trained twice a week for 3 months. Participants showed improvements in the trained tasks (visual WM tasks) and to a lesser degree, in a visual episodic memory task (visual free recall) in which they had to look for differences between two almost identical pictures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Results at 3-Month Follow-Up</title><p>The usefulness of the intervention depends on both the occurrence of transfer effects and the durability of the training effects. Accordingly, it was important to ascertain whether the benefits found at post-training on some WM tasks and short- and long-term memory tests were maintained after a 3-month no-contact follow-up period. In this study, transfer effects were maintained in the Digit forward test, the Jigsaw puzzle task, and in the Faces I and Faces II tests. However, significant improvements in the Corsi blocks task were not maintained.</p><p>Our results are in line with those of Anguera et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) who trained older adults for 4 weeks with an adaptive version of <italic>Neuroracer</italic> and found benefits after training. Specifically, they reported reduced multitasking costs in the trained group compared to the control group. The benefits found after training extended to an untrained WM task, and gains persisted for 6 months. The 3-month maintenance found in the present study is in line with the results of Li et al. (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) who found specific improvements in young and older adults in a WM task and maintenance of near transfer effects at 3-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>The Video Games Training Debate</title><p>The conflicting results obtained in cognitive and brain-training studies with computerized cognitive exercises and video games have been explored in several recent meta-analyses (Karbach and Verhaeghen, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Specifically, we found that short training interventions conducted with older adults produced better results than long regimes (Toril et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Training sessions are exciting at first, but older adults get tired and bored during the last sessions. Karbach and Kray (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) found significant transfer effects in older adults after just four training sessions, as did Kramer et al. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) who provided a limited number of training sessions. Lampit et al. (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) concluded that unsupervised at-home training regimes were less effective than group-based sessions, and that training more than three times a week was also ineffective. Another important variable was the number of video games used during the training sessions. Although not significant, Toril et al. (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found a trend in the analysis indicating that it is better to use a small set of video games than a large set.</p><p>It is important to stress that, on the basis of previous results (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>; Lampit et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we designed the present study as a group-based training program with the presence of the experimenter throughout. The presence/absence of the experimenter might affect the participants&#x02019; interest in training (Borella et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It is important to note that in our previous training study (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) the experimenter was always present during each training session, but each session involved only 2&#x02013;3 participants and not the whole group. The lack of improvement after training in visuospatial WM in our previous study (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and the positive results obtained in the present study might be due to the larger number of video games used in the earlier study (10) compared to just six specially selected to train visuospatial WM in the present study. The training regime of the present study was focused on enhancing WM, and this might explain the positive training effects obtained here.</p><p>Another important question regarding cognitive training concerns transfer. The evidence of transfer from video game training to untrained tasks is mixed, with both positive and negative results. Some researchers (Melby-Lerv&#x000e5;g and Hulme, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) argue that WM training has positive effects on tasks close to the trained tasks (near transfer). However, in a more recent study the same authors did not find evidence that WM training was effective (Melby-Lerv&#x000e5;g and Hulme, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Owen et al. (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) examined whether some training tasks would improve cognitive performance, and concluded that there was no transfer to untrained tasks. In our study, we found positive near transfer effects, as well as smaller transfer effects on other untrained episodic memory tasks. Moreover, it is important to stress that there is not an overlap between the training and the transfer tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions, Limitations of the Present Study and Future Directions</title><p>To summarize, the results of the present study suggest that training older adults with non-action video games can be an effective way of improving visuospatial WM performance in tasks designed to assess this type of memory and episodic memory tests. Importantly, the effects were maintained over a 3-month no-contact follow-up period in the Jigsaw puzzle task, Digit forward (short-term memory), and Faces I and Faces II (episodic memory). Transfer effects were not maintained on Corsi blocks. These findings suggest that older brains retain plasticity, but that some periodic boosting sessions are needed to maintain the benefits.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. First, our sample was smaller than in other studies (e.g., Mozolic et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Anguera et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, it is important to stress that we did not have any drop-outs, which is unusual in longitudinal training studies, which lose between 30 and 40% of participants at follow-up. This suggests that training programs carried out in places that older adults attend regularly, and training sessions attended by the whole group with the presence of the experimenter are more effective than training individually at home or in small groups. Secondly, we did not examine the effects of training older adults with video games on everyday life tasks. This is an important issue for future studies. Thirdly, the control group in the present study was passive. However, most studies have also used a passive control group (e.g., Goldstein et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Basak et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Maillot et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to compare with the trained group, only a few training studies involving both an active and a passive control group (e.g., Torres, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Stern et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Anguera et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Boot et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). However, it is worth mentioning that in their meta-analysis, Toril et al. (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) calculated the effect sizes of the published studies that included both an active and a passive control group (5 out of the 20 studies in the meta-analysis). The mean effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) was 0.36 for the active control group and 0.37 for the passive group. The difference was not statistically significant. However, future studies would include active and passive control groups.</p><p>It would be interesting in future studies to include a questionnaire to assess expectation (anticipated cognitive gains from game play) and the effects of the social contact with the experimenter and the other older adults. Furthermore, video game designers need to work with researchers in aging to create attractive and useful games specifically designed for older adults. Video games have to be interesting to motivate older adults to play them.</p><p>Commercial brain-training programs are currently generating millions of dollars, with very large revenues for the brain-training industry. Video game training is a very active area of research, but there are still important intervention-based factors that require further research. Large-scale longitudinal studies with long follow-up assessments of trained and control groups are necessary before researchers can answer many important questions related to the effectiveness of video-games to improve cognition (Boot et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>; Boot and Kramer, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Green et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Anguera and Gazzaley, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, future research should investigate ways of designing video game training regimes that produce and maintain training benefits in older adults. Further research should take into account multi-domain interventions that can be carried out in social settings, involving computerized cognitive training (e.g., video game training) and physical exercise (Ballesteros et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). In sum, future studies would benefit from using well-supported neuroscience findings to design multi-domain, longitudinal intervention studies to investigate the possible benefits for older adults, and then validate the benefits of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PT, JM, SB and JMR: conceived and designed the experiments, contributed reagents/material/analysis tools, wrote the article, and reviewed the manuscript.
