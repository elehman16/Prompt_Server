As regards ovarian response, factors mentioned include age, ovarian volume, number of antral follicles, blood flow in ovarian stroma, serums levels of FSH, LH, estradiol and inhibin B, smoking, and body mass index. Pregnancy predictors identified include age, serum levels of FSH, LH, estradiol and inhibin B, endometrial thickness, smoking, and body mass index, and parity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cmrh-5-2011-001">7</xref></p><p>Most of these studies included one or only a few predictors of ovarian response or pregnancy, but virtually none included the COH protocol in the multivariate analysis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cmrh-5-2011-001">7</xref> despite the fact that many differences have been reported depending on the type of gonadotropin used.</p><p>The most commonly used gonadotropins are highly purified hMG (hp-hMG) and recombinant FSH (r-FSH). This is why most studies conducted to date in normally responding women have focused on comparing the two abovementioned preparations in women undergoing suppression with a GnRH agonist.

This improved treatment efficacy has previously been reported by other authors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cmrh-5-2011-001">10</xref> In addition, the group treated with r-FSH with potential dose adjustment achieved a greater follicle development than all other groups.</p><p>These results agree with those obtained in the study conducted by Platteau et al in 2006, where patients receiving hp-hMG were found to have a significantly lower number of follicles than those treated with r-FSH,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cmrh-5-2011-001">18</xref> and also with those from the Merit study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cmrh-5-2011-001">13</xref> and the abovementioned study by Bosch.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cmrh-5-2011-001">14</xref> This could be explained by the potential atretic effect on non-dominant follicles attributed to the LH/hCG effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cmrh-5-2011-001">18</xref></p><p>Patients treated with hp-hMG have also been reported to have a greater expression of antiapoptotic proteins in granulosa cells. This, combined with the higher progesterone levels found in patients treated with r-FSH,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cmrh-5-2011-001">14</xref> could have implications for oocyte development and competence,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-cmrh-5-2011-001">19</xref> and hp-hMG therefore appears to be a potential modulator of follicle development.</p><p>All of these data, combined with the fact that treatment with GnRH antagonists may increase apoptosis of non-dominant oocytes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cmrh-5-2011-001">3</xref> could be the explanation for the high pregnancy rates achieved in our study, particularly in the group treated with hp-hMG (41%), taking as reference the 25.6% transfer pregnancy rate in Spain recorded in the last ESHRE registry for IVF/ICSI cycles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cmrh-5-2011-001">17</xref></p><p>In conclusion, women undergoing pituitary suppression with GnRH antagonists appear to have better results when COH with hp-hMG is administered. Such improvements would be a shorter duration of stimulation, lower gonadotropin doses, and improved pregnancy rates when two embryos are transferred.</p><p>A weakness of the study is that patients who met the inclusion criteria were assigned to any treatment protocol based on the investigator decision, ie, the decision to include each patient in each of the treatment groups was taken beforehand by the investigator. As a result, groups are misbalanced: 51 patients were assigned to Group I, 61 to Group II, 118 to Group III, and 75 to Group IV. The risk of bias due to the non randomization could not be excluded and it is recommend carrying out larger randomized controlled studies to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cmrh-5-2011-001"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This manuscript has been read and approved by all authors.
