As would be expected, lower remission response rates were observed when the alternative, lower cutoff point for remission was used (2.4 versus 2.6); however, the response rates were still substantially higher for the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) than for the other measures (additional information is available upon request from the corresponding author). A similar effect was observed for rates of low disease activity using the alternative cutoff point (2.9 versus 3.2).</p><p>To investigate whether the ESR or the CRP level was a primary component contributing to these differences, the mean changes from baseline in the ESR and CRP level at month 3 were compared (additional information is available upon request from the corresponding author). Clinically significant reductions in both the ESR and the CRP level were observed in the active&#x02010;treatment groups. However, the postbaseline values for acute&#x02010;phase reactants had differentially weighted effects on the DAS&#x02010;defined target thresholds. For example, after 3 months of treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, the resulting mean CRP concentration of 5.4 mg/liter across the 5 studies contributed 0.67 points to the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) (or 1.63 points when accounting for &#x0201c;+0.96&#x0201d; in the formula), while the mean ESR value of 32.2 mm/hour contributed 2.43 points to the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR).</p><p>The relative change from baseline in the CRP levels, based on pooled mean values, was stable in the placebo group (&#x02212;1.3%) and ranged from &#x02212;69.1% to &#x02212;54.0% in the active&#x02010;treatment groups.

Therefore, given this different weighting of the acute&#x02010;phase reactants and the same cutoff point for remission (&#x0003c;2.6), a much smaller proportion of patients will achieve DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) remission versus DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) remission, if the other score components (joint counts and patient's global assessments) are equal, as is the case in the individual trials <xref rid="art39996-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="art39996-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="art39996-sec-0011"><title>Frequencies of remission</title><p>Remission and low disease activity rates are described at the time point at which the primary efficacy end point was assessed for each study: month 3 for ORAL Step and ORAL Solo, and month 6 for ORAL Scan, ORAL Standard, and ORAL Sync.

In contrast, the rate of DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) remission was significantly higher in patients treated with tofacitinib compared with those treated with placebo. Importantly, although the SDAI and CDAI remission rates were much lower than the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) remission rates, the SDAI and CDAI remission rates in the active&#x02010;treatment groups were significantly different from the rates in the placebo group (Figure <xref rid="art39996-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Consistent with this, similar results were observed when low disease activity was used as an end point (additional information is available upon request from the corresponding author).</p><p>Boolean&#x02010;based remission rates were statistically significantly greater for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily than for placebo in all studies except ORAL Standard, and for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily versus placebo for ORAL Step only (Figure <xref rid="art39996-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Remission rates were generally numerically greater for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily than for 5 mg twice daily, with the exception of the ORAL Step study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="art39996-sec-0012"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this analysis, we used data from 5 phase III clinical studies of tofacitinib in RA to compare remission rates using 5 disease status criteria. Across the 5 studies, DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) criteria generated 2&#x02010;fold to 5&#x02010;fold higher remission rates compared with the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR). At month 3, remission rates with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily were 18&#x02013;22% using the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) and 5&#x02013;10% using the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) and with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily were 19&#x02013;30% and 7&#x02013;12%, respectively. Remission rates determined using the SDAI and the CDAI were consistently similar to each other. At month 3, remission rates with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily were 4&#x02013;7% using the SDAI and 5&#x02013;6% using the CDAI and with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily were 6&#x02013;10% and 6&#x02013;9%, respectively. As expected, these rates were also similar to rates using the Boolean&#x02010;based method. At month 3, remission rates with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily were 2&#x02013;7% and with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily were 5&#x02013;7%.</p><p>It has been noted that the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) conveys lower scores than the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) at identical joint counts and global assessments <xref rid="art39996-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, and with a remission cutoff of &#x0003c;2.6, the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) may underestimate disease activity more than the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR). However, the extent of the discrepancy between these 2 variants of the same type of score is surprising. In addition, previous studies have shown similar low disease activity response rates when using these DAS28 variants <xref rid="art39996-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. In the current analysis, however, low disease activity response rates were &#x0223c;2&#x02010;fold higher for the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) than for the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR). Given that the tender joint count, the swollen joint count, and the global assessment scores were identical using the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) and the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) and the ESR and CRP level are transformed in a similar manner in the 2 formulas, the likely explanations for these differences may be the differential effects of drugs with distinct mechanisms of action on the ESR and CRP level. Alternatively, the term &#x0201c;0.36*ln(CRP+1)&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.96&#x0201d; of the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) may not adequately replace the term &#x0201c;0.70*ln(ESR)&#x0201d; of the DAS28&#x02010;ESR in patients with lower levels of disease activity when agents affecting the acute&#x02010;phase response are used. As a consequence, a greater reduction in the ESR term than in the CRP term is needed to achieve the same score for the 2 DAS28 instruments.</p><p>While tofacitinib, as a JAK inhibitor, interferes with interleukin&#x02010;6 (IL&#x02010;6) signaling, and IL&#x02010;6 is the major activator of acute&#x02010;phase reactants <xref rid="art39996-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, it appears to have different effects on the CRP level and the ESR. Tofacitinib reduces CRP concentrations to a level that, when entered into the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) formula, may have resulted in values below the remission threshold, despite residual joint counts and high patient's global assessment, while the ESR was not affected to a similar extent. Therefore, it is likely that the differing extents of changes in acute&#x02010;phase reactant levels, regardless of treatment, contribute significantly to the disparate rates of remission and low disease activity achieved using the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) and the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP), especially when compared with the other criteria; previous studies that have assessed remission rates using both the DAS28 and the index&#x02010;based ACR/EULAR criteria demonstrated SDAI and CDAI remission rates that were consistently lower than both DAS28&#x02010;based definitions <xref rid="art39996-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Here, DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) clearly overestimated remission rates.</p><p>The interaction between treatment effects on acute&#x02010;phase reactants and the criteria used to assess rates of remission and low disease activity have been described previously in the context of IL&#x02010;6 inhibition <xref rid="art39996-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Indices in which acute&#x02010;phase reactants have higher weight may lead to discordances in remission rates when compared with other outcomes across treatments. This study also reveals the limitations of using DAS28&#x02010;defined remission as an end point, consistent with the conclusions of the ACR/EULAR provisional definition of remission <xref rid="art39996-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and expands this information to use of the DAS28 to determine a state of low disease activity.</p><p>The differential effect on the ESR and CRP level deserves further investigation, bearing in mind that the CRP level constitutes a measure of a single protein, while the ESR is a complex reaction of various acute&#x02010;phase reactants and presumably other factors <xref rid="art39996-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Indeed, in ORAL Solo, DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) remission rates (the primary end point) were not significantly different with tofacitinib than with placebo, while DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) remission and, of special note, CDAI and SDAI remission rates (i.e., index&#x02010;based ACR/EULAR criteria) were significantly different with tofacitinib than with placebo. These and other previous findings reveal the importance of selecting appropriate measures of disease activity and efficacy end points in clinical trials. Results that are more consistent are obtained when indices are used in which clinical components are more highly weighted than acute&#x02010;phase reactants <xref rid="art39996-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>.</p><p>Although it is clearly necessary to select appropriate instruments in clinical trial design, our study also has important implications for clinical practice, because the DAS28 is widely used in daily practice during care of RA patients. Rheumatologists may make little distinction between the DAS28&#x02010;ESR and the DAS28&#x02010;CRP, given the availability of the respective calculators and programs; however, today, when both the ACR and EULAR strongly recommend use of a treat&#x02010;to&#x02010;target approach in the management of RA to achieve remission or low disease activity <xref rid="art39996-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="art39996-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, use of an appropriate instrument is crucial. If a score such as the DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) conveys high rates of remission and low disease activity when a particular therapy is used, rheumatologists may be inclined to continue the respective treatment despite persistently active disease. On the other hand, if a score such as the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR), in the case of tofacitinib use, reveals an erroneously low frequency of remission, effective therapy may be regarded as insufficient and may be stopped despite a state of inactive disease. Because of the huge number of differences in outcomes, it is alarming when these scores are used interchangeably, as the term &#x0201c;DAS28&#x02010;4&#x0201d; would suggest. The importance of our findings in terms of clinical practice must be considered in the context of increasing use of tofacitinib and the advent of additional JAK inhibitors.</p><p>This analysis confirmed that treatment with tofacitinib in patients with moderate to severe RA resulted in greater remission and low disease activity rates versus placebo when a variety of disease activity indices were used. Irrespective of the instrument used, the rates of remission and low disease activity continued to increase to month 6 in the respective studies (ORAL Sync, ORAL Scan, and ORAL Standard), and rates were generally numerically higher for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily versus 5 mg twice daily.</p><p>A limitation of this analysis was that all patients had a uniform baseline disease status of moderate to severe RA; &#x0223c;90% of these patients met the criteria for high disease activity (baseline DAS28&#x02010;4[ESR] &#x0003e;5.1); patients with less&#x02010;active RA or early RA may be expected to achieve higher remission rates. This should be taken into account when applying these data to clinical practice.</p><p>In summary, the rates of remission and low disease activity observed using SDAI and CDAI criteria were consistent across studies, while, in line with previous observations, DAS28&#x02010;based criteria did not convey consistent results. In the current study, this was attributable to differential contributions of acute&#x02010;phase reactant measures to the observed remission and low disease activity rates. These data reveal the limitations of the DAS28 as a definition of remission due to its heavy dependence on changes in acute&#x02010;phase reactants. This is of particular relevance when agents that interfere with the acute&#x02010;phase response are used, such as those that lead to cytokine blockade or JAK inhibition; this should be considered during the design of clinical trials and taken into account in clinical practice. The data also show that the DAS28&#x02010;4(ESR) and DAS28&#x02010;4(CRP) are not interchangeable. Consequently, this study confirms the usefulness of the ACR/EULAR provisional definition of remission, both Boolean&#x02010;based and index&#x02010;based.</p></sec><sec id="art39996-sec-0014"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
