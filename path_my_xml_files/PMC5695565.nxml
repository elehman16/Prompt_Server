We focus on bereaved adults because experiencing the death of a spouse during later life is associated with an intense period of suffering and an increased risk of developing debilitating mental health problems. Approximately 10&#x02013;20% of older adults are diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and/or prolonged grief disorder(s) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> in the context of losing their spouse. Preventing mental health problems is important because these conditions are highly prevalent and have lasting adverse consequences for the well-being of the bereaved survivor including physical disability, morbidity, and excess mortality <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Apart from the emotional strain of losing a spouse, there are profound changes to bereaved survivors' lifestyle and daily routine (wake time, meal time, activity time, bed time, etc.) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Losing a spouse leads to the absence of social cues that once kept daily routines properly entrained; bereaved elders suddenly feel no reason to wake up, eat meals, or go to bed at a particular time <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These changes disrupt the stability of individuals' internal chronobiological rhythms, placing them at high risk for mood disorders like depression <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Observational research shows that among the bereaved, changes in daily routines associated with physical activity, food preparation/eating, and sleep/wake regularity are correlated with symptoms of depression and complicated grief <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">For this pilot intervention study, we chose to develop and implement an intervention that we hypothesized might prevent depression, anxiety, and/or prolonged grief disorders in bereaved elders via re-entraining a regular daily routine: behavioral self-monitoring of daily lifestyle choices and motivational interviewing-based lifestyle coaching. Interventions such as behavioral self-monitoring (BSM) offer a promising, nonstigmatised strategy to equally target physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene practices <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. BSM teaches older adults to become mindful of their daily lifestyle practices and the conditions in which they occur. The steps of BSM include: (1) selecting a goal, (2) paying attention to some aspect of behavior, and (3) recording that behavior in a diary. We implemented a technology-based approach using personalized tablets to decrease participant burden and improve participant retention <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Improving lifestyle practices can be challenging, requiring effort and motivation. Therefore, the effects of BSM to promote healthy lifestyle change may be enhanced by using motivational interviewing (MI) &#x02013; a patient-centered approach to strengthen bereaved elders' motivation and commitment to change. MI facilitates healthy lifestyle change by helping patients resolve ambivalence about lifestyle change in an empathetic and encouraging climate <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">We designed this pilot study to inform researchers about whether a healthy lifestyle intervention designed to target the daily routine of bereaved elders is feasible and acceptable when offered alone, and when offered in combination with MI.

The app was developed by programmers at the University of Pittsburgh's University Center for Social and Urban Research. We held meetings with programmers to design the style of the diary interface so that it was acceptable to older adults. We insured that large fonts and color contrasts were used to assist those with vision deficits. We added an instruction &#x02018;button&#x02019; for each question to assist those needing assistance answering questions. Examples of instruction buttons included the definition of bedtime and wake time; the definition of moderate and vigorous activity; and the definitions of dietary serving sizes. Several participants had arthritis and/or dexterity problems and could not tap the tablet screen hard enough to record their activity. Therefore, we offered a paper version of the daily diary that consisted of two sheets per day for 12 weeks. Compliance was close to 100% for the paper version (vs. 66% in the tablet version). Participants wanted more information from the tablet in understanding their health behaviors, so we added a section that provided feedback about recorded behaviors. This feedback section was not a required part of the intervention protocol, but participants could view graphs and charts that depicted their daily activity, sleep, and diet behaviors.</p><p id="p0125">Tablets were modified for maximal ease of use of the study app: quick links to other apps were deleted from the home screens and links to the study app were placed in easily accessible places. Participants trained in utilizing basic tablet functions such as returning to the home screen, swiping to log in, and accessing settings functions so that troubleshooting could be completed over the phone (if necessary). After training was complete, we used &#x02018;screen pinning&#x02019; to lock the tablet display in a single view that allowed only the use of the diary app.</p><p id="p0130">There were several unanticipated technology problems that impacted participants' satisfaction and data collection. When the tablets powered down, the time and/or the user profile would reset, inhibiting participants' ability to access the daily diaries. Random system updates and changes in daylight savings also inhibited access to the daily diaries. As a result, we were unable to collect compliance data on 3 of 10 participants in Phase 1. We now instruct participants to leave the tablet plugged in and at their bedside table. This method has proved successful and most participants contact us if they experience a technology issue, allowing us to troubleshoot over-the-phone. Finally, the algorithm used to calculate feedback needed to be reinstalled (due to a glitch in the system) and some participants were not able to view accurate feedback. Since implementing these strategies, we have collected complicate data on all participants.</p><p id="p0135">We piloted the use of Actigraphy (ActiGraph GT9X) for the monitoring of physical activity and sleep patterns. Per manufacturer recommendations, we asked participants to wear the Actigraph sensor around their waist during the day and around their wrist while sleeping. Participants did not like wearing the sensor around their waist/belt, especially women who liked to wear dresses. Several participants misplaced the sensor when it was placed around their waist/belt. As a result, we instructed participants to wear the Actigraph sensor on their wrist at all times (except bathing and swimming) for the first and last 10 days of the intervention. The Actigraph watch has a large display (for time) and was not intrusive to participants' daily lifestyle.</p><p id="p0140">We also piloted the MI intervention, in conjunction with BSM. We called participants weekly and focused on four components of MI: open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, and summarizing statements. We anticipated needing to make changes to the timing and duration of calls, but all participants enjoyed weekly phone conversations. Participants' schedules varied week-to-week; therefore we let the participant decide the duration of calls (typically 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min), as long as the four components of MI were met (via the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Coding Manual). Participants guided the content of conversations, but recurring themes included discussions about 1) barriers inhibiting participants from reaching health goals; 2) strategies to circumvent barriers; 3) grief symptoms; and 4) ideas for monitoring health behaviors beyond the intervention. After the first and second month of BSM we assessed mindfulness and talked about participants' awareness of (or changes to) their daily routine.</p><p id="p0145">We enrolled 10 participants into Phase 1. Five participants were enrolled to standardize the BSM manual; 5 for the BSM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MI manual. There was 100% retention among those who started the intervention protocol; and we collected 100% of measures (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants' median age was 78 years (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70&#x02013;87 years); the median number of months bereaved at the time of enrollment was 3.5 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.0&#x02013;6.5 months). Most were women (60%) and White (90%). Widow(er)s mental health symptomatology aligned with markers that indicated they were at high risk for depression (HRSD median score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4&#x02013;14; PHQ-9 median score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3&#x02013;18); and at lower risk for anxiety (GAD-7 median score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x02013;11), and complicated grief (ICG median score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3&#x02013;39). After the 12-week intervention, PHQ-9 median scores decreased to 2.5 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x02013;11), HRSD scores decreased to 5 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4&#x02013;6), GAD scores decreased to 2 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x02013;4), and ICG scores remained relatively stable at 17 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x02013;33). These change scores indicate that participants experienced fewer symptoms of depression (both self-report and clinician administered) while grief symptoms remained somewhat variable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Phase II: implementing the study interventions</title><p id="p0150">This prevention intervention project was conducted in preparation for a confirmatory trial; therefore, we expected to make many changes to the protocol during implementation. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the methodological changes made during the course of the study. The primary challenge in Phase II has been recruitment. A multifaceted approach is proving to be necessary. We initially contacted PCP offices, senior centers, grief centers, libraries, and other community centers to offer faculty presentations discussing grief and bereavement, followed by screening of individuals interested in the study participation. However, we found that older adults were not attending community presentations and/or senior centers in the early months following spousal death. Most people who attended our presentations were adults who had been widowed for several years. Other strategies included targeted mailings by nurses to family members of patients who died in the intensive care units of two different hospitals in Pittsburgh. Due to patient confidentiality, we did not know when older adults died in the ICU and whether letters were sent to their families. We contacted local funeral directors who agreed to have study fliers available in their office. We attempted to partner with local Cancer centers, but nurses and social workers often did not have contact with family members after cancer patients died. We also contacted local grief counselors, but they were hesitant to advertise our study in addition to the support/therapy they were providing to adults.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Methodological changes to the WELL study.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td><bold>Changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria</bold></td><td><bold>Rationale</bold></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0015"><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0205">Include those bereaved up to 8 months post death (instead of 6 months)</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0210">Symptomatology is likely still due to spousal death and not some other event.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0215">At 7&#x02013;8 months participants may now feel &#x02018;ready&#x02019; to take on an additional activity</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0020"><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0220">Include those on a stable dose of antidepressants; if on low dose, will ask PCP not to change dosage during study period.</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0015"><list-item id="o0020"><label>1.</label><p id="p0225">If not in a current episode of MDD, stable medication for the duration of the study is ok.</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><bold>Changes to intervention protocol</bold></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0025"><list-item id="u0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0230">Everyone chooses a health goal on which to focus during the course of the 12week intervention</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0020"><list-item id="o0025"><label>1.</label><p id="p0235">Will allow participants to feel personally invested in the study</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0030"><list-item id="u0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0240">Provide a nutritional &#x02018;cheat sheet&#x02019;</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0025"><list-item id="o0030"><label>1.</label><p id="p0245">Information about serving sizes allows participants to better record their nutritional intake</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0035"><list-item id="u0045"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0250">Provide light encouragement once a month via phone call to the BSM-only arm</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0030"><list-item id="o0035"><label>1.</label><p id="p0255">Reduces patient boredom and increase retention and motivation</p></list-item><list-item id="o0040"><label>2.</label><p id="p0260">Allows opportunity to &#x02018;check-in&#x02019; with technology</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0040"><list-item id="u0050"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0265">Provide feedback (Actigraph data) about health behaviors in a &#x02018;report card&#x02019; style at the end of the intervention period</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0035"><list-item id="o0045"><label>1.</label><p id="p0270">Feedback about performance is part of the spirit of MI</p></list-item><list-item id="o0050"><label>2.</label><p id="p0275">For those in BSM only, feedback may increase motivation to stick with study</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0045"><list-item id="u0055"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0280">Provide option of a paper diary</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0040"><list-item id="o0055"><label>1.</label><p id="p0285">Increase retention among those with visual problems and/or arthritis who cannot see and/or use tablet</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0050"><list-item id="u0060"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0290">Provide option of wearing Actigraph on wrist only</p></list-item></list></td><td><list list-type="simple" id="olist0045"><list-item id="o0060"><label>1.</label><p id="p0295">Decreases participant burden from switching device from waist to wrist.

They include utilizing research registries, sending email blasts to employees at the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC, encouraging word of mouth by community champions and prior research participants, and partnering with local Hospice organizations. Our partnership with local Hospice organizations has been the most rewarding; we found several champion social workers who were passionate about WELL and recruited for us by 1) sending our study flyer in their support packet to spouses of older patients who died in the care of hospice, 2) describing WELL during follow-up phone calls with bereaved spouses, and 3) mentioning WELL during face-to-face interactions with bereaved (and soon-to-be bereaved) spouses.</p><p id="p0160"><bold><italic>Compliance, Uptake, and Fidelity.</italic></bold> In general, participants were able to learn and use the tablet for the recording of physical activity, sleep, and dietary behaviors. Clinicians trained participants how to use the tablet during the baseline interview and provided a written manual that included instructions detailing how to complete the morning and evening reports. Compliance was measured by examining the total number of BSM sessions recorded in the tablet. For Phase I participants, an average of 104 BSM sessions (out of a possible 168 sessions [2 times per day for 84 days]) were recorded. This number is low (61% compliant) and likely reflects the technology problems we experienced when launching the electronic diary app to participants. Among those who have enrolled in and completed Phase II (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13 out of anticipated 50), compliance increased to 148 BSM sessions (88%). We tracked the uptake of BSM by asking participants whether after participating in WELL they became more aware of their daily routine and health behaviors on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Participants mean score was 3.9 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.2, range 1&#x02013;5) indicating they believed they became more mindful of their daily routine, particularly their bedtime and wake time routine and daily activity. Fidelity to MI was measured by completing a checklist (to complete the 4 components of MI) after every phone session and recording the time spent discussing participants' weekly routine and/or health goals. Session notes (GRW) were discussed weekly with the PI (STS), who is certified in the use of MI for behavior change by the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT).</p><p id="p0165"><bold><italic>Participant Satisfaction.</italic></bold> After 12 weeks of BSM or BSM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MI, participants were asked to complete a satisfaction survey. Items asked about participants' satisfaction regarding operational elements of WELL (flexibility and frequency of appointments, helpfulness of clinicians, frequency of phone calls) and the usefulness of WELL in managing grief and health behaviors. Reponses ranged from 1 (highly dissatisfied) to 4 (highly satisfied). Participants' median score was a 3.6 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.1&#x02013;4.0) indicating high satisfaction with intervention components. We also administered a post-study usability of technology measure. Items asked about participants' satisfaction with using the daily diary to track health behaviors. Reponses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Participants' median score was 6.5 (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.3&#x02013;7.0) indicating greater use and acceptability of the electronic diary and tablet. Participants' written feedback suggests that the BSM helped them &#x0201c;organize their life&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;promote social engagement.&#x0201d; One participant thought that the tablet allowed him to develop a renewed sense of self; stating that &#x0201c;it allowed me to focus on my own health.&#x0201d; One participant (who prior to the intervention avoided eating alone) appreciated that the tablet &#x0201c;reminded me to eat and prepare healthy meals.&#x0201d; Another participant noted that the &#x0201c;tablet became my boss, but in a good way.&#x0201d; Several participants told us they were glad to return the tablet after the 12 weeks because they felt like &#x0201c;they were answering the same thing every day.&#x0201d; This feedback likely reflects these participants' ability to return to a regular/routine schedule.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0170">We have presented the design, rationale, and issues related to implementation of a technology-based healthy lifestyle intervention for older adults at risk for common mental disorders following the death of their spouse/partner. The challenges we encountered were primarily due to technology for BSM and participant recruitment. Once we were able to problem solve technology issues and effectively reach and identify participants, widow(er)s were compliant with BSM and enjoyed monitoring their daily lifestyle choices via the electronic diary.</p><p id="p0175">Two lessons learned in this intervention development study deserve highlighting. First, widow(er)s at risk for common mental disorders are interested in efforts to improve their health and wellbeing. This is important, because experiencing the death of a spouse is a major source of stress which can leave older adults vulnerable to future health problems. In the first few months post death, widow(er)s experience significant change to their daily routine and responsibilities (both personal and household) while simultaneously facing intense and unpredictable feelings of grief. Our goal was to deliver an intervention that was non-intrusive and could be easily integrated into participants' daily lives. Many participants were engaged in caregiving activities related to their physically-declining spouse prior to death. After spousal death, participants expressed a need for a purpose in life and/or a renewed sense of self. Engaging widow(er)s in a lifestyle intervention that may both promote their mental health but also has empowering qualities (via BSM and MI) appears to be an optimal approach to optimizing health and wellbeing.</p><p id="p0180">The second lesson learned is where and how participants may be most effectively recruited. We initially relied heavily on community support centers and PCP offices to refer symptomatic participants. While these approaches were less successful in terms of identifying potential participants, our community presentations were well attended and we continue to give lectures on normal and pathological grief responses to better inform the community. Our most productive partnership was with local hospice organizations who integrated the WELL study into their bereavement support services for family members. This partnership has been mutually productive; we work closely with hospice social workers who consult with us about the mental health status of their patients and we connect hospice social workers to community mental health professionals who specialize in complicated grief and major depression in older adults. Given the challenges of recruitment for prevention studies (e.g., adults are not treatment seeking because they do not know they are at high-risk), effective recruitment strategies are critical for continuing along the intervention development pipeline (feasibility &#x02192; efficacy &#x02192; effectiveness, etc.).</p><p id="p0185">WELL may lead to improvements in prevention strategies, thereby not only influencing mental health, but improving everyday physical health and physical functioning among aging widows and widowers. We are currently evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of WELL on the outcomes of interest, mental health. We plan to monitor participants for 1 year. These findings will be reported after study completion in December 2018.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0190">This work was supported in part by Grants from <funding-source id="gs1">NIH</funding-source> K01MH103467, P30MH90333, UL1 TR000005, and the <funding-source id="gs2">UPMC Endowment in Geriatric Psychiatry (CFR)</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0195">Dr. Reynolds reports being supported by the <funding-source id="gs3">NIH</funding-source>, and the <funding-source id="gs4">UPMC Endowment in Geriatric Psychiatry</funding-source>; having received medication supplies for investigator-initiated trials from Bristol Meyers Squibb, Forrest Labs, Lily, and Pfizer; and receives royalties for industry sponsored use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), to which he holds intellectual property rights.
