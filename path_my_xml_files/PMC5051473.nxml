The important exclusion criteria are the history of previous significant ocular trauma or intraocular surgery, corneal pathology, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, intraocular inflammation, a preoperative fully dilated pupil &#x0003c;6&#x02005;mm, anterior chamber depth &#x0003c;2.5&#x02005;mm and nuclear sclerosis grade &#x0003e;4. After randomisation, patients will undergo phacoemulsification surgery either by a bevel-up or bevel-down procedure.

Introduction of different techniques and certain innovations in the phaco instrumentation have reduced the incidence of postoperative corneal endothelial loss. At every stage of cataract surgery, the surgeon has options to optimise corneal endothelial safety. This includes relevant parameters in various phaco platforms, surgical techniques, materials used and patient characteristics such as the grade of the cataract, age of the patient and the presence of corneal disease.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for endothelial cell damage during phacoemulsification; these include mechanical contact with nuclear fragments, irrigation flow, turbulence and movement of fluid, direct trauma caused by instruments or lens fragments, and formation of cavitation bubbles.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In phacoemulsification procedures the most important predictor of corneal clarity in the early postoperative period is inversely proportional to the amount of ultrasound energy used. For this reason, all of the major platforms now use power modulation to reduce the amount of phaco power necessary, either by varying the duty cycle and pulse energy or by varying the pulse intervals with microburst techniques.</p><p>Several phacoemulsification techniques have been developed and modified.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> Although many techniques have been proposed, the risks of posterior capsular rupture and corneal endothelium damage persist. In theory, damage to the corneal endothelium is minimised by delivering the lowest phaco energy only in the direction necessary to emulsify the lens nucleus. Furthermore, phacoemulsification should occur in the posterior chamber rather than in the iris plane or the anterior chamber.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hence, it has traditionally been believed that the bevel of the needle should be turned towards the nucleus or the nuclear fragment (ie, bevel-down).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, Faramarzi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> hypothesise that in the bevel-up technique, the phaco tip, and therefore the source of heat, are farther from the endothelial cells than in the bevel-down technique and this decreases the chance of endothelial cell damage. Further another clinical trial by Raskin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> concluded in their study that bevel-up tip position has a negative effect on corneal endothelial cells compared with the bevel-down position. Hence, there is a difference of opinion among ophthalmologists with respect to the phaco tip position during phacoemulsification. This subject has not been extensively studied earlier, hence this study is planned.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objective</title><p>To compare the postoperative central corneal thickness (CCT) changes between bevel-up and bevel-down techniques of phacoemulsification.</p><p><italic>Trail design</italic>: Prospective randomised, parallel group, exploratory, triple-blind (trial participant, outcome assessor and the data analyst) trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1.</p><p><italic>Trial registration</italic>: This trial is registered prospectively in the Clinical trial registry of India (CTRI/2016/02/006691) and the full trial protocol can be accessed on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=14144&#x00026;EncHid=&#x00026;userName=CTRI/2016/02/006691">http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=14144&#x00026;EncHid=&#x00026;userName=CTRI/2016/02/006691</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Ethics and dissemination</italic>: Written informed consent will be taken from all study participants.

The axial length (AL) and ACD will be measured by using an ultrasonic A-scan (Echorule Pro, Biomedix Optotechnik &#x00026; Devices).

A capsulorhexis 5.0&#x02013;5.5&#x02005;mm in diameter will be created with a needle cystotome. A 2.8&#x02005;mm clear corneal incision will be made, followed by hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus.</p><p>Phacoemulsification of the nucleus will be performed using the phaco chop technique with a 30&#x000b0; 19-gauge phaco tip. In both groups, the nucleus will be stabilised with the phacoemulsification tip, which is impaled with moderate vacuum and low ultrasonic power. The chopper will be advanced under the anterior capsule until it can pass around the equator of the nucleus at the nucleus&#x02013;epinucleus border, 180&#x000b0; from the phaco tip. The chopper will be advanced towards the phaco tip splitting the nucleus into half. By rotating the lens, several pieces of nucleus are broken (chopped). The pieces will then be emulsified. Following this, irrigation/aspiration of cortical material will be performed with a bimanual irrigation/aspiration cannula. Next, a foldable hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens with ultraviolet absorbing optic and square edge design (Acryfold, Appasamy ocular devices, Pondicherry, India) will be implanted in the capsular bag using a disposable injector cartridge system. Finally, the anterior chamber will be irrigated, the ocular viscoelastic device will be removed, the wounds will be secured by stromal hydration and the eye will be patched.</p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Phaco parameters</title><p>All the operations will be performed with Sovereign compact phacoemulsification system with WhiteStar technology and Ellips (Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA).

Postoperative corneal decompensation is rare when, modern phaco technology is used in combination with proper surgical techniques. However, there are several patient-based factors that increase the likelihood of corneal decompensation. With patients electing to have cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange at increasingly younger ages, protecting the endothelial cell layer at all times is essential to avoid the potential for an epidemic of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy in the future.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Patient expectations after cataract surgery continue to increase, and the patients anticipate perfect vision from as early as the first postoperative day.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The main determinant of a patient's visual acuity on postoperative day 1 is the extent to which the endothelium has been protected.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Hence, one must strive to achieve a surgical technique which causes the least damage to the corneal endothelium. This becomes even more imperative while operating on patients who are prone to have a higher endothelial cell loss during phacoemulsification. These include patients with shorter AL, small pupil, short ACD, high nuclear grade, large nucleus, older age, etc.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> Hence, in this study an attempt will be made to determine the effect of altering the position of phaco tip (bevel-up vs bevel-down) on CCT.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SK conceived the study.
