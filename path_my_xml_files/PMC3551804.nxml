Natural vitamin E comprises eight different compounds, of which alpha-tocopherol is the most abundant in human blood and has the highest biological potency <xref rid="pone.0054417-Zingg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Vitamin E has antioxidative and immunomodulatory properties and is considered one of the most important antioxidative factors against reactive oxygen species (ROS) overload and damages from oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0054417-Pekmezci1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. ROS and oxidative stress have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and multiple sclerosis (MS) <xref rid="pone.0054417-Lassmann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Vitamin E is shown to affect different immune cells. In mice, vitamin E enhanced na&#x000ef;ve T cell function by increasing division and interleukin-2 production, and by reducing T cell suppressive prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> from macrophages <xref rid="pone.0054417-Pekmezci1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, appropriate function and interaction between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, dendritic cells and T regulatory cells in response to viral infection depend on adequate vitamin E levels <xref rid="pone.0054417-Sheridan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In murine microglia cultures, vitamin E has been shown to induce morphological changes and down regulate different adhesions molecules, both associated with deactivation <xref rid="pone.0054417-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Treatment with vitamin E also inhibited demyelination caused by ethidium bromide <xref rid="pone.0054417-Goudarzvand1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, increased subsequent remyelination (7), and has been shown to exert dose-dependent effects in a murine lupus model <xref rid="pone.0054417-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of interferon beta (IFNB) in MS is only partial, and antioxidant therapy might potentially be an adjuvant. IFNB treatment was associated with higher concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in plasma of MS patients compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0054417-Karg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and also with normalization of the alpha-tocopherol levels in erythrocytes <xref rid="pone.0054417-Karg2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In spite of relevant biological properties, the relationship between vitamin E and disease activity in MS has not been investigated. To chart the vitamin E levels and their relationship to disease activity in Norwegian MS patients, we have measured alpha-tocopherol in serum samples from 88 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who participated in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or placebo in RRMS patients before and during treatment with IFNB (the OFAMS study) <xref rid="pone.0054417-Torkildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The patients were followed for two years with repeated and corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and serum sampling, as well as registration of clinical disease activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The design and the results of the OFAMS study have been presented previously <xref rid="pone.0054417-Torkildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In brief, 88 RRMS patients were allocated to either omega-3 fatty acids (Triomar&#x000a9;) or placebo (corn oil), and followed for two years with repeated and corresponding MRI scans and serum sampling. None of the patients had received treatment with immunomodulatory agents six months prior to inclusion. All patients were initiated on interferon beta-1a (IFNB) at study month 6. The MRI scans were conducted monthly from baseline to study month 9, thereafter at month 12 and 24, and evaluated blindly and independently by two experienced neuro-radiologists for new T1 gadolinium (Gd<sup>+</sup>) enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions and combined unique activity (CUA; sum of T1Gd<sup>+</sup> lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0054417-Torkildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-LkenAmsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The serum samples were collected at baseline, thereafter at month 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 18 and 24 and analysed for alpha-tocopherol. The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were analysed at baseline and month 6, 12 and 24. Both the omega-3 fatty acid and the placebo preparations were added vitamin E in order to protect the fatty acids against oxidation. The omega-3 fatty acid capsules contained four IU alpha-tocopherol, which equals approximately 13 mg per daily dose. The placebo preparation contained mixed tocopherols of which approximately 22 mg per daily dose were alpha-tocopherol. Neither of the preparations contained vitamin D nor A. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was evaluated every sixth months and relapses were recorded throughout the study period.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Analyses</title><p>Serum samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis, which was performed simultaneously by blinded lab-technicians for all samples from each patient. The concentration of alpha-tocopherol was measured at Department of Medical Biochemistry, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, using an Agilent 100 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA USA) and the Reagent kit for the HPLC determination of alpha-tocopherol in serum (CHROMSYSTEMS Instruments &#x00026; Chemicals GmbH, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany). The within run coefficient of variation was 0.7% at 30.9 &#x000b5;mol alpha-tocopherol/L and the day-to-day coefficient of variation was 3.0% at 41.8 &#x000b5;mol alpha-tocopherol/L. Neutralising antibodies (NAb) against IFNB were analysed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at study month 24, and categorized as negative, intermediate or high. The analyses of 25-hydoxyvitamin D, retinol, EPA, DHA and HLA-DRB1*15 has been described previously <xref rid="pone.0054417-Torkildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-LkenAmsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-LkenAmsrud2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistics</title><p>As the MRI outcomes were skewed towards none or one lesion, they were dichotomised as present or absent. We addressed our research question by using a hierarchical logistic regression model as previously described <xref rid="pone.0054417-LkenAmsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This model takes into account the repeated MRI scans and serum measurements within a patient. The SAS GLIMMIX procedure was used to fit the model with random intercepts for patients and fixed effects of alpha-tocopherol. Only paired measurements of alpha-tocopherol and MRI scans were included in the regression model. The same statistical model was used to analyse the association between alpha-tocopherol and MRI outcomes lagged by 1 and 2 study months after the alpha-tocopherol measurements. Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), HLA-DRB1*15 status, treatment group (omega-3 or placebo), compliance (intake of study medication in percentage of the total dosage) and serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, retinol, EPA and DHA and NAb against IFNB (categorized as negative, low to moderate and high concentration) were included as possible predictors to the logistic regression model. The Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to examine the association between baseline values of alpha-tocopherol and the cumulative number of new T1Gd<sup>+</sup> and T2 lesions and CUA. Independent samples t-test was used for the comparison of means. Mean (SD) values are presented unless otherwise stated. The statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 and SPSS version 15.0.

Twenty-three MRI scans were missing (14 during study months 1&#x02013;6, nine during study months 7&#x02013;24). We defined MRI scans and serum samples collected within an interval of one month as paired, and 11 MRI/alpha-tocopherol measurements that exceeded this limit were excluded from analysis.

In small cross-sectional studies, lower concentrations of both vitamin E and vitamin E/cholesterol-ratio have been reported in stable MS patients compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0054417-Salemi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and also in MS patients during exacerbation compared to stable MS patients with or without IFNB treatment, and controls <xref rid="pone.0054417-Karg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-Besler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-JimenezJimenez1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In a prospective study, the risk of developing MS was not associated with total or dietary intake of vitamin E <xref rid="pone.0054417-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To our knowledge, there are no prospective studies addressing the relationship between vitamin E and MRI disease activity in MS.</p><p>Our patient cohort comprises well characterized RRMS patients examined with repeated MRI scans and serum measurements, allowing eight paired MRI/alpha tocopherol assessments, and is well suited for a prospective study of the relationship between vitamin E and MS disease activity. Moreover, simultaneous measurements of vitamin A, vitamin D, DHA, EPA and NAb against IFNB in the same patients, combined with records of the compliance of study medication, enabled us to adjust for potential confounding. However, our study also has limitations. Although several paired MRI scans and serum measurements of alpha-tocopherol were conducted in each patient, the cohort might have been too small to detect minor, but nevertheless potentially important associations with relapse rate and EDSS progression. The dietary habits including use of vitamin supplements were not recorded. Moreover, the patients received either approximately 13 or 22 mg alpha-tocopherol from the omega-3 or placebo preparations. This constitutes 2&#x02013;3 times the intake of total vitamin E estimated in a Finnish study <xref rid="pone.0054417-Jarvinen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and also the estimated average daily intake of vitamin E in Norway (8&#x02013;10 alpha-tocopherol equivalents, corresponding to 8&#x02013;10 mg alpha-tocopherol) <xref rid="pone.0054417-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Only the baseline values are therefore representative for the habitual vitamin E status of the patients. Accordingly, there was an increase in the mean concentration of alpha-tocopherol from baseline to the rest of the study period, and the supplementation might therefore have evened out both the inter- and intra-individual variation. Even so, we found a mean ratio between the highest and the lowest concentration of alpha-tocopherol in each patient of 1.34 and 22.8% of the total variation was accounted for by intra-individual variation. The serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol is correlated to the concentration of lipoproteins <xref rid="pone.0054417-Zingg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-Bjornson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Unfortunately, we did not measure lipoproteins or total cholesterol, and can therefore not exclude that lipoproteins might have confounded our results. However, in a previous study T2 lesion volume was not associated with lipoprotein concentrations <xref rid="pone.0054417-WeinstockGuttman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and the association with new T2 lesions was not influenced by BMI or omega-3 fatty acids in our study. It is therefore less likely that lipoprotein status have confounded the results.</p><p>Vitamin E has both antioxidative, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties <xref rid="pone.0054417-Pekmezci1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-Goudarzvand1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054417-Venkatraman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

The finding that the odds for new MRI disease activity were only significantly reduced during IFNB treatment could indicate an interaction between IFNB and vitamin E. However, the difference in odds reduction before and during IFNB treatment was modest, and adjusting for NAb against IFNB did not alter our results. Thus, there is not sufficient evidence to draw any conclusion, and a possible interaction between vitamin E and IFNB treatment should be studied in a larger cohort.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown an association between increasing alpha-tocopherol concentrations and simultaneous and subsequent MRI disease activity in RRMS patients during treatment with IFNB.
