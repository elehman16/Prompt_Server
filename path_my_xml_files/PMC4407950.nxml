The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of calcium and iron supplements on dolutegravir pharmacokinetics and strategies (dose separation and food) to attenuate the effects if significant reductions in dolutegravir exposure were observed. This was an open-label, crossover study that randomized 24 healthy subjects into 1 of 2 cohorts to receive 4 treatments: (1) dolutegravir alone, fasting; (2) dolutegravir with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate, fasting; (3) dolutegravir with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal; (4) dolutegravir administered 2&#x02009;hours before calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate, fasting. Plasma dolutegravir AUC(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;), C<sub>max</sub>, and C24 were reduced by 39%, 37%, and 39%, respectively, when co-administered with calcium carbonate while fasting and were reduced by 54%, 57%, and 56%, respectively, when co-administered with ferrous fumarate while fasting. Dolutegravir administration 2&#x02009;hours before calcium or iron supplement administration (fasted), as well as administration with a meal, counteracted the effect. Dolutegravir and calcium or iron supplements can be co-administered if taken with a meal. Under fasted conditions, dolutegravir should be administered 2&#x02009;hours before or 6&#x02009;hours after calcium or iron supplements.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dolutegravir</kwd><kwd>calcium carbonate</kwd><kwd>ferrous fumarate</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>drug interaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) represent a novel class of antiretroviral drugs designed to block the action of the viral integrase enzyme, which is responsible for insertion of the viral genome into the host cellular DNA. Dolutegravir (Tivicay&#x000ae;; ViiV Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) is an HIV INSTI that has been approved for the treatment of HIV infection in adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients who are treatment-naive, treatment-experienced but INSTI-naive, and treatment-experienced and INSTI-resistant. Studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that dolutegravir is well tolerated, has low to moderate pharmacokinetic (PK) variability, and achieves therapeutic concentrations with once-daily dosing without the need for PK boosting.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Phase III studies in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects demonstrate that dolutegravir has sustained antiviral activity in combination with various background therapies in HIV-infected adults. Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggest that dolutegravir retains activity against viral strains harboring major INSTI-resistant mutations selected for by both raltegravir and elvitegravir, 2 previously approved INSTIs.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These data have been confirmed in clinical studies demonstrating dolutegravir's activity in subjects with resistance to raltegravir.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The mechanism of action of INSTIs involves binding to magnesium in the active site of the integrase enzyme, preventing insertion of HIV viral DNA into the host cell DNA. As such, drugs in this class are susceptible to chelation-type drug interactions with divalent and trivalent metal cations. Previous studies with the INSTIs raltegravir and elvitegravir<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> have shown clinically significant effects of concomitant administration with antacids, which were significantly improved for elvitegravir when its dosing was separated from antacids by 2 and 4&#x02009;hours. In a study with dolutegravir, concurrent administration of Maximum Strength Maalox&#x000ae; (containing Al<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>; Novartis Consumer Health, Parsippany, New Jersey) under fasted conditions decreased dolutegravir mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and plasma concentration at 24&#x02009;hours post-dose (C24) by 74%, 72%, and 74%, respectively, and administration of Maalox 2&#x02009;hours after dolutegravir administration decreased dolutegravir mean AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, and C24 by 26%, 18%, and 30%, respectively.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These data resulted in the recommendation that concomitant administration of dolutegravir and antacids should be avoided. Dolutegravir can be administered 2&#x02009;hours before or 6&#x02009;hours after antacids.</p><p>HIV-infected patients may take mineral supplements in combination with their antiretroviral medications. Calcium supplementation is commonly used in HIV-infected patients. Iron supplementation may also be used in HIV-infected patients with anemia. As both of these mineral supplements have the potential to interact with dolutegravir, this study was performed to evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease dolutegravir exposure in healthy adult subjects and to assess 2 possible strategies for combined use if an interaction was observed. The first strategy was a 2-hour separation, as this was shown to be effective in attenuating the interaction with Maalox.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The second strategy involved the administration of dolutegravir and the supplement with a meal because the presence of food modestly increases dolutegravir exposure<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and because mineral supplements are often administered with food.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Subjects</title><p>Prior to study initiation, the study protocol, amendments, and consent forms were reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards for the study site (Quintiles Early Clinical Development, Overland Park, Kansas), and all subjects provided signed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, consistent with good clinical practices and local regulatory requirements.</p><p>This was an open-label, randomized, 2-cohort, 4-period crossover study that was designed to evaluate the effects of calcium carbonate and ferrous fumarate on the PK of dolutegravir in healthy adult subjects. The study was conducted between December 2012 and March 2013.</p><p>Calcium carbonate was selected for this study because of its higher elemental calcium content compared with calcium citrate, and a clinically relevant dose of 1,200&#x02009;mg calcium carbonate (containing &#x0223c;480&#x02009;mg elemental calcium) was used. Among iron supplements, ferrous fumarate contains a higher quantity of elemental iron than ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate, thus it was selected for this study to represent a worst case, and the standard dose of 324&#x02009;mg ferrous fumarate (containing &#x0223c;107&#x02009;mg elemental iron) was used.</p><p>Eligible subjects were male or female adult subjects ranging from 18 to 65 years of age; had a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18.5&#x02013;31.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and were judged to be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory testing. Excluded subjects were those with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility; hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, or both that could have interfered with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the study drugs; or positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or HIV antibody. Subjects were prohibited from ingesting any prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal supplements, and dietary supplements, within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer) before the first dose of study medication.</p><p>This study was planned to enroll 24 eligible subjects who were randomized into 1 of the 2 cohorts (calcium or iron) (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) and received each of 4 treatments in a randomized fashion: (1) a single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions (Treatment A); (2) a single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate (Treatment B) or ferrous fumarate (Treatment E) under fasted conditions; (3) a single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate (Treatment&#x02009;C) or ferrous fumarate (Treatment F) with a moderate-fat meal (approximately 30% fat); and (4) a single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions 2&#x02009;hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate (Treatment D) or ferrous fumarate (Treatment G). Each dosing session was separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. During each treatment period, the subjects were admitted to the unit on Day &#x02212;1 and were housed in the unit until the Day 3 postdose assessments were completed. A follow-up visit was conducted within 7&#x02013;14 days after the last dose of study drug.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study Treatment Description</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cohort</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg under fasted conditions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg with a moderate-fat (30%) meal</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions 2&#x02009;hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">E</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg under fasted conditions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg co-administered with a single dose of ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg with a moderate-fat (30%) meal</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A single dose of dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg administered under fasted conditions 2&#x02009;hours prior to administration of a single dose of ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Safety evaluations including clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital sign monitoring, and 12-lead ECG were performed during each treatment period.

A lack-of-effect boundary was predefined based on accumulated knowledge of the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship of dolutegravir, as follows<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>: interactions between dolutegravir and either calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate were not considered to be clinically significant if the observed decrease in the AUC or C<sub>max</sub> of dolutegravir was less than 70% (ie, estimates for the test to reference ratio were &#x02265;0.3). For a sample size of 8, the associated 90% confidence interval for this ratio was 0.23&#x02013;0.40, assuming a within-subject coefficient of variation of 33%.</p><p>Following log<sub>e</sub>-transformation, AUC(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;), C<sub>max</sub>, and C24 of dolutegravir in each cohort were separately analyzed using a PROC MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) with period, sequence, and treatment as fixed effects and subject as random effect in the model. Point estimates and their associated 90%CIs were constructed for the differences in PK parameter values between the test and reference treatments. Dolutegravir given alone under fasted conditions was considered to be the reference treatment, and the test treatments were dolutegravir co-administered with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions, dolutegravir co-administered with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal, and dolutegravir given 2&#x02009;hours prior to administration of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions. Additional comparisons with dolutegravir co-administered with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions as reference treatment and dolutegravir co-administered with calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal as test treatment were also performed. The point estimates and their associated 90%CIs were then back-transformed to provide point estimates and 90%CIs for the ratios of PK parameters from test to reference treatments on the original scale. T<sub>max</sub> was analyzed nonparametrically for the treatment differences of interest using the Wilcoxon's Matched-Pairs method.

dolutegravir plasma exposure, as well as strategies (dose separation and food) to attenuate the effects of these supplements if significant reductions in dolutegravir exposure by these agents were observed. Unlike antacids that are taken &#x0201c;as needed&#x0201d; and are often taken after meals, calcium and iron supplements are usually taken on a chronic basis and are usually taken with a meal. The use of these supplements is common in HIV-infected patients because of increased risk of osteoporosis due to drugs (eg, tenofovir)<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or disease and because of anemia.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Consistent with the mechanism of action, INSTIs lend themselves to interactions with metal cation-containing medications. As such, both calcium and iron supplements (calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg and ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg) significantly reduced dolutegravir plasma exposure under fasted conditions. Plasma dolutegravir AUC(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;), C<sub>max</sub>, and C24 were reduced by 39%, 37%, and 39%, respectively, when co-administered with calcium carbonate under fasted conditions. Plasma dolutegravir AUC(0&#x02013;&#x0221e;), C<sub>max</sub>, and C24 were reduced by 54%, 57%, and 56%, respectively, when co-administered with ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions. The expected effects of these metal cation supplements are due to dolutegravir-metal cation chelation resulting in reduced solubility and, therefore, reduced oral absorption as has been seen with other cations.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg (containing 107&#x02009;mg or 1.91&#x02009;mmol elemental iron) reduced dolutegravir exposure to a greater extent than calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg (containing 480&#x02009;mg or 12&#x02009;mmol elemental calcium), although it contains a lower quantity of elemental metal cations. Both supplements contain metal cations (calcium or iron) in excess amount to dolutegravir 50&#x02009;mg (or 0.12&#x02009;mmol dolutegravir). We hypothesize that one possible explanation for the different effect by iron vs. calcium supplements is a solubility difference in the dolutegravir-iron chelation complex vs. the dolutegravir-calcium chelation complex. Another possible explanation is a higher affinity for iron to the dolutegravir binding site. Such differences are unlikely to be related to the effects on gastrointestinal pH by ferrous fumarate vs. calcium carbonate. Although calcium carbonate may increase gastrointestinal pH to a higher degree than ferrous fumarate, dolutegravir has not shown pH-dependent oral bioavailability in humans, concluded on the basis of a clinical study demonstrating that omeprazole had no effect on dolutegravir exposure.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Although the study results showed that the effect of calcium/iron supplements on dolutegravir PK did not meet the predefined lack-of-effect boundary, the observed decrease may be clinically significant, especially in individuals who are taking other antiretroviral drugs that are enzyme inducers that further reduce dolutegravir exposure. Therefore, to take a conservative approach, co-administration of dolutegravir and these calcium/iron supplements under fasted conditions is not recommended. While subjects are taking calcium/iron supplements, a separation strategy for dosing under fasted conditions is warranted, similar to the dosing recommendations for metal cation-containing antacids.</p><p>Another strategy to counteract the interaction was to give the dolutegravir and the mineral supplement concomitantly with a meal, because food increases the exposure of dolutegravir<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and because mineral supplements are frequently administered with a meal to attenuate gastrointestinal tolerability issues. Administration of the mineral supplement and dolutegravir with a moderate-fat meal resulted in plasma exposures that were similar to dolutegravir administered alone under fasted conditions. The effects of food seem to be different in the presence of metal cation-containing supplement vs. in the absence of supplements. A moderate-fat meal increased dolutegravir AUC by 41% in the absence of added supplement,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> whereas it increased dolutegravir AUC by 78% in the presence of calcium carbonate and by 114% in the presence of ferrous fumarate. Co-administration of dolutegravir and mineral supplements with food may be more relevant for patients because mineral supplements are often taken with a meal to avoid gastrointestinal side effects (ie, iron supplements)<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and enhance absorption (ie, calcium supplements).<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> If not administered with a meal, dolutegravir should be administered at least 2&#x02009;hours before or 6&#x02009;hours after taking mineral supplements, same as the recommendation for antacids.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The forms and doses of calcium and iron supplements used in this study, calcium carbonate 1,200&#x02009;mg and ferrous fumarate 324&#x02009;mg, contain the most elemental calcium and iron compared with other commonly used supplements (eg, calcium citrate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate), which represents the &#x0201c;worst case scenario&#x0201d; for potential co-administration of these mineral supplements. Therefore, the effects of calcium and iron from other supplements not evaluated in this study are expected to be lower than or similar to those of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate used in the current study. The dose recommendation on the basis of data from calcium carbonate and ferrous fumarate can be generalized to other calcium and/or iron supplements.</p><p>This study demonstrates that dolutegravir was well tolerated when given with calcium or iron supplements. It is recommended that dolutegravir and calcium or iron supplements can be co-administered if taken with a meal. Under fasted conditions, dolutegravir should be administered 2&#x02009;hours prior to or 6&#x02009;hours after administration of calcium or iron supplements.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this work was provided by ViiV Healthcare.
