In total, 85 cases of middle and late period NSCLC patients were selected, and were randomly divided into the RFA combined chemotherapy group, RFA treatment group and chemotherapy group. After treatment, the three groups were followed up for computed tomography (CT) scan, and were analyzed for the effect of RFA combined chemotherapy on middle and late period NSCLC. It was found that CT value of RFA combined chemotherapy group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P&#x0003c;0.05). The CT value of the RFA group decreased significantly compared to before surgery (P&#x0003c;0.05). The CT value of chemotherapy group was not significantly changed compared to before surgery (P&#x0003e;0.05). The postoperative CT value of the RFA combined chemotherapy group and RFA group was smaller compared to that of the chemotherapy group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Effective rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly higher than that of the EFA and chemotherapy groups (P&#x0003c;0.05). Effective rate (CR+PR) of the RFA group was significantly higher than that of the chemotherapy group (P&#x0003c;0.05). By contrast, the progressive rate (P) of RFA combined chemotherapy group was significantly lower than that of the RFA and chemotherapy groups (P&#x0003c;0.05). In conclusion, RFA combined chemotherapy has obvious effect on middle and late period NSCLC, and is safe and feasible.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>radiofrequency ablation</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer severely compromises human health, and is nowadays one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

The RFA treatment under the guidance of CT scan. Cool-tip RFA system (Covidien; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used, and RFA needle with 20 or 30 mm was selected according to the size of the tumor. The CT scanning was carried out after localizing marker on body surface, and determining needle insertion point according to body surface localization after selecting treatment layer, and needle insertion angle and depth was measured. Regular sterilization and sheet paving was performed. For anesthesia, 2% lidocaine hydrochloride was used. The needle was gradually inserted according to needle insertion point and angle, and CT scan was performed to guide needle depth.</p><p>The treatment was started when the RFA needle was within the tumor tissue. The treatment power was 120 W, and the time was 10 min. Multiple times of RFA treatment were carried out according to the size of the tumor for complete cover of the tumor tissue according to treatment. After the treatment, necessary care was provided, e.g., oxygen uptake, hemostasis, anti-infection and fluid replacement. After surgery, blood tests were performed again. In the groups without chemotherapy, cisplatin + docetaxel was administered. For chemotherapy, 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of docetaxel was added to 0.9% NaCl of 250 ml, intravenous drip on the first day. Along with 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of docetaxel 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl was added for 3 days, separately.

There is a study indicating that a 5-year survival rate of phase I NSCLC patients without treatment is only 6%, and the median survival time is 9&#x02013;14 months (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). According to statistics, &#x0003c;20% patients can be offered surgery. Therefore, the position of non-surgery in lung cancer treatment becomes more important.</p><p>RFA is a new technique aiming at tumor treatment. The principle uses high frequency electromagnetic waves produced by radiofrequency electric current to make intra-cellular polar molecules agitate and friction to generate heat, leading to protein degeneration and leading to irreversible clotting necrosis, and thus to killing of tumor cells. RFA has already achieved good effect in liver cancer treatment. Since there is ample blood circulation and breathing heat elimination in the lung, the heat can dissipate, it has been shown that the amount of blood circulation is low in lung tumor tissue, while a high amount of air in lung can speed the accumulation of heat, which causes rapid temperature increase, known as &#x02018;side-effect&#x02019;, therefore, RFA has obvious advantage when applied to lung cancer treatment (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). RFA can kill the cancer cells in treatment area, reduce tumor load, as well as increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy medicine, which is an important component of the comprehensive treatment to middle and late period NSCLC patients (<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Compared to traditional surgery treatment, RFA has obvious advantages including precise treatment effect, small lesion, short surgery time, fast recovery, capacity of repeated treatment, less complications and high safety level (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The main complications are pneumothorax, fever, thoracalgia, cough and hemoptysis. Most complications have slight symptoms and only a few need special treatment.</p><p>Chemotherapy for NSCLC is currently mainly based on platinum, which greatly improves the survival time and quality of life of the patients (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). There is a study comparing the clinical effect of three generations of anticancer drugs. Docetaxel and cisplatin or TP plan has become the first-tier chemotherapy plan for NSCLC (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, RFA accomplished precise localization under the guidance of CT, and we designed a needle spread plan according to CT image and treatment range of RFA, making the radiofrequency treatment range fully cover the tumor tissue. It can treat multiple tumor lesions at one time or treat the same lesion many times, as there is no blood supply at the tumor tissue clotting necrosis area after RFA treatment (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, the tumor size may not change or even increases, considering it may be related to tumor tissue clotting necrosis, oedema or surrounding acute inflammation (<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, we can assess the treatment effect according to the results of postoperative-intensified CT, and take multiple RFA according to the results to kill the remaining tumor tissue or completely block the blood supply of tumor tissue, to achieve better treatment effect. The research findings have shown that the lesion may increase 1&#x02013;3 months after RFA, and gradually decrease after months (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). If there is not obvious decrease of the tumor volume but intensified CT examination shows no change of the CT value, then it indicates the treatment is effective (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This study showed that in some patients, follow-up CT scan revealed no obvious tumor volume changes in short-term after RFA or a small portion of cases had their tumor volume increased, and all of the CT scan values significantly decreased compared to before, and some cases it showed obvious cavity and diffluented necrosis in the tumor tissue. It suggested the effectiveness of the treatment, which was consistent with research results by different group (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The CT value of the RFA combined chemotherapy group significantly decreased, while its effective rate (CR+PR) was higher than that of the RFA and chemotherapy groups, indicating effective treatment.</p><p>The findings of the present study show that RFA and chemotherapy have an important function in the treatment of middle and late period NSCLC. In the treatment of the middle and late period NSCLC, RFA combined chemotherapy can improve the treatment effect, and retard pathogenetic progress, with convenient operation, small side-effects and can be repeatedly applied, which is worthy of generalization. Some studies indicated that although compared to traditional chemoradiotherapy, single RFA treatment for lung cancer has the advantage of being able to control local lesion and improving life quality of patients, although it cannot improve survival rate of patients with local late period NSCLC (<xref rid="b13-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-5276" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, this study only investigated the short-term effect of RFA-combined chemotherapy on the middle and late period NSCLC. Further studies are required to investigate whether it can improve the long-term effect of factors such as tumor recurrence and metastasis, survival period and quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ol-0-0-5276"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
