shoulder stability and rehabilitative ultrasound images in office workers. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty-eight subjects were randomly divided into a scapular stability exercise
group (n=19) and a manual therapy group (n=19). Subjects in the scapular stability
exercise group performed a scapular stability exercise designed to correct the abnormal
location of the scapula, at 40 minutes per session, two times per week, for 6 weeks.
Forward head horizontal distance, rounded shoulder posture, stability of the upper limb
for the shoulder, and rehabilitative ultrasound images were evaluated before and after 6
weeks. [Results] After the intervention, both groups showed significantly decreased
forward head horizontal distance and rounded shoulder posture, with significantly improved
stability of the upper limb and rehabilitative ultrasound images. Forward head horizontal
distance, rounded shoulder posture, stability of the upper limb, and rehabilitative
ultrasound images showed greater improvements in the shoulder stability exercise group
than in the manual therapy group. [Conclusion] Scapular stability exercise can improve
shoulder stability and the thickness of the lower trapezius in rehabilitative ultrasound
images of office workers, and could be useful in clinical rehabilitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Shoulder dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Shoulder stability</kwd><kwd>RUSI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cervical and shoulder dysfunction in office workers is usually due to the work environment,
including job and sociopsychological risk factors<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The resulting pain and functional impairment affect the muscles,
skeleton, ligaments, cartilage, and nervous system, and result in musculoskeletal
dysfunction<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shoulder pain and
functional disorders are related to abnormal motion and the position of the scapula when it
is stabilized<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cervical pain leads to
impaired function, decreased occupational performance, and quality of life dissatisfaction
including social and economic loss<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weakness of the lower trapezius has a negative effect on scapular movement, with an
increase in shoulder joint weakness, because the lower trapezius is the primary muscle
maintaining the appropriate posture and alignment of the shoulder joint<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The serratus
anterior also provides stability for the scapula. Together with the lower trapezius, it
maintains the appropriate scapular location<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic interventions for shoulder pain include hyperthermia, cryotherapy,
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, strengthening exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and stabilization exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most of these interventions can relieve pain but are inefficient at
preventing the recurrence of pain and maintaining normal function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shoulder joint stabilization exercises have been prescribed
for patients with shoulder pain. The stability of the shoulder joint is important; however,
the stability and strength of the muscle are more important because the shoulder is very
mobile<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Postural stabilization is the state of maintaining a balanced body position, with the
muscle and skeleton in a specific space, and the ability to maintain the center of mass<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise stabilizes the scapula through
active movements of the muscles surrounding the scapula, and maintains the effective length
and tension of upper arm movement<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Rehabilitative ultrasound images (RUSI) evaluate muscle mass, structure, and composition.
This method uses ultrasound to examine blood vessels and organ shape. It is easy to control
and accurately visualizes muscle structure and movement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a stability exercise was prescribed for normal scapular location and muscle
balance in order to determine the effect on scapular stability and RUSI, and to provide
basic information for the rehabilitation of patients with shoulder pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 38 office workers receiving physical therapy at Seoul H Hospital, who
voluntarily agreed to active participation, were included in this study. The subjects were
randomly divided into two groups. The stability exercise for the shoulder was performed two
times per week, at 40&#x02005;min per session, for a total of 6 weeks. The general characteristics
of the subjects in the stability exercise group were as follows: 19 office workers (6 males
and 13 females), mean age 36.2 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x02005;years, mean height 168.0 &#x000b1; 8.1&#x02005;cm, and mean weight 57.8
&#x000b1; 11.3&#x02005;kg. On the other hand, the subjects in the manual therapy group had the following
characteristics: 19 office workers (6 males and 13 females), mean age 35.8 &#x000b1; 4.1&#x02005;years, mean
height 167.2 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;cm, and mean weight 60.2 &#x000b1; 14.2&#x02005;kg. There were no significant differences
between the two groups. The present study was approved by the Sahmyook University
Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2015-014). The objective of the study and its requirements
were explained to the subjects, and all participants provided written consent, in accordance
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>the scapular exercise for the shoulder joint was designed to correct the abnormal location
of the scapula<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise involved the
upper trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoralis major
and minor muscles (all in a shortened state) in lengthening and stretching, with 10 sets of
10-s sessions. The following exercises were performed: isometric contraction in the supine
position, retracting the subject&#x02019;s chin for deep cervical flexor enhancement; closed chain
knee push-up for the serratus anterior; cow position and cat position for 10 sets of 10&#x02005;s
each to increase mobility of thoracic and cervical musculature; prone row and modified prone
cobra, as suggested by Arlotta et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>,
to deactivate the upper trapezius and maximize lower trapezius activation; cow position, cat
position, modified cat position, dead bug position, and plank, at 10 sets of 10&#x02005;s each for
cervical, thoracic, and shoulder movement.</p><p>The manual therapy program consisted of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;min of soft tissue mobilization of the upper
trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis major and minor,
deep cervical flexor, serratus anterior, rhomboid, and middle and lower trapezius muscles,
with prone thoracic mobilization, prone selected thoracic mobilization, cervical
mobilization, and thoracic mobilization.</p><p>The forward head horizontal distance (FHHD) for cervical stability was measured with the
Exbody somatometric system (PA-2010SM; Steps System Inc., Seoul, Korea), which is a medical
angle meter. The subjects were measured from the side in a natural position while wearing
shorts and shirts; a marker was placed on the tragus and acromion process, and the forward
head position was evaluated by measuring the distance between the tragus and acromion
process.</p><p>To assess changes in the rounded shoulder posture (RSP), the length was measured to 1/20&#x02005;mm
by using a Vernier caliper. With the supine method, the RSP determined the interval between
the table surface and the acromion process. This was used to measure the length of the
pectoralis major; however, it has good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient,
0.88) with or without symptoms in the shoulder related to the effect of the scapular
location on the shoulder joint<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An upper limb closed chain exercise test was used for the stability of the upper limb
(SUL)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the performance of the
closed chain exercise test, the starting position, which had a width of 90&#x02005;cm, was marked on
the floor, and both hands of the subjects were placed on the marker dots in order to form a
push-up position. To reduce changes in position, the width was reduced to 80&#x02005;cm. The
subjects alternately placed one hand over the other. Placement of one hand over the other
was counted as one, performed for 15&#x02005;s, and the number was counted. Between test
performances, the subjects were allowed a 1-min break; measurements were performed two
times, and the mean value was used<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a portable RUSI device (UGEO H60; Samsung Medison, Seoul, Korea) was used to
examine the structural properties of muscles. Ultrasound examination was performed at
6&#x02013;12&#x02005;MHz in two-dimensional B-mode linearity, at T8 level, r=0.77 (muscle thickness) for the
lower trapezius structural examination<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>;
an average of two repetitions was used to measure values.</p><p>The SPSS 18.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the distribution of the general properties and
outcome measures of the subjects. The paired t-test was used to compare the pretest and
posttest results of FHHD, RSP, SUL, and RUSI within each group, and the independent t-test
was performed to compare the two groups before and after training. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was
considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the scapular stability exercise group, the FHHD was 9.5&#x02005;cm before the training and

an upright sitting position affects muscle length and tension to maintain low muscle
activation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the FHHD was 9.5&#x02005;cm before the training and 7.8&#x02005;cm after the training, a
decrease of 1.7&#x02005;cm that was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.001), in the scapular
stability exercise group. In the manual therapy group, the FHHD was 8.4&#x02005;cm before the
training and 8.2&#x02005;cm after the training, a decrease of 0.2&#x02005;cm (p&#x0003c;0.05). The scapular
stability exercise group showed greater improvement than the manual therapy group in the
FHHD. If the forward head position is severe, the distance between the tragus and acromion
process increases; if the distance decreases, deep cervical flexor activation increases, and
sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscle activation decreases, thereby stabilizing
the cervical position. In the forward head position and round shoulder position, the upper
trapezius and pectoralis major and minor have increased activity, inducing scapular and
thoracoscapular position change, which causes abnormal cervical alignment and decreased
shoulder stability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The upper, middle, and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles are involved in
shoulder joint stabilizing motion<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, in this study, isometric contraction was applied to enhance the upper, middle,
and lower trapezius and serratus anterior strength in shoulder stabilizing exercises. As a
result, the right-side RSP was significantly decreased by 0.6&#x02005;mm (p&#x0003c;0.001), and the
left-side RSP was significantly decreased by 0.5&#x02005;mm (p&#x0003c;0.001). The SUL was 9.5 before the
training and 13.7 after the training, a statistically significant increase of 4.36
(p&#x0003c;0.001), in the scapular stability exercise group. The scapular stability exercise
group showed greater improvements than the manual therapy group in the SUL and left and
right RSP. These results are considered to be due to the prone row and modified prone cobra,
which were performed to minimize the upper trapezius activity and maximize the lower
trapezius activity. According to RUSI, if lower trapezius muscle activation increases, then
the muscle bulk changes<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Day and
Uhl<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> applied repetitive arm raises on
14 normal subjects in their 20s, and found considerable differences in the thickness of the
lower trapezius (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>In this study, the right-side lower trapezius in RUSI was significantly increased by 0.3&#x02005;mm
(p&#x0003c;0.001), and the left-side lower trapezius was significantly increased by 0.3&#x02005;mm
(p&#x0003c;0.001) in the scapular stability exercise group. The scapular stability exercise group
showed greater improvement than the manual therapy group in the left and right lower
trapezius in RUSI. The increases in muscle thickness in the scapular stability exercise
group indicate increases in muscle mass and strength. This study provides basic material to
aid in the development and promotion of individualized stability exercises, which can be
applied in the work environment to improve shoulder stability in office workers.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the generalization of the results because the results are
based on a selected group of participants office workers with shoulder pain. The short
intervention period may also limit the pain and functional gains.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Haahr</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Risk factors for more severe regional musculoskeletal
