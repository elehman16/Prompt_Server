Approximately 25% of pregnant women undergo a CS in the UK for delivery of their babies. This equates to approximately 171,000 caesarean sections per year in England alone.</p><p id="Par23">Sepsis and post-natal infection constitute significant maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as having significant impact on post-natal recovery and maternal wellbeing. Infection following a CS has numerous primary sources including endometritis, occurring in 7&#x02013;17% of women; this equates to approximately 27,000 cases of infection per year in England only. Risk factors for endometritis following CS include in labour caesarean section and ruptured membranes with or without vaginal colonisation with group B streptococcus. Sepsis reduction and reduction in antibiotic use have been identified as national and international priorities, improving maternal health and neonatal wellbeing through the facilitation of ongoing breast feeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Justification for intervention</title><p id="Par24">Prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery have been demonstrated to be beneficial in a number of large randomised controlled trials (RCT) and continue to reduce infection rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current practice of skin preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] is guided by a recent RCT demonstrating the superiority of a chlorhexidine over an iodine-based solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition to skin preparation with an antiseptic solution, cleansing inside the vagina with povidone iodine has been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A Cochrane review of seven trials randomising 2816 women (2635 analysed) estimated the effects of vaginal cleansing (all with povidone-iodine) on post-caesarean infectious morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Vaginal preparation immediately before caesarean delivery significantly reduced the incidence of post-caesarean endometritis from 8.3% in control groups to 4.3% in vaginal cleansing groups (average risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.81, seven trials, 2635 women). The risk reduction was particularly strong for women who were already in labour at the time of the caesarean delivery (7.4% in the vaginal cleansing group versus 13.0% in the control group; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95, three trials, 523 women) and for women with ruptured membranes (4.3% in the vaginal cleansing group versus 17.9% in the control group; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.55, three trials, 272 women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). The above would appear an effective and important strategy to reduce morbidity at CS, yet this has not been adopted within obstetric practice internationally and does not feature within the NICE Intrapartum guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is due to concerns with exposure of the fetus to iodine-based substances, concerns with vaginal staining and allergy to iodine. Iodine is a recognised antibacterial agent, but inactivity by the presence of blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] limits its use. Thus, there are a number of reasons to believe that vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine would be an appropriate alternative to povidone iodine. Some studies show greater reduction in skin flora after application of chlorhexidine (0.5 and 4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] compared with povidone-iodine agents. Also, chlorhexidine may have a greater residual activity after application than other preparations and, unlike povidone iodine, it is not inactivated by the presence of blood. Solutions that contain lower concentrations, such as the commonly used chlorhexidine gluconate and acetate (0.05%), are usually well tolerated and may be used for vaginal preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With this preparation, there are no reported cases of allergy. There is one small randomised controlled trial comparing povidone iodine with chlorohexidine gluconate for vaginal cleansing at CS. This suggested that chlorohexidine may be superior, and further research was needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">A Cochrane review of cleansing the vagina in normal vaginal delivery with chlorhexidine showed no evidence of an effect on maternal or neonatal infections with low to moderate confidence, although further large scale trials to detect small but clinically important differences were needed. Importantly, no safety concerns for the mother or baby have been identified within these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par26">The overarching aim of this research is to reduce infectious morbidity from caesarean sections.

Following the CS procedure, the vagina will be cleaned of excess blood as is standard practice with a dry swab. The application of the intervention is quick and familiar to the doctors performing the surgery due to their experience in gynaecological surgery where it is routine practice. All theatres&#x02019; standard operating procedures regarding swabs and instrument counts should be adhered to, to ensure patient safety.

The risk of bias was generally low, with the quality of most of the studies being high. Vaginal preparation immediately before caesarean delivery significantly reduced the incidence of post-caesarean endometritis from 8.3% in control groups to 4.3% in vaginal cleansing groups.

With the increasing evidence regarding antimicrobial resistance and the development of bacterial resistance there, is concern that without action, common procedures such as CS will carry significant risks. We must, therefore, seek strategies that reduce this risk. We aim to perform a feasibility study for a larger multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine versus standard practice of no vaginal cleansing immediately before CS to reduce post-partum endometritis and sepsis. There are a number of difficulties in performing a RCT in pregnant women undergoing CS, particularly in an emergency procedure where there is a short interval between decision and delivery. Additionally, the follow-up of women post-CS is unlike other surgical procedures: mothers are discharged from obstetric care quickly with no routine post-operative follow-up. They are motivated to recover and care for their baby. It is therefore necessary to perform this feasibility trial to assess both our ability to recruit women and adequately follow them up. The main limitation of this feasibility study is that it is being performed within units motivated to perform the feasibility trial and this may not accurately represent recruitment in all sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par138">This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial, assessing the feasibility of performing a trial of vaginal chlorohexidine cleansing to prevent post-natal infection.

The common incidence of CS (an event that occurs in 25% of women) and the expectation of women in labour that CS is a possibility means that giving information to all women would not overburden them and is unlikely to cause anxiety or deviate women from the normal birth process.
