Healing rates after 2 weeks of treatment were 87.5% (91/104) in the silver nitrate cauterization and 82% (82/100) in the topical steroid ointment group group. The difference between groups was -5.5% (95% confidence interval, -19.1%, 8.4%), indicating that the non-inferiority criterion was not met. After 3 weeks of treatment, the healing rate with topical steroid ointment treatment was almost identical to that of silver nitrate cauterization (94/104 [90.4%] vs. 91/100 [91.0%]; 0.6% [-13.2 to 14.3]).

However, considering that silver nitrate cauterization carries a distinct risk of chemical burns and that the overall efficacy of topical steroid ointment treatment is similar to that of silver nitrate cauterization, topical steroid ointment might be considered as a good alternative in the treatment of neonatal umbilical granuloma due to its safety and simplicity. To clarify non-inferiority, a larger study is needed.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The individual data in the present study is available upon request.

The granulation tissue in the lesion is soft, 3&#x02013;10 mm in size, vascular, dull red or pink in color, and may show a seropurulent secretion [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The most commonly used treatment for UG is silver nitrate cauterization (SNC) [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192688.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, chemical burns to the periumbilical area, eyelids, and so on caused by SNC have been reported as possible complications [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Various studies have investigated alternatives to SNC, including common salt [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], cryosurgery or electrocautery [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], excision and application of absorbable hemostatic materials [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], double ligatures [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and alcoholic wipes [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Topical steroid ointment (TSO) treatment for UG has gained wide attention due to the advantages of effectiveness and simplicity [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192688.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Brodsgaard et al raised the possibility that topical clobetasol propionate (0.05%), as a group IV steroid, may be as effective as SNC for treatment of UG [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, that study was not large enough to show superiority or non-inferiority to SNC.</p><p>Since every primary-care physician may encounter neonates with UG, clearer evidence of benefit is essential before advocating TSO treatment. We therefore conducted a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of TSO treatment for UG. The aim of this study was to examine the non-inferiority of TSO to SNC in neonates with UG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective, nonblinded, multicenter RCT compared SNC and TSO treatments in neonates with newly diagnosed UG. The trial was approved by the institutional review board of every participating hospital: Ethics Review Committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, which approved the trial for Nagoya University Hospital, Narita Hospital and Clinic Mama; the institutional review board (IRB) of Anjo Kosei Hospital; the IRB of Ogaki Municipal Hospital; the ethics committee of Okazaki City Hospital; the Chubu Rosai Hospital Research Ethics Committee; the IRB of Tsushima City Hospital; the IRB of Nishichita General Hospital; Rinri-kojinjyohohogokanriiinkai of Toyota Memorial Hospital; the Toyota Kosei Hospital Institutional Review Board; the Nakatsugawa Municipal General Hospital ethics committee; the IRB of Nagoya Memorial Hospital; the ethics committee of Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital; the Research Ethics Committee of Japan Post Nagoya-teishin Hospital; the IRB of Tosei General Hospital; the Research Ethics Committee of Japanese Community Health Care Organization Chukyo Hospital; the IRB of Handa City Hospital; the IRB of Kasugai City Hospital; and the Clinical Research Review Committee of Konan Kosei Hospital.

In a previous study that retrospectively compared SNC and TSO treatment in children with UG [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], mean healing times for SNC (n = 12) and TSO treatment (n = 16) were 12.0 and 10.3 days, respectively.

The non-inferiority margin was set at 10%; that is, the aim of this non-inferiority trial was to demonstrate that TSO treatment was no more than 10% worse than SNC with respect to the healing rate. To this end, a sample size of 100 patients per group was required to achieve more than 80% power with a two-sided type 1 error of 5%. Analysis was undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. All patients who were randomized and received any treatment were eligible for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis. Participants who had no data on the primary endpoint, did not satisfy all inclusion criteria or satisfied any exclusion criteria, or did not receive any treatment were excluded from the primary analysis. The primary efficacy analysis compared healing rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the profile likelihood method [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] between groups. Distributions of baseline characteristics were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests and t tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><p>A flow diagram of this trial is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192688.g001">Fig 1</xref>. A total of 207 patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to each intervention group. As treatment effects could not be evaluated in several patients in the present study, indicated that we could not evaluate the treatment effect, 7 more patients were registered. One hundred and four patients were allocated to the SNC group, and 103 were allocated the TSO treatment group. Of these 207 patients, 204 patients completed the trial, including 104 patients (100%) treated with SNC and 100 patients (97%) treated with TSO. Three patients were withdrawn, comprising 2 infants whose parents declined further participation after enrollment, and 1 infant who was diagnosed with urachal remnant. At the 4-week checkup, 1 patient who continued with SNC and 1 patient who continued with TSO treatment achieved cure, and one patient who continued with TSO treatment was changed to SNC. The main baseline characteristics of patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192688.t001">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences in demographic characteristics were seen between groups. One very preterm neonate (born in gestational week 31) was enrolled at a corrected age of 36 weeks without any complications. Thirteen patients had previous histories, comprising pneumothorax in 1, transient tachypnea of the newborn in 1, jaundice in 3, significant vomiting in 1, very preterm and very low birth weight infant in 1, late preterm and low birth weight infant in 3, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in 1, cleft lip, alveolus, and palate in 1, and congenital chylothorax in 1. No major adverse events occurred during treatment in either group. The primary outcome (healing rate after 2 weeks of treatment) and healing rate after 3 weeks of treatment are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192688.t002">Table 2</xref>. Healing rates counted patients that discontinued intervention or were lost to follow-up at earlier time points as failures. Efficacy rates of both treatments were almost identical after 3 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192688.t002">Table 2</xref>), the lower value of the confidence interval was lower than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 10%, so the non-inferiority criterion was not statistically met. For reference, the Wald-type confidence interval was -15.35 to 4.35. Seven patients changed treatment after 2 weeks. Of these, in the SNC group, 2 patients underwent ligation and achieved cure after 3 weeks of treatment, and 2 patients changed to TSO treatment and achieved cured after 3 weeks of treatment. In the TSO group, 3 patients changed to SNC treatment, with one achieving cure after 3 weeks of treatment, and another after 4 weeks, while the remaining patient underwent ligation after 3 weeks and achieved cure after 4 weeks of treatment.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0192688.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0192688.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of patients.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0192688.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0192688.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SNC</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSO</th><th align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr><tr><th align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(n = 104)</th><th align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(n = 100)</th><th align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(n = 204)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59 (57%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 (57%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116 (57%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at diagnosis (days)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (7&#x02013;39)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (8&#x02013;38)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (7&#x02013;39)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gestational age (weeks)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (31&#x02013;41)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (34&#x02013;41)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (31&#x02013;41)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight at birth (g)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3027 (1092&#x02013;3935)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3031 (1825&#x02013;4212)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3029 (1092&#x02013;4212)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prehistory</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (5%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (8%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moist discharge</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99 (95%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">96 (96%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">195 (96%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bleeding</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (11%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (9%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (10%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Granulation</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81 (78%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78 (79%)</td><td align="left" style="background-color:#FFFFFF" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159 (78%)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>Data are expressed as n (%) or median (inter-quartile range).</p></fn><fn id="t001fn002"><p>SNC, silver nitrate cauterization;

These results did not statistically confirm that the healing rate with TSO treatment was as good as that with SNC after 2-week treatment, but did show that healing rates of both treatments were very similar after 3-week treatment. These results suggest the TSO treatment as a potential first-line treatment for UG, owing to not only the favorable efficacy, but also the safety and simplicity.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest RCT to compare the effects of SNC and TSO treatment on neonatal UG. The present study did not demonstrate the non-inferiority of the TSO group relative to the SNC group in terms of the primary endpoint. However, the efficacy of TSO was as good as that of SNC based on the results of the healing rate after 3 weeks of treatment although non-inferiority has not been met even at this stage. The two groups displayed similar demographic characteristics and endpoints were clearly defined in advance. On the other hand, healing rates of SNC and TSO treatment at 2 weeks (primary outcome) were 87.5% and 82.0%, respectively, and were lower than expected (95.0%). This may be why the non-inferiority criterion was not met. However, healing rates at 3 weeks were 90.4% and 91.0%, respectively, and were considered to be almost identical. Furthermore, healing rates at 3 weeks were compatible with a recent study by Brodsgaard et al that showed similar efficacies for topical clobetasol propionate cream (0.05%) and SNC in the treatment of UG. In that study, healing rates after 30 days of treatment with SNC and clobetasol propionate cream group were 96.6% (29/30) and 90.0% (27/30), respectively [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The present study enrolled a much larger patient cohort than that previous study, and demonstrated more clearly that TSO treatment should be considered as a feasible treatment option for neonatal UG.</p><p>TSO treatment appears superior to SNC with regard to safety and simplicity. The use of SNC is not without risk. In particular, iatrogenic periumbilical silver nitrate burns are still reported [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the high healing rate for UG and the low cost (less than $2 US per treatment) are advantages for SNC, the performance of this method justifiably carries a certain degree of concern among medical staff and parents. On the other hand, prolonged application of topical glucocorticosteroids can lead to skin atrophy, telangiectasia, hemorrhage, bacterial infections and even paradoxical inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, these agents can cause systemic adverse effects including Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, which should be avoided [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A complete review of the adverse effects of topical steroids, with guidelines and suggestions regarding their use, was reported by Hengge et al [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Children are more susceptible to the systemic adverse effects of steroids because of enhanced percutaneous absorption through their tender skin. Although the duration of treatment for neonatal UG, at a maximum of around 1 month, is short enough that such risks are not a concern [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], neonates have a larger ratio of body surface area to body weight than older children and should be followed carefully. Despite this, TSO can be conveniently applied at home by parents, safely and effectively, as long as they have the right information, thus reducing the burden on physicians in outpatient clinics. Moreover, TSO treatment is also inexpensive (less than $3 US per prescription). These advantages were stressed and confirmed in the present work, making TSO a good alternative in the treatment of UG in neonates.</p><p>In terms of the pathological mechanisms, glucocorticosteroids are known to suppress immune pathways in keratinocytes and to negatively affect the viability, maturation, and immune function of inflammatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192688.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, recent findings have shown that topical steroids may achieve anti-inflammatory effects and contribute to reduced numbers of fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192688.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The lesion in UG is characterized by overgrowth of granulation tissue after umbilical cord separation. Brady et al showed histopathological findings for UG in a 2-month-old patient and demonstrated that UG predominately comprises granulation tissue consisting of fibroblasts, abundant small blood vessels, and mixed inflammatory infiltrate set in an edematous stroma [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. TSO can reduce the progression of inflammatory process followed by a proliferative phase and this approach appears reasonable for neonatal UG.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, treatment allocation was not blinded, since the differences in treatment drugs and tools could not be hidden from caregivers. In addition, we could not confirm that TSO treatment had been performed appropriately, since the application was carried out by the parents in their domiciles. Second, because we allowed each pediatrician to change to another treatment or ligate the UG after 2 weeks of treatment, two patients changed from SNC to TSO, three patients changed from TSO to SNC, and 4 SNC patients and 1 TSO patient underwent ligation, so the efficacy rate might thus have been assessed inaccurately. Third, we did not set a placebo group, as SNC is currently the standard of care for UG [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, a dry cord has recently been shown to be non-inferior to the use of antiseptics just for care of the cord after birth in a developed country [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, even for UG, further study is needed to clarify the necessity for treatment. Moreover, two studies have already suggested that care with alcoholic wipes offers lower efficacy than SNC [<xref rid="pone.0192688.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192688.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, we did not evaluate differences associated with the size or shape of the UG. A large UG may respond better to ligation, despite the good results observed and reported here with TSO. However, the present study represents the largest study to compare the efficacy of TSO treatment to that of SNC in patients with UG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study did not establish the non-inferiority of TSO relative to SNC, possibly due to lower than expected healing rates, leading to a lack of power in this investigation. However, considering that SCN carries the risk of chemical burns when not used properly and that the overall efficacy of TSO treatment is similar to that of SNC, TSO treatment might offer a very good alternative in the treatment of neonatal UG. To confirm non-inferiority, a larger study is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192688.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0192688.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192688.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Trial protocol in Japanese.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0192688.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192688.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Trial protocol partially translated in English.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0192688.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank all the patients and their parents who participated in this trial.
