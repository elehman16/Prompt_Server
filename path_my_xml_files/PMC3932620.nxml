However, outcomes with this modality are quite poor with 5-year survival estimates at 16% [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A major barrier to improved outcomes is the development of Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI). RILI occurs in 30% or greater of lung cancer patients [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and manifests on a spectrum from acute radiation pneumonitis, an inflammatory state occurring within weeks to 6 months of RT, to chronic radiation fibrosis, characterized by replacement of functional lung parenchyma with fibrotic tissue usually occurring months to years following therapy. Recent studies have shown that radiation causes a state of oxidative stress characterized by increased generation of free radicals. Volatile reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species have been shown <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to accelerate lipid peroxidation, oxidize DNA and cellular proteins, as well as activate pro-inflammatory cytokines. Reducing oxidative stress would hypothetically prevent RILI and improve the therapeutic index of radiotherapy in lung cancer. No known effective pharmacologic therapy to prevent this challenging complication of radiotherapy exists.</p><p id="P6">In this study, two urinary biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress, 8, 12-iso-iPF2a-VI isoprostane and 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2&#x02032;deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo), were investigated. Isoprostanes, oxidative stress biomarkers, are prostaglandin-like compounds formed by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid by free radicals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause the 8-hydroxylation of guanine (8-oxo-Guo) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This molecule and its deoxyribonucleoside counterpart (8-oxo-dGuo) are excreted in the urine <sup>4</sup> and the rate of urinary excretion of 8-oxo-dGuo parallels the rate of oxidative stress. Biochemical studies have revealed that certain populations (smokers, lung cancer, COPD) have baseline elevations in 8-oxo-dGuo levels that do not trend back to epidemiological baseline levels after an oxidative insult was terminated [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Flaxseed (FS) is a non-toxic, dietary wholegrain composed of omega-3 fatty acids and a lignan complex (FLC) with potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties. FS is the richest known source of the mammalian lignan precursor, Secoisolariciresinol Diglucoside (SDG), which is metabolized via enteric bacteria to Enterodione (ED) and Enterolactone (EL). As a plant phenolic, SDG was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to have direct hydroxyl radical scavenging properties, limit the respiratory burst of White Blood Cells (WBCs) and to inhibit lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Flaxseed has been reported to provide health benefits in several disease conditions including hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, menopause [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], cardiovascular health, metabolic syndrome and bone mineral metabolism. Extensive research by our group and elsewhere [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], has helped characterize the benefits of the wholegrain in numerous clinical scenarios. This was our first clinical application of wholegrain FS to mitigate the effects of thoracic radiation. Our long-term goal is to improve clinical responses and therapeutic indices of RT for thoracic malignancies while providing adequate radioprotection against the side effects on normal lung parenchyma.</p><p id="P7">The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the feasibility of incorporating a validated radioprotector, Flaxseed (FS), in the treatment regimen of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy and thoracic radiation. We specifically focused on whether flaxseed muffins would have a reasonable toxicity and tolerability index for patients receiving chemoradiation. We additionally sought to validate FS bioavailability by quantifying serum markers of metabolism and quantifying urinary markers of systemic oxidative stress before, during, and after RT in the presence and absence of concurrent FS supplementation. An additional component of the study aimed to establish if serum lignan levels and/or urinary markers of systemic oxidative stress demonstrated a dose-response relationship with 20 versus 40 grams of flaxseed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S6"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P8">This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted in accordance with the IRB. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requiring definitive thoracic and mediastinal radiation.

Patients with metastatic disease were eligible.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p id="P9">Primary outcomes were toxicity and tolerability of dietary flaxseed administration during chemoradiation.

The trial randomized patients to two dose levels. A standard 1:1 randomization method was applied in this trial, the randomization was performed by the General Clinical Research Center, and therefore the investigators and patients were blinded to the randomization. Twelve patients were first randomized to consume one muffin per day (20 g of flaxseed, 6 patients) or one Durham wheat muffin (control) per day (6 patients) starting on the day their definitive RT begins and for the duration of their therapy definitive RT until two weeks after completion of RT (9&#x02013;10 weeks total). If 2 subjects on the first dose level failed to tolerate the diet, then the trial would be suspended and the randomization code broken. If tolerated, then an additional 12 patients were intended to be randomized to a second dose level of two muffins per day (40 g). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the experimental design of this study. Patients and investigators were blinded as to which type of muffin each subject was assigned. Ground wholegrain flaxseed (Dr. Jack Carter, University of North Dakota) was baked into muffins according to a recipe developed by the metabolic kitchen of the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC). The muffins were isocaloric and were prepared as described by Bloedon et al. [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Blood and urine samples were obtained at four time points (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>): 1) Baseline &#x02013; one week prior to starting RT and FS diet; 2) End of week 1 of RT and FS diet; 3) End of RT with FS diet still ongoing; 4) One month after end of RT (2 weeks after end of FS diet). Subjects were asked to eat the muffin(s) at least 4 hours before sample collection. Plasma was analyzed for metabolites ED and EL of flaxseed lignan. Urine was analyzed for isoprostane and 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo) levels each time. Plasma and urine collection was incomplete in 8 patients due to withdrawal from study due to progressive disease (2) or tolerability (4), or lost to follow up due to patient (1) or hospitalization (1).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Radiation treatment planning</title><p id="P12">All patients underwent CT-based treatment planning for RT. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as all known sites of disease including pathologically enlarged (&#x02265; 1 cm in short axis) or FDG-avid lymph nodes. Elective nodal radiation was not permitted. Total dose to gross disease was 60&#x02013;80 Gray (Gy) administered in 2 Gy fractions given daily 5 days per week. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was created from the GTV by adding a 1 cm margin. In 11 out of 14 patients, 4D-CT and PET/CT fusion was used for treatment planning. Dose constraints were as follows: volume of lung receiving 20Gy (V20) less than 35%, maximum spinal cord doss less than 45Gy, dose to 50% of cardiac volume (D50) less than 40Gy.

In the flaxseed arm, there were three patients with DM (1 pre-existing DM) and 1 LR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">We assessed the feasibility of incorporating flaxseed in the treatment of a small cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Adherence to the flaxseed diet in the baked muffin formulation was below required levels for the study and therefore the trial was terminated after the first dose level. Here, we present the initial analysis of the patients enrolled. Markers of flaxseed metabolism, enterodione and enterolactone, were detected in the sera of the flaxseed group undergoing therapy. Urinary biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress (isoprostane and 8-oxo-D-guo) increased in response to radiotherapy. Trends toward reduced rates of pneumonitis were seen in FS-fed patients. More patients in the FS arm received concurrent chemotherapy than in the control arm; and despite this difference, pneumonitis rates were lower in the FS arm.</p><p id="P23">Poor adherence to flaxseed supplementation in the muffin formulation was likely multi factorial. Patients noted intolerable taste and/or texture with flaxseed muffins, which is of prime importance in patients with anorexia and odynophagia due to chemoradiotherapy. Recently, novel formulations of flaxseed and routes of administration have been designed and may circumvent this issue such as employing ground whole grain flaxseed as a condiment, flavor enhancer, or thickening agent.</p><p id="P24">The antioxidant mechanism of flaxseed is either by direct hydroxyl radical scavenging or by counteracting lipid peroxidation. Thompson et al. [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their studies of healthy volunteers ingesting varying concentrations and formulations of flaxseed [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated the time-dependent concentration differences of ED and EL in the serum and urine of healthy patients. Our study has confirmed that ED and EL plasma concentration were quantifiable in the flaxseed group with the ED and EL levels at or greater than seen previously. While FS metabolites generally reach a plateau in the plasma within 3 weeks of supplementation in our murine models [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the drop in levels shown here may be secondary to poor adherence to the diet or other biochemical factors.</p><p id="P25">Prior work by our group (21) had shown dietary FS given before and after thoracic radiotherapy prevented radiation induced pneumonopathy in a murine model. Lungs were evaluated at 24 hours post-RT for acute markers of radiation-induced injury and the FS-fed mice demonstrated reduced expression of lung injury biomarkers (Bax, p21, and TGF-beta1). At three weeks, there was decreased cellular injury from RT as measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. At four months, mice had decreased hydroxyproline content and fewer inflammatory cells in their bronchoalveolar fluid analyses indicating less late damage.</p><p id="P26">Here we demonstrated a response in two urinary markers of systemic oxidative stress, isoprostane and and 8-oxo-dGuo. Biomarker levels increased from radiotherapy and ultimately decreased at one-month post treatment. This observation was consistent with the understanding that inflammation increases during the course of radiotherapy. As acute effects of radiation diminish and tumor size decreases, there are lower oxidative stress levels. We saw that there was an increase in 8-oxo-dGuo that did not normalize after cessation of radiotherapy. This could relate to ongoing DNA damage in tumor and normal cells persisting post-RT or in conjunction with chemotherapy or other antibiotic therapy. Isoprostane levels appeared to increase more in the flaxseed arm between week 1 and the end of RT; however, there was also a greater decrease between the ends of RT compared to week 1. Taken together, there was an overall decrease in isoprostane level from week 1 to the one month after RT. A dramatic decrease in isoprostane levels from baseline (one week prior to RT and FS treatment) occurred with initiation of flaxseed muffins. this study As seen in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the isoprostane curve mirrors the oxidative stress curve, with baseline elevated biomarkers representing respiratory impairment and advanced cancer, preliminary drop reflecting the start of flaxseed in the presence of radiotherapy, midway spike showing the effect of radiotherapy, and, lastly, a decrease mirroring the discontinuation of all therapy. Antibiotic use can affect the bioavailability of flaxseed. In this study, patients were placed on levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, shown in studies to elevate markers of inflammation (isoprostanes) in otherwise healthy volunteers [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is conceivable that patients on antibiotics affected their enteric flora and thus lacked an integral part of flaxseed digestion [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The complex interplay of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antibiotic therapy makes it challenging to discern what part the fluoroquinolone had in addition to chemoradiation.</p><p id="P27">Given that this is a pilot study and therefore would only have adequate power to identify large differences between groups, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding the difference in oxidative stress levels between the flaxseed and control groups. There were no cases of pneumonitis in the flaxseed arm, which was encouraging. In addition, there were fewer cases of radiation induced esophagitis. Again, these were very important findings but need to be assessed in a randomized study with adequate power. In addition, as previously noted, chemoradiation is a large cause of gastrointestinal toxicity and therefore it is unclear how much of the intolerability of the flaxseed muffins may be from the chemoradiation itself. In addition, it should be noted that there appears to be an imbalance in the type of chemotherapy received by each arm of the study. However, due to the small number of patients, we are not able to statistically evaluate for this difference.</p><p id="P28">Interpretation of these urinary biomarkers normalized to creatinine may be a source of error because of variable creatinine. With larger sample sizes, the effects of 8-oxo-dGuo and creatinine could be assessed separately in multivariable regression models [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P29">Studies by our group <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have revealed that dietary FS given prior to and post-thoracic radiation did not abrogate the tumoricidal properties of radiotherapy. We have also shown that dietary FS given after RT improved survival, decreased pulmonary inflammation and eventual fibrosis [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additional studies are currently under way by our group to further characterize the radiosensitizing aspect of the flaxseed lignan complex as well as the dose-modifying factor of SDG, in an attempt to further improve therapeutic indices of radiotherapy. The two-year overall survival in this study was 30%, which is consistent with recent studies [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p id="P30">Flaxseed administration in the muffin formulation was not feasible due to a range of factors including patient anorexia, odynophagia and tolerability of the flaxseed muffin formulation. However, quantification of flaxseed bioavailability and urinary markers of systemic oxidative stress could be achieved. There was a trend towards decreased rates of pneumonitis in FS versus control (0% vs. 42.9%). Dietary flaxseed may be clinically useful as an agent to increase the therapeutic index of thoracic RT by increasing the radiation tolerance of organs at risk including the esophagus and lungs. Based on our preliminary data, further clinical trials investigating different formulations of flaxseed which are now available are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>NIH-R01 CA133470-04 (MCS), the University of Pennsylvania Research Foundation (MCS) and Junior Investigator Pilot Grant Program Award (RR).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>We do not have any conflicts or potential conflicts of interest to disclose at this time.
