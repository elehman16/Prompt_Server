function, balance, fatigability, and quality of life. [Subjects and Methods] Subjects with
chronic neck pain who were treated in S hospital were included in this study; they were
randomly allocated into two groups, i.e., the experimental group (n = 10) and the control
group (n = 10). Both groups received traditional physical therapy for 3 sessions for
30&#x02005;min per week for 4 weeks. The experimental group practiced additional neurac training
for 30&#x02005;min/day, for 3 days per week for 4 weeks. All subjects were evaluated using the
visual analogue scale (VAS), the neck disability index (NDI), the biorescue (balance), the
questionnaire for fatigue symptoms (fatigue), and the medical outcome 36-item short form
health survey (SF-36) pre- and post-intervention. [Results] The experimental group
effectively improved their pain, function, balance, fatigability, and quality of life.
[Conclusion] Neurac training is thus considered an effective training program that
enhances body functionality by improving pain, function, balance ability, fatigability,
and quality of life in patients with chronic neck pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic neck pain</kwd><kwd>Sling-neurac training</kwd><kwd>Function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain is one of the most common disorders, leading to considerable stress on healthcare
systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is estimated that 67% of
the population will experience neck pain at some point in their life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most people with neck pain complain of inconveniences in
daily life, but rarely opt for aggressive treatments, unlike for lower back pain. As a
result, neck pain does not fundamentally improve even after 10&#x02005;years in most cases and
results in enormous economic losses each year<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive afferent inputs from neck muscles play a significant role in the control of
human posture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is growing evidence
to implicate the role of the cervical spine in influencing postural control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have reported altered
postural control in people with neck pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
McPartland et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> determined a
significant correlation between poor balance control and fatty infiltration of the cervical
extensor musculature in subjects with neck pain; others have demonstrated the adverse
effects of neck extensor muscle fatigue on postural sway<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic pain is a factor that increases muscle fatigue<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle fatigue generated by maintaining
muscular contraction to fixed head posture in different positions is known as one of the
causes of chronic neck pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neck
muscle fatigue caused by chronic pain impairs the balance of upright posture<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, changes the role of sensory
receptors&#x02014;such as muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and affects joint
position sense<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As compared to lower back pain, neck pain tends to become chronic more frequently and is
likely to relapse again after therapeutic interventions<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In patients with chronic neck pain, the quality of life decreases,
which can lead to serious problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Overall, 25% of patients with neck pain experience chronic neck pain, leading to decreased
quality of life and socioeconomic damages such as medical expenses<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among various treatments for reducing chronic neck pain, therapeutic exercise has the
strongest evidence<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies in
recent years have reported that active therapeutic interventions are more effective than
passive therapeutic interventions in neck pain patients<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neurac method is an active rather than a passive treatment
approach<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neurac treatment method
with sling exercises focuses on tonic stabilizers largely located near joints that play a
crucial role in the feed forward mechanism and is efficient in retraining motor units of
muscles and reoperating inhibited actions through dynamic-static contractions of high
intensity<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method utilizes passive fluctuations or mechanical
vibrations. Vibratory stimulation can improve muscle contraction by stimulating muscle
hypertrophy, thereby affecting the muscle spindles<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibrations for a short time period have been reported to be
effective in increasing deep muscle strength and muscle stabilization in chronic pain
patients<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, this study investigated the effects of neurac training on pain, function,
balance, fatigability, and quality of life in patients with chronic neck pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants in this study included administrative staff who had experienced chronic neck
pain at least 3 months previously; they were selected from among administrative staffs with
high computer usage, in S hospital in Seoul. Patients were randomly assigned to the
experimental group (n = 10; male = 2, female = 8) or control group (n = 10; male = 2, female
= 8). Subjects were included in the study if they had a neck disability index (NDI) score
over 5 and had suffered chronic neck pain at least 3 months previously. Exclusion criteria
were patients with acute neck pain, a previous history of neck surgery, presence of other
neurological or orthopedic disorders affecting the neck, and those receiving treatment with
muscle relaxants.</p><p>The experiment was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of S
University. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment.</p><p>Subjects received traditional physical therapy for 3 sessions for 30&#x02005;min per week for 4
weeks. The experimental group practiced additional neurac training for 30 minutes per day,
for 3 days per week for 4 weeks. The neurac training used the motor control training and
myofascial chain training protocols presented in the neurac 1 course materials (redbalance
academy neurac 1 course book, Norway).</p><p>Neurac training was performed using a sling (Redcord, Norway, 2004) in the supine cervical
setting, prone cervical setting, and cervical movements, as presented in Norway Neurac
course 1 materials (redbalance academy neurac 1 course book, Norway). The supine cervical
setting comprises the subject lying in the supine position, with the head supported by an
inelastic sling, wherein the therapist holds the cervical vertebral portion gently with two
hands. Two thumbs of the therapist are placed on the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the
rest of the fingers hold the back of the cervical vertebral portion. The cervical vertebral
portion and back of the head are then pulled gently upwards, and the sternocleidomastoid
muscle is pressed 2&#x02005;mm with the thumb to minimize the lordotic curve of the cervical
vertebrae. The subjects were instructed to maintain this small force and relax. The examiner
observed whether the patient&#x02019;s chin was elevated minutely toward the upper part.</p><p>The prone cervical setting is performed in the prone position. The therapist holds the
cervical vertebral portion with two hands gently. Two thumbs are placed on the middle of the
back portion and the other fingers are placed on the front portion and sternocleidomastoid
muscle; simultaneously, the therapist pulls the cervical vertebral portion upwards. At this
time, the lordotic curve of the cervical vertebral portion is reduced and the chin moves
slightly upward by 2&#x02005;mm. The patient was instructed to maintain this small force and relax.
In the supine cervical and prone cervical settings, when the compensation of other muscles
appeared, applying vibration on sling line. If subjects appealed for a break, the therapist
paused for 30&#x02005;s, known as break time. The Cervical movements of sling training name,
depending on the sling and roll of the subject, while supporting the weight of the body,
were instructed to the movement of the neck. The subject was instructed to maintain the body
in a straight line during the break time.</p><p>Motor control training was used in the supine cervical and prone cervical settings, while
myofascial chain training was used in cervical movements (cervical retraction, cervical
lateral flexion, cervical rotation, and cervical extension).</p><p>Outcomes were measured in terms of pain, function, balance, fatigability, and quality of
life. Pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS was used to measure
the degree of pain on a scale of 0 to 10 points (10 being the highest pain). Function was
evaluated using the NDI. The NDI is a 6-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), with a score of 0
indicating no pain or disability and 5 indicating insufferable pain or complete disability.
Balance was measured by the biorescue test. All subjects were measured when standing for
30&#x02005;s on two feet with eyes open and eyes closed. All measurements were repeated 3 times
after practicing once, and the mean value was determined. The elements measured included the
sway area, sway length, and sway velocity; low values indicated good balance abilities.
Fatigability was evaluated using the questionnaire for fatigue symptoms standardized by
Industrial Fatigue Research Group of Japan Society of Industrial Hygiene. This questionnaire
comprised a total of 30 items&#x02014;including 10 items each for physical fatigue, mental fatigue,
and physical fatigue&#x02014;on a 4-point scale (1, 2, 3, 4) with a total score of 30 to 120, with
high scores indicating a high degree of fatigue. Quality of life was evaluated using the
medical outcome 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of a total of 8
items, i.e., physical function, role limitation-physical, body pain, general health, role
limitation-emotional, vitality, social function, and mental health.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 statistical software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Prior to
training, the normality of the data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
analysis and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to examine the significance of differences
for variables. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare pain, function, balance,
fatigability, and quality of life before and after the treatments. The Mann-Whitney U test
was performed to identify differences between groups. For all tests, statistical
significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 20 subjects participated in this study, with 10 subjects in the experimental

intervention focusing on retraining tonic stabilizers&#x02014;on several dependent variables chosen
on the basis of previous reports.</p><p>This study showed that neurac training for 4 weeks decreased pain and NDI in the
experimental group. Yang et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that neurac training for two weeks is effective in reducing pain and enhancing
function in patients with cervical radiculopathy. Our results were consistent with this
study as well as with those of previous studies, demonstrating that active treatment helps
in reducing subjective symptoms in patients with chronic neck pain<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, with sling exercise therapy being the active exercise
form<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. This reduction in subjective
symptoms was also considered to result in decreased dysfunction.</p><p>Our study confirmed the effects of neurac training on improving balance disorders caused by
neck pain. Brummnage et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that vibration applied to patients with lumbar pain restored the position sense in the
lumbosacral part. Fontana et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> noted
that when vibrations of low frequency were applied to the entire body, the proprioceptive
sense of the lumbosacral area recovered. Choi et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that sling treatment with vibration is an activity that
affects large trunk muscles in contrast to sling treatment without vibration. Further,
Kirkesola et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when
vibrations were applied to patients with neck pain, the force steadiness of neck muscle
increased. Such vibrations applied to muscles and tendons are thought to affect the afferent
nerve pathways<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurac training is a
weight-bearing exercise using suspension units or a sling system<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The closed chain exercises used in weight bearing
exercise provide improved proprioception and kinesthetic feedback<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, neurac training applied to the
experimental group showed improvements in balance ability; this was considered to increase
neck muscle activation and improve proprioception. Further, due to the high density of
muscle spindles in the neck<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>, the applied vibrations to these muscle spindles were
considered to contribute to the recovery of proprioception. We believe that the recovery of
proprioception affects the improvement in balance ability in patients with chronic neck
pain.</p><p>This study also confirmed the effects of neurac training on fatigability and showed a
significant difference in fatigue symptoms before and after the experimental treatment as
well as between the two groups. Falla et al.<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that endurance-strength training reduces fatigue and
increases cervical flexion strength in women with chronic neck pain. Our results using
neurac training for 4 weeks were consistent with this finding. However, an objective
follow-up study is required for analyzing the changes in muscle fatigability using
electromyography, since muscle fatigue was measured in this study using a subjective
survey-type questionnaire for fatigue symptoms specifically developed for Japan.</p><p>In previous studies concerning quality of life, exercise has been repeatedly demonstrated
to be an intervention that promotes the quality of life, because the adaptation of everyday
life through exercises enhances quality of life<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, neurac training significantly improved quality of
life in the experimental group, which was consistent with previous results regarding the
relationship between exercise and quality of life. The reduction in pain, dysfunction,
fatigability shown earlier were considered to be responsible for the improvements in quality
of life in these patients. Many items on the SF-36, i.e., physical function, body pain,
physical role limitation, and vitality, improved significantly with neurac training,
indicating that this therapy led to positive changes in physical health but not in mental
health, which includes various emotional and psychological factors. Jeon<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the mental health of seniors
who participated in exercise was better than those who did not. This contrast is considered
to be because the study period was short and the number of exercises was not high. Further,
subjects who participated in this study were office workers, and the multiple factors that
affect mental health were not thoroughly controlled.</p><p>This study has certain limitations. However, the findings of this study cannot be wholly
generalized because of the small number of subjects. Further analyses are required to
clarify the objective improvements in balance, proprioception, and muscle fatigability with
the neurac training intervention; we expect to use wavelet analysis and electromyography for
such follow-up studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this study proved the positive effects of neurac training on pain, function,
balance, fatigability, and quality of life in patients with chronic neck pain, suggesting
that this intervention may be effective in the clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Aggarwal</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Aggarwal</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Jani</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical approach to neck pain</article-title>.
