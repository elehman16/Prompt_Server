ICPs appear to be most successful in improving service coordination in the acute stroke context where patient care trajectories are predictable [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A review of interventional trials and other studies found that, compared with &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; the use of ICPs with stroke was associated with positive and negative impact on patient care, or no impact at all [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Patients managed using ICPs for acute stroke reduced the total length of hospital stay and hospital costs, were less likely to be readmitted, or experience pneumonias and urinary tract infections. In addition, they were more likely to have essential and timely diagnostic procedures such as brain computerised tomography (CT) scan, echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasound scan. Contrasting reports found that patient satisfaction, quality of life, and probability of good outcomes were significantly lower in the ICP group [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One review found that mortality and hospital discharge disposition was similar between patients managed using ICPs and control groups [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These findings are not entirely consistent. ICPs for stroke management do contain numerous elements 1) a comprehensive unit with acute and rehabilitation beds; 2) specialist staff (medical, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational, speech and language therapy, social work); 3) multidisciplinary team to ensure good communication, with formal meeting of all staff once per week to plan management of individual patients); 4) education and training with incorporated programmes for staff and provision of information for patients and carers; 5) protocols of care (systematic approach to stroke focused care) that function in a complex and multi-faceted intervention. Stroke focused care includes clinical assessment, routine investigations (biochemistry, hematology, electrocardiography (ECG), CT scan), selected investigations (carotid Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography), nursing and specialised therapy. Unfortunately, complex ICPs are difficult to implement in resource limited settings. A &#x02018;stroke care bundle&#x02019; is a subset of an ICP that contains evidence based care interventions that when combined significantly improve patient outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Melbourne, Australia 72 hour stroke care bundle [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] contains six elements including a rapid stroke screening for stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA); brain CT scan in &#x0003c; 24 hours; nil by mouth (NPO) until a bedside swallow evaluation is done in &#x0003c; 24 hours; aspirin if haemorrhagic stroke is excluded within 48 hours; physiological monitoring and management of neurological status, blood glucose, BP, hydration status for 72 hours). The national referral hospital in Kampala, Uganda, like many health centres in sub-Saharan Africa has no stroke unit and thrombolysis, bedside swallow evaluation is not &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;. Stroke patients are managed on the neurology, neurosurgery units and general intensive care unit (ICU). They may not receive timely clinical and technology based assessment and interventions as well as routine physiological monitoring and management that are important particularly in the acute phase. Thirty day case fatality rate is high 43.8% [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implementing a 72 hour stroke care bundle [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] on early outcomes after acute stroke among patients presenting to the national referral hospital within seven days post stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting TREND checklist, are available as supporting information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154333.s001">S1 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154333.s002">S1 Table</xref> respectively). The data base will be made available upon request from the corresponding author.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>We performed a one year non-randomised controlled study with a quasi-experimental study design. Acute stroke patients were consecutively enrolled (controls first, intervention group second after control group enrolment was complete) into each group over 5 month periods.The control group was managed with &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; and the intervention group received a 72-hour stroke care bundle followed by &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; thereafter. Patients in both groups were followed to the 30-day from stroke onset. A randomised control study was deemed unethical/impractical in our study setting [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and thus a sequentially enrolled sample was conducted to provide a control sample and an intervention sample. Given that patients with acute stroke have a number of acute medical problems requiring active intervention during hospital stay, it would be impractical to care for patients on &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; and in the intervention group in the same area on the neurology unit. Even with a secluded area for the intervention group, human resource constraints would not permit two different groups of nurses to care for each study group</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study area and setting</title><p>Patients were enrolled in the accident and emergency unit (A&#x00026;E) at Mulago hospital which has a bed capacity of 1,500. Mulago hospital is located in Kampala the capital city of Uganda with a population of 1,516,210 [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The hospital has no stroke unit and thrombolysis and bedside swallow evaluation are not &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;. The hospital has a radiology department with highly trained specialty personnel. Acute stroke patients (on average 5 patients per week) who present to the A&#x00026;E unit are housed and managed for a maximum of 24 hours before they are transferred to the neurology unit. Patients that require surgical intervention are transferred to the neurosurgery unit and those that require mechanical ventilation are transferred to the general ICU. The neurology unit which contains on average 50 patients is located on a general medical ward that also includes endocrinology, haematology, and dermatology/ rheumatology units. Collectively, these units provide service to 100 patients on average. Patients are managed by neurologists, internal medicine physicians, medical officers, general nurses, physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, social workers, and support staff. Fifteen nurses provide care to the medical ward and patients&#x02019; family members assist the nurses in various ways such as turning patients in bed, feeding and bathing them as well as transporting them to the radiology department for investigations.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study was approved by Makerere University College of Health Sciences&#x02019; School of Medicine higher degrees research and ethics committee, Mulago national referral hospital&#x02019;s research and ethics committee, and The Uganda National Council for Science and Technology.

Initial stroke screening depends on availability or vigilance of a clinician and brain CT scan may be delayed hours to days. Service limitations are largely due to human resource constraints, insufficient equipment and technology access as well as lack of a formal acute stroke care pathway to standardize clinical care and improve its efficiency and effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the neurology unit the &#x02018;Usual care&#x02019; for acute stroke is a modification of the American Heart Association /American stroke association (AHA/ASA) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This includes supportive treatment to ensure a patent airway, adequate oxygen saturation (target &#x0003e;92%), haemodynamic stability, glycaemic control with insulin when serum glucose is &#x0003e;10mmols/L, temperature control with antipyretic paracetamol 1gram if &#x0003e;37.5&#x000b0;C, parenteral normal saline or ringers lactate to maintain adequate hydration in addition to enteral feeding, and measures to prevent pressure sores and deep venous thrombosis with early mobilisation and use of low molecular weight heparin. Antihypertensive drugs (labetalol and hydralazine) are used when BP exceeds 180/105mmHg and 160/100mmHg for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes respectively. The unit team performs physiologic monitoring and management of neurological status, blood glucose, BP, hydration status (clinical evaluation, fluid input/output), and temperature during the patient&#x02019;s hospital stay. Among patients with ischemic stroke, antiplatelet drugs including aspirin and clopidogrel, and statins are administered. Rehabilitation includes physiotherapy, occupational, speech and language therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Stroke care bundle for intervention group</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154333.t001">Table 1</xref> the stroke care bundle aimed to address key deficiencies in &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; by providing a formalised acute stroke care pathway to standardize clinical care and improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Funds were availed to ensure timely investigations, sufficient stock of drugs/sundries, equipment such as BP machines, glucometers with gluco-strips, thermometers, pulse oximeters that were required for physiological monitoring and management of acute stroke patients. The assessment tools and protocols for implementing the stroke care bundle elements are available as appendices in the protocol that was provided as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154333.s001">S1 File</xref>). In summary, when a suspected acute stroke patient presented to the A&#x00026;E, a rapid initial stroke screen was conducted by the study clinicians using the recognition of stroke in the emergency room (ROSIER) scale [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The ROSIER assessed the date and time of symptom onset, history of loss of consciousness, seizure activity, level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and hydration status using clinical evaluation. The patient&#x02019;s temperature was also measured. The study clinicians ensured a patent airway, adequate oxygen saturation (target 92%), temperature control with rectal or parenteral paracetamol if the temperature was &#x0003e;37.5&#x000b0;C, and haemodynamic stability. Patients who presented with blood glucose levels &#x0003c; 3.5 mmol/L were treated with 50mls of 50% dextrose and reassessed when the blood glucose normalised. In addition to the ROSIER assessment, the risk for stroke was also assessed using the ABCD (age, BP, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes) assessment scale [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] among patients that presented in less than 24 hours from stroke onset. Following the rapid initial stroke screen, the patient was then referred for a brain CT scan to confirm stroke. The study clinician prescribed aspirin 300 mg initially and then 150 mg daily if the patient had ischemic stroke on CT scan. Oral medications or fluids were not permitted, until a bedside swallow evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was done by a speech and language therapist within 24 hours. Parenteral fluids or drugs could be given before a swallow evaluation was done. Following a swallow evaluation, a patient was categorised as 1) normal feeding, 2) mild swallowing impairment 3) severe swallowing or significant delay in initiation of swallowing. Regular diet, modified diet or blended consistency with thickened fluids and nasal gastric tube insertion for enteral feeding respectively were recommended. Physiological monitoring and management of neurological status, blood glucose, BP, hydration status and temperature were done at 4 to 6 hourly intervals or shorter in case of an abnormal parameter. Management of the abnormal parameters was done as per the study protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154333.s001">S1 File</xref>). Implementation of the stroke care bundle lasted 72 hours and the patients continued with &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; thereafter.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0154333.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0154333.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Elements of the stroke care bundle versus &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; for patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency unit with acute stroke.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0154333.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0154333.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke bundle</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Usual care</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rapid initial stroke screen (ROSIER)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Seen as per availability of a clinician</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ABCD assessment when TIA is suspected</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not done</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Brain CT scan in &#x0003c;24 hours</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Done as per availability of funds</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPO till bed side swallow screen is done in &#x0003c;24 hours</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not done</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aspirin within 48 hours if hemorrhagic stroke excluded</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depends on when brain CT scan is done</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physiological monitoring and management of Neuro status, blood sugar, blood pressure, hydration status for 72 hours</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not routine</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Training of the study teams</title><p>One week prior to commencement of recruitment of patients in the control group, two internal medicine physicians (not part of neurology, and accident and emergency units attending teams) and the principal investigator were trained in participant consenting, administration of the questionnaires, comprehensive clinical assessment, investigations and follow-up procedures.</p><p>At the end of the control group recruitment period, a stroke care bundle team comprising two physicians (recruited patients in the control group), one medical officer (looked after control group patients as part of accident and emergency attending team) and fourteen neurology unit nurses (looked after control group patients on the neurology unit) was instructed in protocol bundle implementation and adherence for 3 days (19<sup>th</sup> July to 21<sup>st</sup> July).

Measures of association were expressed as risk ratios and a p value &#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kaplan Meier survival estimates and log rank test for comparison were used for time to death analysis for all strokes and by stroke severity categories.

hospital with CT scan of the brain already done at another hospital before they were referred to Mulago hospital.

All the 127 patients in the intervention group were evaluated for pre-feeding requirements for a swallow evaluation. Fifty six (44.1%) patients met the pre-feeding requirements and all of them had a bedside swallow evaluation performed within 24 hours of admission; 5) Aspirin was promptly prescribed for all the 75 patients in the intervention group, in whom haemorrhagic stroke was excluded on CT scan; 6) monitoring and management of neurological status, BP, blood glucose, temperature, hydration status was complete for the first 72 hours of admission in 87 patients out of 127 patients (16 died within 72 hours and 24 were discharged before the 72 hours elapsed.

The processes of care were consistently performed with a 17 fold reduction in time to CT scan.</p><p>In spite of the 72 hour stroke focused care, 7-day mortality was higher in the intervention group compared to the controls, and there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality and functional outcome between groups. This is consistent with findings in a Cochrane review [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with some studies reporting a significant negative effect of ICPs on outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The intervention group generally had more patients with severe stroke, including hemorrhagic strokes and a history of prior strokes, heart disease, abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, high lipid profiles, delayed admissions that were less educated, and female. Even with standard methods of case-mix adjustment, these differences may have impacted our ability to determine the effectiveness of the stroke care bundle on outcomes. Stroke severity could have adversely contributed to poor outcomes beyond the ability of any interventional care protocol to impact outcome. Severe stroke is an independent predictor of early mortality from stroke from multiple studies [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and it is directly related to the severity of the neurological damage [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, we are uncertain why more severe stroke patients presented to hospital during the intervention study period (the last 6 months of the year). Severe strokes have been associated with seasonal variation [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154333.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast with our study, implementing an ICP in a cluster randomised trial of ischemic stroke patients significantly lowered risk of 7-day mortality [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, a study in a resource limited setting reported a reduction of in-hospital mortality from 33% to 16% after implementing an ICP [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In these studies, patients were admitted to stroke units that had stroke focused care for their entire hospitalization in contrast to our study which had stroke focused care for 72 hours. Admission to stroke units has been reported to improve outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Findings in this preliminary study suggest that the stroke care bundle might reduce mortality in some patients with severe strokes. Patients with severe stroke in the intervention group were significantly more likely to be alive at 30 days post stroke compared to patients with severe stroke in the control group. It is possible that the more aggressively implemented care (as represented by the stroke care bundle) is most helpful for individuals with a great amount of impairment and highest risk of complications. Additional research is needed to more conclusively determine if there may be optimal patient populations on which to focus ICPs.</p><p>Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the intervention group. This was in agreement with multiple studies [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but in disagreement with other studies that reported an unclear impact of ICPs on hospital stay [<xref rid="pone.0154333.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our study, all intervention patients spent fewer days in hospital. One might argue that this was so because of a higher mortality in this group compared to the controls but likewise, survivors in the intervention group spent less days in hospital compared to controls. Possibly, early CT scan implementation favoured early discharge in less severe strokes or timely aggressive treatment of more severe strokes. Reduced length of hospital stay invariably translates in to reduced hospital costs and it will be important for resource limited settings to study cost effects of ICPs in future work.</p><p>Facilitators to implementation of the intervention included adequate funding which ensured readily available resources for stroke focused care. The stroke care protocol streamlined patient flow from the accident and emergency unit to the neurology, neurosurgery units and the general ICU. Training of nurses and explaining the rationale for implementation of the care pathway made them more knowledgeable about acute stroke care guidelines, clearly defined the roles of doctors and nurses, and enhanced their involvement in patient care. Weekly meetings and senior team supervision ensured continued adherence to the study protocols. The main barrier to implementation of the stroke care pathway was the impression of appearing overly prescriptive and additional to the pre-existing burden of care on an already over-stretched nursing staff. An ICU bed was not always readily available and so some admissions were delayed.</p><p>There are limitations of our study. The non-randomised design may not have been able to account for temporal differences that could have occurred at our facility during the study time frame or even guarantee complete removal of bias, despite standard methods of case-mix adjustment. The stroke care bundle provided specific stroke&#x02013;focused care for 72 hours only and this could have been an example of &#x0201c;too little, too late&#x0201d; especially for those with delayed hospital admission to begin with. There could also have been differences in informal supports available to the patients in the intervention and control groups such as care delivered by family. The sample size was small given the wide confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This preliminary study in Uganda using a stroke care bundle did not find improved mortality or functional outcomes, although there were improved outcomes in some stroke patient sub-groups. Given the fact that stroke burden in the resource limited settings is expected to increase, it will be important to further develop and test ICPs that can facilitate delivery of stroke care that is efficient, practical, and may be able to generally improve patient outcomes. However, interventions to prevent severe strokes should be studied and emphasized as a preferred way to reduce stroke burden.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154333.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154333.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0154333.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>TREND checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0154333.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mulago national referral hospital management; all study participants for their valuable time and information.
