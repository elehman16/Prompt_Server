First we take a sample of exudate for bacteriological tests, and then we carry out the inspection of the abdominal cavity, in order to localise precisely the perforation spot, and the extent of peritonitis. Quite often the gall bladder and the liver adhere with fibrin accretions in the vicinity of the ulcer, which is most frequently located on the frontal side of the first part of the duodenum. The follow-up step is the cleansing of the abdominal cavity, where irrigation with a warm physiological solution is followed by evacuation of the exudate and removal of fibrin accretions to the maximum possible extent. In terms of methodology we start at the right upper quadrant, proceeding to the left upper one, then we continue to the left lower quadrant, and we end in the right lower one. We need to be especially diligent in the area of the Douglas cavity, and in the space between intestinal loops.</p></sec><sec id="S20006"><title>Perforation suture closure technique</title><p>After the suture closure of the ulcer, there is no need for biopsy of the duodenal ulcer, but on the other hand, in the case of gastric ulcer, it is recommended to take a biopsy of the ulcer margin. Suture is carried out by a slowly absorbable or non-absorbable material applied with atraumatic needle 2/0 or 3/0. Usually two or three transverse sutures are applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Photos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">2</xref>). After the perforation is suture-closed, it is possible (using a part of the large omentum) to cover the suture closure, and fix it to the upper suture. Some surgeons apply for omentoplastic intervention a fibrin sealant. In the case of a chronic callous ulcer, it is problematic to sew together ulcer margins, and we can therefore apply a thicker thread, 1/0, in order to avoid it cutting through the tissue in a fibrous environment.</p><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Photo 1</label><caption><p>Perforation suture A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WIITM-9-23639-g002"/></fig><fig id="F0003" position="float"><label>Photo 2</label><caption><p>Perforation suture B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WIITM-9-23639-g003"/></fig><p>In the case of larger ulcers it is possible to sew-in within the defect, with several stitches, the free end of the omentum, in order to close the defect.

One goes into the subhepatic space, which monitors the area of suture, which goes into the incision used as a port in the right mesogastrium. The remaining two drain tubes are inserted from the left, through incisions used as ports into the left subphrenic space and to the Douglas cavity (in the case of 3-port intervention we introduce into the Douglas cavity a drain tube through an incision on the right side). After the operation we keep in place the nasogastric tube until the peristaltic restart onset. Provided the clamping test was successful, the tube can be extracted. In complicated ulcer-suturing cases, or protracted onset of passage, we can carry out examination using a water contrast agent (UroDiagramin). The gastro-fibroscopic examination is planned following 4 to 6 weeks after the operation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0007"><title>Material and methods</title><p>During the 15-year period from 1998 until 2012, we carried out in our centre altogether 259 operations of perforated gastro-duodenal ulcer.

Similarly the operation intensity in terms of operation duration confirmed a statistically significant difference in favour of laparoscopy, namely 61 min vs. 85 min for conventionally operated patients. The average age was comparable.</p><p>We found a statistically significant difference in the number of complications in favour of laparoscopy, 10.9% vs. 27.5% for conventional operations. In the case of laparotomy we did not record even a single wound infection complication compared to the conventional group with the occurrence of 11.7%.</p><p>The differences in favour of laparoscopy, 3.6% vs. 9.2% in the case of postoperative occurrence of extra-abdominal complications, such as bronchopneumonia and cardiac complications, were statistically insignificant. The differences are apparent, but for statistical confirmation they would normally require a larger group of patients. Similarly to the complications with the follow-up necessity of postoperative re-intervention, laparoscopy seems to be the preferred choice, with 3.6% vs. 9.2% in the case of conventionally operated patients. Even in this case, for the confirmation of a significant difference we would require a larger group.</p><p>With very low numbers of patients in leakage and exitus groups, we were unable to compare the results, although the results were similar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0013"><title>Discussion</title><p>The best parameters for comparison of the two operating techniques are mortality and morbidity. Perforated ulcer is still associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Several studies have been published, although only 3 of them are prospectively randomized [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with a high (degree of evidence). The comparison of results in the aforementioned studies shows significant differences in morbidity (22% in laparoscopy group vs. 36% in conventional group), and mortality (2.5% vs. 5.8%).</p><p>In these studies postoperative leakage occurred more frequently in the laparoscopic group (3%), versus the conventional group, with only 1.1% of operated patients with leakage [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, it is necessary to realise that laparoscopic suture closure of the perforated ulcer is a relatively complicated operation, and it requires manual skills in mini-invasive surgery.</p><p>The reason for conversion, 12.4% on average, is in most cases the size of the perforation [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additional reasons were inability to visualise the perforation, location of perforation, and bleeding.</p><p>In one of the most recent studies, there were not found any significant differences in terms of post-operative leakage from the suture closure, when the surgeons applied a single suture without omentoplasty, or with it [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Alternative options are the application of fibrin glue, which is limited by the size of the perforation, or the application of biodegradable lactide-glycolide-caprolactone patches, which are still at the stage of development.</p><p>During the recent period, we can observe a gradual cessation of the final surgical intervention (resection, pyloroplasty, vagotomy) with low re-occurrence of the ulcer disease following the eradication of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (double combination of antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitor), and elimination of NSAID usage [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Laparoscopic suture closure of the perforated gastro-duodenal ulcer performed in a centre with sufficient history in laparoscopic surgery is a safe method, which offers better results compared to conventional therapy. The potential advantages of the mini-invasive approach are as follows: better view of the trans-operative situation, limited surgical trauma, smaller operating wound, limited intestinal manipulation and earlier recovery to baseline activities [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These advantages contribute to the lower occurrence of complications, especially such as wound complications, and the method is associated with reduced postoperative pain, and the possibility of faster mobilisation. In economic terms, laparoscopy provides a shorter hospitalisation time, and last but not least, a better cosmetic outcome. Even the conclusion of the EAES consensus as of 2006 reads that in the case of suspected perforated ulcer it is recommended to apply a mini-invasive approach as a safe therapeutic method [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This has also been confirmed by available prospective randomised studies, and in our centre the laparoscopic suture closure became the option of choice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Perforated peptic ulcer.
