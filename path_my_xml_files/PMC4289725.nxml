Prophylactic radiotherapy has been used to minimise this complication; however, three small randomised trials have shown conflicting results regarding its effectiveness. The surgical and large bore procedures in malignant pleural mesothelioma and radiotherapy trial (SMART Trial) is a suitably powered, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic radiotherapy within 42&#x02005;days of pleural instrumentation in preventing the development of PTM in MPM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>203 patients with a histocytologically proven diagnosis of MPM, who have undergone a large bore pleural intervention (thoracic surgery, large bore chest drain, indwelling pleural catheter or local anaesthetic thoracoscopy) in the previous 35&#x02005;days, will be recruited from UK hospitals. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive immediate radiotherapy (21&#x02005;Gy in 3 fractions over 3 working days within 42&#x02005;days of the pleural intervention) or deferred radiotherapy (21&#x02005;Gy in 3 fractions over 3 working days given if a PTM develops). Patients will be followed up for 12&#x02005;months. The primary outcome measure is the rate of PTM until death or 12&#x02005;months (whichever is sooner), as defined by the presence of a clinically palpable nodule of at least 1&#x02005;cm diameter felt within 7&#x02005;cm of the margins of the procedure site as confirmed by two assessors.

In 2012, there were 2535 mesothelioma deaths in the UK alone and the incidence is predicted to increase.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In order to obtain a robust histological diagnosis and to manage symptomatic pleural effusions, patients commonly undergo a number of diagnostic and therapeutic pleural interventions during the disease course.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>As a complication of iatrogenic instrumentation of the pleural cavity, tumour can spread to the site of previous interventions, resulting in procedure tract metastases (PTMs), which can be intensely painful.</p><p>Mesothelioma is sensitive to radiation therapy in vitro,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but its use as a radical treatment is limited by unacceptable toxicity. However, prophylactic radiotherapy to pleural intervention sites can be given with minimal side effects and a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) was performed in 1995 by Boutin and colleagues to evaluate its efficacy. None of the 20 patients randomised to receive prophylactic radiotherapy (21&#x02005;Gy in 3 fractions over 3&#x02005;days within 15&#x02005;days of the procedure) developed a PTM, but 8 of the 20 patients (40%) in the untreated arm did.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Based on this small study, prophylactic radiotherapy to procedure tracts in mesothelioma became accepted practice worldwide.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> However, the very high rate of PTM in the control arm of the Boutin study was felt to be more than that seen in routine clinical practice, particularly for patients undergoing small bore pleural procedures such as image-guided biopsies or simple pleural fluid aspirations.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> Additionally, as prophylactic radiotherapy can be burdensome for patients so soon after their diagnosis (requiring up to 4 hospital attendances) and may be associated with some side effects, it was felt further evidence should be obtained to validate its routine clinical use.</p><p>Two further RCTs were therefore undertaken; the results of which called into question what had become routine clinical practice.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

No significant difference in the occurrence of PTM was identified (7% in the radiotherapy arm vs 10% in the control arm).</p><p>These findings were mimicked in another small UK-based RCT evaluating 21&#x02005;Gy in three fractions of radiotherapy given over 3&#x02005;days within 21&#x02005;days of the pleural intervention. Of 61 patients recruited, 7 patients (23%) developed a PTM in the radiotherapy arm, compared with 3 patients (10%) in the control arm.</p><p>These conflicting trial results have led to clinical equipoise regarding the benefits of prophylactic radiotherapy and calls from the mesothelioma community for a suitably powered RCT to conclusively establish its role.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a recent UK survey, 75% of responding centres offered prophylactic radiotherapy, but treatment protocols and patient selection varied greatly between institutions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, the advent of chemotherapy for mesothelioma<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the increasing use of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) for management of malignant pleural effusion in mesothelioma has resulted in uncertainty regarding the use of prophylactic radiotherapy in these contexts.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

One of the assessors must be a doctor who feels that clinically the nodule is a tract metastasis. The assessors will be doctors, nurses or radiographers who have read the chest wall examination standard operating procedure (SOP) (see online supplementary appendix 6) and feel confident to undertake the examination. In the event of disagreement between the assessors, they will examine the patient together to reach a consensus.</p><p>The presence or absence of PTM within 12&#x02005;months of randomisation will be compared using Fisher's exact test. This was chosen in preference to &#x02018;time-to-event&#x02019; analysis for the primary outcome analysis, as prophylactic radiotherapy is not likely to change the speed with which the events occur, but rather prevent them from occurring, thereby violating the necessary assumptions of survival models.

If major baseline imbalances between the treatment arms are identified, these may also be adjusted for in the regression models.</p><p>For missing baseline data, if the numbers are small, median imputation will be used.
