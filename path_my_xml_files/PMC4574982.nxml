These deployments can last multiple days and require firefighters to perform extended hours (i.e., 12 to 15 h) of intense, intermittent, physical work with restricted sleep opportunities between shifts (i.e., 3 to 6 h) [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Evidence suggests that individually, physical work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and sleep restriction [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] can elicit an acute inflammatory response causing the release of cytokines.</p><p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-8 facilitate an acute-phase response [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuate inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-4 cytokines display both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities that modulate inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together, these processes coordinate the body's acute inflammatory response to a stressor to maintain homeostasis of the immune system. However, severe or chronic stress exposure may exacerbate the immune response resulting in chronically elevated cytokine levels and associated adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Acute increases in IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have been observed after 5&#x02013;7 nights of sleep restricted to 4 h or 6 h per night in the laboratory, without physical work. Chronically elevated TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 levels are markers of systematic inflammation linked to negative health outcomes such cardiovascular disease (CVD) and insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels were also reported following 3-days of intense physical running training (2.5 h/day) without sleep restriction [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Chronically elevated IL-8 levels are also associated with atherogenesis and inflammatory changes that may result in CVD [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a field setting, Main et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported increased IL-6 across a shift of physical wildfire work without sleep disruption. However, firefighters&#x02019; IL-6 levels, along with IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8 and IL-4 all exhibited an attenuated response across the second shift, possibly indicative of an adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>While firefighting literature is sparse, multi-day military and exercise-based studies have reported an increase [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], decrease [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or fluctuation in IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Increased, unchanged or fluctuations in IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 levels were also reported among soldiers completing seven consecutive days of physical work with minimal sleep (e.g., 7 h total) [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Though it is possible the inflammatory markers in these field-based studies were confounded by other stressors (e.g., fluid and energy intake), an attenuated or unchanged cytokine response to these demands may indicate a non-damaging regulatory response. For instance, the immunomodulatory properties of IL-6 modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that underpin systemic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The immune system also interacts with cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], found to increase during simulated wildland firefighting work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. An acute increase in cortisol can down-regulate cytokine activity to maintain homeostasis of the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While military- and exercise-based research provide some understanding of the effect of physical work and sleep loss on cytokine responses, the demands investigated differ to the sleep restriction and physical work involved in wildfire suppression. Extrapolation of findings to wildland firefighting could, therefore, under- or over-estimate any stress-related implications.</p><p>Military-based research mostly investigated long duration marching and running [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], whereas wildland firefighting work incorporates a large component of short-duration weight bearing manual handling tasks, in addition to sustained aerobic activity [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Given that eccentric contractions are known to produce a more pronounced increase of IL-6 and IL-8 compared to concentric contractions [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], military-based findings could lead to under-estimates of the cytokine response for wildfire personnel. Furthermore, total sleep deprivation is associated with a greater elevation in IL-6 than partial sleep restriction [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The almost complete sleep restriction examined in military-based studies [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] could over-estimate the cytokine response for firefighters who report 3 to 6 h of sleep per night [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Under- or over-estimating inflammation could lead to inappropriate recommendations regarding the management of risk associated with firefighter&#x02019;s sleep during deployments. The aim of the present study was therefore, to assess the effect restricted sleep has on wildland firefighters&#x02019; inflammatory cytokine levels during 3 days and 2 nights of simulated physical firefighting work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>Male and female volunteer and salaried firefighters from fire agencies across Australia were recruited for this study. Participants were screened and excluded from the study if they had been diagnosed with any form of heart disease, diabetes, respiratory or sleep disorders. Participants were then randomly assigned to either a control (CON) or sleep restriction (SR) condition. For purposes of analysis, participants in each condition were then matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). There were no differences with regards to age, firefighting experience and BMI between conditions (<xref rid="pone.0138128.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants also completed pre- and post-testing health questionnaires to exclude any participants who became ill or sustained an injury directly prior to or during testing that could influence the inflammatory markers measured and confound any subsequent comparisons.

Each of these tasks was designed to mimic the different physical demands involved in wildfire suppression [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Each have been recognised by incumbent firefighters and industry experts as being representative of repetitive movements and carry and drag movements that encompass key firefighting tasks frequently performed on the fire-ground [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The tasks included; lateral repositioning of a hose, rake-hoe work, hose rolling, charged hose advance, black out hose work, and static hold of a hose. These tasks were chosen because they were: 1) deemed to have the highest operational importance 2) the most physically demanding; and 3) the longest, most intense, or most frequently occurring tasks during wildfire suppression work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Although performance of the physical tasks is not the focus of this study, it is possible the performance during the circuit (i.e., repetitions completed for each task) could interact with the cytokine responses and vice versa. Therefore, performance was recorded, but no significant differences in this component were demonstrated between conditions (findings reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]), therefore it is unlikely physical performance had an impact on the cytokine response.

Some studies suggest that, due to a small local inflammatory response to the action of the pinprick, capillary blood samples can result in higher cytokine levels [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Prior to sample collection, participants held a heat pack in their hand to aid in blood flow to the fingertips. At every time point, a 500-&#x003bc;L sample of whole blood was taken from each participant in to a microtainer coated with K<sub>2</sub> EDTA (Becton Dickinson ref: 365974). This process took between 1 and 10 minutes to complete and was the same in both conditions.

The assay was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions on the Bioplex 200 array reader (V.5.0, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

For repeated cytokine measurements, linear mixed models (LMM) were fitted by the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The LMM approach was used to investigate if participants&#x02019; individual profiles for each cytokine differed between conditions. This method also allows for the possibility of autocorrelation in the repeated cytokine measurements (i.e., samples and/or days) on each individual by including a model for the covariance structure. In addition, differences between the conditions in their linear trends and deviations from linearity were investigated via the incorporation of smoothing splines [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Model fit was assessed by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and small differences (&#x00394;AIC) in this criterion compared to the minimum observed value in a set of candidate models were used to identify parsimonious models [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Finally, the REML procedure [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] was used to determine if a common spline was adequate to describe any non-linearity or if separate splines for each group or individual splines were required.

While there were no differences in the performance of physical firefighting tasks between conditions, Vincent et al.

A greater amount of physical activity in the CON condition during the rest periods and the work periods [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] may have resulted in elevated IL-8 levels.</p><p>The unaltered IL-8 levels in the SR condition are consistent with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. IL-8 is a bio-marker for cardiovascular health and accumulating evidence links chronically high levels of IL-8 with pathways that may increase the risk of CVD [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

Sleep restricted to between 2 and 6-h per night over 5&#x02013;10 nights, without physical work, has resulted in increased daytime levels of IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

This may indicate that physical work was the major stressor in the current study. In contrast to our findings, Abedelmalek and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported an increase in IL-6 following a 4-h sleep restriction period and four, 250-metre runs on a treadmill at 80% of personal maximal speed. In comparison to the self-paced work in our firefighting simulation, fixed speed work investigated by Abedelmalek et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], although shorter, may have subjected participants to a higher intensity effort. Greater physical demands in combination with sleep restriction may explain why different IL-6 responses were observed between studies. Moreover, while similar durations of sleep restriction were investigated, Abedelmalek et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] examined an early phase sleep opportunity (22:30&#x02013;03:00). Wu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found 4 nights of 3-h early phase sleep restriction caused a larger reduction in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep compared with later-night sleep restriction. Research in animal models indicates that a reduced amount of REM sleep had a positive association with increased IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Firefighting and other occupations (e.g., air crew, train and truck drivers) can require personnel to start work early in the morning, often causing truncated, early sleep phases [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Accordingly, future research needs to determine how early phase sleep restriction, and the associated changes in sleep architecture, impact the immune system of firefighters&#x02019; and workers in similar occupations completing physical work.</p><p>Morning IL-6 levels in both conditions increased from day 1 to day 3 of testing (<xref rid="pone.0138128.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This finding is in line with Gunderson and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who reported increased morning IL-6 levels among soldiers completing a 7-day training exercise with restricted sleep (1 h sleep per 24 h). However, the reported 11- and 7-fold increase in soldiers&#x02019; IL-6 levels from day 1 to day 2 and day 4 respectively [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], were higher than the 2-fold increase observed in the current study. The larger increase in soldiers&#x02019; IL-6 levels [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] could be explained by the long duration semi-continuous physical work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and extreme sleep restriction [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] they experienced, which are different to the intermittent physical work and partial sleep restriction typical for wildland firefighting [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and simulated in the current study. While the observed changes in IL-6 (i.e., 1.9&#x02013;2.5 pg/mL, <xref rid="pone.0138128.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0138128.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) are toward the low-end of systematic inflammation levels [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], evidence suggests that similar levels of low-grade inflammation in IL-6, if chronic, are sufficient to increase the risk of adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For instance, IL-6 &#x0003e;2.19 pg/mL was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (cardiovascular diseases, cancers and other causes) among older adults across a 9-year period [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Findings from a 6-year study [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] showed that among healthy men at baseline, IL-6 levels were higher (1.81 pg/mL) in those who experienced a subsequent myocardial infarction. While firefighters in the USA appear to have a high risk of CHD-related deaths on duty [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], research in Australia is yet to investigate if firefighting demands are associated with cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to understand if wildland firefighters&#x02019; IL-6 levels are elevated chronically in response to repeated firefighting deployments across a fire season and over multiple fire seasons. Finally, IL-6 and IL-8 can induce white blood cell production [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and it has been speculated that increased cytokines are responsible for heightened cell counts in cardiovascular disease and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Therefore, it is important future longitudinal studies assess cytokine and blood cell differentials to determine how multiple immune responses interact and potentially impact on health.</p><p>Though the change in IL-6 levels was small, there was a significant increase in levels from day 1 to day 3 in both conditions at 06:15 and from day 1 to day 2 in the CON condition at 11:30 (<xref rid="pone.0138128.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). While previous firefighting-based research found no change in IL-6 following short bouts of physical work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], the findings from the current study support exercise and military literature demonstrating significant increases in IL-6 over successive days of both continuous [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and intermittent [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] physical training. Physical work duration and intensity play a role in regulating IL-6 release [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Accumulating physical work output/performance across the three days may have contributed to the parallel rise in IL-6 levels in both conditions.</p><p>Low or depleted glycogen stores have been associated with an increased immune response following periods of long duration physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], which could explain the increased IL-6 response on day 3 in both conditions. While intense periods of physical work can reduce appetite [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], the findings for the SR condition appear in contrast to reports that sleep loss may alter appetite regulation and lead to increased carbohydrate consumption [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, the impact of sleep restriction on food intake has been largely investigated in the absence of physical work. In addition, previous energy restriction- and exercise-based studies that have specifically examined macronutrient intake and immune changes [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] indicate that very low levels of carbohydrate (&#x0003c;10% of total energy intake from carbohydrates) during physical activity, with and without sleep loss, are necessary to elicit an acute immune response. In the current study, firefighters&#x02019; carbohydrate levels were higher in comparison to these studies (56% and 55% of total energy intake from carbohydrates on day 3 in SR and CON respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and remained within normal adult levels [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. It is therefore unlikely the lower carbohydrate intake among participants contributed to increased IL-6 levels on day 3. Further, while a high caffeine intake has been shown to increase IL-6 during physical activity (3 to 6 mg/kg body weight) [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], intakes in the current study were much lower (SR 2 mg/kg body weight, CON 1 mg/kg body weight).</p><p>Consistent with multi-day exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], firefighters&#x02019; IL-6 levels increased across the simulation. Lundeland et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Gunderson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that during a 7-day military training course with minimal sleep, IL-6 levels also increased to day 3 and day 4 respectively, but then decreased towards baseline. Following an increase in IL-6 across the first day of live wildfire suppression work, Main et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] also found IL-6 levels to attenuate over the second day of work. In addition to pro-inflammatory activities, IL-6 has anti-inflammatory properties that lower other pro-inflammatory cytokines to return the immune system to homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, data suggests that an increased IL-6 response during exercise can exert anti-inflammatory effects that inhibit TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The increased levels of IL-6 among firefighters in the current study may have acted to suppress the release of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, resulting in declining levels of these cytokines across the day (<xref rid="pone.0138128.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Similar to IL-6, the IL-4 cytokine is immunomodulatory and therefore capable of exerting anti-inflammatory effects that inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, increased IL-4 in the evening and at night may further explain the fall in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="pone.0138128.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, compared to the inflammatory response typically related to exercise, severe inflammation (e.g., sepsis) has been associated with a distinctively different cascade of cytokines in the circulation (i.e., TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in that order) [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, increased levels of immunomodulatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-4 among firefighters in the current study, without an increase in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; levels, could indicate a non-damaging response to the stress of the simulated physical firefighting.</p><p>The bidirectional feedback loop between cytokines and cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] may further explain the acute increase in IL-6 in the current study. Previously we demonstrated that 3 days of physical firefighting work separated by 2 nights of restricted sleep, resulted in an increased cortisol response over successive days of work [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings indicate that the body may be releasing more cortisol to compensate for the added stress of limited sleep while performing physical work. In turn, the increased release of cortisol may be exerting its anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and buffering the release of IL-6 in the SR condition. Given that cortisol may down-regulate proteins required for immune cell activation of IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], higher cortisol levels previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] may result in greater inhibition of the IL-8 response among sleep restricted participants. To date, cortisol-induced anti-inflammatory effects for IL-8 have only been demonstrated in lipopolysaccharide (i.e., bacteria)-induced cytokine release [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, further research is needed to determine if cortisol has the same mediating impact on plasma IL-8 in response to physical work and sleep restriction. However, the potential for cortisol-induced suppression of IL-6 and possibly IL-8, suggests that the firefighters&#x02019; physiological stress-related changes were functioning effectively to maintain homeostasis of the immune system in response to simulated firefighting work with sleep restriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first wildland firefighting-based study to investigate the effect of sleep restriction and physical work on acute inflammatory stress responses. Findings demonstrate higher levels of IL-8 among participants who received an 8-h sleep each night when compared to those who had a restricted 4-h sleep. Participants&#x02019; IL-6 levels increased in both conditions suggesting that the sleep restriction duration and/or period may not have been a significant enough stressor to affect this cytokine over and above any disturbance caused by physical work. Considering the immunomodulatory properties of IL-6 and IL-4 [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the increase of these cytokines and the simultaneous decrease in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, could indicate a non-damaging response to the stress of simulated physical firefighting work. However, given the link between chronic low-level inflammation of IL-6 and IL-8, and several diseases such as atherosclerosis and Type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0138128.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138128.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], further research is needed to determine if wildland firefighters&#x02019; IL-6 and IL-8 levels are chronically elevated following repeated firefighting deployments across a fire season and over multiple fire seasons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138128.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Pairwise comparison of predicted REML means for logged IL-6 profile between days and within the same condition and time of day.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138128.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre for providing the financial support for this project.
