No economic evaluation of WEPDs against any comparator has ever been conducted. The aim of the paper was to assess whether WEPDs are cost-effective in reducing SSI compared to standard care alone in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>An economic evaluation was conducted alongside the ROSSINI trial. The study perspective was that of the UK National Health Service and the time horizon was 30 days post-operatively. The study was conducted in 21 UK hospitals. 760 patients undergoing laparotomy were randomised to either WEPD or standard care and 735 were included in the primary analysis. The main economic outcome was cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost (&#x000a3;) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Patients in the WEPD arm accessed health care worth &#x000a3;5,420 on average and gained 0.02131 QALYs, compared to &#x000a3;5,130 and 0.02133 QALYs gained in the standard care arm. The WEPD strategy was more costly and equally effective compared to standard care, but there was significant uncertainty around incremental costs and QALYs. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is no evidence to suggest that WEPDs can be considered a cost effective device to reduce SSI. Their continued use is a waste of limited health care resources.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research; Research for Patient Benefit programme (PB-PG-1208-18234).

Development of an SSI significantly impacts upon patient mortality and morbidity as well as healthcare costs <xref rid="pone.0095595-Mangram1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the United Kingdom (UK), hospital length of stay is typically doubled and additional per-patient costs of up to &#x000a3;10,000 have been estimated, the variability depending upon the type and site of surgery and the severity of the infection <xref rid="pone.0095595-Coello1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095595-Tanner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Wound-edge protection devices (WEPDs) have been used for more than forty years to reduce SSI by creating a physical barrier between the abdominal wound edges and viscera, visceral contents, contaminated instruments and gloves, thereby reducing accumulation of endogenous and exogenous bacteria on the wound edges. Evidence on the clinical effectiveness of WEPDs has been unclear: two systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggested that WEPD may be effective in the reduction of SSI <xref rid="pone.0095595-Gheorghe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095595-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, although the quality of the including RCTs was low. To date there is no published evidence on the cost effectiveness of WEPDs.</p><p>The objective of the ROSSINI (Reduction of Surgical Site Infection using a Novel Intervention) trial was to explore the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WEPD in reducing SSI after laparotomy. In this paper we report the results of the economic evaluation conducted alongside ROSSINI which compared the relative cost-effectiveness of WEPD compared to standard care from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The economic evaluation is reported in accordance with the CHEERS Statement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095595.s003">Appendix S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095595.s001">Protocol S1</xref>) and recruitment flow chart are presented as supplementary information.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The trial protocol <xref rid="pone.0095595-Pinkney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> was approved before the study began by the National Research Ethics Service (09/H1204/91; North Staffordshire Committee) and the research and development team at each hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment on paper forms approved by the aforementioned ethics body. ROSSINI was registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 40402832).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>The full report on the trial has been reported elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0095595-PinkneyThomas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Briefly, the trial was a prospective, multicentre, observer blinded, randomised controlled trial with stratification according to baseline infection risk. Randomisation was performed when the patient was in the anaesthetic room immediately before surgery using a centralised secure web system provided by the University of Birmingham. Randomisation was stratified according to the urgency of surgery, likelihood of opening a viscus, and likelihood of creating a stoma, with the use of a minimisation procedure. The trial was conducted between February 2010 and January 2012 at 21 NHS hospitals across the UK. The cost-effectiveness analysis was pre-specified in the trial protocol <xref rid="pone.0095595-Pinkney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The objective of the economic evaluation was to explore the relative cost-effectiveness of WEPD compared to standard care. Cost, resource use and outcome data in terms of QALYs were collected prospectively for both arms of the trial. Costs and QALYs for the WEPD intervention are compared to results of the standard care arm and incremental costs and incremental QALYs are calculated as the difference in costs and QALYs, respectively, between the WEPD arm and the standard care arm. When appropriate, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the ratio of incremental costs (&#x000a3;) to incremental effects (QALY). In this case, the ICER (&#x000a3;/QALY) represents the cost of obtaining an additional QALY when switching from standard care to WEPDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Setting and Perspective</title><p>The trial-based evaluation took a health care provider perspective and thus considered only cost centres relevant for the NHS and Personal Social Services. The intervention under scrutiny was the use of a WEPD during surgery in addition to standard care. The comparator was no WEPD use, i.e. standard care alone. In order to enhance the generalisability of the trial, the surgical teams were given the liberty to use retraction and SSI prophylactic procedures of their choice. The time horizon was 30 days post-operatively, in accordance with SSI monitoring in the English NHS <xref rid="pone.0095595-Health1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Given the short time horizon, no discounting was applied to either costs or outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Health outcomes, preference-based outcomes and resource use data were collected from the participating sites using custom designed paper-based case report forms (CRFs), which were completed by patients or trial staff, as appropriate, at each site then managed centrally at the Centre for Clinical Trials at the University of Birmingham.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Health Utility</title><p>We recorded health-related quality of life using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire (the English three-level response version and validated for use in the UK, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095595.s004">Appendix S2</xref>), a standardised generic preference based instrument that describes a patient&#x02019;s health status using a single index value <xref rid="pone.0095595-The1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We used EQ-5D in this study because of its relevance for the UK policy makers, particularly the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) <xref rid="pone.0095595-National1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We administered the EQ-5D instrument to patients in ROSSINI at baseline (prior to surgery) and on two occasions post-operatively. We conducted the first assessment in clinic, after the patient provided informed consent and before randomisation. We performed the second assessment (5 to 7 days) on the hospital ward if still inpatient or at discharge, as applicable. We performed the third assessment (30 to 33 days) on the hospital ward if still inpatient or, more often, in the outpatient clinic on the occasion of the scheduled follow-up visit. Only the baseline and third assessment (30 to 33 days) were used to calculate QALYs; the 5&#x02013;7 days assessment was employed in the multiple imputation algorithms for missing EQ-5D scores at the final assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Resource Utilisation</title><p>We collected data on resource utilisation of health care resources prospectively in both secondary and primary care settings using the custom designed CRFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095595.s004">Appendix S2</xref>). Hospital utilisation items were completed by health care staff and primary care utilisation items were completed by patients in clinic at the 30-day visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Unit Costs</title><p>Unit costs were valued in &#x000a3; (2011 value). The cost of the intervention (WEPD) was obtained from the manufacturer <xref rid="pone.0095595-3M1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Inpatient care resource items were sourced from the NHS Reference Costs data <xref rid="pone.0095595-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095595-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Medication unit costs were taken from the British National Formulary 2011 <xref rid="pone.0095595-Joint1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. All unit costs were average national costs. Consistent with the NHS perspective, only resource use affecting the NHS budget were considered. Total resource costs were obtained by summation of the individual resource costs for each category of resource item accessed by trial patients. Individual resource costs were obtained by multiplying the resource use by the corresponding unit costs.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>In the base-case analysis we included all the patients with complete primary outcome data. Any missing cost and health utility data, as well as patient-level characteristics, were imputed using the multiple imputations using chained equations method (MICE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095595.s005">Appendix S3</xref>). The analysis included descriptive statistics for the resource use items, resource costs (both at aggregate and individual level) and EQ-5D scores. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the utility weight associated with each individual health state and the time spent in that health state. QALYs were calculated based on the baseline and 30-day EQ-5D assessments and were adjusted for baseline utility <xref rid="pone.0095595-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The average differences in costs and outcomes, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around the point estimates, were calculated using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) non-parametric bootstrap with 1,000 replications <xref rid="pone.0095595-Briggs1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The resulting incremental costs and effects were plotted on the cost-effectiveness plane, a visual decision-aiding tool representing the incremental costs and effects of the intervention under evaluation relative to the next best option <xref rid="pone.0095595-Black1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were plotted, indicating the probability of each of the two alternatives to be cost-effective at varying thresholds of the decision makers&#x02019; willingness to pay for an additional unit of outcome <xref rid="pone.0095595-Fenwick1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were performed to check the robustness of cost-effectiveness findings, as follows: a complete case analysis based on trial subjects with complete primary outcome, cost and EQ-5D data (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;532); and adjusted analyses for both base-case and complete case scenarios, where differences between the trial&#x02019;s arms were investigated using generalized linear models. Total costs and EQ-5D scores were regressed against the following pre-specified covariates: intervention group, baseline utility (only for adjusting incremental QALYs), plan to create a stoma, plan to create a viscus (defined as any internal organ), elective/emergency surgery, age, body mass index, diabetes, current smoking status and SSI. The total cost and QALY values were regressed against the variables above using generalised linear models with an identity link <xref rid="pone.0095595-Dobson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A gamma distribution was assumed for costs and a normal distribution was assumed for QALYs. The analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 <xref rid="pone.0095595-Eborall1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and R 2.15.3 software <xref rid="pone.0095595-R1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>ROSSINI randomised 760 patients undergoing open abdominal surgery between the use of WEPD during and standard care. 735 patients were included in the primary analysis, of which 369 patients received the intervention and 366 patients received standard care. There was no evidence of benefit for WEPDs in terms of SSI reduction (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.36) or hospital length of stay <xref rid="pone.0095595-Pinkney2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In total 20 patients died within 30 days of surgery: 12 in the control group and eight in the intervention group. For those patients who died within 30 days of surgery we carried forward the last available wound assessment, unless no information was available in which case they were treated as lost to follow-up.</p><p>

However, district nurses are the health care professional most likely to apply the wound dressings in a primary care setting and ROSSINI arms were more than comparable regarding the number of district nurse visits, which reduces the potential effect of not costing wound dressings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095595-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The uncertainty around the point estimates of incremental costs and QALYs, reflected in the width of the confidence intervals, is considerable. However, it is very unlikely that the ROSSINI trial was underpowered: the pre-specified sample size in the statistical analysis plan (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;750), based on the best available evidence to date, assumed a 50% reduction in SSI and a 12% SSI rate in the study population. This suggests there may be a large amount of variability in the cost and QALY gains associated with the use of the WEPD. In support of this hypothesis, the primary outcome also exhibited considerable uncertainty (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.36).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Relation to other Studies</title><p>We have no knowledge of economic evaluations of WEPDs, but there are published data on SSI costs. The most recent study on the costs SSI care in a primary setting in the UK collected data on 29 SSI patients following colorectal surgery and found that primary care costs amount to about 15% of total SSI costs (on average &#x000a3;1,563 out of &#x000a3;10,523 per SSI patient), thus suggesting that the largest part of the SSI cost burden comes from inpatient care <xref rid="pone.0095595-Tanner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This is compatible with ROSSINI findings: primary care cost accounted for less than 10% of total costs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095595-t004">Table 4</xref>). However, Tanner <italic>et al.</italic> reported total and average resource use and costs, respectively, without any mention of the variability around these quantities. Variability is an important aspect, as illustrated in the older study of Davey <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0095595-Davey1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>: out of seven patients with a SSI in primary care, one patient alone received 57 district nurse visits, another patient received two visits and the rest no visit at all.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ROSSINI trial has shown WEPDs to be neither effective nor cost-effective in reducing SSI compared to standard care. This contradicts previous evidence, which suggested that WEPDs may be effective. ROSSINI is the largest and most robust trial investigating WEPDs to date and the first to have a pre-specified integral economic evaluation. WEPDs have been used to date at the surgeons&#x02019; discretion in the NHS to reduce SSI but there are no official data on the WEPD utilisation and, as such, the current NHS spending on WEPDs cannot be estimated. Our analyses suggest that the use of WEPDs for SSI reduction cannot be justified and should be discontinued.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s003"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>CHEERS Statement checklist for the ROSSINI within-trial economic evaluation.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s004"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p>Case report forms used to capture resource use in the ROSSINI trial.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s005"><label>Appendix S3</label><caption><p>Details of the multiple imputation exercise.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0095595.s006"><label>Appendix S4</label><caption><p>ROSSINI trial: summary of resource use by treatment group, overview.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0095595.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Contributors</title><p>
