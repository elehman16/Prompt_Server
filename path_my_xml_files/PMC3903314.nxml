Physical performance was assessed using HR responses to a submaximal run, a Yo-Yo Intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR1) and a 20&#x02005;m sprint. Most measures were performed daily, with the exception of Yo-YoIR1 and 20&#x02005;m sprints, which were performed near sea level and on days 3 and 10 at altitude.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with near sea level, Australians had moderate-to-large impairments in wellness and Yo-YoIR1 relative to the Bolivians on arrival at altitude. The acclimatisation of most measures to altitude was substantially slower in Australians than Bolivians, with only Bolivians reaching near sea-level baseline high-intensity running by the end of the camp. Both teams had moderately impaired 20&#x02005;m sprinting at the end of the camp. Exercise HR had large associations (r&#x0003e;0.5&#x02013;0.7) with changes in Yo-YoIR1 in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite partial physiological and perceptual acclimatisation, 2&#x02005;weeks is insufficient for restoration of physical performance in young sea-level native soccer players. Because of the possible decrement in 20&#x02005;m sprint time, a greater emphasis on speed training may be required during and after altitude training. The specific time course of restoration for each variable suggests that they measure different aspects of acclimatisation to 3600&#x02005;m; they should therefore be used in combination to assess adaptation to altitude.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>International soccer matches may be played at a high altitude.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and also assists the ability to repeat high-intensity efforts.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While the optimal time of arrival prematch has received very limited consideration,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> it is generally recommended to arrive &#x0223c;2&#x02005;weeks before competition to allow partial acclimatisation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For instance, 6&#x02005;days of acclimatisation at 1600&#x02005;m was insufficient to avoid impaired match running performance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Since the time required for acclimatisation is likely altitude-dependent,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> longer periods may be required for matches played at higher altitudes.</p><p>Altitude training camps are also used to increase sea-level physical performance.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, little is known about player tolerance to those camps.

A need also exists to identify the most useful tools for monitoring these changes.</p><p>The use of wellness questionnaires to monitor training responses has grown exponentially.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There is also growing interest for heart rate variability (HRV) measures<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

Whether these measures can also be used successfully in the context of a high-altitude training camp is however still unknown, as is whether these measures are equally useful for sea-level versus high-altitude natives.</p><p>The primary aim of the present study was to examine the time course of wellness, fatigue and performance markers during a high-altitude training camp in sea-level and altitude native soccer players.

This recovery rate was faster than that reported at 4500&#x02005;m,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and likely related to the lower altitude. The time course of HRrest and resting HRV was actually similar to that of SpO<sub>2</sub> in the present study, which increased after the first week.

Because of the limited reliability of RPE responses to submaximal runs (&#x0003e;30%<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) in comparison with HR (3%), RPE is likely less sensitive to slight changes in exercise intensity. It is also possible that the increase in cardiovascular work (ie, &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5% for HR) at this low relative intensity was not large enough to affect perception of effort. In contrast, RPE response may be more related to ventilatory response, which takes a few days to normalise.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Surprisingly however, the Bolivians and not the Australians, had the greater HRV changes, suggestive of greater autonomic perturbation. These results may reflect a limitation of HRV measures to accurately assess cardiac autonomic function in the present setting, at least in high-altitude native players examined near-sea-level. Since an increased blood volume decreases HR and increases HRV,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the fluid alterations observed in the Bolivians<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> could have triggered parasympathetic activity further than its actual resting level.

While this initial difference could be related to carry-over effects of international travel, and acknowledging that data on external load (eg, distance covered at different speeds assessed through GPS) would be required to fully characterise training load in both groups, the doubling of the between-group standardised difference at altitude suggests a direct effect of altitude on the perceived exertion for the non-acclimatised players. This hypothesis is confirmed by the greater RPE increase in response to the submaximal run at altitude in the Australians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092749F2">figure 2</xref>).

While it is impossible to quantify the magnitude of these possible effects on players' initial physical performance, these effects were accounted for in the analysis (see Statistical analysis section).

While a possible neuromuscular fatigue (alteration in central drive or even a peripheral limitation due to chronic hypoxic stress) could also explain the impaired sprint performance, all wellness scores, including perceived fatigue and general muscle soreness remained stable after the acute acclimatisation period. Additionally, if fatigue occurred, it is likely that HRrest and HRV would also have changed accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Monitoring changes in physical performance at altitude</title><p>HRex was the only variable that had trends comparable to those of Yo-YoIR1 performance in the Australian players (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BJSPORTS2013092749TB1">table 1</xref>), that is, increased on arrival and did not return to baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJSPORTS2013092749F2">figure 2</xref>).
