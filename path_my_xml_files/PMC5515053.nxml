To be selected, participants had no IAS-USA-defined resistance, HIV-1 RNA &#x02264;100,000 copies/mL at screening and negative HBsAg. Plasma viral load (pVL) was measured at baseline; days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28; weeks 6, 8 and 12; and thereafter every 12&#x000a0;weeks up to 96&#x000a0;weeks. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL in an intention to treat (ITT)-exposed analysis at 48&#x000a0;weeks (the FDA snapshot algorithm).</p><p><bold>Results</bold>: Median HIV-1 RNA at entry was 24,128 copies/mL (interquartile range (IQR): 11,686&#x02013;36,794). Albeit as per protocol, all patients had pVL &#x02264;100,000 copies/mL at screening as required by inclusion criteria, four patients had &#x02265;100,000 copies/mL at baseline. Median baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 507 per cubic millimetre (IQR: 296&#x02013;517). A rapid decline in pVL was observed (median VL decay from baseline to week 12 was 2.74 logs). All patients were suppressed at week 8 onwards up to week 24. At week 48, 90% (18/20) reached the primary endpoint of a pVL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL. Median change in CD4 cell count between baseline and week 48 was 267 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR: 180&#x02013;462). No major tolerability/toxicity issues were observed. Nineteen patients completed 48&#x000a0;weeks of the study, and one patient (with undetectable VL at last visit) committed suicide. One patient presented a low-level protocol-defined confirmed virological failure at week 36, being the only observed failure. This patient had pVL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL at the end-of-study visit without having changed the two-drug regimen. Observed failure rate was 5%.

Soon after, two-drug combination became the preferred strategy, as ZDV effects lasted only for the short term, due to selection of resistance mutations. Unfortunately, the dual strategy also failed in achieving long-lasting virologic control. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing three active drugs from at least two different classes has been the standard of care for HIV treatment all over the world since 1996, based on the findings of two seminal studies [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Expansion of access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has been the main driver of a striking 38% decline in HIV incidence and a 35% reduction in AIDS-associated mortality since 2000 [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend first-line ARV regimens consisting of two nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as a &#x0201c;backbone&#x0201d; combined with a third agent from the non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, the boosted protease inhibitor (PI), or the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) classes. Over the past two decades, novel drugs for ART have improved the rates of long-term viral suppression, but even the most widely used regimens might result in treatment modification or interruption because of tolerability, toxicities or issues like challenging treatment schedules, drug interactions and food requirements [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To reduce toxicity, complexity, and costs, strategies that decrease the number of active drugs have been evaluated, both as initial therapy and as maintenance therapy for patients who achieved virologic suppression. Most efforts have yielded unacceptable high rates of treatment failure [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A two-drug regimen with a boosted PI plus lamivudine (3TC) has demonstrated favourable results in treatment-naive patients. The GARDEL study was the first to show non-inferiority of a dual combination of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) plus 3TC, even in patients with baseline viral load (VL) above 100,000 copies/mL [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other three studies showed non-inferior virologic efficacy of the same dual regimen or the combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus 3TC, all performed in virologically suppressed patients as a switch strategy [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent INSTI, exhibiting rapid reduction in VL and a high barrier to resistance. DTG is a QD drug, well tolerated, that can be taken with or without food [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with a low potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and a high genetic barrier [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Comparison with other preferred first-line drugs showed non-inferiority of DTG to raltegravir and superiority to efavirenz (EFV) and darunavir (DRV) in the randomized clinical trials SPRING, SINGLE and FLAMINGO, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Lamivudine (3TC) is a potent cytidine nucleoside analogue without major side effects, and it has a well-proven safety profile. In monotherapy, it has shown VL reduction up to 1.19 log [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has a low genetic barrier selecting, in case of failure, the M184V mutation, which has been linked to a reduction in viral fitness [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This NRTI is also a QD drug, it can also be administered with or without food and no clinically relevant drug&#x02013;drug interactions have been reported with its use [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of a two-drug regimen with DTG 50&#x000a0;mg QD plus 3TC 300&#x000a0;mg QD as initial HAART among ARV-naive patients.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>PADDLE is an ongoing pilot study involving HIV-1-infected patients naive to ARV treatment.

The Abbott Real-Time HIV-1 assay was used to detect the HIV-1 RNA plasma level (lower limit of detection, 40 copies per millilitre). Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory measurements (including haematological measurements, fasting lipid profile and blood-chemistry profile) were assessed intermittently throughout the study, and their severity graded according to the criteria of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. Specifically, safety evaluations were completed as follows: AEs and concomitant medications on all visits and laboratory parameters and vital signs on screening, baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Viral genotype was analysed (TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit) at the screening visit and had to be obtained at time of protocol-defined virologic failure (PDVF) defined as VL &#x02265;1000 copies/mL at week 12, VL &#x02265;400 copies/mL at week 24 or 36 or a confirmed viral rebound (&#x0003e;200 c/mL) after VL &#x0003c;50 c/mL.</p><p>Participants were required to withdraw from the study if PDVF was confirmed.

The GARDEL study was the first one to demonstrate non-inferiority of a dual therapy compared to triple therapy at 48 and 96&#x000a0;weeks [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An INSTI dual regimen of DRV and raltegravir (RAL) showed non-inferiority compared to a DRV triple therapy, but failed to do so in critical populations, like patients with pVL above 100,000 copies/mL and CD4 counts below 200 cells/mL [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A potential explanation of these results could be the requirement of two separated doses of RAL, while DRV was dosed once daily, which could have impaired adherence. The results of the PADDLE study provide further evidence that the potency required to achieve viral suppression does not necessarily mean the use of a three-drug ARV combination. Regarding the primary endpoint, 90% of the study population had undetectable pVL at week 48. Of note, all patients, including those with baseline pVL above 100,000 copies/mL had a rapid viral suppression that matches the one seen in other studies combining DTG with two NRTIs. Compared to SINGLE and SPRING studies, VL decay did not reveal any differences between treatments [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The patient that presented the only SAE (suicide) achieved pVL below 50 copies/mL at week 2 and remained so until his last visit on week 24. HIV and/or HAART have been previously related to suicidality. A nationwide Swiss study showed that in 2008, suicide rates in HIV-infected individuals were more than three times higher than the rates of the general population [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a voluntary testing and counselling centre in South Africa, the investigators found that a significantly elevated risk of suicidal ideation was found in 83.1% of the patients who tested seropositive [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>EFV relationship with suicidality has been studied with divergent conclusions, ranging from a twofold increased hazard of suicidality compared with a regimen without EFV to no increased risk at all [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With DTG, events of suicidal ideation, attempt or behaviour have been reported in less than 2% of ARV treatment-naive or ARV treatment-experienced patients in eight registrational clinical trials (SPRING-1, SPRING-2, SINGLE, FLAMINGO, SAILING, VIKING, VIKING-3 and VIKING-4). These events were observed primarily in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness. Suicidal ideation is quoted in RAL and elvitegravir package inserts among the less common adverse reactions observed in treatment-experienced studies [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The relationship of our patient&#x02019;s suicide with DTG cannot be absolutely ruled out, albeit our patient had at least two stressful and traumatic life events, as we found out retrospectively, and this could be the explanation for his tragic decision.</p><p>Through week 48, one patient met the criteria for <bold>PDVF</bold> (confirmed viral rebound above 50 copies after being undetectable). Therefore, the primary analysis shows 90% of the patients with pVL &#x0003c;50 copies in the ITT-exposed, FDA snapshot analysis. Observed failure, as the patient who committed suicide had undetectable pVL at last visit, was 5%.</p><p>The clinical implications of low-level viremia are controversial. Department of Human Health Services (DHHS) ARV guidelines define virologic failure as the inability to achieve or maintain suppression of viral replication to an HIV-RNA level &#x0003c;200 copies/mL and state that viremia &#x0201c;blips&#x0201d; are not usually associated with subsequent virologic failure [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our study has some limitations. As a pilot proof-of-concept trial, it has a small sample size. Given that this dual regimen has been never tested before, we preferred a cautious design, treating first a cohort of 10 patients, and recruiting the second cohort when initial success was achieved, as pre-defined in the study protocol. Other limitations include being an open-label study, with a single arm and a low median VL at entry, albeit four of the volunteers had baseline pVL above 100,000 copies/mL.</p><p>A limitation for using this dual regimen is that patients with active hepatitis B infection (HBV) would not be eligible, as HBV would be exposed to 3TC monotherapy, which is no longer the standard-of-care for that infection. Universal HBV vaccination is encouraged as a public health intervention, regardless of the ARV strategy selected. Special populations like pregnant women and patients with active tuberculosis were excluded, hence this strategy cannot be considered for those populations until specific studies are completed. Nevertheless, the PADDLE study strategy might potentially address several unmet needs. First, toxicities associated with NRTIs other than 3TC may compromise lifelong exposures to those compounds. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) lowers bone density more than other NRTIs and can be nephrotoxic [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Abacavir can induce a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome, and only patients who are negative for the HLA-B*5701 allele can be treated with this drug. Also, it has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, albeit other studies failed to confirm this association [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The new tenofovir alafenamide formulation (TAF) has shown similar efficacy to TDF [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], with a better safety profile, but long-term data are needed to confirm the TAF safety profile. TAF is already available in western countries, but it is uncertain when it will be available in the rest of the world, which carries the heaviest burden of the epidemic. ZDV (still used in some developing countries) causes myelosuppression, gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches and mitochondrial toxicity that can lead to lipoatrophy, hepatic steatosis and lactic acidosis. Second, 3TC is a potent and inexpensive drug that can be easily co-formulated with DTG, providing a single pill QD first-line option that might be easy to administer, with minimal side effects and few drug interactions. Third, the total amount of active pharmaceutical ingredients required is low, allowing to produce smaller pills. Fourth, given the production cost of the DTG and 3TC, this regimen might be the cheapest drug combination according to a recent WHO forecast that estimated the annual cost per patient at about UDS44 [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Even in the US, the use of this combination as initial therapy or switching could result in significant savings. Girouard et al. compared no ART to an initial dual regimen (DTG + 3TC); to an induction&#x02013;maintenance strategy (48-week induction regimen of DTG + abacavir + 3TC) followed by DTG + 3TC maintenance if virologically suppressed; and to a standard-of-care three-drug regimen (DTG + abacavir + 3TC) [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Two-drug regimen was the most cost-effective strategy if DTG + 3TC 48-week virologic suppression rate could exceed 90%.</p></sec><sec id="S0010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this small, proof-of-concept, pilot study encourage further exploration of this strategy. Our results suggest that the combination of DTG and 3TC could be considered as an alternative option in first line, sparing exposure to other nucleosides and preserving other treatment options downstream, if needed. The low rate of side effects reported in the study is attributable to the avoidance of the second NRTI. Dual therapy with DTG + 3TC could be a highly effective, simple and, in some settings, cost-effective first-line option for HIV patients. If our findings are confirmed in the ongoing randomized trials GEMINI 1 (NCT02831673) and GEMINI 2 (NCT02831764), this strategy may challenge the value of adding a third nucleosid(t)ide to the outcomes of HAART. Until then, the decision of using this dual regimen outside clinical trials should be carefully considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Lamivudine and Dolutegravir were provided by ViiV Healthcare.
