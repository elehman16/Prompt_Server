It is a unique dual neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor. In contrast with other selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, including duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine, it has greater selectivity for inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake than serotonin reuptake. Our review focuses on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data for five double-blind, placebo-controlled, short-term studies and two long-term studies. In the short-term studies, LVM was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing depression (Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale) scores as well as improving functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale) scores. Long-term studies found LVM to be similarly effective but in the only placebo-controlled long-term study, LVM was not significantly superior to placebo. LVM is fairly well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being nausea, headache, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, and constipation. Discontinuation rates were mildly increased in those being treated with LVM (9%) versus placebo (3%). Adverse events were not dose-related except for urinary hesitancy and erectile dysfunction. LVM was weight neutral, was not toxic to the liver, and did not cause clinically significant QTc prolongation. Consistent with being a predominant potentiator of norepinephrine, pulse and blood pressure were significantly elevated by LVM but rarely induced tachycardia or hypertension. LVM is a relatively safe alternative antidepressant treatment with minimal drug&#x02013;drug interactions. It is the only antidepressant that has in its labeling that it is not only effective in improving depression but also effective in improving impaired functioning. Whether this important effect on functioning is unique to LVM must be researched. In addition, whether LVM might be effective in norepinephrine-deficit depression, refractory depression, atypical depression, or seasonal depression is yet to be evaluated. Ultimately, head-to-head studies comparing LVM with other antidepressants will determine the place of LM in antidepressant treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>levomilnacipran</kwd><kwd>antidepressant</kwd><kwd>clinical efficacy</kwd><kwd>functional impairment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although antidepressants clearly have been significantly effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD),<xref rid="b1-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> they have also been disappointing, in that many patients fail to respond, only have a partial response, cannot continue treatment due to intolerable side effects, or relapse despite continuing initially successful antidepressant treatment.<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This was highlighted in the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) study in which only approximately 30% of patients had a remission and 50% had a clinical response (improvement of 50% from baseline) to a 12- to 14-week course of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, over 40% of patients had significant side effects.<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Lastly, even for patients who initially responded to treatment with citalopram, approximately 40% relapsed within one year of continued treatment.<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, there is need for alternative antidepressants that are more effective and better tolerated than the currently approved antidepressants.</p><p>Recently, levomilnacipran (1<italic>S</italic>, 2<italic>R</italic>-milnacipran; LVM; Fetzima<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Forest Pharmaceuticals Inc, New York, NY, USA), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MDD. It is an enantiomer of the racemic drug, milnacipran, which is approved for the treatment of MDD in Europe and Japan and for fibromyalgia in the USA.<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Preclinical studies have found that LVM is a more potent inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin (50 and 13 times, respectively) than the less active enantiomer, F2696 (1R, 2S-). Furthermore, it has a better pharmacokinetic profile than F2696, having a longer elimination half-life with a higher maximal concentration and area under the curve.<xref rid="b8-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, LVM is a dual neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin. It is unique amongst other dual neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors in that it predominantly potentiates norepinephrine over serotonin; it has over a 15-fold higher selectivity for norepinephrine versus serotonin reuptake inhibition compared with duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, or venlafaxine.<xref rid="b8-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Interestingly, both in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest that, at higher doses, serotonergic activity increases so that inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake approaches that of inhibition of serotonin reuptake. LVM lacks affinity for other receptors, including the dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminic, muscarinic, and opioid receptors.<xref rid="b8-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of LVM follow linear dynamics between 25 mg/day and 300 mg/day. LVM has a half-life of approximately 12 hours, with a time to peak concentration of 6&#x02013;8 hours. Absorption is not affected by food intake, and the drug is 22% bound to protein. Metabolism is primarily through cytochrome 3A4. The latter can contribute to potential drug&#x02013;drug interactions if the concomitant drug is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4, such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir. Therefore, in these situations, a maximal dose of 80 mg is recommended. Excretion of LVM is predominantly via the kidney. Thus, the package insert suggests a reduced maximal dose of 80 mg if moderate renal impairment exists (creatinine clearance 30&#x02013;59 mL per minute) and 40 mg if severe renal impairment exists (creatinine clearance 15&#x02013;29 mL per minute). LVM should not be used in patients with end-stage renal disease.<xref rid="b11-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The purpose of this paper is to review the status of LVM, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2014, presenting an overview of its effectiveness, safety, and tolerability.

Clearly, a successful treatment course must not only lead to symptomatic improvement but also lead to a normalization of functioning. Although symptomatic improvement is usually accompanied by improvement in functioning, the latter can still remain impaired.<xref rid="b23-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This appears to be an important clinical point in that euthymic patients who still have impaired functioning are less likely to have a full recovery and more likely to suffer recurrences.<xref rid="b24-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Recently, some investigators have suggested that antidepressants with potent noradrenergic mechanisms may be particularly helpful in normalizing impaired functioning in depressed patients partly due to their positive effect on cognitive functioning and concentration.<xref rid="b25-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Since LVM is unique in having a potent noradrenergic component and one&#x02019;s functioning is so important, SDS was assessed in the LVM trials.</p><p>In the overall study population (meta-analysis of the five short-term LVM studies), the mean change in SDS score (end of treatment minus baseline score) was significantly greater for LVM over placebo (LSMD &#x02212;2.2, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

Whether LVM is more effective than other antidepressants that are not predominantly noradrenergic, such as other serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or SSRIs, awaits clarification. One recent meta-analysis of duloxetine, another SNRI, found that an asynchrony existed between symptomatic remission and functional remission. Clinical remission frequently was not accompanied by a functional remission.<xref rid="b27-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, LVM may be unique here.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical dimensions associated with LVM responsiveness</title><p>In the five short-term<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and two long-term LVM studies,<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> ie, a total of seven publications, no clear clinical dimensions were identified as being associated with LVM treatment response.

Significant effects of LVM on MADRS were seen in all age groups, with the group aged 60 years and older having the greatest response of all the age groups (LSMD &#x02212;4.4, <italic>P</italic>=0.002).

Patients who have symptoms of urinary obstruction or even a history of such symptoms should consider an alternative antidepressant.</p><p>Although LVM appeared to significantly help anxiety symptoms in the LVM trials as measured by the MADRS (ie, the MADRS item for inner tension) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD<sub>17</sub>, ie, the HAMD items of anxiety-psychological, somatic symptoms-gastrointestinal, and somatic symptoms-general),<xref rid="b49-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> what effect LVM has on comorbid anxiety disorders or other comorbid psychiatric diagnoses is unknown, since the presence of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis was an exclusion criterion in three of the five LVM trials;<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> unfortunately, the effect of allowable comorbid anxiety disorders, ie, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobias, seen in two trials was never analyzed.<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> What effect LVM might have on comorbid anxiety disorders is an important question, given that approximately 60% of patients with MDD have a comorbid anxiety disorder.<xref rid="b51-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>In addition, although LVM was significantly superior to placebo in the short-term studies, it failed to be significant in the one placebo-controlled, double-blind, long-term study.<xref rid="b16-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another study is currently underway to reassess this important issue.</p><p>Despite having a number of positive reasons to consider LVM early in treatment, the economics of LVM may be prohibitive for many patients. Since LVM at this point does not have a generic equivalent, antidepressants which have generic formulations may be necessary due to lack of insurance coverage and restricted formularies.</p><p>Since refractory depression is such a prevalent problem (33% of patients with MDD fail to respond to a course of two sequential antidepressants),<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> what effect LVM might have on refractory depression is an important question. The five short-term LVM trials all excluded patients who failed to respond to two antidepressants for their current depressive episode. Thus, whether LVM is effective in refractory depression needs to be studied. In addition, the efficacy of LVM in atypical depression, &#x0201c;anxious depression&#x0201d;, psychotic depression, and seasonal depression needs to be studied. The true place of LVM will be learned from head-to-head, placebo-controlled studies comparing LVM with other antidepressants.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>GMA is on the speaker&#x02019;s bureaus for Forest Research Institute and Shire Pharmaceuticals, and has received clinical research grants from Shire Research Institute, Lunbeck, and Takeda.
