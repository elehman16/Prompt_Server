Hypoxia constitutes a basic regulatory mechanism in vascular development during embryonic and fetal growth <italic>in utero </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In endothelial cells, hypoxic conditions drive the transcription of multiple genes which control vascular function, expansion and remodeling. Although tissue hypoxia is the main driving force for angiogenesis, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that oxidative stress can also be a potent trigger for the development of new vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Two families of radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are very crucial to growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and aging. The transition from growth to degeneration of cells is finely tuned by the relative concentration of oxidants. For instance, in ambient conditions, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in nano-micromolar concentrations are necessary for angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while its excessive accumulation at levels more than 150-200 &#x003bc;M prompts endothelial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An imbalance of free radicals attacks and alters cell constituents, resulting in lipid peroxidation, protein peroxidation, oxidative inactivation, mutation of DNA, and destruction of vitamins and other functions that protect cell components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Excessive accumulation of free radicals affects placental development and function, and may subsequently impact both the fetus and dam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The dietary antioxidants are important in attenuating the oxidative damage produced by radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Tocopherols are micronutrients which act as free radical scavengers. The major tocopherols found in mammalian tissue are alpha-tocopherol (aT) and gamma-tocopherol (gT). Studies on tocopherol in humans have shown that aT constitutes 80 to 90% of vitamin E in plasma, which is due to the preferential incorporation of aT into very low-density lipoprotein via tocopherol-binding protein, and a rapid catabolism of gT within the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Consequently, aT has received the most attention and is the primary form of vitamin E in supplements. However a recent work has suggested that under specific circumstances gT might scavenge reactive species more effectively than aT thereby, being more beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Gamma tocopherol affords higher protection against lipid peroxidation as compared to aT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that high levels of aT intake can decrease gT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also gT has synergistic effect with other tocopherols and suggested as most promising agent to use. Hence we decided to use both tocopherols in this study. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that chronic supplementations with tocopherols have biphasic, proangiogenic and antiangiogenic therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A recent study also concluded that tocoretinols not tocopherols suppressed Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) induced angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Optimal placental development is critical for fetal development and growth. Normal fetal growth is genetically pre-programmed and regulated by fetal, placental, maternal and environmental factors. A range of pathophysiological factors including maternal stress due to poor nutrition, hyperthermia or metabolic diseases such as pregnancy toxemia and eclampsia may affect important metabolic, transport and hemodynamic functions of placentas. This may lead to fetal stress due to poor supply of nutrition and thus impairment in fetal growth. A recent study demonstrated that glucocorticoid induced restriction of fetal and placental growth is mediated through reduced placental expression of VEGF and associated reduction in placental vascualrization during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Supplementation of antioxidants may negate oxidative stress, promote angiogenesis and increase nutrient supply to the fetus. The differential expression of VEGF and placental growth factors (PlGF) throughout gestation indicates that they both play essential roles in placental angiogenesis. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1&#x003b1; or HIF-2&#x003b1; combine with HIF-1&#x003b2; to form the functional basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor HIF-1 to stimulate transcription of the VEGF gene via interaction with the hypoxia response element (HRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Several genes encoding growth factors and tyrosine kinase receptors essential for endothelial cell growth and function such as erythropoietin (EPO), VEGF, endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) and Flk-1 were shown to contain HIF-binding sites in their promoter/enhancer sequences.</p><p>We hypothesize that oral supplementation of tocopherols during late gestation in ewes will increase tocopherol levels in the circulation, resulting in increased concentrations in the uterus and placenta and thereby increasing the expression of angiogenic genes and exerting an angiogenic effect. The objectives of the study were to: 1) compare aT and gT concentrations in serum, uterine and placentomal tissues among supplemented and CON groups; 2) compare angiogenic gene (VEGF, PlGF, eNOS, and HIFs) expressions in the uterus, caruncle and cotyledon among supplemented and CON groups; and 3) compare angiogenic morphometric parameters of the uteroplacental vascular network of late pregnant ewes supplemented with aT, gT, or placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Eighteen pregnant ewes (2 to 6 years of age and weighing approximately 68 kg; impregnated by different sires by natural service), with similar breeding dates were selected for the current study and were mainatined under normal pasture conditions.

Fractal analysis measures complexity using the fractal dimension. A fractal dimension is, in essence, a scaling rule comparing how a pattern's detail changes with the scale at which it is considered. The fractal dimension is a valuable parameter to describe the complexity. FarcLac 2.5 release 1b5 m (NIH, USA) was used to perform fractal dimension. The FracLac scan images using a shifting grid algorithm that can do multiple scans from different locations on each image. The fractal dimension of the binary skeleton was estimated using the box counting method at multiple origins. The basic procedure is to systematically lay a series of grids of decreasing calibre (the boxes) over an image and record data (the counting) for each successive calibre. To minimize grid location effects, the algorithm started from number of locations, generating a set of variables for fractal dimension. The average value over all locations was considered as the final estimate of fractal dimension. During the same analytical process 'Lacunarity" was also calculated. This parameter is a measure of homogeneity of structure or the degree of structural variance within an object. It was estimated as the average of the coefficient of variation for pixel density over all grid sizes and locations. The field demarked as a square in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> is one location.

We evaluated biweekly serum, and uterine and placental concentrations of tocopherols, angiogenesis gene (VEGF, PlGF, eNOS and HIFs) mRNA expressions, and morphometry of placental vascular network following daily oral supplementation in late pregnant ewes. The findings of this study indicated that oral supplementation of tocopherols to pregnant ewes during late gestation increased their serum concentrations; increased their concentrations in uterine and placentomal tissue; alpha tocopherol increased mRNA expression of PlGF, eNOS and HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon compared to placebo; gamma tocopherol increased VEGF and eNOS mRNA expressions in caruncle and uterus, and HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon, HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2 &#x003b1; in caruncle and uterus compared to placebo; morphometry analysis of angiogenic parameters favored increased angiogenesis.</p><p>In this study, the serum and tissue level of aT (mg/kg) was higher than gT (&#x003bc;g/kg) even with increased gT daily dose. Gamma-tocopherol is initially absorbed in the same manner as alpha-tocopherol following administration, however, only small amounts of gamma-tocopherol are detectable in blood and tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The bioavailability of aT is 5 to 10 times more than gT, could explain the reason for lower serum and tissue gT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Other factors that could be responsible include high fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], dose and half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], species and cell type in question, and the chemical vitamer. The d2-gamma-tocopherol half-life was 13 &#x000b1; 4 h compared with 57 &#x000b1; 19 h for d6-alpha-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Considering the half-life, the daily oral supplementation and biweekly serum sample collection in this study occurred in the mornings, between 0800 and 0900 h, and could also be the possible explanation for the lower gamma tocopherol levels in the serum. Also, it has been demonstrated that aT transfer protein is present in early and late term placenta in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Hence it is possible that aT was better able to transfer across to the cotyledon and thereby increased tissue aT concentration.</p><p>Tocopherols exhibit complex biological effects reflecting their diverse nutritional, antioxidant and signaling properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The biologically active range of tocopherols is relatively narrow (~3-4-fold variation). Because of this relatively narrow "window of efficacy," benefits from tocopherols might require continuous consumption to be effective. Once ingested, orally administered vitamin E plateaus in the plasma by 24 h but does not fully distribute to all biological compartments until at least ~1 week after ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is consistent in this study that the serum concentrations of both aT and gT spiked during the first week and maintained at increased levels during rest of the study.</p><p>Several factors including VEGF, PlGF, basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor, eNOS and angiopoietins 1 and 2 have been recognized as important regulators of placental development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the present study, alpha tocopherol increased mRNA expression of PlGF in cotyledon compared to placebo, and gamma tocopherol increased VEGF in caruncle and uterus. In ewes, maternal placental vascularization is dependent upon VEGF and angiopoietins expression. In contrast, fetal placental vascularization depends on numerous angiogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that both VEGF and PlGF driven angiogenesis acts via an eNOS activated, nitric oxide mediated pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In this study, aT increased the eNOS in cotyledon and gT increased the eNOS in caruncle and uterus. In pioneering studies, Cooney et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] showed that tocopherol reduces nitrogen dioxide to the less harmful nitric oxide. Because endothelium derived nitric oxide is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis, up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide formation by tocopherol could be important in promoting angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In this study aT, increased mRNA expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon compared to placebo. The gT increased mRNA expressions of HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon, and HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2 &#x003b1; in caruncle and uterus compared to placebo. Hypoxia-inducible factor is the main regulator of the cellular response to low oxygen levels in mammalian species, playing a key role in regulating many physiological functions. The 2 principal HIF-&#x003b1; subunits, HIF-1&#x003b1;, which is ubiquitously expressed and HIF-2&#x003b1;, which shows a spatially restricted expression, both play important roles in vascular development and endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1; or HIF-2&#x003b1; combine with HIF-1&#x003b2; to form the functional basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor HIF-1 to stimulate transcription of the VEGF gene via interaction with the hypoxia response element (HRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This occurs under hypoxic conditions, but is down regulated under normoxic conditions due to targeted proteolysis of HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2&#x003b1;, mediated by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL). Additionally, VEGF is regulated post-transcriptionally through stabilization of its mRNA by interaction with heterogeneous nuclear ribonuceloprotein L (hnRNP L). The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor HIF-2&#x003b1; is also capable of heterodimerizing with HIF-1&#x003b1; to form functional HIF-1. Several genes encoding growth factors and tyrosine kinase receptors essential for endothelial cell growth and function such as EPO, VEGF, eNOS and Flk-1 were shown to contain HIF-binding sites in their promoter/enhancer sequences.</p><p>Although placental and fetal growth and development are driven by the program encoded in its genome, the genetic regulation is influenced by the intra-uterine environment in which the fetus grows. The size and nutrient transfer capacity of the placenta plays a central role in determining the prenatal growth trajectory of the fetus. Angiogenesis is the process of formation of new vessels from preexisting vessels. Although tissue hypoxia is the main drive for angiogenesis, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that oxidative stress can also be a potent trigger for the development of new vessels. Hence it seems reasonable that the presence of no or high oxidative stress may result in formation of new vessels. Angiogenic sprouting is controlled by the balance between pro-angiogenic signals (VEGF) and factors that promote quiescence (pericyte) or VEGF inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In conditions that favor angiogenesis, some endothelial cells can sprout, whereas others fail to respond. In the present study, morphometric analysis revealed ewes supplemented with alpha- or gamma-tocopherol had increased fractal dimension and decreased lacunarity compared to placebo treated ewes indicated increased angiogenesis in utero-placental vascular network. It should be noted that even though not significant reduced mRNA expressions for VEGF, PlGF and eNOS in uterus and placenta were observed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study evaluated cellular responses to supplementation in order to understand the mechanisms behind the biological effects of tocopherols on placental angiogenesis during late gestation in pregnant ewes. The tocopherol concentrations of uterus and placentome increased following oral supplementation. In aT supplemented ewes, mRNA expression of PlGF, eNOS and HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon were greater than the CON group. In gT supplemented ewes, VEGF and eNOS mRNA expressions in caruncle and uterus, and HIF-1&#x003b1; in cotyledon, HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2 &#x003b1; in caruncle and uterus were greater than the CON group. Morphometry analysis revealed angiogenic parameters favoring increased angiogenesis. Given the findings, it is plausible that the angiogenesis observed in this study might be a prooxidant and proangiogenesis pathway. Based on the results observed in this study we confer that the tocopherols supplementation can be employed to promote placental angiogenesis during late gestation. The oral tocopherol supplementation may be considered as an option to overcome pregnancy complications due to placental ischemia during late gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RK did the work of acquisition of funding, conception, design and collection of data, morphometry analysis, data analysis and interpretation, and drafting of the manuscript, tables and figures.
