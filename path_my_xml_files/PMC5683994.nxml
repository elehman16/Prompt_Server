elderly-customized hatha yoga on the vascular inflammation factors of elderly women.
[Subjects and Methods] This research was conducted with 14 elderly women, between 70 and
80&#x02005;years old, divided into an elderly-customized hatha yoga group (n=7) and a control
group (n=7). The application group participated in a hatha yoga program designed to be
elderly-friendly for 10 weeks. At the end of the program, the vascular inflammation
factors were measured, including the albumin, white blood cell count, fibrinogen, high
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
[Results] In the hatha yoga group, the albumin increased significantly after the
application, when compared to the level before the application, while the
fibrinogen, hs-CRP, and ESR decreased significantly. In the control group, the
vascular inflammation factor levels before and after the application period were not
significantly different. [Conclusion] Based on the results of this study, the application
of elderly-customized hatha yoga created positive changes in the vascular inflammation
factors of elderly women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly-customized hatha yoga</kwd><kwd>Vascular inflammation factor</kwd><kwd>Elderly women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In senescence, a reduction in muscular strength, musculoskeletal system atrophy, changes in
the postural alignment, and balanced gait abnormalities occur naturally. Moreover,
cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stroke, can be
induced, and the risk of inflammatory diseases increases due to declining immune system
functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some researchers have
suggested that appropriate exercise can stimulate an elderly person&#x02019;s immune system to
maintain and improve immune functions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, it has been reported that regular exercise can play a role in delaying or
preventing the aging process, along with boosting the immune system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other researchers have warned that despite the positive
effects of exercising, elderly persons show rapid declines in their physiological functions
and physical fitness, increases in their physical fatigue, and rapid declines in their
recuperative powers against fatigue. However, inadequate participation in exercise may act
as a factor causing oxidative stress and inflammation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>By emphasizing a harmonious balance between physical, mental, spiritual, and social
health<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and using posture and breathing
exercises, hatha yoga progresses in the form of maintaining and repeating isometric
exercises. This is the act of contracting diverse muscles in fixed poses, creating muscle
relaxation. Previous studies have reported its effects in the treatment of musculoskeletal
system diseases and arthritis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as
its improvement in the cardiovascular system, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and
neuromuscular function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, one researcher reported that regular aerobic
exercise, such as hatha yoga, performed by elderly males brought about an improvement in
their immune substances. If these phenomena continue for long periods of time, the defense
and attack systems of immunoreactive substances against immune diseases like cancer could be
improved<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Choosing appropriate forms of exercise for elderly individuals should be carefully
considered to improve their quality of life and allow them to live out their remaining years
in a healthy way. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and apply an
elderly-customized form of hatha yoga to investigate the effects of this type of exercise on
the vascular inflammation factors in elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This research was conducted with 14 elderly women, between the ages of 70 and 80&#x02005;years old,
divided into an elderly-customized hatha yoga group (n=7) and a control group (n=7). The
mean age of the yoga group was 76.1 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;years old, with a mean height of 154.9 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;cm
and mean weight of 61.72 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x02005;kg. The mean age of the control group was 78.0 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;years
old, with a mean height of 157.5 &#x000b1; 3.6&#x02005;cm and a mean weight of 64.0 &#x000b1; 13.9&#x02005;kg. These groups
were homogeneous because there was no statistically significant difference between the two
groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). The elderly-customized hatha yoga program consisted of 60 minutes of
exercise three times per week for 10 weeks. Five minutes each of joint stretching and
breathing in the prayer and corpse yoga poses were performed as the warm-up exercises. The
main exercises were elderly-customized modifications of hatha yoga poses. To achieve the
elderly-customized exercise intensity, the target heart rates of 30&#x02013;40% of the heart rate
reserve (HRR) were calculated using the Karvonen formula. The subjects were encouraged to
perform the individual hatha yoga poses at 30&#x02013;40% of the degrees of completion, and to
perform breathing exercises in the prayer and the corpse poses between the individual
isometric poses. The major poses used were as follows: sitting forward bend pose, bound
angle pose, wide-angle seated forward bend pose, bridge shoulder stand pose, revolved
abdomen pose (supine), cobra pose, revolved abdomen pose (prone), cat stretch pose, and
plough pose.</p><p>The following vascular inflammation variables of the blood were analyzed: albumin, white
blood cell (WBC) count, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). For the measured data, paired t-tests were conducted
using SPSS 21.0 for Windows to examine the changes between the pre and post-application of
the yoga exercises in each group. Significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05. This study has been
prepared in accordance with the Namseoul University research ethics standards, and the
subjects were safely protected throughout every stage of the experiment. All of the subjects
understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to their
participation in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>With regard to the changes in the vascular inflammation factors in the yoga group, the
albumin was increased significantly after the application (p&#x0003c;0.05), while the fibrinogen,
hs-CRP, and ESR were significantly decreased. There was no significant difference in the WBC
count in the yoga group, but there was a tendency toward a numerical decrease. In the
control group, there were no significant differences between the vascular inflammation
factor values before and after the application (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

hs-CRP, and fibrinogen, which are acute vascular inflammatory factors, since such changes
are attributable to the progression of vascular inflammation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the vascular inflammation factors tested in this study, the
albumin increased significantly in the yoga group after the application of the
elderly-customized hatha yoga, when compared to those levels before the application. Albumin
is a protein biosynthesized in the liver, and it is involved in the maintenance of osmotic
pressure, the movement and transport of substances, immunity, and enzyme reactions. If the
concentration of albumin decreases, nephrotic syndrome, infectious hepatitis, and/or liver
cirrhosis could be present. Regular aerobic exercise has been reported to be helpful for the
prevention of cardiovascular diseases in elderly females by preventing a drop in the serum
albumin levels and increasing the albumin values to within the normal range.</p><p>With regard to physical activity and the vascular inflammatory factors, some researchers
have indicated that albumin concentrations significantly increase when the intensity of
physical activity increases, improving the levels of both the activities of daily living and
overall physical activity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, the same results were shown along with the significant increase in the
albumin values after the application of yoga.</p><p>Among the vascular inflammation factors, the fibrinogen, hs-CRP, and ESR levels decreased
significantly after the application of the yoga exercises, when compared to those before the
application, in the hatha yoga group (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, although the WBC count exhibited
a numerically decreasing trend, there was no significant difference between the pre and
post-application values. The hs-CRP plasma protein increases remarkably in cases of
inflammatory disease and tissue necrosis. It is also a representative component of the
so-called acute phase proteins, which are useful in determining the existence and severity
of inflammatory or tissue-disintegrative diseases. Fibrinogen is one factor leading to the
formation of thrombi, and increases in the blood concentration of fibrinogen can increase
the risks of arteriosclerosis in the cardiovascular system and thrombotic diseases. The ESR
can be used to evaluate diverse disease conditions, particularly inflammatory conditions;
for example, increases in the ESR are commonly seen in acute and chronic inflammatory
conditions in which cytoclasis rapidly increases.</p><p>The hatha yoga applied in the present study is traditional yoga used to control physical
conditions and train breathing through a balance of mind and body, as achieved by balancing
the yin and yang. It is mainly composed of postural methods (called asana poses) and
respiratory methods, and has been reported to provide greater aerobic effects than the other
types of yoga with regard to the energy consumption<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. One researcher reported that hatha yoga, jogging, aerobic dance,
swimming, and cycling reduce the levels of the vascular inflammatory responses (hs-CRP,
fibrinogen, and WBC count)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, while
another researcher reported that those individuals regularly participating in physical
activity had lower fibrinogen concentrations and a greater cellulose solubilizing
ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that although appropriate exercise improves the
blood-clotting process, those with excellent physical fitness had an improved cellulose
solubilizing ability and anti-clotting functions when compared to those with poor physical
fitness<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, when the
elderly persons (at least 65&#x02005;years old) in one study performed aerobic exercise, their serum
hs-CRP and ESR values decreased significantly when compared to those before the exercise
treatment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, those with more
physical activity had lower fibrinogen concentrations and a better cellulose solubilizing
ability when compared to those with less physical activity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it was no surprise that the elderly-customized hatha
yoga exercise applied in the present study had positive effects on the vascular inflammatory
factors.</p><p>High intensity exercise is known to increase the circulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which
is actively involved in immunoinflammatory responses and the acute inflammatory factors of
the blood<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These increases are
attributable to the fact that high intensity exercise causes damage to the muscles and
increases inflammation in both the joints and muscles. Therefore, when exercise is applied
to elderly individuals to create positive changes in the vascular inflammation factors, the
intensity of that exercise is especially important. In the present study, the
elderly-customized exercise intensity was set when the hatha yoga was applied to induce the
results of this research.</p><p>In this study, it could be seen that the application of elderly-customized hatha yoga in
women aged 70 to 80&#x02005;years old brought about positive changes in their vascular inflammation
factors. The results of this research suggest the benefits of using elderly-customized hatha
yoga in those elderly persons suffering from conditions related to poor vascular
inflammation factor levels. Although this study was applied to elderly-customized hatha
yoga, elderly people should pay attention to physical and psychological burdens and
musculoskeletal injuries when applying elderly-customized hatha yoga.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Bonder</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name></person-group>: Functional performance in older adults, 3rd ed.
