Pathological changes in the late stage of OA include softening, ulceration and focal disintegration of the articular cartilage; synovial inflammation also may occur. Typical clinical symptoms are pain, particularly after prolonged activity and weight bearing; whereas stiffness is experienced after inactivity <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It is also known as degenerative arthritis, which commonly affects the hands, feet, spine, and large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. It can present as localized, generalized or as erosive osteoarthritis. Most cases of osteoarthritis have no known cause and are referred to as primary osteoarthritis. Primary osteoarthritis is mostly related to aging. Secondary osteoarthritis is caused by another disease or condition <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Epidemiological profile of this disease in India is not clear but it is estimated that osteoarthritis (OA) is the second most common rheumatologically problem and is most frequent joint disease with prevalence of 22%&#x02013;39% in India. Eleven COPCORD (Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Disorders) reports show knee OA data: there were 3328 knee OA patients out of a total surveyed pooled sample of 41,884. The pooled prevalence of knee OA thus becomes eight percentages. Knee Osteoarthritis prevalence increases with age, so that about 11% of all women over the age of 60 years have symptoms due to knee OA <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The guidelines for treatment of the OA of the knee from the National institute of health and clinical excellence (NICE), the American college of rheumatology and the European league against rheumatism recommend non-drug treatments including the education of the patients, social support, physical exercises and weight loss <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are still used as the initial treatment in primary care as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. NSAIDs are associated with a number of side effects, most importantly the increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and renal failure <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> as well as increasing risk of myocardial infarction and stroke especially in the COX-2 inhibitor category <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The intra-articular injections of corticosteroid and sodium hyaluronate etc. are also in practice but have limited role. Finally end stage forms of OA are treated with knee replacement therapy. This is frequently associated with pain relief but however hold a substantial post-operative risk and financial burden <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. On the basis of limitations, the use of alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, medicinal herbs is on the rise and according to reports; about 60&#x02013;90% of dissatisfied arthritis patients are likely to use the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approach for overcoming pain and associated problems. An increasing number of people in the United States are adopting complementary or alternative medicine approaches to meet their personal health problems. Arthritis (both OA and RA) is one of the foremost diseases for which patient seeks option of complementary or alternative medicine <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In treating osteoarthritis, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, two of the molecular building blocks found in articular cartilage, are the most commonly used alternative supplements <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p><italic>Sandhivata</italic> nomenclature available in Ayurvedic literatures for this clinical entity <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which is similar to Osteoarthritis. The cause of <italic>sandhivata</italic> in Ayurveda is attributed to improper diet, life style, and old age etc. leading to degeneration of body elements (<italic>dhatu kshaya</italic>), aggravation of <italic>vata</italic>; the humor responsible for all the movements and functions of the body and reduction in <italic>shleshaka kapha;</italic> a slimy substance present in the joints.
