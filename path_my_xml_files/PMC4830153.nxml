It is predicted that it will be the biggest cause of death in 2020.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Statistics show that over &#x0201c;100.000&#x0201d; one hundred thousand ischemic heart disease patients are re-hospitalized in medical centers because of the relapse of the disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Inadequate supportive systems, ineffective planning to follow-up the patients, inability of the patients to follow the treatment activities when relapsing the disease symptoms, lack of nutritional, and medicinal diet follow-up, discharging without planning, lack of knowledge about the illness risks and treatment diets are the main factors and reasons of re-hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Moreover, angina symptoms, heart insufficiency, limited activities, and physical disabilities in ischemic heart disease can effect on the patients&#x02019; quality of life.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The results of the clinical trials have shown that quality of life can be a sign of health care quality and a considerable part of the treatment program in ischemic heart disease patients. So increasingly, traditional criteria such as rate of survival, mortality, and illnesses replaced with an assessment of the quality of life to determine the results of health care of the patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Since the hospitalization period has been reduced in hospitals these days, it is necessary for patients and their families to be informed of essential instructions before and after discharging.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Huber and McClelland reported that of 7300 nurses working in hospitals, 75% declared that their quality of care toward patients discharge was not perfect, and the patients were discharged without adequate instructions to them and their caregivers.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, it is critical to design an appropriate discharge plan. This program with a systematic process prepares the patients for discharging medical and health care centers.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Discharge-planning program deals with examining the patients and their families and also determining their health care need and instructions, consulting, following up, referring, and evaluating.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Despite all advantages of performing discharge planning, Backer <italic>et al</italic>. stated that rare studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of discharge planning performance.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In Iran, there is no structured discharge plan program. Considering the mentioned studies and the criterion of quality of life to evaluate the effects of performing discharge-planning program, the researcher aimed to conduct a comprehensive study to determine the effect of discharge-planning program on the physical quality of life in patients with ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a quasi-experimental study, which was conducted on 74 ischemic heart disease patients during 2012. The samples were collected from intensive coronary care, internal heart care units and coronary emergency units of the two hospitals according to exclusion and inclusion criteria. Seventy-four patients were selected via purposive sampling methods according to previous studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The samples divided randomly in case (<italic>n</italic> = 37) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 37) groups. Fourteen patients were lost during the study and final sample comprised sixty patients (thirty cases in each group).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were willing to participate in the study and signing the consent letter, diagnosis of myocardial infarction and unstable angina in the patients&#x02019; medical files, aged between 35 and 65-year-old, patients from Mashhad city and ability of reading and writing. The exclusion criteria included having open heart surgery during the intervention, trauma experience in last 6 months such as immigration, accidents, and divorce, suffering immediate family members from an incurable disease and unavailability after discharging.</p><p>Questionnaire and other forms were examined and corrected by supervisor professors, professional advisers and 11 members of faculty of nursing and midwifery of Mashhad and finally were developed for use in research. Quality of life Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire with Persian version was used; the validity was confirmed by using convergent validity test where all the correlation coefficients were over the recommended value (0.4) with change range of (0.95&#x02013;0.58). Reliability was established by doing a guide study on ten persons of the research community and confirmed by Cronbach alpha which was 0.90&#x02013;0.77.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>After ethical permission, patients were sensitized. In the case group (discharge-planning group &#x02013; [DPG]), in addition to medicinal actions, controlling of medicine side effects and blood pressure, electrocardiography, and unscheduled instruction; the patients&#x02019; educational needs were specified in the questionnaire of level of knowledge and awareness by interviews, and then the discharge-planning program instruction was provided based on the patients&#x02019; educational and instructional needs, while the control group received the routine care. Both groups were evaluated before discharge and 3 months after discharge.</p><p>The program was performed in 3&#x02013;6 face-to-face sessions twice a day for 15&#x02013;20 min using a laptop computer, power point, showing images, and answering the probable questions.

To follow-up the clients and their families in using trained materials, seven phone calls were made by the researchers, the first one during first 24&#x02013;48 h after discharge and the other calls once every 2 weeks. Each phone call lasted 5&#x02013;20 min.</p><p>The patients in two groups were hospitalized in separate wards and rooms in order not to get in touch to each other. To consider the ethical principles, after completing research study, necessary instructions were given to the control group through phone and the training booklets was posted to their addresses.</p><p>The data were analyzed via ANOVA, <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square tests through SPSS20 software (IBM Corp.

In addition, in Lin's training sessions the patients&#x02019; families did not participate and the researcher had only two visits with the patients during 3 months after discharging. In Lin's study, discharge-planning had little effect on the different aspects of quality of life and had no effect on the aspect of limited activities due to physical disabilities and mental problems probably because of lack of consultation by phone conversation and no close emotional touch with the patients and their families. In this study, after training sessions with the caregivers there was a telephone call every 15 days by the researcher to the patients, and their questions were answered and also there was mental, emotional and religious support, and if possible the patients were referred to special centers. In this program, the clients were under control and supervision of the researcher. Therefore, in our study, each one of the physical aspects of the quality of life has significantly during 3 months after performing discharge-planning program (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001).

The results also indicates that the program influenced all dimensions of quality of life including fatigue, bodily pain, general health, social function, physical function, physical role and mental health. In addition, the follow up revealed resistance of difference between intervention and control group, which implies the effectiveness of designed plan in long time after intervention.</p><sec
