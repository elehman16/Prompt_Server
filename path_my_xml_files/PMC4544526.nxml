</p><p>Some of the most common clinical presentations include: trigger finger,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> De Quervain tenosynovitis<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and carpal tunnel syndrome.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These pathologies tend to affect individuals in their late adulthood, with the potential to impair both quality of life and ability to work.</p><p>Treatment options depend on the type of alteration but can potentially range from splinting (carpal tunnel)<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> to local steroid injection<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to surgery (both open and endoscopic),<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7 </xref>which is the treatment of choice in the most severe cases or when all other options have failed.</p><p>Trigger finger release, carpal tunnel release, De Quervain tenosynovitis operation, surgical correction of minor bone injuries or pathologies are characterized by similarly low intra- and post-operative pain levels, which can be successfully controlled by local anaesthesia and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) respectively.</p><p>Anaesthesia for hand surgery largely relies on local or regional techniques<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9 </xref>that have proven to be safe and effective, especially in the out-patient setting where the management of a general anaesthesia would be more difficult.</p><p>An effective post-operative pain control strategy is a prerequisite of any surgical procedure. In the out-patient setting the anesthesiologist needs a protocol that can be easily implemented at home with a low incidence of even mild complications and good tolerability.</p><p>NSAIDs are the post-operative pain therapy of choice for their effectiveness to control bone and soft-tissue pain. They can be associated with acetaminophen for the treatment of break-through pain.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>A standard therapy at full NSAID dosage should cover the first 18-24 hours after the operation. A local anesthetic activity is present during the early post-operative period with variable duration according to the drug used.</p><p>Ibuprofen is a well-tolerated NSAID due to its low gastric toxicity and good anti-inflammatory activity. </p><p>The aim of this study is to compare two different ibuprofen post-operative pain management schemes for minor hand surgery procedures performed with local anaesthesia in an outpatient setting in relation to pain control.</p><p>The main objective of the study is pain level comparison, measured as visual analog scale (VAS) between the treatment groups at scheduled times in the peri-operative period.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were VAS value variation before the operation and during follow-up between groups, the use of rescue medication, and the rate of complications related to pain management strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval for this phase 4 triple blind randomized trial (Ethical Committee N&#x000b0; 5/2009) was provided by the Provincial Ethics Committee of Modena (<italic>Comitato Etico Provinciale</italic>), Modena, Italy (Chairperson Prof. Sandro Spinsanti) on February 5, 2009.</p><p>Patients included in this study were at least 18 years old and candidates for trigger finger release, carpal tunnel release, De Quervain tenosynovitis operation, surgical correction of minor bone injuries or pathologies under local anaesthesia. </p><p>Patients were excluded from this study on the basis of allergy to the drug(s) used and a positive medical history of gastric or duodenal ulcers.</p><p>The study was conducted at the <italic>Policlinico</italic> Teaching Hospital (Modena, Italy) in the Department of Pathologies of the Locomotor System.

</p><p>A non-parametric K-sample equality of median test was performed to assess the difference in pain levels related to the type of surgery. No statistically significant differences were present during the procedures and follow-up.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in the use of rescue therapy during follow-up. Acetaminophen was used 6 times in group A and 6 times in group B.</p><p>No drug-related adverse effects were reported during follow-up. There was a main limitation to these results: the relatively small sample size, which may reduce the clinical significance of these findings, which may be further magnified by the fact that data were collected in a single centre, which may lead to a selection bias on the basis of a specific case-mix treated during data collection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This triple blind randomized control trial showed a substantial equivalence in post-operative pain control, especially during the later phases of follow-up. Median pain levels were under the threshold for rescue medication for most of the patients.</p><p>For minor hand surgery procedures such as trigger finger release, De Quervain tenosynovitis operation topical and local anaesthesia seemed to be a viable solution, especially in the out-patient setting for its safety and effectiveness, an effective postoperative pain control therapy maximizes the benefits of topical and local anaesthesia. Ibuprofen with acetaminophen as rescue therapy offered good post-operative pain relief with a similar VAS values profile between groups.</p><p>A pre-operative dose of ibuprofen did not appear to influence post-operative pain levels apart from T1. This, however, may not be considered a pre-emptive analgesic effect, as a way to provide inflammatory mediator reduction by inhibiting their production pathway before its activation. It may be the result of a timely plasma concentration peak to cover the end of such procedures. </p><p>Ibuprofen is a commonly used NSAID<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> due to its analgesic properties with a low incidence of the most common adverse effects of this class of drugs. It is well absorbed orally with a peak serum concentrations in 1 to 2 hours after administration. This could be, nonetheless, a useful technique for maintaining a more stable pain curve while the patient is recovering from anaesthesia.</p><p>The absence of post-operative complications is in line with out-patient requirements.</p><p>Quality of life was minimally affected as most of the subjects experienced no to mild pain during follow-up. Only a minority of patients reported VAS greater than 40 mm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>If administered pre-operatively, ibuprofen can reduce pain levels in the immediate post-operative period, more significantly than an early post-operative dose.</p><p>This strategy could better couple anaesthesia and pain control therapy without additional negative side effects. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>AKNOWLDGEMENTS/</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Pre-scatto Investigators Claudio Castagnetti MD, Alessandro Bonito Lt., Vincenzo Esperti Lt., Concetta D.
