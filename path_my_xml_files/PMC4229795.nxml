Prolonging the duration of culture to day 5 allows chromosomally competent embryos to develop to the blastocyst stage and permits selection of embryos that have the potential for continued development under embryonic genomic control.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In addition, selection of day 5 embryos has the advantage of physiological synchronization with the uterine endometrium, thereby resulting in better implantation rates.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The introduction of sequential media that takes into account the changing metabolic requirement of the embryo, as it develops from the zygote to the blastocyst stage, allows extended culture.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Blastocyst transfer should enable transfer of fewer, but higher quality embryos resulting in increased implantation rates. This would maintain a high pregnancy rate while controlling the multiple pregnancy rates.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Reasons for higher success rates with blastocysts are mainly related to embryo selection process. Embryos selected for transfer on day 5 are healthier and carry a lower risk of being aneuploidy, thereby increasing patients&#x02019; chance of achieving an on-going pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Although blastocyst transfer has been shown to be beneficial in good prognosis patients, similar benefits were not seen in an unselected group. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of blastocyst transfer in comparison with day 3 embryo transfer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Three hundred patients aged 25-40 years undergoing <italic>in-vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF)/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle between May 2010 and April 2011 were included in our study, meeting the inclusion criteria set namely, 2-20 years of infertility, having minimum five oocytes at oocyte pick up and endometrial thickness of 7 mm and more indicating good ovarian response, having normal uterine cavity and basal follicle stimulating hormone level (FSH &#x0003c; 10 mIU/ml). Complete patient work-up, baseline routine investigations, and hormonal analysis were done, and postmenstrual diagnostic hysteroscopy was done. Patient was put on long protocol, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists started on cycle day 21 daily doses given subcutaneously till cycle day 3. Hormonal evaluation&#x02013;serum FSH, luteinizing hormone, estradiol (E2) and transvaginal sonography was done on day 3 to confirm down-regulation. Induction with recombinant FSH (rFSH) was started once pituitary down-regulation was confirmed. The dose schedule was modified according to parameters such as body mass index, previous response, and ovarian reserve estimates and was given for 5 days (days 3-7). Follicular monitoring was initiated on day 8 of the cycle, and further dose of rFSH was given according to follicle size and continued till day 11. Patients were scheduled for oocyte retrieval once at least 3 follicles reached 18 mm size and injection human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 10,000 IU was given. Transvaginal sonography guided oocyte retrieval was then planned 36 h after hCG, which was performed under short general anesthesia.</p><p>The retrieved oocytes were then incubated for 3-4 h in IVF-30 media and then depending on maturity of oocytes and previous IVF performance, IVF or ICSI was performed. Short incubation insemination for 2 h and group culture was followed for IVF.</p><p>Denudation of oocytes was carried out before ICSI was performed. Oocytes were incubated overnight in IVF-30 media in a carbon dioxide incubator and observed after 16-18 h postinsemination for fertilization. The fertilized oocytes were then transferred into a cleavage medium and incubated. Embryos were observed on day 2 and transfer was scheduled according to random allocation of patients into two groups based on availability of minimum three good quality embryos:</p><p>Group 1: Included patients undergoing embryo transfer on day 3, and Group 2 in which extended culture till day 5 was done in G2 plus media and blastocyst was transferred on day 5.</p><p>Random allocation of patients was done equally so that study population in both groups was comparable. The number of blastocysts/embryos transferred was determined by the availability of embryos, patients&#x02019; age and previous clinical history. Not more than three embryos/blastocysts were transferred on any occasion. All transfers were performed using Edward&#x02013;Wallace catheter. Luteal support was given in the form of micronized vaginal progesterone in dose of 200 mg thrice a day for 18 days postretrieval. In addition, injection hCG 2000 IU was given intramuscular on days 5<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 11<sup>th</sup> after retrieval. Serum beta-hCG was performed on day 15 following embryo transfer, and if positive then transvaginal sonography was performed 15 days later to detect and confirm intra-uterine pregnancy. Positive cases were followed till 6 weeks to check for fetal cardiac activity.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>

In this study, no significant difference was found between both the study groups in terms of age, duration of infertility, indication of infertility, and type of infertility. This was in agreement with the study conducted by Van der Auwera <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The mean number of embryos transferred in both groups showed no significant difference (2.04 and 1.93, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>In our study, the proportion of clinical pregnancies occurring as a result of blastocyst transfer was higher 66 (44%) as compared to cleavage stage embryo transfer which was 45 (30%), the association was statistically significant and similar results were seen in the study by Van der Auwera <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Mangalraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although the fertilization rate was higher with blastocyst transfer (65.34%) compared to day 3 embryo transfer (64.96%) in our study, but association was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and same association was observed in the study of Mangalraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Among both the study groups, cleavage rate (74.62% and 83.43%) and implantation rate (21.35% and 35.17%) were significantly higher in blastocyst transfer/group 2 over day 3 embryo transfer/group 1. The results of our study were similar to the study by Van der Auwera <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Mangalraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although the proportion of multiple pregnancies in our study was higher with blastocyst transfer (48.48%) than with embryo transfer (31.81%), but the association was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Thus, in younger women with good ovarian response and three or more grade-I embryos on day 3, extended culture can be offered. The good clinical pregnancy and implantation rates observed will confidently allow transfer of not more than two good quality blastocysts and allow women to enjoy benefits of limiting numbers for transfer. Hence, by transferring fewer embryos at blastocyst stage in selected group of good prognostic patients, physicians are practicing preventive medicine as there are fewer multiple gestations and ultimately greater pregnancy success is achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study has shown that in younger patients with good ovarian response extended culture to day 5 can be offered as blastocyst transfer is found to have good clinical pregnancy rates. The good clinical pregnancy and implantation rates observed will confidently allow transfer of not more than two good quality blastocysts and allow women to enjoy the benefits of limiting numbers for transfer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Racowsky</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>KV</given-names></name><name><surname>Cekleniak</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hornstein</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ginsburg</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The number of eight-cell embryos is a key determinant for selecting day 3 or day 5 transfer</article-title><source>Fertil Steril</source><year>2000</year><volume>73</volume><fpage>558</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10689013</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alper</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Brinsden</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikland</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>To blastocyst or not to blastocyst?
