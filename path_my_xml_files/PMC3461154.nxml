The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling. We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a face-to-face consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 6600 persons (50&#x02013;75 years) were 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone. In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening. A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees. Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24&#x00025;) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25&#x00025;) a face-to-face consultation (<italic>P</italic>=0.41). Subsequently, 674 (20&#x00025;) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23&#x00025;) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (<italic>P</italic>=0.018). Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable. More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 98.5&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>=0.014).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based CRC colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>colonoscopy/&#x0002a;methods</kwd><kwd>colorectal neoplasms&#x0002a;</kwd><kwd>humans</kwd><kwd>interviews as topic/methods</kwd><kwd>mass screening/methods</kwd><kwd>prevention and control</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) are being implemented in most Western countries. In 2009, 19 out of 27 European countries had established or were preparing a population-based or opportunistic CRC screening programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zavoral <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Although screening for CRC is gaining acceptance throughout the world, a consensus on the preferred strategy is still lacking. Colonoscopy is a colorectal exam with a high accuracy to detect colorectal neoplasia and one of the recommended screening strategies by the US Taskforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levin <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Colonoscopy is, however, a burdensome procedure that requires complete colon lavage. For a primary screening test, it has a relatively high complication rate of 0.1&#x02013;0.3&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nelson <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Panteris <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). When colonoscopy is used as a primary screening method, the risks and benefits of screening therefore have to be explained to participants before screening to enable informed decision making. Besides, information on a person's medical history and medication use should be obtained to anticipate on possible risks during colonoscopy. On one hand screenees need to be adequately informed on the risks and benefits of the procedure, and on the other hand the endoscopist and screening organisation require adequate information on the health status of the individual screenee and the need for any specific precautions. Both aims can be achieved in a pre-colonoscopy consultation.</p><p>Most hospitals in the Netherlands invite patients at the outpatient clinic prior to colonoscopy. Although this is working well in daily clinical practice, it may overload the outpatient clinic when used in screening.</p><p>An alternative for a face-to-face consultation could be a telephone consultation. Travelling to and from the hospital with absence from home or work would no longer be necessary, which could facilitate participation. On the other hand, bowel preparation may be less well explained during telephone conversations, which would lead to lower quality exams. Telephone conversations may provide less room for additional questions, leading to lower satisfaction levels and inferior participation rates. Furthermore, participants' expected burden of the colonoscopy might be influenced by the type of assessment.</p><p>The primary aim of this randomised trial was to compare the response rate and participation rate with pre-colonoscopy assessment by telephone to that of a face-to-face consultation at the outpatient clinic. Secondary outcomes were participants' satisfaction, expected and perceived burden and quality of bowel preparation. Our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis was that more invitees would have a pre-colonoscopy assessment in the telephone group than in the face-to-face group, because these invitees could stay at home or at work during the consultation. We expected that a higher response rate in the telephone group would lead to a higher colonoscopy participation rate, because these invitees would have to come to the hospital only once. We also expected participants in the face-to-face group to be more satisfied with the consultation and that the quality of bowel preparation would be higher in this group. We anticipated no difference between both groups regarding expected burden and perceived burden of the colonoscopy.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Randomisation and invitation</title><p>A group of 6600 persons aged 50&#x02013;75 years of the general Dutch population in the regions Amsterdam and Rotterdam was randomly allocated, prior to invitation, to either a face-to-face pre-colonoscopy consultation (<italic>n</italic>=3298) or a telephone consultation (<italic>n</italic>=3302) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Individuals were identified using the electronic databases of the regional municipal administration registration. Randomisation was performed per household. The randomisation was performed by TENALEA, using ALEA Randomisation software (version 2.2) (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), based on a minimisation algorithm taking into account age (50&#x02013;55, 55&#x02013;60, 60&#x02013;65, 65&#x02013;70 and 70&#x02013;75), gender and socio-economic status (very low, low, average, high and very high). At the time of the trial, the Netherlands did not have a CRC screening programme.</p><p>All individuals were invited between June 2009 and July 2010 by the Regional Comprehensive Centres in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. They received a pre-announcement, followed by an invitation and an information leaflet, containing information on CRC in general, the advantages and disadvantages of screening, possible risks and follow-up in case of a positive test result. If invitees failed to respond, they were sent a reminder letter 4 weeks later for the same assessment type as in the first invitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Wijkerslooth <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The overall design of the COCOS (COlonoscopy or COlonography for Screening) trial has been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Wijkerslooth <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The primary outcomes of the COCOS trial (participation rate and diagnostic yield) were published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stoop <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Ethical approval was obtained from the Dutch Health Council (2009/03WBO, The Hague, The Netherlands). The trial was included in the Dutch trial register prior to its initiation: NTR1829 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl">www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-colonoscopy assessment</title><p>At two academic centres in the Netherlands, face-to-face and telephone pre-colonoscopy consultations were performed by clinical research staff. A formalized consultation was performed with standardized questions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) using a shared database in both hospitals. For both consultation types, 30&#x02009;min were scheduled. During the consultation, possible screening exclusion criteria were discussed. Persons were excluded when they had had a full colonic exam (colonoscopy, double contrast barium enema or CT colonography) in the previous 5 years or when they were in a surveillance programme because of a personal history of CRC, colonic adenomas or inflammatory bowel disease. Persons with an end-stage disease and a life expectancy &#x0003c;5 years were also excluded.</p><p>If additional information was needed on possible exclusion criteria or contraindications for the screening procedure, the general practitioner or medical specialist was contacted for further information. In the telephone group, respondents were invited at the outpatient clinic if the research staff felt that the telephone consultation had been inadequate.</p><p>During the second part of the consultation, information was given regarding the colonoscopy itself. Duration, discomfort and possible complications, such as bleeding or perforation (0.1&#x02013;0.3&#x00025;), were discussed. The research staff explained about the possibility of using conscious sedation (midazolam) and/or analgesics (fentanyl) during the procedure.</p><p>Invitees received detailed information about the bowel preparation during the consultation. In addition, they were handed bowel preparation materials. In the telephone group, this was distributed by mail. At the end of the consultation, information was given on how test results would be reported and corresponding follow-up measures. Informed consent was discussed during the assessment and, subsequently, an informed consent form was sent by postal mail to potential participants together with an information leaflet for reference. Participants were asked to return the informed consent form by mail before the scheduled colonoscopy.</p><p>At the end of the consultation, an appointment was made for the actual colonoscopy. All individuals who agreed to participate were sent a confirmation of the appointment for colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline questionnaire</title><p>The first 5924 invitees received a validated baseline questionnaire by postal mail. Respondents to the first screening invitation received the questionnaire after the prior consultation, within 4 weeks before the scheduled colonoscopy. Invitees who had not responded to the initial invitation received the same baseline questionnaire 4 weeks after the initial invitation, together with the reminder. All individuals were asked to complete the questionnaire and to return it by mail in a pre-paid envelope.</p><p>The baseline questionnaire comprised items regarding satisfaction with the prior consultation (SQ) and expected burden (EBQ) of the colonoscopy (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Items on satisfaction were based on a previously validated questionnaire on satisfaction in eight university hospitals in The Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Prismant: Trends in tevredenheid, 2008</xref>). Satisfaction was scored on a four-point scale ranging from very satisfied to very unsatisfied. Expected burden was itemised into expected embarrassment, pain and burden of the bowel preparation and the colonoscopy itself and was previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Gelder <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denters <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hol <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The EBQ burden items such as embarrassment, pain and burden during the procedure were scored on five-point rating scales labelled as not embarrassing, painful or burdensome, to extremely embarrassing, painful or burdensome (1=not at all; 2=slightly; 3= somewhat; 4=rather; and 5=extremely). The questionnaire also collected information on background characteristics, such as educational and income levels. Completed baseline questionnaires were scanned and responses were automatically transferred to a database.</p></sec><sec><title>Perceived burden questionnaire (PBQ)</title><p>A PBQ was sent to screening participants, 2 weeks after the colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants received this questionnaire together with their final test results. Participants were asked to fill in the PBQ questionnaire directly after receiving it and to return by mail in a pre-paid envelope. If participants did not respond, they were not reminded. This questionnaire had also been previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Gelder <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deutekom <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denters <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hol <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). It comprised colonoscopy-related items as well as items on the full procedure (including bowel preparation, colonoscopy itself, post-procedure follow-up and waiting for the test results). The perceived burden questions are listed in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All burden items were scored on a five-point rating scale ranging from not embarrassing, painful or burdensome to extremely embarrassing, painful or burdensome (1=not at all; 2=slightly; 3= somewhat; 4=rather; and 5=extremely). Participants were also asked about their willingness to participate in a future screening round (1=absolutely not; 2=probably not; 3=probably; and 4=certainly). Completed PBQs questionnaires were scanned and responses were automatically transferred to a database.</p></sec><sec><title>Colonoscopy</title><p>All colonoscopies were performed by experienced gastroenterologists (&#x02a7e;1000 colonoscopies) according to the standard quality recommendations of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rex <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Conscious sedation (midazolam) and analgesics (fentanyl) were administered intravenously at the discretion of the participant and the endoscopist. Withdrawal time was at least 6&#x02009;min. For bowel preparation, 2&#x02009;l of polyethylene electrolyte glycol solution (Moviprep; Norgine BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) together with 2&#x02009;l transparent fluid and a low-fibre diet for 2 days were used. Bowel preparation was scored using the validated Ottawa bowel preparation score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rostom and Jolicoeur, 2004</xref>) and classified as excellent (0&#x02013;3), good (4&#x02013;6), sufficient (7&#x02013;10) or inadequate (11&#x02013;14). In case of inadequate bowel preparation, the colonoscopy was interrupted and re-scheduled, unless the participant refused to undergo re-colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The analysis was based on the intention-to-screen principle. The primary outcome measures were the response rate, defined as the number of invitees attending the pre-colonoscopy consultation relative to the total number of invitees, and the participation rate, defined as the number of invitees who underwent a colonoscopy relative to the total number of invitees. Differences in response and participation rates between groups were evaluated using Chi-square test statistics. Results were not adjusted for clustering, as in most instances there were only one or two eligible subjects per household. Items on satisfaction of the consultation and expected and perceived burden of the colonoscopy were expressed as mean scores and compared using Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Expected burden was compared for all invitees, responders (invitees who attended the consultation) and non-participants (responders who did not attend the colonoscopy). In the analysis of the expected burden and satisfaction scores for responders, questionnaires were excluded if completed before the consultation. All the baseline questionnaires that had not been completed before the colonoscopy were excluded from the analysis. Quality of bowel preparation was expressed as percentages per category and compared using Chi-square statistics. The software programme SPSS for Windows, version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all of the analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We expected an overall participation rate of 25&#x00025; in colonoscopy screening. We anticipated a participation rate of 22.5&#x00025; in the face-to-face group <italic>vs</italic> 27.5&#x00025; in the telephone consultation group. Including 5000 invitees in this trial would result in a power of 98&#x00025; to reject the null hypothesis of no difference, using two degrees of freedom Chi-square test with a significance level set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Response and participation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> summarises the study flow.

After the pre-colonoscopy consultation, 102 responders in the telephone group and 65 in the face-to-face group decided not to undergo a colonoscopy. The participation rate was significantly lower in the telephone group: 674 invitees (20&#x00025;) had a screening colonoscopy after the telephone consultation <italic>vs</italic> 752 (23&#x00025;) in the face-to-face group (<italic>P</italic>=0.018).

Information provided during the consultation was kept similar; a standardised questionnaire was used to keep the two assessment types comparable. In each centre, the same research staff performed both types of assessments, minimising bias in the comparison. Nevertheless, differences may have occurred in the information exchanged with invitees. At the outpatient clinic, information supply can be simplified and made clearer using visual aids, for example.</p><p>In our study, 20&#x00025; of the invitees in the telephone group participated in screening and 23&#x00025; in the face-to-face group. This compares well with the attendance rates in other colonoscopy screening programs. The participation rate in colonoscopy population screening in Australia was 16&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Two Italian randomized controlled trials, in which invitees were selected by general practitioners, reported primary colonoscopy participation rates of 10 and 27&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Segnan <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lisi <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The annual participation rates for the age group 55&#x02013;69 years in the opportunistic colonoscopy screening programme in Germany are 3&#x00025; for men and 4&#x00025; for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brenner <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, only one previous, non-randomised study compared a face-to-face pre-colonoscopy assessment with a telephone assessment in CRC screening using gFOBT as the primary screening method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rodger and Steele, 2008</xref>). This retrospective study, performed in Scotland, compared participation, satisfaction of the participant, and quality of bowel preparation in 316 gFOBT-positive participants in the first year of screening (with a face-to-face consultation) with 388 gFOBT-positive participants in the second year of screening (with a choice for face-to-face or telephone consultation). Overall, colonoscopy attendance was significantly higher in the second year: 99&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 85&#x00025;. These results are difficult to compare with ours, because of the non-randomized nature of the study and the optional choice for a face-to-face interview in the second year. Both in the Scottish study and in our study, quality of bowel preparation did not differ between the two groups.</p><p>Prior to colonoscopy, accurate information on bowel preparation must be provided to perform a high-quality exam. Inadequate bowel preparation can result in missed lesions, cancelled procedures, increased procedural time and a potential increase in complication rates. Adherence to instructions for preparation can be achieved by an accurate explanation prior to colonoscopy. Characteristics like age, gender, weight and comorbidity must be obtained before colonoscopy, because these may influence the quality of bowel preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chung <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Here also, in screening participants, we found no significant differences between both groups. This indicates that a telephone interview can be an adequate mode for preparing participants for colonoscopy.</p><p>In our study, we found significant differences in satisfaction between groups. It is conceivable that when participants feel satisfied with the personal attention and the opportunity to ask questions, they will be more compliant with screening. One may assume that a high level of satisfaction strengthens continuity of the participant&#x02013;physician relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ware and Hays, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haddad <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Several previous studies have evaluated satisfaction regarding the colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chartier <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ko <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In concordance with our results, usually very high satisfaction rates are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rosenthal and Shannon, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Expected burden may also influence participation in CRC screening. If invitees expect the colonoscopy to be highly burdensome, they can decide, before or after the pre-colonoscopy assessment, not to undergo colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Multicentre Australian Colorectal-neoplasia Screening (MACS) Group, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ko <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Expected burden can be influenced by the way the information is provided during the pre-colonoscopy assessment. In our study, significantly more invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be painful than in the face-to-face group. Not only expected burden but also perceived burden of colonoscopy influences the participation rate in future screening rounds. In our study, perceived burden was comparable between both groups, as well as the willingness to participate in a future screening round (96&#x00025;). This suggests that the mode of pre-colonoscopy assessment does not affect the experience of actual screening participants.</p><p>Actual differences in satisfaction and expected burden scores between both groups were small, which makes the clinical relevance arguable. In a review published in 2003, the minimally important difference for health-related quality of life instruments was computed. In this review, the authors concluded that, to indicate clinical relevance, a difference of at least half a s.d. is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Norman <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, CRC screening by definition has to deal with large populations, and the impact of screening fully relies on consistent participation during repeated screening rounds. As such, small differences become relevant.</p><p>It is possible that other factors, besides expected burden and satisfaction with the assessment, caused invitees in the telephone group to refrain more often from actual participation. Unfortunately, a considerable proportion of responders who did not attend colonoscopy failed to report the reason for not participating. Maybe the way in which the contact is initiated affects the developing physician&#x02013;patient relationship. We know from other studies that this relationship can be influenced by the way participants are approached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ha and Longnecker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moretti <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Non-verbal communication between a doctor and a patient affects patient's satisfaction. Behaviour such as sitting close to the patient and leaning forward have been associated with higher patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roter <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pawlikowska <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). A Dutch study reported on end points in medical communication to improve physician&#x02013;patient communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Haes and Bensing, 2009</xref>). The authors suggested that one of the ways to check if a good physician&#x02013;patient relationship is being established is to have eye contact with the patient, something which is obviously not possible during a telephone conversation. Having eye contact also enables the physician to check whether information given during the assessment is understood.</p><p>Although, response rates in both groups were similar, the telephone group had a higher post-consultation drop-out rate, or in other words a lower post-consultation uptake of colonoscopy, which is of key importance for the impact of CRC screening. The uptake rate of colonoscopy using a telephone consultation needs to be improved. Therefore, further research should focus on how to raise colonoscopy participation rate after a telephone consultation. Maybe an interactive conversation using a computer or information about the screening colonoscopy on video might increase commitment. Besides, information supply could be done using internet or email.</p><p>There may be alternatives to the face-to-face assessment as done in this study to evaluate and inform potential screening participants. One example is the additional use of a pre-assessment questionnaire. Future research should investigate the safety and preference of additional measures for improving pre-colonoscopy assessment in colonoscopy screening.</p><p>In summary, we found that a similar number of invitees responded to an invitation for a telephone consultation and to an invitation for a face-face consultation in a population-based CRC screening programme using colonoscopy as the primary screening method. The number of invitees who decided not to participate was significantly higher after the telephone assessment, whereas satisfaction was lower and expected burden higher. We therefore do not recommend switching to telephone consultation in primary colonoscopy screening programmes for CRC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development of the Dutch Ministry of Health (ZonMW 120720012 and 121010005) and by the Centre for Translational Molecular Medicine (CTMM DeCoDe-project).
