Brazil. The most common forms are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), spindle cell carcinoma
(SCC), and melanoma, which account for 70%, 25%, and 4% of all skin cancers
respectively.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
</p><p>The estimated countrywide incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers in 2010 was 53,410 new
cases in men and 60,440 new cases in women, according to the Cancer Incidence Estimates
published by the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA). These figures correspond to
an estimated risk of 56 new cases per 100,000 men and 61 new cases per 100,000 women.
With early diagnosis and treatment, these malignancies are highly curable. Despite their
high incidence, only 1,296 deaths attributable to nonmelanoma skin cancer were recorded
in Brazil in 2007.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
</p><p>A variety of treatment modalities are available for cutaneous neoplasms, including
cryotherapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, photodynamic therapy, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, imiquimod, and surgical excision.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>Another treatment option is Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), a particular type of
dermatologic surgery that involves minimal margins controlled by performing horizontal
frozen sections during the procedure.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In view of the increased incidence of
skin cancer in the last decades, there is a need for improvement of the Mohs technique
so as to optimize its efficacy.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>Dermoscopy, or dermatoscopy, is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that is very useful
in the assessment of cutaneous lesions, as it enables visualization of structures
invisible to the naked eye.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Dermoscopy is performed with an instrument known as a
dermoscope or dermatoscope, which provides (on average) a tenfold magnification of skin
structures.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>The present study advances a new proposal for use of dermoscopy as an adjunct to therapy
rather than as a diagnostic method alone.</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the impact of dermoscopy on demarcation of surgical margins for MMS and
ascertain whether the use of this method can shorten operative time and,
consequently, decrease surgical morbidity and cost.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All methodological aspects of this study were in compliance with the current Brazilian
legislation for human subjects research, as set forth in National Health Council
Resolution 196/96, and with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the hospital where it was
conducted.</p><p>This was a prospective, non-randomized study.</p><p>Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and clinical indications for MMS were recruited
from the outpatient oncologic dermatology clinic of Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas da Universidade
Federal do Paran&#x000e1; from April 2009 to August 2011. These patients were allocated into two
groups: control (group I) and intervention - MMS with dermoscopy-guided margins (group
II).</p><p>In both groups, all lesions were first assessed with the naked eye and had their margins
demarcated in blue or black marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). In
the intervention group, tumors were also assessed under dermoscopy for determination of
dermoscopic margins, which were drawn in red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>). The outermost margin was used to define the surgical margin (initially 2
mm).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Demarcation of surgical margins in a control group patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-01-0038-g01"/></fig><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Dermoscopic demarcation of margins in an intervention group patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-01-0038-g02"/></fig><p>Changes in skin texture due to tumor proliferation and a finding of tumor structures in
the skin adjacent to the demarcated clinical margin were considered dermoscopic patterns
indicative of lesion extension beyond the clinical margins.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The presence of whitish or erythematous areas or
superficial ulcerations on dermoscopy were deemed criteria for alteration of the
initially demarcated margins.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
Nonmelanoma pigmented lesions were examined for structures such as blue/gray globules,
leaf-like areas, and spoke-wheel areas, among other characteristics described in greater
detail later.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Examination of
nonpigmented lesions was guided by the vascular structures usually present in skin
lesions, such as arborizing or glomerular vessels. In case of doubt, the margins were
defined on the basis of this area.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p><p>The dermoscope used for the study was a DermLite Hybrid contact dermoscopy device with
10x magnification capabilities. Clinical and dermoscopic images were obtained with a
10.1-megapixel Sony DSC-W179 digital camera.</p><p>The number of surgical stages required in each of the two groups was analyzed to
ascertain whether dermoscopy had an impact on the MMS workflow. Statistical analysis was
conducted by means of the chisquare test, at a significance level of 5%.</p><p>Any modifications to surgical margins made after dermoscopy were measured in
millimeters. Furthermore, the profile of the study population - including variables such
as sex, age, and lesion site and histological type - was also analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 44 patients undergoing MMS were selected for the study. The first 21 patients
referred for surgical treatment were allocated to the control group, and the rest to the
intervention group (dermoscopyguided surgical margins).</p><p>In the control group, the mean age was 61 years, and 62% of patients (n=13) were female.
In the intervention group, mean age was 58 years and 61% (n=14) were female. Fourteen
patients in group I (67%) had a prior history of cutaneous malignancy, versus 12
patients (52%) in group II. Overall, 17% of tumors in the control group (n=4) were
recurrences, versus 13% (n=3) in group II.</p><p>In the control group, 83% of lesions (n=19) were BCCs, 13% (n=3) were SCCs, and 4%
(n=1), metatypical carcinoma. In group II, BCCs accounted for 87% of all lesions (n=20),
and SCCs, for 13% (n=3). In both groups, the nose was the most common site of lesion
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Graph 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">2</xref>).</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>GRAPH 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of histological types in the control group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-01-0038-g03"/></fig><fig id="f04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>GRAPH 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of histological types in the intervention group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-01-0038-g04"/></fig><p>The mean lesion size was 0.78 (0.3-1.5) cm (mode, 1 cm) in group I and 1.18 (0.4-3.0) cm

exact test (p=0.003).</p><p>Dermoscopic examination of lesions in the intervention group resulted in an increase in
surgical margins in at least one area in all cases. Quantitatively, the increase in
margins ranged from 0.5 mm to 7 mm (mean, 2.26 mm; mode, 1 mm).</p><p>In the control group, MMS was performed in a single stage in 57% of cases (n=13) and in
two stages in the remaining cases. In the intervention group, the surgery was completed
in a single stage in 52% of cases (n=12), in two stages in 35% (n=8), in three stages in
9% (n=2), and in four stages in 4% (n=1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Graph 3</xref>

cure rates and the lowest recurrence rates in the treatment of skin cancer, the most
prevalent malignancy in the general population.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
</p><p>In MMS, the tumor is excised and its peripheral and deep margins are assessed
histologically ("micro") during the procedure, thus enabling a precise mapping
("graphic") of the lesion. Margins are examined by means of horizontal sections, rather
than the standard vertical sections.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> MMS permits individualized treatment and
identification of subclinical extensions.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p><p>Historically, MMS was developed by Frederic Mohs at the University of Wisconsin in the
1930s and first described in 1941. It was initially known as chemosurgery due to the use
of a zinc chloride-based paste for <italic>in vivo </italic>tissue fixation, a painful
procedure that took 24 hours on average. The tumor was removed, sectioned, and stained,
and all margins were examined microscopically during the procedure. If any tissue
involvement was identified, the surgical margins were widened after an additional
fixation cycle, on the basis of a map of the excised tissue. In 1953, the procedure was
modified to employ fresh tissue histology for margin assessment, decreasing patient
discomfort while producing equivalent outcomes, as proven by Tromovitch &#x00026; Stegman in
1974.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
</p><p>Currently, lesions are excised with a 2-3 mm margin. The tissue is then mapped to
determine the location of each section for histological examination. The surgical
specimen is frozen, cut into horizontal sections, and stained. The peripheral and deep
margins are examined by the surgeon. If there is any remaining tumor tissue, another
excision is performed, restricted to the site of the positive margin as marked on the
surgical map.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> These steps are repeated until completely tumor-free
margins are achieved.</p><p>MMS provides histological control of 100% of the surgical margin with maximal
preservation of healthy adjacent tissue.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This leads to greater preservation of
important anatomic structures, making reconstruction simpler and safer, providing better
cosmetic and functional results and reducing the risk of recurrence.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
</p><p>The main histological types in which MMS is indicated are the aggressive subtypes of BCC
(sclerodermiform, infiltrative, and micronodular), highgrade or invasive SCC, adnexal
neoplasms, and dermatofibrosarcomas. Its use in melanoma is still
controversial.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10 </xref></sup>MMS is
indicated in the treatment of locally invasive cutaneous tumors, recurrent tumors or
those with a high risk of recurrence, those with poorly defined borders, those larger
than 2 cm, lesions with perineural invasion, those located at sites where preservation
of adjacent tissues is essential (eyelid, nose, extremities of the feet and hands,
genitalia), and those located where the risk of recurrence is greatest, such as
branchial cleft sites.</p><p>Despite its many benefits, MMS is still constrained by limitations regarding operative
time and required infrastructure.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Regarding cost, Cook <italic>et al
</italic>showed that the cost of single-stage or two-stage MMS is equivalent to that of
conventional surgery.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, due to
the low rates of recurrence, there is less need for supplemental therapy and,
consequently, lower additional costs.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
</p><p>In an attempt to improve on MMS and minimize its restrictions, some techniques - such as
curettage and photodynamic therapy - are sometimes used to demarcate tumor margins with
greater precision. However, there is no standard protocol for determination of tumor
extent prior to definition of surgical margins, an essential step for reduction of
operative time.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>The present study assessed whether the use of dermoscopy for demarcation of surgical
margins could improve the Mohs technique. A 10x-magnification dermoscope was chosen due
to practical considerations, as this is the most widely used device in daily clinical
practice, although it does not provide the wealth of detail obtained with
40x-magnification digital dermoscopes.</p><p>Dermoscopy, also known as dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy, or surface
microscopy, is a noninvasive technique that is very useful for assessment of skin
lesions, as it enables visualization of structures invisible to the naked eye.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It is the diagnostic
tool that has had the single greatest clinical impact on the practice of
dermatology.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Dermoscopy enables
<italic>in vivo </italic>assessment of tissues from the epidermis down to the
reticular dermis, and thus represents an interface between clinical practice and
histopathology.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>Dermoscopic assessment of skin lesions reduces the uncertainty of clinical examination,
improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling detection of tumors at earlier
stages.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, it
prevents unnecessary biopsies and can provide guidance on the optimal site for biopsy,
thus allowing the dermatopathologist to focus on the area of greatest clinical
suspicion, which improves histopathological accuracy.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
</p><p>First developed for assessment of pigmented lesions, dermoscopy is now employed in the
examination of other cutaneous lesions, such as nonmelanoma skin cancers, angiomas,
sebaceous hyperplasia, and hair and nail disorders. Use of dermoscopy for therapeutic
monitoring of imiquimod treatment has also been reported.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
</p><p>Caresana &#x00026; Giardini described the use of dermoscopy to assist in the determination
of the peripheral borders of BCCs and reduce the surgical margin to 2 mm for
conventional surgery, achieving a 98.5% rate of complete tumor excision.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Another potential application is the
enhancement of margin demarcation for MMS, as tested herein.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>Dermoscopy is a simple and practical technique whereby a dermoscope, a handheld device
with 10x magnification, is used to examine the skin. In contact dermoscopy, the device
emits a beam of light that strikes the skin at a 20&#x000ba; angle. To eliminate reflections and
thus enable better visualization of lesion structures, a fluid (oil, water gel,
glycerin, or ethanol gel) is placed between the skin and the device.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Polarized light dermoscopes, which do
not require the use of fluids and thus shorten the examination time, are another option.
Despite their more practical nature, these dermoscopes can distort colors. Several of
these devices also have contact dermoscopy capabilities in an attempt to minimize such
color distortions.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for assessment of pigmented lesions are well established, and
several assessment methods are known, such as the ABCD rule, the 7-point checklist, the
point rule, and Menzies' method.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Diagnosis of pigmented BCC is based on the absence of a pigmented network and the
presence of at least one of the following criteria: multiple bluegray globules;
leaf-like areas; spoke-wheel areas; large, blue-gray ovoid nests; ulcerations; and
arborizing telangiectasias.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
Concentric structures (early phase of spoke-wheel areas) and multiple "in focus"
bluegray dots are considered non-classic patterns.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Additionally, pigmented BCCs may also present with dermoscopic
features commonly found in melanocytic lesions, such as brown-to-black dots or globules,
veil-like structures, and pseudopods. The frequency at which these structures are found
increases with the degree of lesion pigmentation.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p><p>In non-pigmented BCC, particular attention should be paid to vascular
structures.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Whitish to erythematous, translucent to opaque areas
free of vascular structures are characteristic. Multiple, small superficial ulcerations
(n&#x02265;5 and &#x02264;1mm diameter) and fine, superficial telangiectasias are frequent. Arborizing
vessels are the most specific finding, although not the most common one.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
</p><p>Vascular patterns play a very important role in the differential diagnosis of skin
tumors. According to Argenziano <italic>et al</italic>, dotted vessels are also commonly
found on dermoscopy, and are mostly associated with Spitz nevi. Linear-irregular vessels
are common in melanoma, which can also feature dotted and atypical vessels. Congenital
nevi are associated with comma vessels. Glomerular vessels are seen in Bowen disease.
Crown vessels are seen in sebaceous hyperplasia. Finally, hairpin vessels are most
closely correlated with seborrheic keratoses, but can also be observed in SCC.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In addition to the aforementioned
hairpin vessels, glomerular vessels amid areas of desquamation have also been reported
in SCC.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Criteria for dermoscopic diagnosis of some adnexal neoplasms have
only been described in case reports.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p><p>Superficial tumor-related telangiectasias are often difficult to distinguish on
photodamaged skin with actinic lesions and severe poikiloderma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, tumor margins may be difficult to demarcate
in patients with biopsy or previous surgery scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Figure
4</xref>).<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>

so in the present study. Possible explanations for the absence of significant
differences between the control and intervention groups include the fact that, in
lesions with overt clinical characteristics, the impact of dermoscopy is relatively
minor, and therefore not associated with a change in the number of surgical stages of
MMS.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, subclinical
extensions are unpredictable and, although dermoscopy can guide excision of lateral
margins, preoperative assessment of deep margins is impossible.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>As operator experience will have improved with each procedure, dermoscopic examination
may have been conducted differently in the last few surgeries of the sample. As
dermoscopy is operatordependent, assessment may be influenced not only by knowledge and
experience but also by the time available for decision-making and by the dermatologist's
self-confidence.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although outcomes were equivalent in the control and intervention groups, demonstrating
that dermoscopy would have no impact on demarcation of surgical margins for MMS, this
study puts forth a practical proposal for improvement of the Mohs technique.
Nevertheless, studies with larger, population-based samples are still required to
confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Fernanda Manfron Rosas, MD, Larissa L Gomes da Silva,
