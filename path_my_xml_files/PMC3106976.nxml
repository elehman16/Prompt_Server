Subsequently, three baseline assessments were performed, at least 1 week apart, to establish the stability of self-report and objective measures. Following this a computer-generated random assignment was used to allocate subjects in blocks of four to BoNT-A or same volume placebo injection. Both groups undertook a daily home programme of exercises typically used in this cohort. Subjects, investigators and assessors were blinded to group allocation. At 12 weeks postinjection, all subjects had the opportunity to have an open-label BoNT-A injection if they considered that there was no change in their knee symptoms. Data were not unmasked at this time point. Subjects receiving a second injection continued with the exercise programme for a further 12 weeks. Assessments occurred at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks from each injection.

The group studied had an average duration of knee symptoms of 5.7 years (range 1&#x02013;10); and had exhausted conservative management, including having previously performed similar exercises to those that were undertaken as part of the study. Data presented support the hypothesis that this novel intervention has the potential to induce improvements in longstanding knee pain and disability. Importantly, these improvements outlasted the 12 weeks expected duration of the drug effect based on animal studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>The mechanisms underlying these improvements may be partly elucidated from the present study. The ratio of VM to VL muscle activation during isometric knee extension was reversed following BoNT-A injection. That is, as early as 2 weeks postinjection, the VM showed the greatest activation during isometric knee extension; whereas previously the VL was dominant. In the placebo group, the ratio of VM to VL muscle activation also changed, although to a much lesser extent, suggesting that the injection itself had some influence on muscle activation, which persisted for at least 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). However, in contrast to the BoNT-Ainjected subjects, the VM:VL ratio in placebo subjects was not significantly different from baseline at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). There was a steady improvement in knee extensor force production over the 12-week period in placebo subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). Peak force, which might be expected to have reduced in BoNT-A-injected subjects as a result of relative weakening of the distal VL muscle, was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). Some subjects noted an ability to recruit and sustain a contraction of the VM muscle within a week of the injection; something that they had been unable to achieve previously, despite, in some cases, electrical muscle stimulation and EMG biofeedback training. It is acknowledged that this may have led them to conclude that they had received the active treatment, with the potential for bias of subsequent self-reports; however, it is difficult to accept that this would have influenced quadriceps muscle activation ratios, which are not under volitional control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><sec id="s11"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The relatively small numbers recruited for this study, as well as the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria used, mean that the sample is not broadly representative of all individuals with chronic AKP. The groups were well matched apart from gender allocation. The greater incidence of AKP in women is well described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>; however, it is possible that the gender inequity between groups may have confounded the results, particularly with respect to gender-based differences in strength and motor control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Future studies are needed to explore this issue.</p><p>It is well accepted that quadriceps muscle imbalance is only one of many factors contributing to AKP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Indeed, only 26 of the 51 cases assessed, all of whom presented with symptoms suggestive of AKP,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> were found to have VL dominance on surface EMG evaluation. However, the present cohort represents a group who are frequently considered for surgery. Cases with refractory AKP associated with maltracking may undergo surgical procedures such as lateral retinacular release and tibial tubercle alignment. The evidence that patella malalignment is the primary cause of AKP is limited and is based on measures with poor reliability and/or validity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Given the lack of evidence for a clear relationship between patellofemoral joint alignment and symptoms, it could be speculated that surgical correction may not be the optimal approach to alleviate symptoms of AKP. Botulinum toxin injection is a safe, reversible treatment that does not interfere with patellofemoral joint integrity. In combination with careful assessment and management of contributing factors, BoNT-A injection has the potential to be a cost-effective treatment for carefully selected AKP patients, who are refractory to conservative management. In some cases, BoNT-A injection may alleviate the need for surgery. Further investigation of the utility of BoNT-A in larger cohorts with refractory AKP, including patients wait-listed for surgery, and with a longer follow-up, would appear to be merited.</p><p>From our investigation, it could be speculated that the injection of BoNT-A into the distal VL muscle improved neuromotor control of the quadriceps, which facilitated normal patellofemoral mechanics. Draper <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> have reported the utility of open magnetic resonance imaging and a semi-erect dynamic knee flexion protocol to demonstrate abnormal patellofemoral joint kinematics in individuals with AKP. In future studies it would be valuable to examine changes in physiologically loaded patellofemoral joint kinematics as an outcome of BoNT-A treatment of AKP, in addition to selfreported pain and disability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study extends our previous open-label study examining the efficacy of a focal injection of BoNT-A for individuals with refractory AKP associated with quadriceps muscle imbalance. 9 The improvement between baseline and 12 weeks was significantly greater for BoNT-A than placebo-injected subjects for the AKPS, pain on kneeling, squatting and level walking. BoNT-A injection was associated with improved activation of VM muscle without compromise to isometric knee extensor force production. Individuals who received Dysport either as an initial or crossover treatment were generally satisfied or highly satisfied with outcomes at 6 months postinjection. Improvements were maintained in the majority of BoNT-A-injected subjects available for follow-up to a mean of 20 months.</p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>What is already known on this
