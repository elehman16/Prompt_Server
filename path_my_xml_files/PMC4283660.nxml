Night pain and Harris Hip Score below 60 are used as criteria for THR at our institution.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Thus, the patients included in the study were not candidates for THR at the time of inclusion, and none of them were on waiting lists for THR. Exclusion criteria were THR in the index joint, knee pain or knee OA, low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease unable to tolerate exercise, dysfunction in lower extremities due to accident or disease, pregnancy and not understanding Norwegian.

Sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes were used to assign treatment for patients consecutively by a research coordinator not involved in the patient assessment or interventions. Allocation concealment was maintained until written informed consent was obtained, and baseline assessments and patient education sessions were completed. The randomisation sequence was concealed from the study collaborators until treatment was assigned. The exercise therapy programme was specifically designed for patients with hip OA<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and consisted of strengthening, flexibility and functional exercises. Patients in the exercise therapy group performed the exercise programme two to three times per week for 12&#x02005;weeks, supervised by a physical therapist at least once weekly. Compliance was based on training diaries filled in weekly by the patients in the exercise therapy group during the 12-week intervention period. Attending at least 20 of a total of 24 sessions was defined as satisfactory adherence. Patients in the control group attended a 2-month follow-up visit at the physiotherapy clinic as part of the patient education programme. They did not have access to the exercise therapy programme during the intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures and follow-up</title><p>Characteristics of the patients&#x02019; included age, gender, height, weight, work status, education level, unilateral or bilateral hip pain, pain duration, minimum joint space and Harris Hip Score.</p><p>The main outcome measure for this long-term follow-up was survival of the native hip to THR in the index joint. At inclusion all patients were instructed to report if and when they went through THR surgery during the project period.

In this long-term follow-up study, WOMAC was used to assess symptoms and functional limitations prior to THR surgery or end of study. PASE is a brief, self-administered, 7-day recall questionnaire to assess physical activity in older adults.

A Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis was constructed to evaluate cumulative 6-year survival, and group difference was tested by the log rank test. THR in the index joint was defined as event, while patients who were lost to follow-up, were dead or were followed until the end of study were treated as censored in the analysis. Time to THR is reported as median and 95% CI. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate HR and 95% CI between groups. No adjusted analysis was conducted due to equality of groups at baseline. Baseline comparisons were performed with Student t tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. A linear mixed model (variance component model), with time and the interaction of time and group as fixed effects and time as random effect intercept and slope, was used to compare WOMAC scores between the exercise therapy group and the control group over the 29-month follow-up period. A linear mixed model was also applied to compare WOMAC scores prior to THR surgery or end of study between patients who went through THR and patients who did not. The analyses were based on the intention to treat principle. For the outcome measures of physical activity and exercise, mean (SD) or number was calculated, and a linear mixed model was used to compare PASE scores between the exercise therapy group and the control group. p Values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p>Analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics, V.19.0 (IBM Corp., Somers, New York, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Characteristics of the patients</title><p>Two hundred and twenty patients were screened for eligibility between April 2005 and October 2007.

Thus, the null hypothesis was rejected. The cumulative survival of the native hip was higher in the exercise therapy group from 1&#x02005;year and throughout the follow-up period.</p><p>This is the first study to evaluate whether exercise therapy affects the need for THR in patients with isolated hip OA. One previous study has used total joint replacement as an outcome to compare the effect of individually tailored exercises and usual care in knee and/or hip OA.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> They found that 20% underwent THR in the individually tailored exercise therapy group compared with 45% in the usual care group for those with hip OA.

The somewhat smaller protective effect of exercise in our study may be due to the patients having both symptomatic and radiographic hip OA.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> THR rates have increased steadily during the past four decades,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which in turn has enlarged healthcare costs substantially.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Our finding, that exercise therapy enhances the survival of the native hip to THR, is therefore important for healthcare consumption and for patients who may avoid surgery and its potential complications. Some studies have recommended and used total joint replacement as a hard endpoint in OA,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> but it is debatable whether it can be interpreted as an expression for OA progression. Attempts are requested<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and have been made,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> but still no clearly defined criteria for THR exist. Worse self-reported pain and functional limitations are associated with a higher THR rate,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> but cannot be used to discriminate between patients who are or are not in need of a THR as clinical severity varies widely.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In our study, the patients who went through THR had poorer scores in the WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness and physical function prior to THR compared with the patients who did not undergo THR. This supports the assumption that the patients who undergo THR surgery have more severe symptoms and functional limitations. Also, the patients who went through THR had smaller minimum joint space at baseline. Abadie <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> stated that THR is probably the most relevant clinical endpoint for evaluating effect of disease-modifying treatment, but it is potentially biased by non-disease-related factors such as economic factors, availability and geographical differences, comorbidities and contraindications for surgery, and willingness to undergo surgery.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, in a randomised design study, equal distribution of potential confounding factors is assumed.</p><p>Other studies have found beneficial short-term effects of exercise therapy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> No significant difference in self-reported pain was demonstrated in the 16-month follow-up of our trial, but the patients in the exercise therapy group had better self-reported physical function compared with the control group.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This was supported by the findings in our study, with the exercise therapy group demonstrating better results in WOMAC physical function compared with the control group over the complete 29-month follow-up period (p=0.004), The differences in WOMAC pain (p=0.083) and WOMAC stiffness (p=0.112) did not reach statistical significance. This may indicate that the lower rate and longer time to THR in the exercise therapy group are due to better hip function, with or without the presence of pain. Ten patients in the exercise therapy group and 17 patients in the control group had gone through THR surgery prior to the 29-month follow-up, and it is not unlikely that this uneven distribution of performed THRs has biased the WOMAC results, giving an underestimation of the treatment effect of exercise therapy. Pisters <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found no long-term differences in pain and function when comparing individually tailored exercises and usual care, but suggested that patients who underwent THR may have biased the results. Fifty-three per cent of the patients in the exercise therapy group completed &#x02265;20 exercise sessions and were thus regarded as compliant. Data on continuation of the exercise therapy programme after the 12-week intervention period were not obtained, and this must be regarded as a limitation of the study. However, the data on physical activity, exercise and physical therapy treatment suggest that no major between-group differences were present. Self-reported outcome measures lack validity for measuring physical activity and exercise due to recall bias and overestimation of time, frequency and intensity,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and these data should therefore be interpreted with caution. Better adherence to exercises has been shown to improve long-term results,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and higher leisure time physical activity may have a protective effect against THR.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Our study had some limitations. The criteria for when THR surgery was indicated were not specified prior to the start of the study. The criteria used for THR at our institution (night pain and Harris Hip Score below 60 points) are not necessarily used at other hospitals, and the symptom state may differ at time of surgery. Preoperative assessment was not conducted, but pain and physical function were assessed with a mean time of 0.7&#x000b1;0.8&#x02005;years prior to THR. Calculation of statistical power for this study was not based on survival of the native hip to THR, but rather the WOMAC pain subscale, which was the primary outcome measure of this trial.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Some caution should be taken when interpreting these results. Our findings are applicable for patients with symptomatic and radiographic hip OA, with mild to moderate symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms and patients with knee or back pain were excluded. Patients recruited to non-surgical treatment trials may have a stronger desire to avoid surgery compared with the general OA population.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is debatable whether postponing surgery is beneficial for the patients in the long term.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> We argue that for patients with tolerable pain who are able to maintain their desired activity level and who are relatively young postponing surgery is appropriate and may reduce the future need for THR or repetitive THR revision surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings in this explanatory study show that participating in a 12-week exercise therapy programme in addition to patient education can reduce the need for THR or postpone surgery in patients with hip OA.
