In patients with operable esophageal cancer, there is evidence supporting the use of preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients with unresectable or inoperable esophageal disease have also been treated with various chemotherapy strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Chemotherapy can significantly improve the clinical outcomes of cancer patients, but it can also result in serious adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In esophageal cancer, treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin plus docetaxel (DCF) is reported to be associated with increased response rates but also with an increased incidence of toxicities, the most common of which are hematological and gastrointestinal (GI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Triplet regimen had high response rate and also was associated with higher rates of grade of stomatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. GI toxicities caused by chemotherapy can negatively affect patients&#x02019; nutritional status by decreasing food intake and can result in a delay or discontinuation of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thereby negatively affecting tumor response to treatment; in addition, GI toxicities could lead to a delay in elective surgery and increase the risk of operative complications. Oral mucositis, one of the most common GI toxicities, results in increased pain, difficulty in swallowing, nutritional compromise, and an increased risk of infection. Nishimura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that the incidence of oral mucositis (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] grade &#x02265;1) was the highest during chemotherapy for breast cancer (76.5&#x000a0;%), followed by chemotherapy for head and neck cancer (67.7&#x000a0;%), colorectal cancer (63&#x000a0;%), esophageal cancer (57.8&#x000a0;%), and malignant lymphoma (42.9&#x000a0;%). Several reports indicated that the glutamine (Gln) decreased only the subjective symptoms of stomatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Even if there was objective effect, a large amount of Gln was administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It was difficult to formulate a large amount of Gln in the practical treatment. Recently, efficacy of elemental diet (including Gln) for chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in esophageal cancer (grade 1 stomatitis) and colorectal cancer (grade 1&#x02013;3 stomatitis) patients was reported, and their concept of treatment were after experience of stomatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our pilot study, oral Gln and elemental diet (ED) which was administered from before starting of chemotherapy was found to help maintain patients&#x02019; nutritional status and to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis in esophageal cancer (unpublished data).</p><p>We therefore conducted a randomized phase II study for investigation of efficacy and safety at Gln plus ED or Gln alone compared to no treatment on oral mucositis in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>In addition, because oral mucositis is reported to be caused by chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage or infection and inflammation by indigenous oral bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we also measured and compared the mucosal integrity and degree of inflammation between the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This trial was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000008338).

We could estimate the effect size for each arm. We will plan a multicenter randomized phase III study using these estimated effect sizes for calculation of sample size. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of Gln and Gln plus ED on the incidence grade of oral mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] during 2&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy. After confirmation of eligibility, patients were randomized to the chemotherapy-only group (control), Gln group (Gln) (marzulene-S&#x000ae;; Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.), or Gln plus ED (Elental&#x000ae;; Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd) group (Gln plus ED). In the Gln and Gln plus ED groups, each drug was administered orally beginning 1&#x000a0;week before chemotherapy and was continued between rounds of chemotherapy. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Gln, Gln plus ED, or no additional treatment (control). During the chemotherapy cycles, patients continued to receive Gln or Gln plus ED every day. Total daily calories consumed were restricted to 30&#x000a0;kcal/body weight in all patients, and the amount of food intake was directly reported by patients. In cases where food consumption was 70&#x000a0;% or less of the defined amount for 3&#x000a0;days, the patient was withdrawn from the study because of the significant difference in calorie intake. Oral mucositis was assessed by two trained physicians who were blinded whether administered or not. The severity grade was assessed before chemotherapy, after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and after the second cycle of chemotherapy. Before chemotherapy, a dentist has performed oral care for dental caries and periodontal disease to all the patients. Patient education in oral selfcare was performed by nurses, too. We also measured weight; plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, which is a reliable indicator of intestinal mucosal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; C-reactive protein (CRP) level, which was used as an inflammatory indicator; turnover rate of plasma proteins (prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol binding protein [RBP]), as indicators of nutritional status; and plasma concentration of various amino acids such as Gln and histidine. We assessed tumor response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. A barium meal study, endoscopy, ultrasonography, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate the response status of measurable lesions. We defined complete response as complete disappearance of all clinically detectable malignant disease and partial response as a &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;% decrease in the sum of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions present for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks. We defined progressive disease as either a &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;% increase in the sum of the products of measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed or the appearance of new lesions. Stable disease did not qualify as complete response, partial response, or progressive disease. We investigated the incidence of any complications at the time of operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Other adverse events</title><p>Side effect was assessed using the National Cancer Institute CTCAE version 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint was the pairwise comparison of incidence grade of mucositis between each of the two experimental arms (Gln group and Gln plus ED group) and the control arm. Secondary endpoints included a comparison of patient demographics and confirmation of laboratory changes. For the primary endpoint, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test with Bonferroni correction was used to assess the reduction of mucositis incidence. A proportional odds model was used to the evaluation of treatment effect (Gln and Gln + ED) and adjusted effect of five covariates (age, sex, cancer stage, treatment, and body mass index). The estimated model may have multicollinearity, so we applied backward stepwise method using Akaike&#x02019;s information criteria as variable selection measure. Secondary endpoints were assessed using Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparison method. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.1.1. A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patients</title><p>From June 2010 to March 2013, 30 patients were enrolled and randomized to either the Gln plus ED group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10), Gln group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10), or control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10).

Moreover, the results of the multivariate analysis demonstrated that Gln plus ED and cancer stage were independent factors affecting mucositis grade during chemotherapy. Additionally, in our study, Gln plus ED had beneficial effects on the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, as indicated by DAO measurements and body weight. In the Gln plus ED group, there was a significant difference during chemotherapy in the inhibitory effect against stomatitis. But in cycle 2, there was no significance of prevention. Probably because of the dose reduction in five cases in cycle 2 and also small sample size, significant difference was not seen in cycle 2. When enteral nutrients are administered, poor compliance becomes a serious problem. However, in this study, all patients completed the scheduled treatment with ED, which suggested good patient compliance. One of the reasons why the high intake ratio was maintained may be the choices offered to patients on how to take ED, such as adding flavoring agents or a jelly mix. Previous reports indicated that the Gln decreased the subjective symptoms of stomatitis in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our study showed that Gln alone did not have a preventive effect against oral mucositis, in spite of the same Gln content as Gln plus ED. This was in contrast to previous studies that reported that oral Gln reduced the incidence and severity of mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our trial, marzulene&#x000ae; (which is largely composed of Gln) was administered at a dose of 8910&#x000a0;mg/day as an oral Gln formulation. Previous reports administered Gln doses of 30 and 24&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], respectively; thus, the dose used in this study may be inadequate to prevent oral mucositis. Saforis&#x02122; (Eisai Co., Ltd.), which is composed of Gln in a novel, proprietary, drug delivery system, is used for preventing oral mucositis. Peterson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that Saforis&#x02122; significantly prevented oral mucositis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy when administered at a dose of 2.5&#x000a0;g, three times a day, for 14&#x000a0;days. Comparing the local concentration of marzulene&#x000ae; with that of Saforis&#x02122; is difficult, but Saforis&#x02122; might have a higher concentration than marzulene&#x000ae; in epithelial oral mucosal cells because of its ability to facilitate the uptake of Gln by more than 100-fold. May et al. suggested that the mixture of hydroxyl-methylbutyrate, arginine, and Gln (HMB/Arg/Gln 16&#x000a0;g) was effective against cancer cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, this paper suggested that one of the mechanisms of this effect was that Gln is a substrate for enterocytes and lymphocytes, acting to improve nitrogen retention, lower the incidence of infections, and decrease tumor growth and chemotherapy toxicity. However, this mixture has a higher Gln content than the dose used in this study. Therefore, the Gln dose in this study might be inadequate to prevent oral mucositis. Gln plus ED prevented oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy, despite the fact that this regimen included the same amount of Gln as marzulene&#x000ae; alone. It cannot be ruled out that absorptive kinetics may be different between marzulene&#x000ae; and marzulene&#x000ae; plus ED, but various amino acids, including Gln, in ED might have resulted in the prevention of oral mucositis. Supportively, efficacy of ED for chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer patients was recently reported, but their concept of treatment was after experience of stomatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although the pathogenesis of mucositis remains to be completely elucidated, it has been reported that chemotherapy damages DNA through production of reactive oxygen species, induces apoptosis by upregulating the expression of intracellular molecules such as NF-kB, and produces several cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (direct mechanism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The protective effect of ED on mucosal tissue in Crohn&#x02019;s disease has been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In clinical practice, ED has a clear suppressive effect on clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the levels of mucosal inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, histidine, one of the constituent amino acids of ED, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, in chemotherapy-induced mucositis, it has been hypothesized that ED might also have a mucosal protective effect and prevent oral mucositis. In fact, our trial showed significantly higher levels of DAO activity, an indicator of intestinal mucosal integrity, in the Gln plus ED group than in the control group. DAO activity was previously reported to be an index of intestinal mucosal integrity. In humans and rodents, DAO is detected in various tissues, including the small intestine and kidney, but may also be found in the plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Plasma DAO activity correlated with DAO activity in the villi of small intestinal mucosa in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and also correlated with the severity of small intestinal mucosal lesions induced by anti-cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Recently, measuring DAO activity in gastric cancer patients was reported to be useful not only as an indicator of mucosal injury but also for the evaluation of coinciding GI tract toxicities induced by anti-cancer drugs, such as 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the effect of ED on mucositis might result from maintaining mucosal integrity, indicated by higher DAO activity. In this study, from the results of the multivariate analysis, cancer stage IV was an independent influential factor affecting increased mucositis grade during chemotherapy. Accordingly, previous reports have demonstrated increased levels of plasma cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in patients with advanced cancer stages. Although daily calorie intake was restricted to the same amount among the three groups in our trial, body weight was significantly decreased in the control group, and body weight in the Gln plus ED group was maintained after chemotherapy. The maintenance of body weight in the Gln plus ED group may be explained by two possible mechanisms. First, ED and Gln may have maintained mucosal integrity not only in the oral cavity but also in the GI tract, thereby resulting in maintained nutrient absorption. Second, ED included an amino acid formulation and not protein. Patients may be unable to digest food because of chemotherapy-induced GI toxicities. In this situation, amino acids may be more suitable than proteins to provide nutrients, as proteins require digestion. Levels of rapid turnover proteins, known to reflect nutritional index, were not dependent on body weight loss in the control group. Previously, Georgiannos et al. suggested that patients who lost weight (&#x0003e;7.5&#x000a0;%) had higher plasma CRP levels and lower prealbumin levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) compared to both weight-stable cancer patients and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In our trial, mean body weight loss was 5.4&#x000a0;% in the control group, and lower than 7.5&#x000a0;%. Moreover, no significant increase in CRP levels during chemotherapy was observed in the control group. Therefore, rapid turnover proteins such as prealbumin were not significantly decreased in the control group in our study.</p><p>It was recently reported that enteral administration of amino acid mixtures enabled normal amino acid absorption in patients with mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. On the other hand, it was also reported that absorption of long-chain fatty acids might have been reduced in patients with GI mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This also suggested that ED, which is composed of amino acids (not including protein) and a small quantity of fatty acids, might be the best source of enteral nutrients during cancer chemotherapy. In our trial, we measured plasma concentrations of various amino acids. However, no significant differences in the concentrations of plasma Gln or other amino acids were observed either before, between, or after the administration of ED and/or Gln in any groups. This may be due to the fact that Gln and other amino acids are almost locally consumed as a source of energy or anti-inflammatory effects in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>The above mechanisms of action of Gln plus ED on oral mucositis are completely speculative. Therefore, further experimental studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of the action of ED and/or Gln on mucositis. Moreover, one of the limitations of our study was the small sample size studied at a single site. Hence, we are currently conducting a large, multicenter study to confirm the beneficial effects of ED on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in esophageal cancer patients.</p><p>In conclusion, Gln plus ED may prevent chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in esophageal cancer patients, and this effect may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and body weight during chemotherapy. These results would suggest that this will be tempered with recommendation for a multicenter RCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec
