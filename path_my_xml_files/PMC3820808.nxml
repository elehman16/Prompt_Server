Mouse models of human colorectal cancer were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=25) and a control group (n=25). The control group was implanted with blank seeds (0 MBq) and the experimental group with iodine-125 seeds (14.8 MBq). At 20 days after implantation, the animals were sacrificed. The methylation levels of SFRP<sub>2</sub> and P16 were detected using methylation-specific polymerase chain reactions (MSPs). Following iodine-125 seed irradiation, the level of SFRP<sub>2</sub> methylation decreased. The methylation index of the experimental group (0.67&#x000b1;0.05) was significantly lower than that of the control group (0.84&#x000b1;0.07; P&#x0003c;0.05). In the experimental group, 10 samples (40%) displayed methylation in the P16 promoter region compared with 14 (56%) in the control group, which was a significant difference (P&#x0003c;0.05). Iodine-125 seeds induce the downregulation of methylated tumor suppressor gene promoters, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and growth of tumor cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>iodine-125 seeds</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>SFRP<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>P16</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>As the social economy develops and lifestyles and food habits change, the incidence rate of colorectal cancer is increasing in China, with an annual increase that has reached as high as 4% since the 1970s. In the US, colorectal cancer has become the third most common cause of cancer-associated mortalities (<xref rid="b1-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Patients presenting with this disease have a notably shortened life span, as well as a poor quality of life. Radical surgery fails to achieve satisfactory results, with a recurrence rate &#x0003e;33% (<xref rid="b2-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This rate may reach as high as 90% following radical surgery (<xref rid="b3-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Even radical surgery combined with intraoperative chemotherapy is only able to achieve a local control rate of 50% (<xref rid="b2-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For patients with intrapelvic recurrent colorectal cancer, traditional surgery achieves a 3-year survival rate of only 8% (no 5-year survival rate) and a median time of remission from bleeding and pain of between 5 and 6 months (<xref rid="b4-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although total pelvic exenteration may achieve a superior curative effect, the 3-year survival rate is no more than 32% (<xref rid="b5-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The prognosis following palliative surgery is much worse. Colorectal cancer has a high recurrence rate following surgery and is difficult to re-treat. Neither chemotherapy alone nor additional surgery is able to achieve a satisfactory curative effect. Therefore, radiotherapy has attracted an increasing amount of attention.</p><p>Radioactive particles have a persistent lethal effect on the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells with a definite curative effect on tumors. Radioactive particles may achieve a 3-year survival rate of up to 87.2% (<xref rid="b6-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Iodine-125 seeds have a long half-life and low energy with excellent stability, which has led to their extensive application in clinical practice. Jarusevicius <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b7-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) first applied permanent implantation with 229 iodine-125 seeds for a malignant neurilemmoma following chemoradiotherapy failures and obtained successful results. Since then, permanent iodine-125 seed implantation has been used as the preferred method for the treatment of prostate cancer in the US, Canada, South Africa and other countries. Iodine-125 seed implantation has also been gradually applied in the treatment of other malignant carcinomas, including breast carcinoma, brain neoplasm, lung carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma (<xref rid="b6-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The authors of the present study have used this technique for &#x0003e;20 types of malignant carcinomas since developing and popularizing it in China for the first time in 1999 (<xref rid="b9-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Brachytherapy with iodine-125 seed implantation has since been reported to have favorable curative effects on tumors, and this technique has become an important method for the treatment of colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b11-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that the development of colorectal cancer is accompanied by the CpG island hypermethylation of numerous tumor suppressor gene promoters and that promoter hypermethylation leads to the downregulation or silencing of tumor suppressor gene expression (<xref rid="b13-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

This process is invariably accompanied by noticeable genetic changes. However, genetic changes do not provide a complete explanation for the development of all colorectal cancers. As epigenetics advances, it has been demonstrated that DNA methylation plays a critical role in the development of colorectal cancer. The joint action of DNA methylation and genetic changes leads to tumorigenesis (<xref rid="b18-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). SFRP<sub>2</sub> and P16 are tumor suppressor genes that participate in cell cycle regulation. Their normal expression inhibits cell division and growth (<xref rid="b19-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, their hypermethylation may lead to tumorigenesis.</p><p>Iodine-125 seeds have been applied in the treatment of prostate carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer and colorectal cancer in clinical practice. Iodine-125 seeds release &#x003b3;-rays with an energy of ~35.5 keV and an effective irradiation radius of ~1.7 cm and, therefore, provide a low-dose irradiation treatment. The main effect of iodine-125 seeds on tumors is damage to the DNA duplex structure by irradiation, resulting in apoptosis (<xref rid="b20-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of iodine-125 seeds on the methylation of SFRP<sub>2</sub> and P16 in colorectal cancer. Iodine-125 seeds were used as the &#x003b3;-ray source to act on tumor cells and the changes in SFRP<sub>2</sub> promoter methylation were quantitatively detected. The results showed that the level of SFRP<sub>2</sub> methylation decreased following iodine-125 irradiation. The methylation index (Mtl) of the experimental group (0.67&#x000b1;0.05) demonstrated a significant difference compared with that of the control group (0.84&#x000b1;0.07; Student&#x02019;s t-test: P&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, the CpG island methylation in the P16 promoter region was detected using MSP. The results showed that the methylation positive rate of the experimental group (40%) was significantly lower than that of the control group (56%; P&#x0003c;0.05). This result indicates that iodine-125 seed irradiation decreases the P16 methylation rate in tumor tissues to a certain extent to inhibit tumors. This was in accordance with our predictions: iodine-125 seeds downregulate tumor suppressor gene promoter methylation to inhibit the proliferation and growth of tumor cells. In addition, this study showed that certain tumor tissues implanted with iodine-125 seeds, and some without such an implantation, displayed the coexistence of methylated and non-methylated amplification products. This phenomenon is likely due to the coexistence of different cell subsets in tumors, the existence of normal tissues in tumors or the methylation of one allele rather than another.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the downregulatory effect of iodine-125 seeds on the methylation level of tumor suppressor genes remain uncertain. The possible mechanisms may include the following: i) &#x003b3;-rays directly damage the double strands of DNA, and ii) &#x003b3;-rays downregulate the expression of DNA methyltransferases. DNA double strand disruption is the main form of DNA damage caused by &#x003b3;-rays. DNA damage is accompanied by the repair startup. Although disrupted DNA may be restored by means of recombination and partial fragment resection, the already methylated cytosine may also be resected during the process, which reduces the level of methylated cytosine and reduces the level of CpG island methylation. By contrast, the generation and maintenance of methylation requires the participation of methyltransferases. Therefore, the downregulated expression of the associated enzymes caused by &#x003b3;-rays results in a reduced methylation level. Iodine-125 seed irradiation at a dose of 4 Gy decreases the protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b in SW-1990 human pancreatic cancer cells (<xref rid="b13-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Another study has demonstrated that reduced methylation is accompanied by the downregulation of DNMT expression (<xref rid="b21-etm-06-05-1225" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>At present, the majority of studies concerning the effects of &#x003b3;-rays on gene methylation are <italic>in vitro</italic> tests in cell. However, the environment for cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> is different from that <italic>in vivo</italic>. The accumulated irradiation energy following iodine-125 permanent implantation in clinical practice is also different from a dose administered in trials. Therefore, whether the results of these studies reflect the changes in gene methylation <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear. At present, studies concerning the effect of iodine-125 seeds on tumors primarily focus on DNA strand disruption and cell apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the regulatory effect of iodine-125 seeds on the promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes by quantitating the changes in DNA methylation. The study provides a practical basis for the application of iodine-125 seed implantation in the treatment of tumors. However, since iodine-125 seed implantation is a new technique, its molecular biology remains to be explored.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
