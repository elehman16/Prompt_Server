They were followed till death or--at the time of this analysis--from 15 to 146 months after initiation of therapy. The initial tumour burden of each patient was assessed, combining tumour size of each involved region and number of regions involved. Tumour burden thus assessed proved to be the single most important prognostic factor with regard to disease free survival. Other known prognostic factors such as number of involved regions, mediastinal size, pathological stage, systemic symptoms, and ESR were related to tumour burden and lost their prognostic significance in a multivariate analysis. The only other factors of independent significance were histologic subtype and, to a lesser extent, sex. Combining tumour burden and histologic subtype made it possible to single out a group of patients with a very poor disease free survival. These patients also had a poorer survival from Hodgkin's disease and thus clearly candidates for additional initial treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00516-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="535" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00516-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="536" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00516-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="537" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00516-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="538" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00516-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="539" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
