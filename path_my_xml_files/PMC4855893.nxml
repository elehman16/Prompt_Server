In contrast, growing evidence has shown that posttraumatic growth can occur as a result of coping with breast cancer. Challenging the assumptive world, deliberate rumination, and emotional disclosure are recognized as strong predictors of posttraumatic growth. Group interventions may also increase social support, distress disclosure, and posttraumatic growth. The aim of this study is to evaluate how group-based interventions can facilitate posttraumatic growth and promote improved psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer. This article describes the study protocol and the applied research methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To measure the impact of a group-based intervention on posttraumatic growth, a multi-center randomized control trial was developed for Portuguese breast cancer patients. 205 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer (stages 1 to 3) were recruited for the study and were randomly assigned either to the experimental group, which participated in an 8-session group intervention, or to the control group. Psychosocial variables, which consisted of posttraumatic growth, illness perception, stressfulness of the event, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, core beliefs, rumination, social support, and distress disclosure were measured at three time points. The designated points in time for the assessments were baseline, 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention, and follow-up (12&#x000a0;months after baseline).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first trial to assess the efficacy of a group-based intervention designed to facilitate posttraumatic growth following a breast cancer diagnosis. If proven to be effective, group-based intervention could be recommended as a complementary program to be included in hospital health-care and clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered on 28/10/2013 at the Current Controlled Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN02221709)">ISRCTN02221709</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>group intervention</kwd><kwd>posttraumatic growth</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer diagnosis can induce several negative psychological symptoms such as distress, anxiety, and even cancer-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are cognitive and affective symptoms that persist during the course of the treatment(s), with different levels and intensity over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Along with the distress caused, the positive outcomes of having cancer have received substantial attention over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, it is strongly recognized that individual struggles with the overwhelming effects of major life crises can lead to the perception of positive changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The construct of posttraumatic growth (PTG) was first proposed by Tedeschi and Calhoun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to define an individual&#x02019;s experience of positive change arising from &#x0201c;the struggle with the new reality in the aftermath of trauma that is crucial in determining the extent to which posttraumatic growth occurs&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], p. 5). Several studies reported PTG in women with a diagnosis of breast cancer within five years following being diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>PTG involves the reappraisal of traumatic events through different cognitive perspectives, with the main objective of reconstructing the basic assumptions or core beliefs about one&#x02019;s self, the world, and the future, which are frequently disrupted in the aftermath of a traumatic event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The challenge to one&#x02019;s core beliefs appears to be a major antecedent to PTG, since the stressfulness of the event shatters the assumptive world and leads the survivor to engage in a cognitive process to understand what happened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, within the cognitive process, the rumination related to the event is a crucial factor in the pathway of growth, since it is a key component with an intermediary function between the shattering of the assumptive world and PTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Rumination is generally defined as repetitive thinking or cognitive processing about certain information, including cognitive mechanisms such as problem solving or making sense of the situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Intrusive rumination is characterized by negative, maladaptive, distressing, and unwanted thoughts that occurred repeatedly and uncontrollably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In contrast, deliberate rumination consists of thoughts that occur deliberately, through which the individual purposefully re-examines the event and its inherent implications. Thus, during deliberate rumination, the individual is involved in intentional attempts to understand and assign a meaning to the traumatic event, which, in turn, can lead to increased awareness about the positive repercussions of the experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. According to some authors, deliberate thinking is the type of rumination that is most associated with the development of PTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The experience of intense distress in the aftermath of a breast cancer diagnosis, may lead to the need to seek social support for distress disclosure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, it is emotional disclosure concerning illness-related stress within social relationships, which influences the reconstruction of one&#x02019;s assumptive world, cognitive reappraisal, and fosters deliberate rumination about one&#x02019;s experience with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These conditions have been recognized as key factors for the development of PTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], specifically among women with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of psychosocial support groups in regards to the psychological well-being of breast cancer patients is demonstrated by a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Supportive-Expressive Therapy (SET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], is shown to be effective in reducing anxiety, depression, mood disturbance, PTSD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and pain perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in addition to improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and enhancing survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Cognitive-Behavior Stress Management therapy (CBSM) is proven to reduce anxiety, emotional distress, and intrusive thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. At the physical level, CBSM is demonstrated to be effective in improving physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and reducing patients&#x02019; cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Beyond the psychological and physical benefits that are already recognized, group interventions may be another way to promote PTG. There have been some psychosocial interventions that have previously assessed growth as an outcome of group-based emotional support for women being treated for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, a recent meta-analysis reported several new interventions that were developed with the aim to promote growth in aftermath of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated the effectiveness of an intervention to promote PTG in women with breast cancer by showing that the participants of a group intervention reported more PTG over a 6-month period, in comparison with control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Other interventions proved to be effective in fostering PTG with war veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], as well as cancer patients and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This can be interpreted as evidence that PTG may be enhanced by participation in group-based interventions. In fact, a group setting can provide a forum to discuss personal experiences, review cognitive schemas, and promote core belief reconstruction, which are the main predictors of PTG. Moreover, the group members who have already undergone positive changes during their experience with cancer can serve as role models, and may be credible sources for fostering PTG in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Aside from the evidence of positive changes resulting from group interventions, to the best of our knowledge there have not yet been any group interventions specifically designed to facilitate PTG in breast cancer patients. Based on previous model of PTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], we designed a group-based intervention program to facilitate posttraumatic growth. If proven to be effective and efficient, this program could be used in a health-care context as a complementary form of psychological treatment for breast cancer patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>In the study we present the detailed research protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of a group intervention in facilitating PTG in breast cancer patients. Additionally, we address the association of PTG with other variables related to psychosocial adjustment, such as the style of rumination, the challenge of core beliefs, social support, PTSD, distress disclosure, and illness perception. Our second aim is to assess how psychosocial variables moderate the effect of group intervention in PTG reports. Finally, the third objective of our study uses a longitudinal design to assess the potential differences in PTG at three different points in time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The sample is composed of an experimental group and a control group of female Portuguese nonmetastic breast cancer patients recruited from multiple health-care centers. This study was conducted over the course of 8 sessions of group-based intervention. We used three points of measurement: baseline, 6&#x000a0;months (post group intervention), and 12&#x000a0;months after the baseline (follow-up) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both phases of the study utilized patient volunteers and were free of charge. The principal researcher led both the intervention groups and conducted the assessments at three designated measurement points.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design and flow diagram of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12905_2016_302_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The research was conducted in the oncology departments of three public hospitals (Centro da Mama - Centro Hospitalar de S&#x000e3;o Jo&#x000e3;o; Hospital de Santo Ant&#x000f3;nio - Centro Hospitalar do Porto; Hospital de S&#x000e3;o Francisco Xavier - Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental), a private clinic (Hospital da Luz), and an association for breast cancer patients (Movimento Vencer e Viver do N&#x000fa;cleo Regional do Sul da Liga Portuguesa Contra o Cancro). The public hospitals, private clinic, and breast cancer association are all located in Porto or Lisbon, the two largest cities in Portugal. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of each institution, namely, Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica para a Sa&#x000fa;de do Centro Hospitalar de S&#x000e3;o Jo&#x000e3;o; Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica para a Sa&#x000fa;de do Centro Hospitalar do Porto; Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica do Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental; Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica para a Sa&#x000fa;de do Hospital da Luz; Movimento Vencer e Viver do N&#x000fa;cleo Regional do Sul da Liga Portuguesa Contra o Cancro.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>For this study, we recruited 205 Portuguese women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Participants were also required to meet several additional inclusion criteria. The criteria included having their first and only breast cancer diagnosis between stages 1&#x02013;3, having been diagnosed between January 2011 and the present; possessing no other type of cancer prior to or after the baseline point, being at least 18&#x000a0;years old, speaking and writing Portuguese fluently, and having no physical or mental disorder that could compromise participation in the study. Therefore, the exclusion criteria consisted of having another diagnosis of breast cancer or another type of cancer prior to or after the first assessment, psychological or physical comorbidities that make it unlikely that participants would complete the study (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression, personality disorder, etc.), and having substance abuse or other issues that may compromise patients&#x02019; participation in the study.</p><p>During recruitment, the contact information of the participants was collected through the consultation of their individual medical histories, in accordance with the data protection guidelines of the Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD &#x02013; Comiss&#x000e3;o Nacional de Protec&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Dados), which guarantee confidentiality through the appropriate methods of protecting patients&#x02019; data.</p><p>Alternatively, the multidisciplinary hospital team, including doctors, nurses, and psychologists, were notified about the study with the goal of informing participants.</p><p>Additionally, we selected participants who were scheduled to start treatment, who had already initiated any systematic treatment, or who had already finished any systematic treatment.</p><p>The research team leader contacted each participant in order to schedule the baseline assessment, which consisted of a semi-structured clinical interview.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Power calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated using G-Power 3.1. To calculate the power, the test for independent samples (significance level of 0.05) was used to compare the two groups.

The participants were randomly allocated either to the intervention group, where group intervention to facilitate PTG was performed, or to the control group, which was created in order to compare the effects of the intervention program. The main researcher stratified randomization, with participants being assigned to intervention groups of 6 to 8 participants each.</p><p>Moreover, the selection for the experimental group was made based solely upon the values obtained from the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist &#x02013; Civilian Version (PCL-C, 50), in the baseline assessment. In accordance with the theory of PTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which asserts that PTG will occur only if the individual perceives an event as traumatic or stressful, the intervention group only included participants who reported medium or high PTSD values. Given the characteristics of the study and the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to conduct a blind study; however, the ethics committees consider that this is unlikely to influence the study&#x02019;s outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Control group</title><p>Participants in the control group underwent the standard treatment for breast cancer and did not receive any individual or group-based intervention on behalf of the study. However, they received the typical medical and psychological care provided to patients by the Department of Oncology at their respective hospitals (Treatment as Usual condition).

During the interview, each participant signed the written informed consent, for participating in the study. The interview also aimed to evaluate any possible physical or mental conditions that might compromise the participation in the intervention or the control groups.</p><p>The assessment of psychosocial variables was repeated at two subsequent points in time. These were post-intervention (6&#x000a0;months after the baseline) and follow-up (12&#x000a0;months after the baseline). For both groups these assessments were conducted in a clinical interview setting, in a manner similar to that of the baseline assessment.

At baseline the questions asked participants to reflect upon &#x0201c;the weeks immediately after the event&#x0201d;, and in the following assessments the instructions concerned &#x0201c;the last two weeks&#x0201d;. The two sub-scales had strong psychometric properties (intrusive rumination, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.94; deliberate rumination, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Social support was evaluated by the Social Support Satisfaction Scale (ESSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which contains 15 statements describing four social support dimensions. The four dimensions are defined as relationship satisfaction, intimacy, satisfaction with family, and satisfaction with social activities. The assessment utilizes a Likert scale ranging from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). All of the sub-scales had satisfactory internal consistencies in the sample composed of Portuguese women with breast cancer (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha ranged from .56 to .85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Distress disclosure was evaluated with the Distress Disclosure Index (DDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and with 5 items from the Opener Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The DDI, measures the tendency of emotional expression and repression. Higher scores indicate a greater tendency for emotional expression, while lower scores indicate a greater likelihood for emotional repression. It consists of 12 items, which are assessed on 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha for the total score was .93. The Opener Scale consists of 5 items used to assess the extent to which the subject discussed each topic with her spouse or other intimate other during the previous week through a 5-point Likert scale varying from 1- (<italic>Did not discuss at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Discussed fully and completely</italic>). The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha for the Opener Scale was .83.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To assess the efficacy of the intervention, in the last session of the group intervention, we also used a questionnaire developed to assess one&#x02019;s satisfaction with the intervention and with the therapist&#x02019;s performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><p>The group-based intervention took place between 2&#x000a0;months after the baseline assessment.

Furthermore, additional new group interventions have assessed PTG as an outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; however, thus far, this is the first study to investigate the effects of a group-based program with the explicit focus on promoting PTG in the psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer. This study will provide information on the efficacy of group-based interventions on PTG. The plan for the group sessions includes not only major cognitive processing about breast cancer, but also promotes the best opportunity to disclose emotions and share personal experiences, which facilitate the emergence of PTG.</p><p>The primary outcome of group interventions is to increase PTG at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months following the baseline assessment. We expect that potential significant differences among the three time points will occur in the intervention group. Further beneficial effects for cognitive processing, distress disclosure, PTSD, and social support are also evaluated, in addition to the potential mediation effect of psychosocial variables on PTG.</p><p>If PTG group intervention is found to be effective, it could be integrated into multidisciplinary daily clinical practice as a powerful way to promote PTG in women who are being treated for breast cancer. Furthermore, given that the intervention used cognitive-behavioral strategies, in addition to the positive effects on PTG, benefits may also be noted in the psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer, improvements in quality of life, greater adherence to therapy and to medical indications, and fewer hospital visits.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FCT</term><def><p>Portuguese national funding agency for science, research, and technology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTG</term><def><p>posttraumatic growth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.
