To stimulate the implementation of such programmes in the Netherlands, a new payment policy (ie, bundled payment) was recently implemented.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, the wide implementation of these programmes in the Netherlands, as is currently ongoing, would benefit by a justification from a cost-effectiveness perspective.</p><p>Recent systematic literature reviews of COPD-DM programmes showed favourable effects on both health outcomes and costs (mainly due to decreased hospitalisation).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, previous economic studies had poor methodological quality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Most studies did not measure all relevant costs and health outcomes and did not perform incremental cost-effectiveness analyses.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For instance, there is little knowledge on the required investments in implementation of these programmes. Furthermore, the generalisability of the outcomes of these studies was low, due to the inclusion of patients with mainly severe COPD and the exclusion of patients with multimorbidity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>We aimed to conduct a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a COPD-DM programme in primary care compared to usual care in the Netherlands. This CEA was performed as part of a 2-year cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the clinical effects of this RECODE programme (acronym for <italic>R</italic>andomised clinical trial on <italic>E</italic>ffectiveness of integrated <italic>CO</italic>P<italic>D</italic> management in primary car<italic>E</italic>).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In the clinical paper we concluded that, after 12&#x02005;months, the RECODE programme did not significantly improve the score on the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) compared to usual care, despite an improved level of integrated care and a higher degree of self-reported physical activity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Our current paper includes additional outcome measures not reported in the clinical paper and it reports 24-month results. This is important because it is often argued that it takes time before the effect of DM programmes becomes clearly visible. The added value of a cost-effectiveness analysis is that we report the joint uncertainty in effects and costs, allowing us to report the probability that the RECODE programme would be cost-effective at various threshold values of the maximum acceptable costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Moreover, the publication of results in terms of cost-effectiveness is important to avoid selective reporting of positive studies. The published evidence is used to inform all decisionmakers across developed countries about whether and which COPD-DM programmes to reimburse on a wider scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the medical ethics committee, performed according to the study protocol,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> as well as national<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and international<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research, and reported according to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and intervention</title><p>RECODE is a 2-year cluster randomised trial in which 40 clusters of primary care teams were randomised to the COPD-DM programme or usual care. The 20 teams of the intervention group were trained in essential components of effective COPD-DM: proper diagnosis, optimising medication adherence, motivational interviewing, smoking cessation counselling, applying self-management plans including early recognition and treatment of exacerbations, physical (re)activation and nutritional support. In addition, the teams learnt the details of a web-based computer program for measuring and reporting process and outcome performance indicators, named ZORGDRAAD. This Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) application included a patient and provider portal that facilitated the communication within the multidisciplinary teams as well as between care providers and patients. At the end of the 2-day course, each team developed a plan with steps to be taken in order to redesign the care process and integrate the COPD-DM programme into their daily practice. After the course, the teams were invited to join refresher courses, received regular feedback reports on patients&#x02019; outcomes and had access to ZORGDRAAD. The local healthcare insurer reimbursed physical reactivation for patients with a Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score &#x0003e;2, and also if these patients had no supplementary insurance. All practices were flexible in determining and following their individual plans. Therefore, the mix and intensity of interventions for individual patients depended on their health status, personal needs and preferences, as well as the actions taken by the team. Healthcare providers in the usual care group were asked to continue providing care as usual. The care as usual has been reported previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Target population</title><p>The enrolment of primary care teams and their patients with COPD took place between September 2010 and September 2011.

Additionally, the following incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated: costs per additional patient with an MCID on the CCQ, costs per additional patient with an MCID on the SGRQ and costs per exacerbation prevented. Taking a multioutcome approach is in line with recent guidelines.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Uncertainty around the ICERs was handled by bootstrapping the data 5000 times. Bootstrapping means repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original data set.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Each sample has the same size as the trial and for each sample the difference in costs and QALYs between RECODE and usual care and the ICER is calculated. The 2,5th and the 97,5th centile of the 5000 bootstrap replications form the 95% uncertainty interval of the differences in costs and QALYs. The 5000 ICERs were plotted on cost-effectiveness planes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In a cost-effectiveness plane, the horizontal axis displays the difference in effects and the vertical axis displays the difference in costs. The results of the bootstrap replications can fall into one of four quadrants: north-east quadrant (more cost and more effects); south-east quadrant (less cost and more effects); south-west quadrant (less cost and less effects); north-west quadrant (more cost and less effects; see online supplementary appendix 1). Finally, the probability that the RECODE programme is cost-effective using different thresholds for the monetary value of a QALY was shown in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This probability equals the proportion of bootstrap replications in which the ICER is lower than the threshold value.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sensitivity and subgroup analyses</title><p>Two sensitivity analyses were performed: one with the inclusion of intervention costs and the other with a 1-year instead of a 2-year time horizon.

The CE planes of the different outcomes showed that the majority of the bootstrap replications (&#x0003e;98%) had higher costs.

Our results show that RECODE is not cost-effective from a healthcare as well as a societal perspective. The point estimates of costs and effects pointed towards higher costs and no significant difference in effects, except for 0.04 less QALYs. The majority of bootstrap replications in the CE planes showed that RECODE was dominated by usual care. The decrease in utility, especially in the second year, might be explained by the consistent pattern of no effect or a worse effect on the outcomes. The reduction in utility might also result from the increased awareness by patients of their health problems as an effect of being enrolled in the RECODE programme.</p><p>These unexpected findings cannot be related to weaknesses in the research design. The strength of our study lies in the inclusion of a large and representative group of patients with COPD recruited in primary care. To avoid contamination, randomisation was performed at the cluster level. Since blinding of participants and clinicians was impossible, blinded research nurses collected the data, while patients were instructed not to report back on their type of intervention. Additional strengths of this study are the 2-year follow-up period, the broad range of health outcomes and cost categories included and the sophisticated analyses that took into account the hierarchical nature of the data. A limitation of our study is that we collected healthcare resource utilisation at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x02005;months using a questionnaire with a 3-month recall period, necessitating the extrapolation of the 3-month data to 6&#x02005;months to estimate the costs of months 3&#x02013;6, 15&#x02013;18 and 21&#x02013;24. We chose to collect intermittent data for two reasons. The first was to avoid study dropouts resulting from endless questionnaires or daily diaries over a long follow-up period. The second reason was that evidence from the literature suggests that intermittent data provide reliable estimates of total annual health expenditures.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A second limitation is that patients who dropped out were significantly older and had a significantly worse baseline score on the CCQ, SGRQ, MRC-dyspnoea and EQ-5D, thus potentially jeopardising the generalisability of the results. However, baseline characteristics of the dropouts in the RECODE group and the dropouts in the usual care group were not significantly different. Moreover, after correction for baseline scores, no evidence of benefits of the intervention were found, indicating that dropouts are unlikely to have biased the results.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the finding that the RECODE intervention was not cost-effective. First, it may be due to the relatively low intensity of our pragmatic intervention. The RECODE programme did not require the teams to implement all elements of effective COPD-DM that they learnt during the courses. Instead, each team made their own plan to redesign the care process and implement COPD-DM. Consequently, the mixture and intensity of interventions for individual patients was dependent on the health status, personal needs and preferences of the individual patients, as well as on the specific focus that a team may have chosen, the level of implementation of the DM interventions and the context within which each team operates. As an example of an area that may not have been sufficiently addressed during the courses, we should mention interventions to improve psychological health.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, only 10% of the patients in the RECODE trial suffered from a depression at baseline. Although this has probably influenced their motivation to change their health behaviour and may have increased unscheduled care,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> it is unlikely to be a major explanation for the lack of effect. Obviously, further research is required to understand the conditions for a successful implementation and thus cost-effectiveness of a COPD-DM programme.</p><p>Second, it is questionable whether the pragmatic provider-oriented interventions of the RECODE programme (eg, training and education, support in writing practice reform plans, ICT system Zorgdraad) were optimally translated into patient-oriented interventions. This is important because it has been shown that successful COPD-DM programmes mainly include patient-oriented interventions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The literature showed that exercise is an important success factor of a COPD-DM programme<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and that education, exercise and relaxation are important factors for reducing the use of urgent and unscheduled healthcare among people with COPD.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In our study, physical exercise was not mandatory and only patients with MRC&#x0003e;2 received full reimbursement of physiotherapy.</p><p>Third, there was limited room for improvement in comparison with previous studies due to the relatively high standard of COPD care in the Netherlands<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and the low proportion of patients with severe COPD in this study.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It could be that a programme like RECODE would have led to more positive results in settings where the COPD care is less advanced. For instance, in 2005, when the standards of good COPD care in developed countries were less well developed, a Spanish study did find that a community-based integrated care programme in frail patients with COPD improved clinical outcomes including survival and decreased the emergency department visits.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Moreover, Bourbeau <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> demonstrated positive results of a COPD-DM programme in patients recruited from seven hospitals in Canada in 1999, while a similar programme in 15 general practices in the Netherlands in 2006<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> found no long-term benefits and a study in the USA in 2009 did even find negative results in patients recruited from 20 hospital-based outpatient clinics.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> It might well be that as time passes and the quality of COPD care improves, there is less room for improvement. However, even in the presence of incentivised quality improvement programmes like the Quality and Outcome Framework in England, hospital admissions for COPD still occur more frequently among the least well served such as those in deprived areas.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> So there is still room for improvement among certain subgroups of patients with COPD and it might be a question of targeting DM programmes at those most likely to benefit.</p><p>Fourth, changes in healthcare occurred during the study period that affected COPD care in the RECODE as well as the usual care group. Since July 2010, a new bundled payment scheme for patients with COPD has been introduced in the Netherlands to stimulate the integration of care.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In this scheme, healthcare insurers purchase integrated care from care groups by negotiating a fixed price per patient per year for all multidisciplinary COPD care required by a patient. As the bundle excludes secondary care and medications, it primarily stimulates the cooperation between different providers in the primary care setting. This increased attention for integrated chronic care and the ability to reimburse COPD interventions such as smoking cessation and nutritional counselling could have stimulated integrated care in the usual care group too.</p><p>Future research should determine the cost-effectiveness of more intensive COPD-DM programmes in primary care using a long(er) time horizon. Hence, the gains from preventing patients with moderate COPD to progress to severe COPD are likely to be detected only in the long run.</p><p>In conclusion, this comprehensive economic evaluation of an integrated care programme in primary care showed that the programme increased costs but did not improve health outcomes. It even reduced QALYs. This is most likely due to the suboptimal translation of the provider-oriented interventions of the RECODE programme into patient-oriented interventions, the suboptimal implementation of the interventions, the relatively mild COPD population and the national reforms in COPD care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MPMHR-vM, WJJA, JG and NHC conceived and designed the study.
