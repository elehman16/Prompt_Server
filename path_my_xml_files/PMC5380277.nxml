Present prospective, randomized, and controlled study was performed to determine the benefits of warmed liquids infusion compared with infusion of liquids kept at room temperature in elderly patients during hip surgery. The outcome measures included time to recovery, length of hospital stay, Steward score, visual analogue scale (VAS) score as well as postoperative adverse events rate.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This prospective, randomized, single-blind, and controlled trial included patients who underwent bilateral hip arthroplasty at the Second Hospital of Jilin University between December 2015 and April 2016.

Computer-generated allocation sequences were used to randomize patients (SPSS version 22.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p><p>After entering the operating room, patients&#x02019; heart rate, blood pressure, and oxyhemoglobin saturation were monitored. Venous access was established and continuous invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring was performed before anesthesia.

Ephedrine or methoxamine was used to patients to normal blood pressure. Subsequently, central venous catheterization was performed. The anesthesia status was maintained using total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was performed to control the infusion speed of anesthetic drugs. BIS values were maintained between 45 and 55 for all patients. Patients received blood transfusion based on the time of fasting and water deprivation, as well as intraoperative blood loss, central venous pressure was maintained between 6 and 10&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O during surgery. After surgery, drugs were withdrawn. Endotracheal tube was extracted when patients presented spontaneous breathing, normal reflexes, recovered consciousness, and stable oxyhemoglobin saturation above 93%.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Definition</title><p>Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the following formula: BMI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;weight (kg)/height (m)<sup>2</sup>.

They have demonstrated an effective reduction of the incidence of adverse events caused by low temperature of infusion.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the present study, we reported the benefit of prewarmed infusion in patients who underwent bilateral hip replacement as demonstrated by the significantly shorter time to recovery (spontaneous breath, eye opening, and consciousness recovery), higher recovery score, and the lower level pf pain in patients who received an infusion of fluid warmed with an infusion fluid heating apparatus (35&#x000b0;C) as compared with those who received an infusion kept at room temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C). Our results are consistent with previous description.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Additionally, we compared the incidence of adverse events between 2 groups. Body temperature is controlled by 3 mechanisms: import of temperature information, information integration of information in the central nervous system, and controlled export of information regarding heat production or dissipation.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Drugs used for general anesthesia such as propofol and opioids are able to block any of these 3 mechanisms of temperature regulation system.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Additionally, skin disinfectant evaporation and long period of surgical exposure also increase the risk of hypothermia. Several adverse events such as patients shivering and discomfort can occur during operative hypothermia. In the present study, there was a significantly higher incidence of shivering during extubation which was found in patients receiving an infusion kept at room temperature than in those receiving pre-warmed infusion. These results indicated that prewarmed infusion can effectively reduce heat loss and maintain normothermia, thus decreasing the incidence of adverse events.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that perioperative hypothermia is an independent risk factor for POCD in patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Several factors including age prolonged the duration of anesthetic drugs action, and lower educational level, reoperation, and postoperative infection were also found associated with the incidence of POCD within 1 week after surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Age is the only risk factor for POCD within 3 months after surgery. In the present study, we compared to the incidence of POCD between patients from both groups within 48&#x0200a;hours after surgery. A significantly higher incidence of POCD occurred in the control group than in warming infusion group. These results can be explained by the fact that more patients experienced perioperative hypothermia in the control group due to prolonged anesthesia and delayed recovery in this group. Our results showed that a prewarmed infusion is beneficial for improving the POCD as well as prognosis, which was consistent with the previous description.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, we assessed the incidence of POCD in patients only during 48&#x0200a;hours. Furthermore, cardiovascular and coagulation system adverse events have not been documented. Thus, further studies with long-term follow-up and much more monitoring measurements are still necessary.</p><p>In summary, prewarmed infusion is beneficial for elderly patients during bilateral hip replacement, as it can shorten time for extubation, improve the quality of extubation, and reduce the incidence of postoperative shivering and POCD. The results of this study can provide a reference for clinical decision making during surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BIS = bispectral index, BMI = body mass index, POCD = postoperative cognitive dysfunction, SD = standard deviation, VAS = visual analogue scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>HM and BL should be regarded as cofirst authors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Learmonth</surname><given-names>ID</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rorabeck</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>
