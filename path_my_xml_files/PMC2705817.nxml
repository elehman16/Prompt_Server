Primary variables were MSSBP change from baseline to week 8 and incidence of peripheral oedema reported as an AE. Resolution of peripheral oedema was assessed 4 weeks after switching patients from amlodipine 10 mg to amlodipine/ valsartan 5/160 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At week 8, MSSBP showed greater reduction with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg than amlodipine 10 mg (least square mean: &#x02212;8.01 vs.&#x02212;5.95 mmHg, p&#x0003c;0.001 for non-inferiority and p=0.002 for superiority). Systolic control, overall BP control and systolic response rate at week 8 were significantly higher with combination than amlodipine 10 mg (34 vs. 26%; 57 vs. 50%; 36.57 vs. 27.77%, respectively). Incidence of peripheral oedema was significantly lower with the combination than amlodipine 10 mg (6.6 vs. 31.1%, p&#x0003c;0.001). Peripheral oedema resolved in 56% patients who switched from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination, without the loss of effect on BP reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In non-responders to amlodipine 5 mg, treatment with amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg induced significantly less peripheral oedema than amlodipine 10 mg for similar BP reduction.

At the capillary level, venodilation should compensate for the arteriolar dilation and thus minimise amlodipine-induced peripheral oedema. The combination of valsartan and amlodipine is associated with better efficacy and tolerability than amlodipine alone.</p></sec><sec><title>What&#x02019;s new</title><p>This study shows that adding valsartan to the common starting dose of amlodipine provides similar BP reduction with a better tolerability profile (leading to fewer discontinuations) when compared with the up-titration of amlodipine. This further enhances the clinical evidence for the early use of combination therapy, supported by effective BP reduction, improved tolerability and increased persistence on antihypertensive treatment.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertension is a well-known major risk factor for target organ damage and cardiovascular (CV) clinical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), representing the number one underlying cause of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Although available data from controlled clinical studies indicate that blood pressure (BP) reduction to target levels (BP &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensive patients and &#x0003c; 130/80 mmHg in diabetic patients and high or very high-risk patients) is associated with a significant decrease in CV mortality and morbidity, such target BP values are difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Thus, available data indicate that a major challenge in the treatment of hypertension is inadequate BP control, with only 3&#x02013;38% of patients worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and 31&#x02013;63% in developed countries attaining target BP of &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Among various factors contributing to inadequate BP control, efficacy and tolerability of drug treatment seem to play a prominent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Monotherapy is a rational therapeutic approach in patients with mild BP elevation and low-to-moderate CV risk, with targeted BP &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). However, the ability of any agent used alone to achieve target BP values is limited to not more than 20&#x02013;30% of hypertensive patients except in those with grade 1 hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In responders to monotherapy, but with uncontrolled BP, the increase in dosage for drugs with dose-dependent efficacy constitutes a further rational therapeutic approach. But several antihypertensive drugs, including calcium antagonists, also have a dose-dependent tolerability profile. Therefore, increasing the dose could result in an increased incidence of adverse events (AEs), thus reducing patient compliance with therapy. In these patients, low-dose combination therapy is a better therapeutic alternative, provided that the combination includes drugs with different and complementary mechanisms of action, which could additionally potentiate the antihypertensive effect and improve tolerability while minimising individual side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Moreover, a fixed-dose combination of two drugs fulfilling the above mentioned criteria can simplify the treatment schedule and improve patient compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is one of the most widely used agents in the treatment of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and is considered by many to be the most efficacious. However, a major hurdle with the use of amlodipine is the occurrence of peripheral oedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), when the dose is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Therefore, a rational therapeutic approach for preventing the peripheral oedema associated with amlodipine, would be to add a potent and highly selective blocker of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), such as valsartan to compensate for the arteriolar dilation produced by amlodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) by also dilating the venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), limiting fluid leakage into tissues. Thus, two key mechanisms are targeted to achieve rapid and optimal BP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and indeed the combination of amlodipine and valsartan is associated with a significantly better BP-lowering effect and greater response rate compared with amlodipine alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the non-inferiority of the combination amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg compared with amlodipine 10 mg with respect to antihypertensive efficacy, along with the incidence of peripheral oedema, in patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg alone. We also assessed the incidence of peripheral oedema resolution when patients who developed peripheral oedema during 8 weeks of treatment were switched from amlodipine 10 mg to the combination of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the benefit of the amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg combination in reducing peripheral oedema, for the same BP lowering, compared with amlodipine 10 mg alone in patients with essential hypertension. The study was performed in 148 centres in 12 countries (Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey) between January and November 2007 and was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), Declaration of Helsinki and applicable local regulations. The study received approval from Institutional Review Board or Ethical Review Committee, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The study comprised a 4-week, single-blind, amlodipine 5 mg run-in period and a 12-week, double-blind, active-treatment period. At the end of the single-blind, run-in period, patients whose mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) was not adequately controlled (MSSBP &#x02265; 130 and &#x02264; 160 mmHg) were randomised (1 : 1) to receive amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg combination or amlodipine 10 mg alone for 8 weeks. At week 8, patients who were on amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg combination continued the same treatment, whereas those who were on amlodipine 10 mg alone switched to the amlodipine/valsartan combination for an additional 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the study design.

On the first day of the double-blind phase, BP was measured in both arms using an Omron automated BP monitor, and the arm with higher diastolic BP reading was used at all subsequent visits. The MSSBP and mean sitting diastolic BP (MSDBP) were measured at trough three times (at 2-min intervals between measurements) at each visit, and the average of three readings was recorded for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Male and female patients (aged &#x02265; 55 years) with essential systolic hypertension (MSSBP &#x02265; 140 and &#x02264; 160 mmHg, if not previously treated and MSSBP &#x02264; 160 mmHg, if pretreated on monotherapy) were enrolled into the run-in phase at week-4.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for randomisation were patients with MSSBP &#x02265; 130 and &#x02264; 160 mmHg and no peripheral oedema.

The secondary efficacy variables were the (i) change in MSSBP and MSDBP, (ii) systolic control rate (defined as MSSBP &#x0003c; 130 mmHg), (iii) overall control rate (defined as BP &#x0003c; 140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic patients and &#x0003c; 130/80 mmHg for diabetic patients), and systolic response rate (defined as MSSBP &#x0003c; 130 mmHg or at least 20 mmHg reduction from baseline in MSSBP) at weeks 4, 8 and 12 in each treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><sec><title>Peripheral oedema</title><p>The second co-primary variable was the presence of peripheral oedema, which was evaluated at every visit. The evaluation was based on spontaneously reported oedema by the patients and on the presence of signs of oedema on physical examination of the patient by the investigator. Patients were counted as having peripheral oedema if it occurred at any time postdose, up to and including week 8. The absolute number and proportion of patients with peripheral oedema at any time postdose and up to and including week 8 were summarised by severity (none, mild, moderate and severe) and treatment group. If the severity changed over time, the maximum severity was used for analyses. If a patient experienced more than one occurrence of peripheral oedema between start of the double-blind phase and week 8, it was only counted once in the analysis. In the case of patients who discontinued before week 8, the information available up to that point was used for analysis.</p><p>The absolute number and proportion of patients with peripheral oedema resolution at week 12 (after switching from amlodipine 10 mg to the amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg combination at week 8 or continuing on amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg for 12 weeks) were also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Further safety assessments</title><p>Other safety assessments included regular monitoring and recording of all AEs, vital signs and physical examination, laboratory investigations and ECG as per the visit schedules. Each AE was described by its duration, severity and relationship to the study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using non-inferiority tests at the one-sided significance level of 0.025. A sample size of 916 patients (458 patients per group) was required (90% power) to show non-inferiority (change in MSSBP and MSDBP) between the treatment groups. The intent-to-treat population was used for the efficacy analyses. The safety population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug) was used for the analysis of data on peripheral oedema and AEs.</p><p>For the primary efficacy variable, the last postbaseline MSSBP measurement collected (LOCF) was used for the analysis in case of patients who discontinued prior to week 8. The change from baseline (day 1) in MSSBP and MSDBP at weeks 4, 8 and 12 was analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as covariate and a non-inferiority margin of 3 mmHg for MSSBP and 2 mmHg for MSDBP. A logistic regression model was used for the analysis of the number of patients with systolic BP control and systolic response rate (with baseline MSSBP as covariate) and overall BP control (with baseline MSSBP and MSDBP as covariates). The proportion of patients who developed peripheral oedema in each treatment group up to and including week 8 was analysed using logistic regression, with treatment, region and diabetic status as fixed factors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics</title><p>Of 1644 patients who were screened, 1521 were enrolled into the single-blind amlodipine 5 mg, run-in phase (week-4).

This study evaluated the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of the combination of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg compared with amlodipine 10 mg, in non-responders to amlodipine 5 mg. Among those non-responders, a higher proportion achieved BP control with low-dose combination therapy compared with high-dose amlodipine monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Adding an ARB, such as valsartan, presents a feasible and safe therapeutic alternative to dose escalation in such patients. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>While efficacy is the prerequisite for optimal BP control, tolerability is an important determinant of adherence to therapy and attainment of long-term BP goals. The high incidence of peripheral oedema with amlodipine is because of potent arteriolar or precapillary dilation (without dilation in the venules or postcapillary circulation). The resultant extravasation of fluid into the surrounding tissue manifests as peripheral oedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Addition of valsartan in the combination dilates venous capacitance vessels with consequent intracapillary pressure normalisation, thereby minimising exudation of fluid from the inter-capillary space, and counteracting oedema caused by amlodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), the combination of amlodipine and valsartan demonstrated a lower incidence of oedema in patients randomised to the combination. However, in this study, much of the reduction in the incidence of oedema seen with the combination is likely because of the different doses of amlodipine in the two arms.</p><p>In those patients from the high-dose amlodipine group experiencing oedema, resolution occurred in more than half of the cases after switching to the combination. However, these data must be considered in light of the fact that significantly more patients discontinued from the amlodipine monotherapy arm during the first 8 weeks of the study, primarily caused by peripheral oedema. This may have introduced a selection bias where only those patients whose oedema was less severe continued into the second phase of the study and were switched to the combination. Thus, one might surmise that the effect would have been different and had more patients experiencing oedema in the amlodipine 10 mg arm completed the study.</p><p>Aside from the lower incidence and resolution of peripheral oedema, the overall incidence of AEs (oedema being the most frequent AE) was also lower with the amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg combination than with amlodipine 10 mg. This led to many more discontinuations because of AEs with amlodipine monotherapy than with the combination. In addition to the added advantage of a better tolerability profile for a comparable efficacy, the administration of fixed-dose combination regimen in hypertension is associated with fewer discontinuations and better compliance than administration of two agents separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Lack of discontinuation or persistence to the treatment regimen is essential for hypertension control and best clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In those hypertensive patients not adequately responding to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy, the combination of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg induces significantly lesser peripheral oedema for similar BP reductions, and a better safety and tolerability profile than amlodipine 10 mg. In addition, in patients experiencing oedema in the high-dose amlodipine monotherapy arm, more than half resolved after switching to amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg. Thus, an effective alternative to amlodipine dose escalation in patients would be a combination of low-dose amlodipine and valsartan, which has a better antihypertensive effect than high-dose amlodipine and a better tolerability profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to all participating investigators and study co-ordinators at the study centres and all patients for their commitment to the study.
