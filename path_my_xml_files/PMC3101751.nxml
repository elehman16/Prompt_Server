All of these untoward effects may hamper patients&#x02019; cooperation during surgery, and would make these agents less than ideal for the intraoperative management of sedation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Propofol is widely used for sedation during eye surgery because of its short duration of action, no cumulative effect, unique recovery profile as well as its rapid emergence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] In contrast, dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist with both sedative and analgesic properties and is devoid of respiratory depressant effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has been studied for sedationand analgesia sparing properties in surgical settings[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] but not in vitreoretinal surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and respiratory effects (as a primary end-point) and the recovery profile and surgeons and patients satisfaction (as a secondary end-point) with dexmedetomidine sedation compared with those of propofol sedation in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery under sub-Tenon&#x02019;s anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent from all patients, 60 adult patients (ASA I-III) of both sexes were scheduled for retinal detachment surgery including pneumatic retinopexy, segmental buckling&#x000b1;gas, and vitrectomy&#x000b1;gas&#x000b1;silicone oil. Vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane or macular hole was included. The patients were enrolled in this prospective, single-blind, randomized study in case that the expected time of surgery to be less than 2 h. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 18 years, the usual contraindications for regional anesthesia such as patients refusing LA, clotting abnormalities, impaired mental status, or allergy to any of the study medications. Also, patients were excluded if they had severe cardiac disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and a history of sleep apnea. This study was carried out in the Magrabi Eye and Ear Hospital in Oman by the January 2008 to December 2009. Patients were randomly (the block randomization method was used with the block size determined to be six) allocated to one of the two groups to receive either dexmedetomidine (group D, <italic>n</italic>=30) or propofol (group P, <italic>n</italic>=30) for sedation during surgery under sub-Tenon&#x02019;s anesthesia. The patients were masked to the treatment arms. All measures were assessed by the first author, while the perioperative anesthesia management and drug preparation were performed by the second author. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (fourth author) who was blinded to the technique of sedation.</p><p>Patients arrived in the operating room fasted for 8 h and unpremedicated, a peripheral i.v. catheter was inserted and standard monitoring, including noninvasive arterial blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiogram (5 leads), heart rate (HR), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpaO<sub>2</sub>) were used. A nasal cannula was applied and supplemental oxygen was given throughout the procedure at 2 L/min. Expired CO<sub>2</sub> (infrared spectroscopy) was sampled from one port of the cannula. Sedation level was assessed every 5 min by using the Ramsay sedation scale (RSS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] which was explained to the patients during the preoperative visit. Dexmedetomidine (Precedex, 200 &#x003bc;g per 2 mL; Abbott, USA) was diluted with 0.9% NaCl to a concentration of 4 &#x003bc;g/mL in 50 ml syringe. Group D patients received dexmedetomidine1 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. over 10 min using an infusion pump (AS50TM, Baxter Health Care Co., Singapore), and followed by a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 to 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg /h, starting at 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and titrated every 5 min, in steps of 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. In Group P, an initial dose of propofol (propofol 1% fresenius, contains: 10 mg/mL propofol) was infused i.v. over 10 min at 0.7 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/h (the propofol doses are adjusted from our experience in the hospital for sedation during ophthalmic regional anesthesia). To achieve adequate sedation in both groups, infusion doses of test drugs were titrated as required to achieve the target RSS of 3 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>]. During the procedure, if bradypnea (RR&#x0003c;10) or SpaO<sub>2</sub> was 92% or less, bradycardia (HR&#x0003c;45) and hypotension (MAP&#x0003c;50) were recorded, 4 L/min of supplemental oxygen was administered via a nasal cannula, 0.5 mg atropine was administered, and 0.9% saline was infused, respectively, with reducing rate of infusion of the drug aiming to awake the patient and to resume his normal breath. The infusion pump was stopped at the end of the procedure in both groups.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ramsay sedation score</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Observation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anxious, agitated or restless</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cooperative, oriented and tranquil</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responsive to commands</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asleep, but with brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asleep, sluggish response to glabellar tap or auditory stimulus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asleep, no response</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>After completing the loading dose of the study drug, sub-Tenon&#x02019;s block was performed.

At similar sedative doses, dexmedetomidine and propofol resulted in a similar significant reduction in HR and MAP compared with baseline values. The same results were reported by Kaygusuz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Previous studies had demonstrated a powerful inhibitory effect of propofol on sympathetic outflow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is also known to decrease sympathetic outflow and circulating catecholamine levels and would therefore be expected to cause decrease of MAP similar to those of propofol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] The decrease in the HR might be attributed to the sympatholytic effects and in part because of a vagal mimetic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, the interesting finding in this study was that the dexmedetomidine sedation maintained an adequate respiratory function as compared with propofol sedation. The RR and SpaO<sub>2</sub> values of the dexmedetomidine group were significantly higher than those in the propofol group during the sedation period. The expired CO<sub>2</sub> was similar in both groups. Hsu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] reported similar effects on respiratory functions during dexmedetomidine sedation. They explained that by the increase in minute ventilation coincided with arousal phenomenon. Such arousal phenomenon, secondary to the hypercapnia stimulation, has been described during natural sleep. Dexmedetomidine converges on the natural sleep pathway to exert its sedative effects. Therefore, the similarity between the hypercapnic arousal phenomenon during dexmedetomidine infusions and natural sleep is not surprising. However, we reported that the expired CO<sub>2</sub> was similar in both groups; the minute ventilation cannot be measured in the absence of endotracheal tube. Measurement of the expired CO<sub>2</sub> through the nasal cannula is qualititative more than quantitative. In addition, De Sarro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] has reported that &#x003b1;-2 receptors are located at multiple places in the central nervous system. Hypercapnia activates the locus ceruleus, which is associated with increase apprehension and which leads to the stimulation of the respiratory centers. Ebert <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] also reported similar results with dexmedetomidine sedation.</p><p>On the other hand, Arain and Ebert[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] reported similar respiratory end points between dexmedetomidine and propofol groups while Kaygusuz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] reported that the RR values were significantly lower and the SpaO<sub>2</sub> values were significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the propofol group. This discrepancy in the results could be resulted from the difference in the regimen of drug infusion or the combination of narcotics. Sedative doses of propofol had been established to have minimal depressant effects on tidal volume and minute ventilation, with end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tension and arterial blood gas values remaining unchanged.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] In the recovery room and postoperatively, we found that the time to achieve an Aldrete score of 10 was similar in both groups and dexmedetomidine showed better analgesic properties than propofol (lower VAS) which was not relevant clinically as both groups had VAS scores&#x0003c;4. It is now well described that dexmedetomidine has analgesia sparing effects when used for sedation in the ICU.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] The half-life of dexmedetomidine has been described as 2 h, would likely to explain why the analgesic sparing properties persisted postoperatively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] This interesting characteristic of dexmedetomidine (persistent analgesic effects with preserving the patient arousability) in the postoperative period resulted in significantly more analgesia with equivalent discharge times when compared with the short-acting propofol. Similar results were reported in a previous study by Arain and Ebert.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>Another finding in our study was that the surgeon&#x02019;s satisfaction with patient&#x02019;s sedation was similar for both groups. While, in the dexmedetomidine group, there was higher patient&#x02019;s satisfaction compared with the propofol group which may be related to the natural sleep pathway of dexmedetomidine sedation. These results are similar to those reported by Arain and Ebert.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>In summary, monitored sedation for patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery under sub-Tenon&#x02019;s anesthesia is challenge for the anesthetist. Taking into account that benzodiazepines may result in respiratory depression and confusion, particularly, when administered to elderly patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] and opioids are associated with increased risk of respiratory depression with episodes of apnea resulting in oxygen desaturation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] propofol is the widely used sedative hypnotic because of its minimal cardiorespiratoryeffects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] This study evaluated dexmedetomidine sedation, which is a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist, compared with those of propofol sedation for this group of patients. We conclude that dexmedetomidine at a similar sedation levels with propofol was associated with equivalent hemodynamic effects, maintaining an adequate respiratory function, similar time of discharge from PACU, better analgesic properties, a similar surgeon&#x02019;s satisfaction with patient&#x02019;s sedation, and a higher patient&#x02019;s satisfaction. Thus, dexmedetomidine may prove to be a valuable adjuvant for sedation in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery under sub-Tenon&#x02019;s anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Mahmoud M.
