and chest mobilization exercises on pulmonary function and chest expansion in chronic
stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke patients were randomly divided into
two groups: a core stabilization exercise group (n=15) and a chest mobilization exercise
group (n=15). Each exercise was performed 3 times per week for 30 minutes for 4 weeks, and
pulmonary function and chest expansion when breathing were measured for both groups.
[Results] There were significant increases in both forced vital capacity and forced
expiratory volume in 1 second before and after intervention. Core stabilization exercise
resulted in a significant increase in peak expiratory flow, and significant increases in
upper and lower chest expansion were detected with chest mobilization exercise. However,
no significant difference was revealed between the two groups. [Conclusion] This study
suggested that both exercises were effective in some aspects of pulmonary function while
core stabilization can help increase peak expiratory flow and chest mobilization can
assist with chest expansion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Core stabilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Chest mobilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>After stroke, damage to the upper motor neurons can cause a deconditioned state. This
results in physical inactivity and eventually a reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in physical activity through
the movement of the thoracic cage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
stabilization exercise improves respiratory function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, therapeutic exercise is important in improvement of
pulmonary function in stroke patients. In addition, because the inspiratory limitations in
stroke patients are manifested by thoracic cage contracture and the expiratory decrease is
caused by weakness of the hemi-abdominal muscle<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is necessary to choose a proper exercise method depending on
physical condition.</p><p>Currently, stabilization exercises and chest mobilization exercises that have been utilized
in stroke patients have been objectively confirmed to increase their respiratory
function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization exercises activate one&#x02019;s trunk muscles, providing
stability to the spine and abdominal wall<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The contraction of the diaphragm and transverse abdominis helps
abdominal breathing, as it increases abdominal pressure<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chest mobilization exercise is a combination of deep breathing and
active movements of the limbs and body. It improves ventilation by increasing movement in
the shoulder girdle, trunk, and chest wall, thereby improving chest breathing<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, a previous study involved comparing the control group with chest mobilization
exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and comparing the control
group with stabilization exercises<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, both
of which are the same as the majority of other studies compares the exercises to the control
group. Although there are studies investigating the pulmonary function and stability of the
trunk after comparing chest expansion exercise and chest resistance exercise, it was not
able to confirm the PEF and chest-wall expansion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The chest mobilization exercise in this study was designed to
enhance the pulmonary function while increasing the fascia of the neck and chest and the
movement of the trunk on the affected side<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study is to compare
core stabilization exercise for the improvement of respiration, and chest mobilization
exercise through deep muscle strengthening. Afterwards, its purpose is to suggest an
effective exercise method for pulmonary function and chest-wall expansion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients who had been admitted to the P Convalescent Hospital in Gyeonggi Province
and had been diagnosed with a stroke for more than 6 months by a specialiset in the
Department of Rehabilitation Medicine were selected for the study. They included patients
without respiratory diseases or injuries, patients who were not receiving any special
treatment to improve their pulmonary function, patients who had scored more than 24 points
in a Korean version of mini-mental state exam, and patients who had a score of 2 or less in
the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Patients who had orthopedic disorders or rib fractures
were excluded from the study. The study was performed from June 6, 2016 to September 30,
2016. This study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Yong-In University. Informed
consent was obtained and all subjects who agreed to participate were given sufficient
explanation of the study&#x02019;s purpose. The general characteristics of the participants in this

stroke were randomly divided into two groups&#x02014;15 people were placed in the core stabilization
exercise group and the other 15 were placed in the chest mobilization exercise group. This
intervention was conducted 3 times a week, for a total of 4 weeks.</p><p>The core stabilization exercise was utilized with patients after appropriate modification
using a study conducted by Oh and Park<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> as
a reference. For the exercise, a total of 5 movements were set including: contraction of
transverse abdominis, maintaining the bridge position, lifting one leg while maintaining the
bridge position, lifting both legs while lying in supine, and lifting both arms and legs
while lying in supine.</p><p>For the chest mobilization exercise, 5 kinds of movements were included using the chest and
neck mobilization technique described by Lima et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and Colby and Kisner&#x02019;s<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> chest mobilization exercise as references. Fascia
globalmobilization: The patient was supine, with the therapist at the bedside with 2 hands
on the patient&#x02019;s sternum. At the end of the expiration, the therapist amplified the decline
in the chest being supported by the manubrium. At the end of inspiration, the therapist
amplified the chest elevation through a little traction on the xiphoid process. Scalene
muscle mobilization: the patient was supine, with the therapist at the bedside with the hand
performed an occipital grip, and the opposite hand on the upper trapezius. Tension was
obtained by occipital hand pull. Sternocleido-occipital-mastoid muscle mobilization: The
patient was supine, head opposite rotated to the treated muscle. The therapist at the
bedside with the hand on the muscle to be treated held the skull base, and the opposite hand
applied mobilization to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Tension was obtained by a downward
pressure of sternal hand, accompanying the patient&#x02019;s expiration. To mobilize paretic side of
the chest: while sitting, have the patient bend away from the tight side and expand that
side of the chest during inspiration. Then, have the patient bend toward the tight side
during expiration. To mobilize the upper chest and stretch the pectoralis muscles: While the
patient is sitting in a chair with hands clasped behind the head, have him or her
horizontally abduct the arms during a deep inspiration. Then instruct the patient to bring
the elbows together and bend forward during expiration. Each exercise was done for 6
minutes, for a total of 30 minutes.</p><p>Pulmonary function was assessed using a spirometer (MicroLab spirometer ML3500 MK6, UK) to
measure FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and PEF before and after the intervention. Subjects were asked
to sit on a chair with a seat back, put on a nose plug, and place a disposable mouthpiece
into their mouths. After the intervention they were asked to breathe normally 3 times, and
then to carry out their maximum inspiration and expiration for 6 seconds, as prompted by the
researcher&#x02019;s foot signal.</p><p>The chest-wall expansion measurement was performed using a tape measure
(Hoechstmass-Rollfix, Germany) to determine the range of motion of the thoracic cage. The
upper chest expansion measure was made by placing the tape measure parallel to the space
between the 3rd rib and then measuring the area where it made contact with the 5th spinous
process. For the lower chest expansion measure, it was made by measuring the area that was
horizontal to the inferior aspect of the xiphoid process and 10th spinous process, and the
measurement value was the difference between the measured value at maximum inspiration and
maximum expiration. The inter-rater reliability of this measurement method is 0.99, which is
close to 1<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. All the interventions and
evaluations were carried out by one researcher who has more than 5&#x02005;year experience, and no
information about the exercises was given to the subjects to exclude items that seem to
affect parameters.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 20.0 program. The general
characteristics of stroke subjects were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In order to
analyze the effect of intervention methods on pulmonary function and chest-wall expansion, a
paired t-test was used. To evaluate the effect of intervention on pulmonary and thoracic
cage expansion, an independent t-test was used for analysis. All statistical significance
levels were set to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Analysis of the changes in pulmonary function of the core stabilization exercise group

significant improvement in FEV and FVC after intervention. However, in the PEF of the two
groups, a significant increase in the chest-wall expansion was only shown in the chest
mobility exercise group.</p><p>With the purpose of stimulating the core muscles in stroke patients, Oh and Park<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted lumbar stabilization exercise on
patients 3 times a week for 30 minutes each, over a span of 8 weeks. The results showed that
there was an increase in FEV1, FVC, and PEF, which is consistent with our findings. Core
stabilization exercises activate one&#x02019;s core muscles to increase the intra-abdominal pressure
and to reduce intrathoracic pressure through the contraction of abdominal walls. This helps
increase airflow<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In pulmonary function, the PEF is dependent on the force-velocity relationship and
length-tension relationship of the exhalation muscles. Because it is a measurement method
that is affected by abdominal muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>,
it seems that improvement of pulmonary function including the PEF is possible.</p><p>Song and Park<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the FVC and
FEV1 of stroke patients increased after performing chest-expansion exercises 5 times a week
for 30 minutes each, for 8 weeks total. Park<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that there was an increase in the upper and lower chest
expansion through rib cage joint mobilization among stroke patients. In addition, Minoguchi
et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that chest expansion
significantly increased after carrying out respiratory muscle stretch exercises in patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but there were no significant differences in
PEF, which is consistent with our study&#x02019;s results.</p><p>This study showed no significant difference between the two groups. Similarly Kim et
al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that there was no
significant difference in pulmonary function and chest expansion when comparing the
abdominal muscle exercise and thoracic mobility exercise. Unlike Kim&#x02019;s, study, the current
study showed a significant increase in PEF in the core stabilization exercise group, and
there was a significant increase in chest expansion in the chest mobilization exercise
group. It is assumed that the chest mobilization exercise improves chest-wall expansion as
it is an intervention aimed at reducing stiffness of the chest wall<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, not at improving respiratory muscle strength. In
addition, an increase in the chest-wall motion can increase one&#x02019;s lung volume during
inspiration, so the FEV1 is also increased when the FVC increases.</p><p>Therefore, if the decreased respiratory function is due to a weakening of the abdomen and
reduced exhalation caused by muscle coordination disorders<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, then core stabilization exercises should be carried out rather than
chest expansion exercises. However, if the reduced exhalation is due to the thoracic cage
contracture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, then we recommend doing
chest expansion exercises rather than core stabilization exercises.</p><p>This study was conducted in a specific medical institute and because of the small sample
size, it is difficult to generalize the results of the study. In addition, the comparative
analysis only involved pulmonary function and chest function, so it is difficult to say that
the measured results reflect the overall respiratory function of stroke patients. Therefore,
in the future, a larger study with a greater sample size could reveal more substantial
differences among the patient groups.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>MacKay-Lyons</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Howlett</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Exercise capacity and cardiovascular adaptations to
