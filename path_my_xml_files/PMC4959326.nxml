Our hypothesis was that through a yoga program, children would improve their motor abilities and physical capacities, and also present some positive changes in behavior toward yoga practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>This study is characterized as a quasi-experimental study with mixed method,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which was chosen to integrate the results and produce a relationship between the findings.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The study was approved by the University's Ethics Committee (no. 2003109).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Subjects</title><p>The selection of the sample was intentional, according to children's and parents&#x02019; acceptance. The study included 16 children (8 males and 8 females), aged 6&#x02013;8 years old, who had no previous experience with yoga. The children were enrolled in the 1<sup>st</sup> grade of an elementary public school located in the periphery of a major city in the South of Brazil. One of the children had a diagnosis of autism; none of the others were diagnosed with disabilities. The informed consent was obtained from the parents and/or legal guardians and the school board of education.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment</title><p>The balance, running speed and agility, and strength subtests of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - Second Edition were used to assess children motor abilities.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The performance of the child in each task generated a gross score, and the sum of the tasks generated the total raw score, which was converted to a standard score according to the child's sex and age.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] For this study, we used the results by task and the total raw score for each subtest.</p><p>A version of the sit and reach from Eurofit test[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was used to assess children flexibility. The children sited on the floor barefoot and with legs stretched out straight ahead. Both knees locked and pressed flat to the floor. Children placed their heels on the mark and then with palms facing downward and the hands on top of each other reached forward along the measuring. Children hold the position for seconds while the distance was recorded in centimeters. The better of two attempts was considered.</p><p>The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (PSPCSA) was used to assess the children perceptions of competence and social acceptance.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This scale consists of 24 items organized into four subscales: Perceived cognitive and motor competence, social and maternal acceptance. Each question includes two figures: One of these figures represents a competent/accepted child, and the other a child not as competent/accepted. After choosing which figure feels more alike them, children must decide how much the level of concordance (range: From 1 [low proficiency/acceptance] to 4 [high competence/acceptance]). The sum of the questions result in the subscale score, and the sum of the subscales results in the total score.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>To assess behavioral toward yoga, semi-structured interviews with the children and the classroom teacher were conducted. The interview of the children involved questions regarding the meaning of yoga practice, the activities they most liked to do, the practice outside of school, and the interest to continue practicing. The teacher's interview looked at issues relating to expectations in regards to the yoga program and her opinion after the program finished. In addition, children's behavioral changes that were visibly observed and other observations related to the yoga program were also questioned.</p><p>A questionnaire was sent home to parents or the legal guardians of children. The questions addressed the impact of yoga classes in the home environment as well as their perceptions of the influence of the yoga program in the life of their children.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Yoga program</title><p>The yoga program was implemented in the physical education classes during 12 weeks, twice a week for 45 min each lesson. Since the public school has no gym or other safety space, the lessons were implemented in the children classroom. A student-centered approach of teaching was implemented. Appropriated practices were provided with a yoga movement curriculum with scope and sequence based on children the initial level of performance in order enhances cognitive, social, and motor development. The teacher used direct and indirect learning strategies, encouraging children do modeled movements, and to discovery the different ways to move.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The instruction was meaningful and adequate to the children level of understanding, using simple words, and cue word to perform the yoga postures. The teacher also encourages the self-expression throughout the movement[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and equally encourages boys and girls as well the child with disability to achieve success and cooperate with each other. Different skill levels of yoga tasks were presented in each session that encompassed group diversity of skills levels. The teacher strategies also supported the autonomy of children, personal and group achievements, and the active participation in decision-making during the learning process.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Teacher also employed a strategy of &#x0201c;gymnastics storied&#x0201d; in which yoga postures were practiced in accordance with different children's books. Stretching and massage in pairs, meditation, and relaxation as well as games and music related to the practice of yoga were also implemented. In addition, the classes emphasized the breathing awareness and the adoption of basic values of social interaction, nonviolence, truthfulness, respect with themselves and the others, and cooperation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS-20.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM).

Our findings suggest positive improvements on the static and dynamic balance, and strength and flexibility; the participants also reported positive feelings related to the yoga practice.</p><p>Regarding balance, all the improvements corroborate with previous studies that also suggested that the practice of yoga promotes significant gains on the static and dynamic balance of children.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] We suggest that these gains could be related to the practice of some yoga postures, such as the airplane (Virabhadrasana C), tree (Vrksasana), surfer (Virabhadrasana B), and star (Utthita Trikonasana) that requires support on one foot, the trunk tilt forward and also generating instability and the need to working in balance.</p><p>The children's ability to speed running and performed agility tasks showed improvement, gains were observed during the tasks of set the pace and jump sideways with feet together. No studies were found related to the assessment of these abilities after the practice of yoga in children that to some extension limits our possibilities to compare results. It has been suggested that yoga promotes improvements in motor coordination and general motor control,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] consequently, could generate improvements in total body coordination and temporal organization,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] which are essential features perform speed and agility tests. Further studies are necessary to improve the yoga effects on the speed and agility of children.</p><p>The results observed in this study regarding children enhancements on strength received support from three previous. Researchers reported visible improvements on strength as a result of participation on a yoga intervention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In addition, increases in the median were large [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], which indicate a probable limitation to achieve significance in some strength tasks due to the reduction in number of children in this study. Moreover, the strength subtest showed significant and positive change, so the discrete changes (small increments) of each task were sufficient to indicate positives changes in strength pattern of children. During the program, several yoga postures emphasize this physical capacity, such as superman (Salabhasana), boat (Navasana), invisible chair (Utkatanasana), and half bridge (Setu Bandhasana). These postures that require the work of different muscle groups, such as dorsal and abdominal region, as well as upper and lower limbs, that may have influenced the positive results observed in children performance.</p><p>The positive increments in flexibility performance also corroborate with previous research.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] We suggested that these gains are result from the practice of the postures that emphasizes muscles, stretching. Some examples of postures that may have contributed for these results are the sandwich (Paschimottanasana and Utanasana), dog (Adho Mukha), butterfly (Baddha Konasana), and snake (Bhujangasana). All these postures require the maintenance position and different muscle groups&#x02019; stretching impacting the children performance.</p><p>No significant results were observed on the perceived competence and maternal and social acceptance results. Although previous studies highlight that yoga practice could promote the increase of self-perception and self-regulation of behaviors,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] our study could not find support for these changes in behavior. However, some of the children thoughts illustrate well a couple of changes in self-perception and self-improvement (please refer to Speech 5). It is important to notice that self-perceptions are hard to be changed in a short period of time, may be an extensive program would detect more convincing changes related to this parameter.</p><p>The children's interest in continuing the practice of yoga after the end of the program, as well as the appreciation, and the spontaneous participation in the lessons, observed in this study, has been previously acknowledge in the literature.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Furthermore, the feelings expressed by children [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and children discourses] corroborate with the literature suggesting that yoga practice can promote self-observation and self-knowledge in children.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The achievement of a greater command and control of emotions and calm feelings in nonpleasant experiences, reported in literature,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were also observed in the children discourses (refer to speeches 3, 4, 5, and 8). The children's thoughts show that the yoga program helped them learn how to deal with emotions, and adapt to face and encounter challenging situations without suffering, interesting acknowledgment demonstrated by children in this study at young age.</p><p>In addition, improvements in social interactions (refer to speech 7) and reflection about health-related values were also reported (refer to speech 10), similar to the previous study.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The literature also supports that yoga could contribute in reducing the levels of stress and anxiety in children,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which was clearly noticed in children's interviews (refer to speeches 1, 2,4, and 9).</p><p>Previous studies suggest that yoga practice could contribute in increasing social acceptance, communication, and contributions in classes,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] result also observed in children's interviews. The speeches 7 and 9 were very strong in expressing these feelings. Children reported that after the yoga program they start to play with friends more often, felt more intelligent and well behaved in the class. The yoga practice for children seems to have a significant impact on general well-being,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] resulted confirm in this study.</p><p>Ultimately, the benefits reported in children, in this study, are similar to the findings for adults.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Our results supported that yoga practice is very suitable for the school environment, serving as an educational intervention that promotes development and health for children, as previously suggested.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It could also contribute for the well-being of children's future[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] if constantly included in the curriculum program.</p><p>The limitations of the study were the short period of intervention that was limited by the school board of education, the small sample size since it was an automatic choice for children, and also the lack of a control group. Further studies are necessary to detailed determine the changes that a yoga program can generate for school-age children, considering the educational values of this practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the results of this study, we suggest that a 12-week yoga program promoted positive effects on the development of motor and physical parameters of children, especially on balance, strength, and flexibility.
