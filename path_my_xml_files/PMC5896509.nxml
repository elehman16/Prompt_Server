It is estimated that 82 000&#x02013;99 000 young people initiate smoking every day, with the majority residing in low- or middle-income countries.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The latest Global Youth Tobacco Survey data from Central and Eastern European countries neighboring Romania report a lifetime smoking prevalence that spans from 39.2% in the Republic of Moldova to 58.8% in Bulgaria and a past 30 days smoking that ranges from 9.3% in Serbia to 28.2% in Bulgaria with a downward time trend over the past 5- to 6- year period.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, the 2011 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs that includes nationally representative data from the same countries suggests that both lifetime and past 30 days smoking prevalence could be higher than estimated in the Global Youth Tobacco Survey.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The 2009 Global Youth Tobacco Survey indicates that 41.2% of Romanian school students aged 13&#x02013;15 years have smoked at least once in their lifetime and 13.5% have smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30 days.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs 2011 Report shows that lifetime smoking prevalence among 15- to 16-year-old Romanian students could be as high as 52% and last 30 days smoking as high as 29%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A recently published study about 15-year-old adolescents living in Tirgu Mures, Romania reports similar prevalence data (53.2% and 24.1% respectively).<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Daily smoking rates among 15-year-old Romanian adolescents are estimated between 6.4% and 12%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Comprehensive, evidence-based tobacco control strategies implemented according to the principles outlined in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, such as the National Truth Campaign, are needed to reduce the global burden of tobacco.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></sup> A key element of these strategies is the need for coordinated state and community interventions aimed at preventing youth and young adults from tobacco use initiation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>School-based programs are a generally accepted component of a comprehensive strategy to curb tobacco use among children and adolescents. Schools are considered an optimal site for delivering antitobacco programs to children and adolescents, with health education curriculum taught by teachers or trained professionals being the most widely accepted and used intervention in antitobacco education.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>School-based interventions may include at least three practical approaches: (1) health education curricula (teachers, health professionals, psychologists and more recently, computers deliver a planned tobacco curriculum over several sessions); (2) peer-based interventions (older student-led interactive educational activities); (3) school policy and culture (setting up tobacco control rules and penalties).<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The most comprehensive and recent Cochrane review on the evidence regarding school-based interventions for smoking prevention has shown that their effectiveness varies depending on the type of interventions and the timeframe of the assessment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The pooled analysis of the school-based smoking prevention programs has shown no significant effect on smoking initiation at 1 year follow-up or less, while on the longest follow-up has produced a significant effect. Further subgroup analyses of the interventions at 1year follow-up or less by type of curricula involved in the program indicated that exclusively information giving and exclusively social influence curricula had no significant effect on smoking initiation, while combined social competence and social influence programs significantly reduced it. Furthermore, social competence-only curricula as well as combined social competence and social influence curricula had significant effects on reducing uptake of smoking while information giving only and social influence only type of curricula have shown no significant effect at the longest follow-up. Finally, no significant effect was detected either at 1 year and longer follow-up for multimodal programs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The mixed results of previous research indicated the need for further investigation on the impact of new technologies in prevention programs.</p><p>Web-based programs can be delivered to large groups of adolescents under relatively private conditions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In addition, these programs can be completed at a speed that is convenient to each user, and experts consider that web-based interventions have low-cost.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Several web-based programs were developed and tested for their efficacy in various countries including Australia (Consider This)<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, United States (ASPIRE&#x02014;A Smoking Prevention Interactive Experience)<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, Netherlands (Smoke Alert,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Fun without Smokes<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>).

Moreover, the students in the intervention group scored significantly favorable on two of the secondary outcomes (decisional balance and temptations to smoke scale) measured at 18 months.

The sampling frame included all the 16 high schools in Tirgu Mures, Romania, with a total of 82 ninth grade classes. Inclusion criteria were (1) schools having at least one ninth grade class per school and at least 15 students per class; (2) a functional IT laboratory; and (3) a willingness by the school principal to participate in the study. The list of eligible schools was obtained by the research assistant from the county educational department. Three classes from one school declined to participate due to organizational reasons. The remaining sample included 16 schools, 79 classes, and 2002 students.</p><p>In order to minimize contamination, the randomization occurred at the school level with an allocation to treatment and control conditions 1:1. After attaching a two digit code to each of the eligible schools listed in alphabetical order, a concealed random allocation was performed at school level by drawing the school codes written on pieces of folded paper from a bag. All the students in the enrolled schools were invited to participate in the trial.</p><p>Enrollment started in November 2014 following approval by the Institutional Review Board of University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures and by the head of the county education department. Parents were informed about the purpose, benefits, and risks of the study and all parents provided written consent before randomization. Adolescents were included if the following criteria were met: basic computer skills, ninth grade student, and parental written consent.</p><p>Students in both conditions completed the baseline questionnaire in November 2014 (1 week before intervention) and the follow-up questionnaire in May 2015 (6 months after baseline, 5 months from the completion of the intervention, 1 week after the booster session). The web-based questionnaire was completed in the computer lab during one teaching hour under the supervision of trained field assistants unknown to the participants.

ASPIRE was designed for middle and high school students and was developed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center and The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The program was designed using the social cognitive theory<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and the transtheoretical model of change<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and contains embedded animations, video, and interactive activities (quizzes and games) structured in five learning modules. The educational content covered the basics regarding smoking prevention and cessation: individual and social determinants of smoking, health, and financial consequences of smoking, nicotine addiction, the impact of smoking on the environment, strategies, and techniques to quit and resist smoking, dealing with stress, peer pressure, social temptations, and mood changes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> All users received the same content and all modules were presented sequentially; the web material was not tailored per individual&#x02019;s responses and it was not possible to skip modules. Details about the key intervention components by module, step, and media type are presented in the Supplementary Table S1).</p><p>During November&#x02013;December 2014, the students in the intervention group received five weekly sessions of ASPIRA and one &#x0201c;booster&#x0201d; session during the following semester, in May 2015. Each session was 45 to 50 minutes in duration. The ASPIRA field assistants provided the students with general guidance at the beginning of each session and offered them individual help at request during the sessions. Students were provided with headphones for privacy and noise reduction and accessed the ASPIRA program individually in the computer lab using unique login codes. Their progress was quantitatively assessed weekly at individual, class and school level. The web-based educational content was available from a subdomain of the University&#x02019;s website.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Program Translation and Adaptation</title><p>The ASPIRE program adaptation process included consultations with Romanian and Hungarian specialists in smoking prevention, with Alexander Prokhorov&#x02014;the designer of the original ASPIRE, and a feedback received through a formal pilot study that involved prospective participants. The aim of the pilot study was to identify any language, cultural, technical, and implementation barriers in the target group and included a total of 120 Romanian and Hungarian high school and university students.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Adaptations included: program interface, menu labels, text subtitles, and audio tracks were translated from English into Romanian and Hungarian in order to maximize comprehension of the curriculum; smoking-related statistics referring exclusively to the United States in the original material were replaced with corresponding national or European data; smoking costs expressed in US currency were recalculated in local currency; a number of idiomatic, culturally specific phrases and everyday life situations were substituted with locally meaningful messages or symbols (ie, motivational messages that supposed a detailed understanding of baseball technicalities were transposed in the context of soccer game). Finally, some media content was edited for shortness and a few excluded being considered not relevant in the Romanian context (ie, the Rogue Gallery game, a media material presenting snuff and chewing tobacco, was excluded because their use in Romanian teenagers is extremely low). All changes were approved by the original ASPIRE program staff to ensure the content remained theoretically coherent following cultural adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>We tested the efficacy of the adapted ASPIRA intervention on smoking initiation (among never-smokers at baseline) and current smoking (among those who previously experimented with tobacco, but were not current smokers at baseline), 6 months after the baseline data collection. We applied hierarchical logistic regression analyses, first introducing the intervention, followed by covariates including demographic characteristics, peer smoking, sensation seeking, and depressive symptoms. In addition, we estimated the effect of intervention dose (defined as exposure to 75% or greater of ASPIRA content or &#x0003c;75% of the content) on the two smoking outcomes. Finally, we estimated the impact of the intervention on potential mediating cognitive variables&#x02014;decisional balance, negative consequences, and social benefit&#x02014;by comparing the mean changes in these constructs before and after the intervention, stratified by study arm, using three mixed ANOVA analyses.</p><p>All analyses were performed with controlling for the design effect due to the cluster sampling using complex sample analyses in SPSS 21.0. For baseline comparison of control and intervention groups, we applied student <italic>t</italic> test or Chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Results</title><sec id="s9"><title>Characteristics of the Sample</title><p>The sample included 1369 students in the ninth grade, of which 662 (48.4%) had ever tried smoking and 293 (21.4%) were current smokers.

Moreover, the local adaptation and translation of a web-based prevention program like ASPIRE demonstrate local capacity to utilize evidence-based programs rather than creating home-grown programs that may/may not have any impact on smoking cessation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> With increasing access to computers and mobile technologies in the region<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, the potential to scale-up such an intervention from a regional to a national study is achievable.</p><p>Overall, our study has demonstrated that the intervention reduced tobacco initiation, most notably among those students who were exposed to at least 75% of the ASPIRA program content. Usually the degree of exposure of the contents in web-based smoking prevention programs is not reported in relation to the efficacy of the intervention<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, however, some studies reported a relatively low level of exposure.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our study highlighted the necessity to measure the content exposure objectively, nonetheless, other indicators might be used also for future research such as time spent on reading and watching materials. Thus, if the ASPIRA will be adopted as a national youth prevention program, efforts should be made by local teachers and administrators to increase exposure of the program among youth. In line with our result, other web-based programs were also successful in decreasing the incidence of smoking initiation in different age groups<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, although some studies also reported null results.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Web-based programs might be a useful method to implement in smoking prevention curriculum in adolescence.</p><p>However, we did not find an effect of the program on current tobacco use, which is likely due to the low numbers of children who are engaged in past 30 day smoking and ultimately a limitation imposed by an underpowered study design. Similar negative results were reported regarding smoking behaviors elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>We also tested the potential role of mediating cognitive variables, such as decisional balance, as the perceived consequences of smoking (good and bad) have previously been shown to influence smoking behavior.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, our results showed no significant effect of the intervention on changes in decisional balance, which raises questions about the cognitive pathways through which interventions that deliver information and skills are perceived and integrated into participants&#x02019; psychological functioning and ultimately behavior. Although decisional balance is viewed the most important in preparing quitting smoking, it might be less relevant in initiating smoking among young people.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Nevertheless, other cognitive variables such as knowledge, smoking outcome expectancies, social norms would be possible mediators of such interventions and should be tested in the future research.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis provided evidence that prevention trials combining social competence/social influences curricula have a significant short-term effect on smoking prevention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In addition to the constructs of the transtheoretical model, the content of ASPIRA also covers the social competence and social influences approaches, which can explain why the intervention is effective in spite of the fact that decisional balance is not influenced by the intervention.</p><p>This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, given the low prevalence of some tobacco use behavior among youth, including current smoking, the study was likely underpowered to evaluate the effect of the intervention on them. Second, the study was conducted in a single city in the Transylvanian region of Romania with an ethnic composition representative of the region (51.9% Romanian, 45.2% Hungarian, and 2.9% Roma and other ethnic minorities). However, the overall ethnic composition of Romania is 89.5% Romanian, 6.6%, Hungarian, and 3.9% all the other ethnic minorities) which raises questions regarding the generalizability of results to other counties within Romania and to other countries. Nevertheless, our study highlighted the feasibility of web-based smoking prevention programs in urban school settings of middle-income countries. Third, the outcome variables were measured only with self-report, therefore we did not have the opportunity to verify the self-report biologically. An American study supported the validity of self-reported current smoking behavior with cotinine measure in adolescents.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However we cannot exclude the possibility that some unmeasured factors influence the self-reported smoking behavior in our sample.</p><p>Despite these limitations, there are several notable strengths, including the location of the study. The Central and Eastern European region is less researched in terms of smoking prevention. Our study also contributes with an example of adapting an already tested intervention into two other languages.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>Nicotine &#x00026; Tobacco Research</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the Fogarty International Center and National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number (1R01TW009280).
