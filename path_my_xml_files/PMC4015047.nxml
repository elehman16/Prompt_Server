Study Design: The study was a randomized and a double-blinded study which included 42 healthy young individuals with impacted third molars and bone retention. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n: 14) to which diclofenac potassium, naproxen sodium and etodolac were administered orally an hour before the operation. Impacted third molars were surgically extracted with local anaesthesia. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used to assess the pain in the 6th, 12th hours and on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th days postoperatively. Swelling was evaluated using ultrasound (US) and mouth opening (trismus) was measured with a composing stick pre and post operatively on the 2nd and 7th days respectively. 
Results: Regarding pain alleviation, diclofenac potassium was better than naproxen sodium and naproxen sodium was better than etodolac but these differences were not statistically significant. US measurements showed that the swelling on postoperative 2nd day was significantly lowest with diclofenac potassium as compared to others (p= 0.027) while naproxen sodium and etodolac acted similarly (p=0.747). No difference was noted regarding trismus in any of the groups.
Conclusions: NSAIDs (diclofenac, naproxen and etodolac) are somehow similarly effective for controlling pain and trismus following extraction of mandibular third molars but diclofenac potassium surpasses others in reduction of swelling.

As prostaglandins are presumed to be primary mediator of acute postsurgical inflammatory changes, these patients, therefore are ideal clinical subjects to study the effect of anti-inflammatory agents on sequelae of teeth extractions such as pain, edema and trismus (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as effective medications in the management of pain and other discomforts associated with oral surgery and exert their therapeutic effect through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which inhibits prostaglandin production whose synergistic interactions with other mediators promote local inflammatory reactions and hyperalgesia. Traditionally, two isoforms of COX are known: COX-1, a constitutive form expressed in almost all tissues which is responsible for the routine physiological functions of prostanoids, including gastric mucosal protection and vascular homeostasis and COX-2, which is found in a limited number of tissues such as kidney, prostate and brain which is primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoids and mediation of responses to pathological processes, such as inflammation, pain and fever (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Naproxen sodium, diclofenac potassium and etodolac have both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory effects (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Naproxen sodium is a propionic acid derivative mainly used in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and is also used as an antipyretic and anti-analgesic agent. Naproxen sodium is a NSAID that is traditionally orally administered and the usual doses for oral surgical procedures range between 275 and 550mg (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Diclofenac potassium is a NSAID that is either available as an immediate release oral potassium salt tablet form, or as a delayed-release sodium salt tablet form. Many studies showed efficacy of diclofenac as compared to other NSAIDs in management of acute pain following third molar surgery and other dental surgical procedures. As an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent, diclofenac dose ranges between 25 and 100 mg po for oral surgical procedures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Etodolac is a NSAID that is in acetic acid preparation form which is used in treating various acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoarthritis of all joints (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Earlier studies have reported that etodolac in 50 to 400 mg/day po doses provides dose-related relief of moderate to severe postoperative pain from a variety of surgical and dental procedures (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), when administered pre-operatively, can be absorbed and distributed to oral tissues before the initiation of surgical trauma, thus ensuring a blockade of arachidonic acid pathway, with subsequent reduction in the occurrence of post-operative swelling, trismus, discomfort and pain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study is to compare the preemptive administration of diclofenac potassium and etodolac and naproxen sodium on postoperative management of pain, swelling and trismus following removal of impacted mandibular third molars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>A clinical, randomized and double-blinded study which included 42 patients was carried out. Healthy outpatients of either gender, between the ages of 17 and 25 years, who presented to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics for surgical removal of mandibular third molars were included in the study. This study lasted a year and a half. The trial was conducted in accordance with the standards of Good Clinical Practices for NSAIDs drugs and guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration on human subjects. Also the local Institutional Review Board approved the design of the study. Exclusion criteria were hepatic or renal disease, blood dyscrasias, gastric ulcer, heart disease, known hypersensitivities, allergies or reactions to any of the study medications, pregnancy and lactation. In addition, patients who had taken any drug within last month before surgery were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study protocol was explained to all patients in detail and written informed consent was obtained. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups in a double -blinded fashion by using a prepared drug box with three compartments coded A (etodolac group), B (naproxen sodium group) and C (diclofenac potassium group) and each drug was handed as a coated tablet to patients 1 hour before the operations by the auxiliary personnel. In summary; a total of 42 patients were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 14 third molar teeth as mentioned above (A, B and C groups).</p><p>Patients in group A were given etodolac (Tadolak 200 mg tablet, Saba Drug Industries, Turkey). Group B received naproxen so-dium (Apranax 275 mg tablet, Abdi &#x00130;brahim Drug Industries, Turkey) and group C was administered diclofenac potassium (Cata-flam 50 mg tablet, Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland).</p><p>The degree of surgical difficulty of impacted third molars was assessed using Archers Classification (Class I and II). Vertical or mesio angulation and bony retention were taken into consideration. Oral perioperative antibiotics (500 mg amoxicilin, Alfoxil 500 mg tablet Abfar Drug Industries, Turkey), were administered to all patients 1 hour before the surgery also chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% (Klorhex Mouthwash, 200ML, Drogsan Drug Industries, Turkey) was given to all patients as mouth wash. On the following day after surgery, rescue analgesic (Paracatemol 500 mg, Parol tablet, Atabay Drug Industries, Turkey) was made available to all patients for use if needed.</p><p>- Surgical procedure</p><p>Surgery of the impacted third molars was carried out under local anaesthesia (2% Articain hydrochloride with 1:100.000 adrenaline) with buccal guttering technique after adequate elevation and reflection of buccal mucoperiosteal flap. Tooth delivery was followed by meticulous irrigation of the surgical site with physiologic saline (0,9 %). The three-sided muco-periosteal flap was repositioned and sutured. A single experienced surgeon performed the all surgical procedures. If operation times exceeded 30 minutes, those patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>- Measurement of Pain Intensity </p><p>Perioperative pain was assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Accordingly, pain was recorded as: &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; (no discomfort, VAS: 0), &#x02018;mild pain&#x02019; (almost unnoticeable pain, VAS: 1-2), &#x02018;moderate pain&#x02019; (noticeable pain but patient can engage in routine daily activities, VAS:3-4), &#x02018;heavy pain&#x02019; (very noticeable pain but patient can engage in routine daily activities, VAS: 5-6), &#x02018;severe pain&#x02019; (significant pain, patient can perform daily activities, VAS:7-8) and &#x02018;intolerable pain&#x02019; (patient cannot perform their daily activities and has to take rescue analgesic medication, VAS:9-10). For each patient, the subjective appropriate score was recorded by a questionnaire at 6th, 12th hours and on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th days postoperatively. Before leaving the clinic, the surgeon ensured that all patients were thoroughly instructed on how to complete the pain self-assessment diary and when to take medications.</p><p>- Measurement of swelling</p><p>The facial swelling was measured quantitatively in milimeters (mm) using ultrasound (US). Ultrasonographic measurements were carried out preoperatively and postoperatively at second and seventh days by single experienced radiologist. The ultrasound examinations were performed using linear 12 MHz probes (Toshiba SSA-770A/80, Aplio, Japan). The patients were placed in supine position and their faces were slightly turned to the contralateral side. The probe was placed transversely on the buccal space and short axis images were obtained. The anterior border of the ramus of the mandible and anterior border of the masseter muscle was used as reference landmarks for standardization of measurements. The probe was oriented transversely so that the cortex of ramus of mandibula lied as a definitive echogenic horizontal line posteriorly on the image screen. Then the vertical distance from the skin to this echogenic line was measured. Measurements were done on the screen after freezing the optimal image and obtaining three consecutive measurements. The median value was recorded and registered to the closest 0.1 mm. Both sides were measured in the same manner. This distance encompassed the skin and the buccal fat pad. This anatomic area was markedly affected by the edema and hemorrhage caused by tooth extraction. Patients were instructed to close their mouths and contact the upper and lower teeth in a natural relaxed way that maintained light interocclusal contact and told not to forcefully clench the jaw, teeth or masticatory muscles during measurements. Care was taken to avoid compression of buccal space.</p><p>- Measurement of maximum mouth opening ability (Trismus)</p><p>Mouth opening ability was measured in millimetres (mm) with a regular composing stick preoperatively and postoperatively at second and seventh postoperative days. The incisal edge of the maxillary central teeth and incisal edge of mandibular central teeth were used as reference points at the most available maximum mouth opening.</p><p>- Statistical Analysis</p><p>Data analysis was carried out using commercially available software (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, SPSS for Windows 15.0, Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Comparison of the independent drug groups were carried out using &#x02018;Kruskal Wallis Test&#x02019;. Double comparisons of the groups were done with &#x02018;Mann-Whitney U Test&#x02019;. Multiple comparisons of the data from different re-lated times among drug groups were calculated using &#x02018;Friedman Test&#x02019; and double comparisons of the same data were studied with &#x02018;Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test&#x02019;. The level of significance was set at P&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>Results</p><p>A total of 42 patients (14 male and 28 female; age ranging from 18 to 25 year; mean age, 20.8&#x000b1; 4.1 year), who had impacted molars which were Class I or Class II and in vertical or mesio-angular positions as described in Archer&#x02019;s Impacted Third Molar Classification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) were included in this study.

No major or minor complications related to medications were encountered in any of the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, the efficacy of NSAIDs which were diclofenac potassium, naproxen sodium and etodolac were investigated in regards to pain, swelling and trismus following third molar surgery. To our knowledge, there is no comparative study comparing these three drugs on this subject.</p><p>Close relation between postoperative complications (pain,swelling and trismus) and operation time was shown in various studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the present study, any third molar operation that exceeded 30 minutes was excluded from the study. If there was any deviation from the surgical technique described in the material and methods section due to difficulties in extraction, these patients were excluded as well.</p><p>Timing of NSAID administration is a subject of debate. Some authors favour preoperative medication arguing that it allows better postoperative analgesia control by suppression of peripheral and central sensitization while others argue that preemptive medication performs less compared to postoperative administration of the same drugs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In the study by Bridgman et al. diclofenac sodium did not demonstrate any significant pre-emptive analgesic effects (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). On the contrary Shah et al. compared the analgesic effect of diclofenac sodium before and after third impacted molar surgery and suggested that preemptive medication provides better pain control (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The findings in our study also support the notion to administer drugs preoperatively.</p><p>In this study, diclofenac potassium was slightly more effective on postoperative pain but the difference between diclofenac, etodolac and naproxen regarding pain in any postoperative time period was not statistically significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Oncul et al. compared preoperative IV diclofenac sodium with IV paracetamol (acetaminophen) and Lornoxicam and concluded that although all were equally effective on postoperative pain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Diclofenac was reported to be better in controlling postoperative pain compared to tramadol and ketorolac but less compared to piroxicam and nimesulid and tenoxicam (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>There are only a few studies about the efficacy of Etodolac on molar teeth extraction surgery. Etodolac performed better compared to placebo and showed similar efficacy compared to aspirin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), acetaminophen plus codeine combination and zomepirac regarding postoperative pain but performed less compared to diflunisal (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Combination of NSAID&#x02019;s with steroids appears to be more effective in controlling complications after third molar surgery as compared to NSAID&#x02019;s alone especially regarding pain and swelling, but carry a certain risk of adversity such as adrenal suppression and concerns about impaired wound healing, therefore their routine use has not been justified (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Bamgbose et al. compared co-administration of dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium with diclofenac potassium alone. They concluded that co-administration was more effective as compared to diclofenac potassium alone for pain and swelling but no significant difference was noted regarding trismus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Likewise, Lopez-Carriches et al. compared diclofenac to metilprednisolone and steroids slightly performed better in pain reduction and swelling but not in trismus (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Bj&#x000f8;rnsson et al. compared naproxen and acetaminophen on postoperative sequelae after impacted third molar surgery. They found that naproxen was more effective on pain than acetaminophen, but acetaminophen was more effective on swelling than naproxen (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the present study diclofenac appeared more effective on swelling than naproxen. When acetaminophen and diclofenac are compared, they were reported to have similar efficacy (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Acetaminophen is considered safer and combination with diclofenac is reported to perform better compared to diclofenac alone and acetaminophen codeine combination (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Several methods were employed to measure postoperative swelling including VAS, stereophotography, sutures and face-bow (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Ultrasound method was utilized in a few studies and reported to be an efficacious method of measurement and as good as CT (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Ultrasound was used this study to measure postoperative swelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Evolution of postoperative swelling.

Many studies support the present study in terms of mouth opening ability (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study; diclofenac potassium performed significantly better on swelling and as good as other two drugs naproxen sodium and etodolac regarding pain and trismus. In other words, the present study aligned the drugs as diclofanac potassium&#x0003e; naproxen sodium = etodolac in terms of reducing the postoperative third molar surgery sequelae. Various methods, such as different NSAIDs, laser, steroids etc. were tested and will continue to be tested on this issue.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
