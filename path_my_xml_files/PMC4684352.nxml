This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH, delivered as an extract of un-ripened avocado, on energy expenditure (EE) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs (total of 12 dogs, 26.99 &#x000b1; 0.634 kg, 4.9 &#x000b1; 0.2 y). The study was a double-blind, cross-over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments, control (CON) and MH (400 mg/kg of diet; 6 mg/kg BW), in random order. Resting and post-prandial (10 h) EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) were determined by indirect calorimetry (d 42). The following day, body composition was assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical&#x000ae; accelerometer (d 43&#x02013;47). A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal (d 49) and 4 h after consumption of their meal (d 56) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Diet did not affect body weight, resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation. Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post-prandial RQ (p = 0.02) and ratio of fat to lean body mass (p = 0.02). Physical activity during light time periods (but not dark) was lower in dogs fed MH (p &#x0003c; 0.05) during weekends, but not on weekdays. These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs, but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Procter and Gamble Pet Care.

As in humans, ageing in canines is thought to be accelerated by aspects such as genetics, disease, and/or harmful environmental and lifestyle factors. Nutrition management of dogs, throughout the life cycle, should seek to delay (or prevent) the physiological and metabolic changes associated with aging.</p><p>Energy restriction (ER), without malnutrition, has been shown to increase median lifespan in yeast, flies, nematodes, rodents [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and dogs [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies in humans and non-human primates have not found ER to increase lifespan, but have shown that ER provides protection from certain age related diseases [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, Labrador Retrievers subjected to 25% ER had and increased median lifespan (2 y), significantly lower triglycerides, cholesterol and superior glucose tolerance than control animals (fed to weight maintenance) [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, ER dogs had significantly lower ratio of body fat to lean mass than dogs that were not restricted. Despite these benefits, ER has limited clinical success, presumably due to the significant behavioural changes it elicits in pets, including begging, aggression and scavenging. Such behaviours are often perceived as negative by the owner, thereby straining the owner-animal bond and presumably resulting in poor owner compliance with ER strategies [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Food ingredients enriched with compounds thought to favourably alter metabolism or extracts of these compound may provide an alternative to ER. In humans, several plant-derived polyphenols are currently under investigation, including, but not limited to, resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. How these compounds exert their beneficial effects is not fully understood. However, many of these compounds are believed to work, in part, by activating the key energy sensing protein 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Once activated, AMPK promotes ATP-generating pathways and reduces anabolic processes, creating a direct link between cellular energy status and whole body energy expenditure (EE).</p><p>Mannoheptulose (MH), a seven-carbon sugar found in avocados, has been preliminarily investigated as a novel food ingredient for dogs. Early research demonstrated that MH competitively inhibits hexokinases [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies administering oral MH to dogs are limited and the results have been inconsistent. Labrador Retrievers fed a gelatin capsule containing 2, 10, and 20 mg/kg BW MH had lower fasting serum insulin than dogs fed a placebo capsule or a capsule containing 1 mg/kg BW MH [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, no changes in serum insulin or glucose or post-prandial energy expenditure (EE) were noted in Labrador Retrievers receiving a dietary dose of 200 mg MH/kg diet [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. No changes in serum glucose or insulin concentrations were noted in Beagles given an oral cocoa butter based supplement containing 8 mg/kg BW MH. However, a transient increase in post-prandial energy expenditure was observed [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The mechanism by which MH would impact whole body energy expenditure has not been investigated. As glucose deprivation has been shown to activate AMPK [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it is plausible that MH-induced inhibition of glycolysis would decrease ATP production thereby activating AMPK and in turn decreasing diet induced thermogenesis and increasing lipid oxidation and glucose uptake. However, this hypothesis has not been tested.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of dietary MH (400 mg MH/kg diet; 6 mg/kg BW) on EE in adult Labrador Retrievers. In addition, we examined the effects of MH on skeletal muscle AMPK&#x003b1; protein content and phosphorylation. We hypothesized MH induced inhibition of hexokinases would limit glucose as a substrate of energy production and consequently increase fat utilization. Furthermore, MH was expected to decrease post-prandial EE and this decrease would be associated with increases in the activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and Housing</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Procter and Gamble Pet Care (Lewisburg, OH).

All dogs resided at Procter and Gamble Pet Care (Lewisburg, OH) and were considered healthy based on a general health evaluation by a licensed veterinarian prior to study. Dogs were pair-housed in indoor runs (in the same building) with free access to water and indoor and outdoor runs. The indoor kennel (2.4 x 2.4 m) was maintained on a 12 h light (0600 h to 1800 h) and dark (1800 h to 0600 h) cycle, in addition to natural light. Indoor temperature was set at 22&#x000b0;C (range 18&#x000b0;C to 24&#x000b0;C) and humidity at 50% (range 40% to 70%) with 10 to 15 fresh air exchanges per hour. All indoor runs were equipped with raised canvas beds, toys and heated flooring. Outdoor runs (2.4 x 2.4 m) were equipped with toys and play yard equipment. All dogs received 40 min of supervised group exercise and socialization in a separate fenced yard daily (22.7 x 21.7 m).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was designed as a parallel, double-blind, cross-over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments, control (CON) and mannoheptulose (MH), in random order. The study took place January 2013 to July 2013 and included a ten week dietary adaptation period, two study periods (each 63 d), and a three week dietary washout between study periods. A summary of study measurements is presented in <xref rid="pone.0143324.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Glucose and lipid kinetics were measured as part of this study but will be presented in a separate manuscript. Briefly, plasma glucose, glycerol, and palmitate turnover and oxidation were measured in the steady state using a stable isotope dilution methodology and indirect calorimetry. The scheduling of study events reflects the need to accommodate multiple technical staff personnel on a single day. Furthermore, the indirect calorimetry method only allowed for 4 dogs to be measured per day. Therefore, the 12 dogs were divided into 3 groups of 4 dogs with each diet represented on each day and staggered 1 d apart.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0143324.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143324.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of study procedures.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0143324.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0143324.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day of Study</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measurement/Procedure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline <xref rid="t001fn001" ref-type="table-fn">

The day before study initiation, dogs were randomized to dietary treatment and energy intakes (1359 &#x000b1; 13 Kcal/d) were fixed throughout the entire duration of the study (including in between treatment periods).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Indirect Calorimetry</title><p>Respiratory gas exchange measurements were conducted via whole-body indirect calorimetry. The calorimetry chambers (76 cm &#x000d7; 53 cm &#x000d7; 61 cm, L &#x000d7; W &#x000d7; H) were made of clear plexiglass and fitted with a hinged access top door for providing food to the dog. Chambers were designed as open-flow circuits with room air pulled into the chambers at a rate of 22 to 26 L/min to maintain CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the chamber between 0.4 and 0.8%. Exiting chamber air was dried by passing it through columns of Drierite&#x02122; and magnesium perchlorate before reaching the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> analyzers (Qubit Systems Inc., Kingston, ON).</p><p>Prior to study initiation, dogs were acclimated over an 8 wk period (1 to 8 h per week) to rest comfortably and calmly in the chamber with no excessive activity or movement. Dogs that did not acclimate were ineligible to participate in the study. Gas exchange measurements were conducted 2 d prior to the initiation of each study period (baseline) and on d 42 of each period. Prior to any measurements, the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> analyzers were calibrated with standard gases and dogs rested in the chamber for a minimum of 25 min to ensure adequate CO<sub>2</sub> equilibration. Two fasting measurements were taken, after which dogs were fed their full daily ration of test diet as a single meal (time 0) and gas exchange measurements continued for 10 h. Animals were fed their full daily ration (opposed to their half ration) in order to maximize circulating MH concentrations and presumably its biological effects. Each chamber was sampled every 3 s over a 5 min period every 25 min. O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange and respiratory quotient data were logged in real time using data acquisition software (Qubit Systems Inc., Kingston, ON). Energy expenditure was calculated from O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production (VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>) using the abbreviated Weir equation [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and expressed on a per kg lean mass basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Body Composition Analysis</title><p>On d 43 of each period, body composition analysis was completed using an X-Ray Bone Densitometer (QDR4500, Hologic Inc., Bedford MA). Dogs were fasted overnight (18 h since last meal) and sedated using Dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor, Pfizer) at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg and Carprofen (Rimadyl, Pfizer) at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg administered i.m. Propofol (Propoflo, Abbott) at a dose of 5 to 7 mg/kg was administered i.v. for induction. Dogs were positioned on their sternum with the cranial aspect of ante brachium placed on the table to ensure the phalanges faced caudally. The hind limbs were extended with the tail placed straight and in between the hind limbs. A whole body scan was performed of the following regions: left arm, right arm, trunk, left leg, right leg and head. Scans were done in triplicate for each dog and the median value of the three scans was recorded. Following the scan, atipamezole (Antisedan&#x000ae;, Pfizer) was administered to each dog at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Dogs were placed in a heated cage until fully recovered and monitored for 1 wk for complications.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Physical Activity Monitoring</title><p>Continuous physical activity measurements were made using the Actical accelerometer (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR). The Actical device (28mm &#x000d7; 27 mm &#x000d7; 10mm, ~17.5 g) was attached to the dog&#x02019;s collar in the ventral position and all dogs were acclimated to wearing the device prior to study initiation. Raw activity values were converted to activity counts using ActiReader software (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR).</p><p>Baseline activity measurements were taken the week prior to study initiation and again the third week of the dietary washout period. Treatment measurements were taken on d 43 to 47 of each period (March 2013, period 1 and June 2013, period 2). The average activity per minute was calculated during dark (1800 h to 0600 h) and light (0600 h to 1800 h) time periods. The percent of active time was calculated by dividing the time when dogs were active (activities greater than or equal to 250 per minute) by the total time. Weekday (0600 h Wednesday through 0600 Saturday) and weekend (0600 h Saturday through 0600 h Monday) activity were analyzed separately, as there is less human interaction with the animals on weekends.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Muscle Biopsy</title><p>Muscle biopsies were taken after an overnight fast (18 h since last meal) on d 49 of each treatment leg. On d 56 of both treatment legs, dogs were fed their full daily ration of test diet at their morning meal and muscle biopsies were taken 4 h post-feeding (contralateral leg to that of the fasted sample).

The hair over the incision point was clipped and the skin was prepared aseptically. A 1 to 2 cm incision was made with a #11 scalpel blade in the lateral aspect of the proximal thigh, and a Bergstrom needle (Surgipro, Inc. Shawnee, KS) was used to obtain 20&#x02013;30 mg of muscle tissue from the vastus lateralis. The incision was closed using surgical skin staples (AutoSuture Appose ULC TM, Tyco) and atipamezole (Antisedan, Pfizer) was administered (0.2 mg/kg).

Mixed effects models were fitted using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS assuming fixed period and diet effects and dogs as random variables. Denominator degrees of freedom were calculated using the Kenward-Rogers approximation. Repeated measures within period on dog were analyzed using the autoregressive order 1 covariance structure. Multiple comparisons were made using the Tukey-Kramer method. Interactions between fixed effects were tested but only discussed if significant. For calorimetry data, fasting, 0 to 10 h post-prandial and 3 to 5 h post-prandial data were analyzed separately and time was considered a fixed effect. MH concentrations have been shown to peak in plasma between 3 to 5 h after feeding and the effects of MH on metabolism are transient. Therefore, the post-prandial time period of 3 to 5 h was selected to examine maximal MH effects, and in addition, to provide a basis of comparison for muscle protein analysis. Results were considered statistically significant if p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Body Weight and Composition</title><p>All dogs maintained good general health, with no instances of diarrhea or poor fecal quality, throughout the entire study.

These MH induced changes were not associated with alterations in EE or the content and phosphorylation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, decreased physical activity associated with MH feeding and led to a reduction in body fat to lean mass, without altering body weight (despite equivalent energy intakes). Energy expenditure as measured by indirect calorimetry includes obligatory and facultative components of REE, adaptive thermogenesis and a small amount of voluntary activity. It does not include the energy expended during voluntary physical activity. REE represents the major component of total EE (~70%) and is largely predicted by fat free mass [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As lean mass was not affected by diet in this study, REE was not expected to be affected by diet. The REE values observed in this study are similar to those reported in Beagles [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143324.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Labrador Retrievers [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143324.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Adaptive thermogenesis includes the energy produced in response to environmental temperature, behaviour, and diet and accounts for a relatively small proportion of total EE (~10%). MH had no significant effect on adaptive thermogenesis in the present study. This finding is in contrast to McKnight et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who noted an increase in post-prandial EE in Beagles fed a MH supplement (8 mg/kg). There are several key differences between these two studies. For example, the current study used Labrador Retrievers, whereas, McKnight et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] utilized Beagles. Metabolic differences between the two breeds have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the diets used in the two studies were considerably different with respect to dietary macronutrient composition and ingredients. Using the present EE results, a sample size of 44 dogs would be required.</p><p>As MH has been shown to inhibit hexokinases, the reduced flux through glycolysis was expected to limit glucose as a substrate of energy production and consequently increase fat utilization. In agreement, post-prandial RQ was transiently reduced in dogs fed MH, suggesting a higher proportion of fat relative to carbohydrate oxidation. However, RQ does not indicate net carbohydrate or fat oxidation, nor does it account for protein oxidation. Therefore, more sensitive measures of substrate oxidation are warranted. Inhibition of glycolysis may lead to a decrease in intracellular ATP. Lowering the ATP to ADP ratio would activate AMPK. Once activated, AMPK increases ATP production by potently promoting fat oxidation. Indeed, glucose deprivation, as imposed by another glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose, has been shown to activate AMPK [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143324.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, MH had no effect on the ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK protein content (used as a marker of AMPK activation) in skeletal muscle. It is important to note that an inadequate amount of muscle tissue was collected to complete the required analysis in all treatments, thereby reducing statistical power and the opportunity to detect significant differences. Glucose utilization in skeletal muscle is mediated by hexokinase II isoform, which has a low <italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for glucose compared to that of hexokinase IV found in liver, pancreas and brain. As glucose phosphorylation in skeletal muscle is saturated at low glucose concentrations, AMPK may not be as sensitive to changes in glucose supply as it would be in tissues that express glucokinase. In addition, MH was delivered in a mixed meal. Therefore, it is also likely that effectiveness of MH as competitive inhibitor of hexokinase II was overcome due to the abundance of dietary derived carbohydrate (glucose). A dose response study is necessary to better understand the role of dietary MH as a glycolytic inhibitor in skeletal muscle and other tissues, particularly adipose tissue, given the observed reduction in fat to lean body mass in the present study.</p><p>The final component of EE, physical activity, can account for 20&#x02013;30% of EE. Dogs in this study exhibited diurnal patterns of activity; specifically dogs were more active during the light than dark periods (irrespective of diet). This finding agrees with the activity patterns displayed by laboratory Beagles [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, feral dogs have been shown to be more active in dark periods than light periods [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Differences in physical activity patterns between laboratory housed dogs and feral dogs suggest that dogs are able to adapt activity patterns to their environmental conditions. In the dark time period, dogs were more active in the first study period (March 2013) than the second period (June 2013). This finding may be attributed to differences in light exposure and intensity between study periods. Specifically, exposure to natural light was reduced in the first period compared to the second period due to the time of year. The reduced exposure to natural light would have imposed an abrupt transition between light and dark periods, as artificial lighting was maintained on a 12 h cycle. Previous research in Beagles has demonstrated that dogs exhibit anticipatory activity prior to the lights coming on in an indoor housing arrangement [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Study period did not affect daytime activity patterns. This finding is in agreement with Siwak et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who found daytime activity patterns in laboratory Beagles to be largely dictated by standardized daily routine that dogs experienced in their housing facility. In contrast, MH decreased daytime physical activity on the weekend when there is reduced human-animal contact. It is important to note that activity, as measured in this study, represents the mean activity count (locomotion) over the entire light (06:00&#x02013;18:00) and dark periods (18:00&#x02013;06:00). It is unclear how MH affects discrete activity bouts and conversely rest periods, but this finding is interesting. Furthermore, locomotion encompasses complex behaviours (i.e., spontaneous activity, exploration and exercise) that are elicited by a wide range of internal and external stimuli. A more critical analysis of physical activity and related behaviours is necessary to fully understand the effects of MH.</p><p>With prolonged reductions in physical activity, as imposed by daily MH feeding, one may expect weight gain. However, MH decreased the ratio of body fat to lean mass, despite all dogs having equivalent energy intakes. To understand the impact of MH on EE better, other measurement techniques, including the doubly labelled water technique, should be considered. The doubly labelled water technique would enable average estimates of EE over variable time periods in the dog&#x02019;s regular environment. Furthermore, other sources of energy loss including fecal and urinary losses, which were not measured in the current study, should be examined.</p><p>Irrespective of MH, study period had a significant impact on several study outcomes, including body weight. Dogs in this study were fed to maintenance weight based on historical energy intake records yet still gained weight. Basing energy intakes on historical energy intake records is a common practice in companion animal nutrition, largely due to the impracticality of using more sensitive measures such as indirect calorimetry. However, the accuracy of energy intake records is debatable, especially for studies of long duration such as the present one. The primary reason for fixing energy intakes in this cross-over designed study (opposed to adjusting intakes weekly to maintain body weight) was to ensure individual dogs received an equivalent amount of MH in each study period. The body weight gain observed in this 6 month study was modest, approximately 3% of the animal&#x02019;s body weight (equivalent to a 2 kg increase in 70 kg adult). As lean mass was not different between study periods, the gain in body mass was considered fat deposition. Fat deposition was likely influenced by reduced physical activity observed in the second study period. Seasonal changes, including differences daylight exposure and climate, between period 1 (winter) and period 2 (spring) may have influenced animal activity patterns and in turn body composition. Seasonal changes in fat deposition have been noted in ruminants [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and recently cats [<xref rid="pone.0143324.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, information related to seasonal changes in physical activity and fat deposition in dogs is lacking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A modest but statistically significant transient reduction in post-prandial RQ was observed in dogs fed MH. The biological significance of the decrease in RQ is uncertain. It may be reflective of increased fat oxidation, as a reduction in fat to lean body mass with MH feeding was observed (despite equivalent energy intakes). However, changes in body composition with daily MH feeding (~6 mg/kg BW) were likely influenced by decreased voluntary physical activity, particularly on the weekend when there is reduced human animal contact. As physical activity encompasses a broad range of complex behaviours, a more critical analysis of physical activity (and related behaviours) is warranted. These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs, but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143324.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143324.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143324.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline<sup>1</sup> measures of resting and post-prandial energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) (d 42) in adult Labrador Retrievers fed either a control (CON, no mannoheptulose) or mannoheptulose containing diet (MH, 4 mg/kg BW) (a total of 12 dogs in a complete cross-over design).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143324.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143324.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline<sup>1</sup> measures of spontaneous physical activity counts as measured using an accelerometer in adult Labrador Retrievers fed either a control (CON, no mannoheptulose) or mannoheptulose containing diet (MH, 4 mg/kg) (a total of 12 dogs in a complete cross-over design).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143324.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff at the Procter and Gamble Pet Care (Lewisburg OH) for caring for the animals.
