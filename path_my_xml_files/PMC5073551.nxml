Patients with COPD tend to lead inactive and highly sedentary lifestyles, which may contribute to reductions in functional capacity. Targeting sedentary behaviour (SB) may be more attainable than exercise (at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity) for behaviour change in patients following an exacerbation. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 2-week at-home intervention providing education and self-monitoring to reduce prolonged periods of SB in patients with COPD discharged following an acute exacerbation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Patients will be randomised into 1 of 3 conditions: usual care (control), education or education+feedback. The education group will receive information and suggestions about reducing long periods of sitting. The education+feedback group will receive real-time feedback on their sitting time, stand-ups and step count at home through an inclinometer linked to a smart device app. The inclinometer will also provide vibration prompts to encourage movement when the wearer has been sedentary for too long. Data will be collected during hospital admission and 2&#x02005;weeks after discharge. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with patients in the intervention groups to explore patient experiences. Interviews with healthcare staff will also be conducted. All data will be collected January to August 2016. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability, which will be assessed by qualitative interviews, uptake and drop-out rates, reasons for refusing the intervention, compliance, app usage and response to vibration prompts.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The research ethics committee East Midlands Leicester-Central has provided ethical approval for the conduct of this study.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The lower levels of physical activity coupled with the often fragile physical and psychological health (eg, low exercise capacity and low self-esteem) among patients with COPD may make reducing sedentary behaviour (SB) a more suitable conduit for behaviour change.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> SB is defined as &#x02018;any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure &#x02264;1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting or reclining posture&#x02019;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients with COPD demonstrate significantly higher levels of SB compared with healthy controls.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>An acute exacerbation of COPD marks a critical life event, characterised by a worsening of symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation; bringing with it a plethora of negative impacts affecting both physical and psychological health.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For example, exacerbations contribute to reductions in patients' abilities to perform activities of daily living.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For patients hospitalised for an acute exacerbation of COPD, there is amplitude attention at the initial phase of admission followed by &#x0223c;7&#x02005;days of monitored inactivity and sedentariness.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Consequently, patients may be discharged less well equipped to manage their &#x02018;usual routine&#x02019; than when they were admitted.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Interventions for patients with COPD in close temporal proximity to hospital admissions are promising, with pulmonary rehabilitation within 4&#x02005;weeks postdischarge, found to reduce rehospitalisation in the preceding 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Despite this, postdischarge pulmonary rehabilitation is sparsely taken up by patients who are offered it at the point of discharge.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A stepping stone approach which does not emphasise exercise and does not require travel and additional time/appointments may serve to facilitate the physical and psychological well-being required for patients to invest in pulmonary rehabilitation. To date, few studies have specifically targeted non-rehabilitation physical activity or SB immediately after discharge. There is a need to determine the feasibility and acceptance of such programmes, the evaluation of which may be enhanced through qualitative approaches. Such an approach may even offer as an alternative for those patients unable to exercise at sufficient capacity to reduce readmission risk.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The time between hospital discharge and the initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation (for those who attend) marks an important period for patients. Pitta <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> highlighted that patients with low activity levels at 1&#x02005;month after discharge were more likely to be readmitted within the following year. Therefore, there is a need for behavioural interventions for patients on leaving the hospital in order to prevent further decline in quality of life, functional capacity and potentially encourage uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation. Owing to the impact of an acute exacerbation (eg, dyspnoea and fatigue) interventions requiring large amounts of effort or time may be impracticable.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Consequently, targeting SB (eg, long periods of consecutive sitting) during the early stages of postdischarge recovery may act as a catalyst to encourage patients to sit less and move more; equipping them with the ethos and habits to better engage in pulmonary rehabilitation when the time comes. Furthermore, targeting the displacement of SB with light activity such as walking may help to reduce the risk of readmissions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Indeed, physical inactivity is widely regarded as the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in COPD<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and preliminary evidence has suggested that a reduction in sedentary time from discharge to 6&#x02005;weeks will also help reduce the risk of readmissions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Wearable technologies such as pedometers, which provide a basis for self-monitoring and real-time feedback, have been shown to elicit increases in physical activity in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Patient-driven healthcare, facilitated by behavioural feedback and/or prompting, may empower patients to improve and track their health outcomes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In a metaregression to identify the active ingredients in activity promotion research, Michie <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> found self-monitoring and feedback to be among the most potent behaviour change techniques. Coupling behaviour change strategies such as self-monitoring and feedback, which are grounded in control theory,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> tend to have an impact greater than the sum of their independent effects.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As supported by a comprehensive review of SB change strategies,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> providing patients with education, self-monitoring, real-time feedback and behaviour prompts may yield promising results. However, in postexacerbation care for patients with COPD, the use of wearable technology for behaviour change has not been widely explored. Technology competency and psychosocial issues in this population, particularly during phases of acute illness, makes examining the uptake and engagement with such interventions fundamental to future success. The &#x02018;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Sitting and ExacerbAtions Trial&#x02019; (COPD-SEAT) will focus on the feasibility of delivering a home-based SB self-monitoring intervention in patients following hospital discharge for an acute exacerbation.</p><p>The objectives of the trial are to:

A researcher will revisit the patients at the bedside at an agreed time to collect the expression of interest form from the patient. For those patients who are not interested in taking part in the trial, reasons for this (if offered freely) may be taken as field notes or by an interview if patients consent to this. For patients wishing to take part in the study, informed consent will be obtained followed by prerandomised group allocation. If allocated to the education or education+feedback group, patients will then receive the respective intervention. Questionnaires, activity monitor deployment and qualitative interview (intervention groups only) will then be completed prior to discharge. The timing of these procedures will vary based on expected discharge. On discharge, patients will wear the activity monitors for 2&#x02005;weeks before returning for their follow-up appointment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Trial interventions</title><sec id="s2b4a"><title>Control</title><p>Although there are some variations in practice, &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; offered to patients with COPD admitted to hospital for an acute exacerbation typically comprises brief advice to take part in regular exercise, information about pulmonary rehabilitation, and a referral to a follow-up clinic if the patient is eligible and does not decline pulmonary rehabilitation during their admission. No in-hospital rehabilitation is conducted as part of usual care. Patients also receive brief discussions and advice regarding smoking cessation (if appropriate), medication and inhaler techniques, and oxygen therapy (if appropriate); generally lasting 15&#x02013;30&#x02005;min. All patients will receive a phone call during the first week of discharge, as per usual care.

Researchers will not be blinded to treatment allocation for qualitative interviews and study measurements. Baseline data will be collected during patients' hospital stay. The timing of baseline data collection cannot be standardised due to variation in the timing of patients receiving usual care from COPD specialist nurses, screening and length of stay.</p></sec><sec id="s2b9"><title>Sample characteristics</title><sec id="s2b9a"><title>Objectively measured physical activity and SB</title><p>Following hospital discharge (day 0), patients will be asked to wear two monitors, one posture sensor (gyroscope) and one triaxial accelerometer, for 14&#x02005;days and return the devices at the follow-up appointment (day 15). An ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer will be worn on a waistband (on the right anterior axillary line) for 2&#x02005;weeks to measure time spent in physical activity (ie, sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous) using common cut-points (eg, as published by Freedson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and step count. Patients will be asked to wear the device during waking hours and to only remove it during that period for water-based activities.</p><p>The LUMO posture sensor will serve to objectively quantify SB in all groups (control, education and education+feedback). Therefore, it will act as both the measurement and intervention device for the education+feedback group. In addition to physical activity intensity data collected by the ActiGraph accelerometer, the LUMO will provide information on sitting, driving, lying, standing, sit-to-stand transitions and stepping. The device will be worn on the lower back (in contact with skin) for 2&#x02005;weeks postdischarge. Patients will be asked to wear the monitor during waking hours and to remove it for water-based activities. The LUMO has been found to produce valid measurements of free-living SB (mean error of 9.5%)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and step count (mean absolute percentage error 0.4%)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> compared with the ActivPAL (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, UK). While no validation study to date has specifically examined LUMO stand-ups, valid free-living SB against the ActivPAL supports accurate detection of sit-to-stand transitions. LUMO data will be analysed in 5&#x02005;min epochs with behaviours summarised as a percentage of each 5&#x02005;min epoch (eg, 50% sitting will be converted to 2.5&#x02005;min sitting).</p><p>Patients will be asked to wear for the ActiGraph and LUMO monitors concomitantly for two main reasons. First, as noted above, the LUMO monitor is a relatively new device and has not yet been subject to multiple validation studies across different populations (eg, ages, disease states and habitual activity levels). Therefore, the ActiGraph provides a well-established measurement of physical activity and sedentary time in COPD and general populations. Second, it is unclear whether patients will dislike the nudge/vibration feature of the LUMO and thus remove it. Consequently there is a need for an independent evaluation and intervention sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s2b9b"><title>Psychosocial health</title><p>During hospital stay and at follow-up a range of health/psychosocial measures will be taken.

One of the main objectives of this feasibility study is to provide data on eligibility and recruitment and to enable an accurate estimation of the required sample size for a future trial based on a realistic recruitment plan. The number of hospital admissions for an acute exacerbation of COPD is &#x0223c;80&#x02013;100 patients per month and in a previous in-hospital early rehabilitation trial conducted in part at Glenfield Hospital, overall recruitment uptake was 32.3%.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, a similar admissions rate and uptake (&#x0223c;1 in 3) would be expected for COPD-SEAT.</p></sec><sec id="s2b11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Block randomisation (1:1:1) will be used to ensure a balance in sample size between the three study groups. Balanced combinations of group allocations within blocks will be conducted by a researcher at Loughborough University who is independent of the research team. This will ensure study team researchers will be blinded to group allocation prior to patients deciding whether to take part in the study. Owing to limited study team members and logistical barriers, study team researchers will be made aware of group allocation before consent. Patients will only be informed of their group allocation after providing informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b12"><title>Quantitative data analysis</title><p>As this is a feasibility study, it is not appropriate at this stage to aim for sufficient statistical power to detect changes over time or between group changes. Therefore, quantitative data analysis will primarily be descriptive; in the form of estimations of means and SDs and proportions of patients screened, eligible and willing to participate and complete the trial. In order to examine differences in patient characteristics between study groups, between-group comparisons will be assessed using independent t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Within-group comparisons will be conducted using paired sample t-tests or repeated measures ANOVA if data meet parametric assumptions.</p><p>Data will be entered and housed on a secure web-based database system, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), which has discrepancy management capabilities. Data will be transferred from REDCap to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for statistical analysis.</p><p>All participant information collected as part of the research will be kept strictly confidential. With permission, patients' general practitioner will be informed of their participation in the study. Any information regarding patients which leaves the hospital will have their name and address removed. Participants will not be identified in any subsequent written materials and results will be reported in such a way that confidentiality is preserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2b13"><title>Qualitative research</title><p>The aim of the qualitative research is to identify potential barriers and facilitators to participation in the trial and in the self-monitoring and education programme. This information will help maximise chances of avoiding recruitment and retention issues and facilitate optimal qualitative process evaluation of the eventual trial.</p><p>Patients randomised to the education or education+feedback intervention groups will be invited to take part in two semistructured interviews. The first interview will take place at the bedside before being discharged from hospital and will explore areas including perceptions of SB in general and in relation to managing COPD, previous experiences of using technology, previous experiences of advice about COPD self-management as well as their study expectations. The second interview will take place at the 2-week follow-up appointment. These interviews will explore the overall acceptability and experiences of the educational and self-monitoring interventions, how the interventions are perceived and how they fit into the daily life and health context of the participants, participants' perspectives on the recruitment process, context and time (ie, following exacerbation) of the intervention (both education and education+feedback) and specific components of the intervention (eg, prompts). Patients, who do not attend their follow-up appointment, will be invited for a telephone interview to explore reasons for not completing the study.</p><p>It is not only important to understand reasons for participant engagement with an intervention but also reasons for non-engagement. For patients who are offered the intervention but who do not take part in the main trial, reasons for not wanting to engage with the study will be noted as part of field notes or qualitative refusal interviews where patients consent to this.</p><p>Given the timing and setting of the trial (in-hospital and immediately after discharge) qualitative interviews with healthcare staff within the care pathway of hospitalised patients with COPD (eg, clinicians, COPD specialist nurses and ward nurses) will be conducted to explore topics, such as perspectives on the feasibility of reducing SB in this population and in the hospital setting and the use of self-monitoring technology to achieve this. All interviews will be conducted by a social scientist with experience in conducting qualitative research.</p></sec><sec id="s2b14"><title>Qualitative data analysis</title><p>The qualitative interviews will be recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.

Results will be disseminated to our Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation Patient and Public Involvement Advisory group whose members are current and former pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation patients or interested members of the public who have participated in previous research trials. We have a number of national and international visitors who come to share our practice which we anticipate will stimulate interest in the study findings.
