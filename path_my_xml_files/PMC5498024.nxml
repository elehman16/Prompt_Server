The sequelae, namely, cholestasis and cholangitis, entail interventional or endoscopic treatment, reoperation, and even retransplantation. Several classifications of bile duct changes have been proposed, and lesions affecting extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts are differentiated from those involving the extrahepatic portion alone.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In individual patients, ITBL pathogenesis typically remains obscure.

ITBLs were diagnosed in 21 (16%) of 131 grafts preserved using SAP, but only in 1 of 59 grafts preserved using SAP + BP. To confirm the role of ex situ BP in preventing ITBLs after transplantation, we initiated a multicenter study involving 13 liver transplant centers in Germany. The rationale of the study involved analyzing the outcomes of controlled flushing of the peribiliary plexus by arterial perfusion after retrieval.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This randomized, 2-arm, multicenter study included all consecutive full-size liver grafts procured between October 2007 and March 2010 from brain-dead donors aged 15 to 85 years in the Mitte and Nord regions defined by the German Organ Retrieval Foundation. An advisory board was established to control the course of the study and to monitor data safety. Liver grafts were randomly assigned to be preserved using either SAP or SAP + BP. Grafts were procured by 7 organ recovery teams and transplanted in 13 German transplantation centers blinded with respect to the graft preservation mode.</p><p>The study was performed per the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical commissions of all participating centers. Primary ethical approval was given by the Ethical Committee of Rhineland-Palatinate under the number 837.364.06 (5462) on December 20, 2006. All patients included in the final analysis provided written informed consent, either before inclusion in the study or before any data acquisition or study-specific investigations. Informed consent before data acquisition or study-specific investigations, instead of consent before inclusion in the study, was stipulated by the Ethical Committee of Rhineland-Palatinate, as both types of perfusion had been routinely used in Germany for several years before initiation of the study, and patients undergoing liver transplantation could receive a graft preserved either by SAP or SAP + BP. Therefore, consent to data acquisition and study-specific workup, but not consent to the type of perfusion, was required for participation in the study.</p><p>The study hypothesis postulated superiority of SAP + BP over SAP in preventing ITBLs. A sample size of 75 patients per study group was calculated to be sufficient for detecting a difference of 15% in ITBL incidence at 2 years after transplantation with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 5%. The difference in ITBL incidence was anticipated to be 15% based on our previous findings (ie, 16% in the SAP group vs 2% in the SAP + BP group).</p><p>The Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Trials of the University Medical Center Mainz was responsible for randomization, data management, and study monitoring. The randomization list was generated using permuted blocks of size 6, without any stratification factors. Sealed envelopes were prepared, which were opened by the procurement control center to inform the retrieval team about the required perfusion method.</p><p>The Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics of the University Medical Center Mainz oversaw the statistical design and evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study was clinical manifestation of ITBLs during 2 years of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were graft survival (death or retransplantation) at 24 months after transplantation; peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 3 days after transplantation; incidence of peak AST and/or ALT exceeding 2000 U/L within the first 3 days after liver transplantation<sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>; and biliary damage, as assessed through bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and &#x003b3;-glutamyl-transpeptidase levels, at 6 months after transplantation. Serious adverse events were also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>All consecutive patients older than 18 years and consenting to the evaluation of baseline and transplantation data were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included previous transplantation, split-liver transplantation, retransplantation, refusal to provide informed consent, and biliodigestive anastomosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Perfusion Mode</title><p>SAP was performed in situ with 10-L HTK solution administered over 10 minutes at a pressure of 100 cm above heart level and a temperature of 4&#x000b0;C. Before starting the perfusion, the infracardiac caval vein was incised to allow free outflow of perfusate. After retrieval of the liver, the portal vein was flushed with additional HTK solution (500 mL). In the SAP + BP group, the same SAP protocol was followed by additional BP with 300 mL HTK solution administered through the celiac trunk (temperature, 4&#x000b0;C; variable time; pressure, 100 cm above graft level). Vessels deriving from the hepatic arteries had to be clamped before ex situ perfusion. When accessory hepatic arterial supply was noted, perfusion of all vessels was required, and the total volume of perfusate could be increased up to 400 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Criteria for ITBL Diagnosis</title><p>At any time after transplantation, suspicion of clinical ITBL was established in patients with fever, cholangitis, septicemia, and elevation of cholestatic parameters (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and &#x003b3;-glutamyl-transpeptidase) by a factor of 3 or more above normal. The diagnosis had to be confirmed by visualization of the bile ducts (radiography through intraductal biliary drainage, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, or magnetic resonance imaging). Patency of the hepatic artery had to be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, or angiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiological Criteria for ITBL Diagnosis</title><p>Cholangiography via a biliary drain if in place, magnetic resonance cholangiography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography could be performed at the discretion of the participating centers. Cholangiography data were subjected to central assessment by 2 radiologists (M.P. and J.S.; Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the University Mainz, Germany) who were blinded with respect to clinical information and perfusion mode. Assessment and classification of detected ITBLs followed the criteria proposed by Buis et al.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The assessment was performed separately for the extrahepatic common bile duct, including the hilar bifurcation (zone A), the right- and left-sided bile ducts between the first- and second-order branches (zone B), the bile ducts between second- and third-order branches (zone C), and bile ducts in the periphery of the liver (zone D). Per these 4 zones, the presence and location of nonanastomotic biliary strictures, dilatations, irregularities, and cast formation were recorded, and the findings were classified as indicative of mild, moderate, or severe ITBLs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Censored time-to-event data were displayed using Kaplan Meier estimates and tested with log-rank tests. Proportions were compared using the Fisher test, and the Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables.

Ten symptomatic ITBLs occurred in the 33 patients who showed bile duct changes on cholangiography, compared with 2 clinically apparent ITBLs in 44 patients with apparently normal cholangiography (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Cholangiography and clinical findings of ischemic-type biliary lesions after transplantation of livers preserved using SAP alone or using SAP + BP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="txd-3-e183-g006"/></fig><p>In 36 patients, the quality of cholangiography allowed for an assessment of all 4 bile duct regions (zones A-D), and the results of this detailed analysis are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>TABLE 3</label><caption><p>Results of assessment of 36 biliary imaging studies after standard aortic perfusion or standard aortal perfusion plus arterial BP</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="txd-3-e183-g007"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Safety Analysis</title><p>The safety analysis showed no significant differences between the treatment groups.

The use of grafts from marginal donors and elderly donors has steadily increased during recent years,<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> leading to higher risk of developing ITBLs. Donor age is particularly high in Germany (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Because it is currently not possible to control immunological pathomechanisms or the detrimental influence of bile salts and other molecular mechanisms, prevention of ITBLs has been focused on clinical issues such as stabilization of the potential donor, improvement of graft retrieval, usage of improved preservation solutions, mode of preservation, reduction of ischemia time, and bile duct reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>When SAP + BP was adopted in our procurement region in the year 2000, we followed the rationale of hydrodynamics in the cardiovascular system, as described by R. M. Anderson.<sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Specifically, the principal requirement of normal circulation is a closed circuit filled with liquid at a positive mean pressure. During aortic preservation, the system is no longer a closed circuit, as it has usually been opened at the infracardiac portion of the caval vein to allow free outflow of perfusate. Positive intravascular basal pressure can, therefore, never develop in this system, not even if high pressure is applied to the perfusate bag during aortic perfusion. It is the lack of this positive basal intravascular pressure which theoretically prevents adequate perfusion of arteries deriving from the aorta. Hemodynamic measurements corroborated this explanation, as the amount of perfusate reaching the hepatic artery during aortic perfusion proved to be negligible.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> This shortcoming of SAP may lead to inadequate protection of the bile duct vasculature during cold storage. In view of this theory, our former results<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of ITBLs from 16% (SAP) to 2% (SAP + BP) appeared reasonable. Nevertheless, further confirmation was required before changing the general recommendation for preservation mode in our country; hence, the present randomized, multicenter study was initiated.</p><p>In this study, the 2-year incidence of clinically apparent ITBLs was comparable between the SAP and SAP + BP groups, as was graft survival rate. Based on these results, the superiority of back-table pressure perfusion in preventing ITBLs can be excluded. Similarly, no difference was noted between the groups in terms of graft damage, as assessed by peak levels of transaminases within 3 days after transplantation. The only difference between the groups was in terms of the number of patients with marked increase in transaminase levels (28 in SAP vs 15 in SAP + BP; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), but this observation may related to the arbitrary choice of the cutoff value of 2000 U/L.</p><p>How can the present negative result be explained in context of the superiority of SAP + BP observed in our previous, retrospective study?<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Several aspects may have contributed to this discrepancy. For example, when the former study was performed, University of Wisconsin solution was the standard preservation solution used in Germany. However, it appears highly improbable that the different viscosity of the preservation solutions (University of Wisconsin solution versus HTK) could have accounted for the negative results observed in the present study, because animal experiments indicated that arterial flow rates are not significantly affected by the viscosity of the solution used for SAP and BP.<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The volume of perfusate used for BP may also play a role. Nevertheless, in the former<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> as well as in the present study, BP was performed with 300 mL of the respective solution. Because the same volume of preservation solution was used in both studies, this factor does not explain the discrepancy in the results. Moreover, this volume of solution is expected to be sufficient for rinsing the hepatic arteries and arterioles several times, because experiments using vascular corrosion casting have indicated that the volume of these vessels hardly exceeds 50 mL.<sup><xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Therefore, we believe that the negative results obtained in the present study provide a realistic view of the comparative outcomes expected for SAP and SAP + BP perfusion.</p><p>Despite the overall negative outcome as to the primary and secondary endpoints, some findings noted in the present study deserve consideration. The great discrepancy between visible bile duct changes on cholangiography and clinical manifestation of ITBLs represents an interesting point. In 77 imaging studies, the rate of radiologically apparent cholangiopathy compared with clinically symptomatic ITBLs differed by a factor of 3 (33 radiological vs 10 symptomatic ITBLs). This remarkable discrepancy may explain the wide range of ITBL rates reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Different attitudes toward posttransplant workup of bile ducts and lack of unequivocal definitions result in variations of reported ITBLs. Accordingly, the results of our former analysis,<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> which prompted the present multicenter study, may be explained as follows: Due to the principles of organ allocation in Germany, grafts are usually transplanted in centers different from the retrieving center. In the authors' center, routine radiography is performed in all patients through a biliary drainage placed during transplantation, which resulted in a high rate of &#x0201c;visible&#x0201d; ITBLs. In other transplantation centers that used grafts treated with BP and retrieved by the authors, reports mostly cited clinical ITBL rates. Therefore, it was not BP, but the approach to diagnostic workup and definition which led to the observation of the supposed &#x0201c;superiority&#x0201d; of BP in our previous study.</p><p>Another point was the time to clinical manifestation of cholangiopathy. Sixteen of 18 patients experienced symptomatic ITBLs within the first year after transplantation, while just two (1 in each group) were diagnosed later than that. Although the late occurrence of ITBLs (ie, after the observation period had ended) cannot be excluded, the pathomechanisms affecting biliary integrity before or shortly after transplantation are responsible for most ITBLs and therefore deserve attention. Accordingly, major studies focused on primary damage.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Numerous alterations in the epithelial layer and the wall of the bile ducts are detectable as early as at the end of cold storage, and this type of injury becomes more pronounced after reperfusion.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Injury to the deep peribiliary glands and microvasculature was found to be associated with the development of ITBLs. Hansen et al<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reported that arteriolonecrosis was the most prominent predictor of ITBL development, whereas epithelial damage was visible after reperfusion in almost all patients (99%). So far, it remains obscure if insufficient regeneration due to impaired blood supply or due to loss of biliary stem cells located in the epithelial crypts is pivotal for the development of ITBLs.</p><p>In this context, the implementation of machine preservation, which provides a more physiological method of perfusion, should be noted. Particularly, regarding donation after cardiac death (which is not performed in Germany) and extended criteria donation, encouraging results have been reported after machine preservation in comparison to those noted for cold storage. So far, it remains obscure whether continuous perfusion, the avoidance of hypoxia or hypothermia, rewarming after storage, or all the abovementioned procedures are crucial for the effectiveness of machine preservation.<sup><xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Both experimental models and clinical studies have used perfusate oxygenated under hypothermic<sup><xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> or normothermic conditions,<sup><xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> and it was found that using perfusate containing red blood cells led to attenuation, but not complete prevention, of biliary complications.<sup><xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In view of these conflicting findings, further clinical studies are warranted to clarify the pathomechanism of early cholangiopathy after liver transplant.</p><p>Our randomized, controlled multicenter study did not confirm the previously suggested superiority of liver preservation using arterial ex situ BP in addition to SAP over preservation using SAP alone in terms of preventing ITBLs after liver transplantation. Likewise, ischemia-reperfusion injury, graft loss, and patient survival rates did not differ with perfusion mode. The considerable discrepancy between cholangiography findings of bile duct changes and clinically apparent cholangiopathy should be considered when assessing ITBLs after liver transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>In addition to the institutions mentioned in the heading, the following German transplant centers contributed to this study: Department of Surgery, University of Regensburg; Department of General, Visceral, Thoracic, Transplantation and Pediatric Surgery, University of Kiel; Department of General and Visceral Surgery, University of M&#x000fc;nster; Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg; Department of General, Visceral and Vascular Surgery, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena; Department of General, Visceral and Vascular Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg.
