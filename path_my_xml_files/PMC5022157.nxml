The purpose of the study was to describe patients&#x02019; ability to self-manage and associated factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 3-year prospective quasi-experimental study with a control group. Overall, 333 patients on anticoagulant therapy from seven primary care health centres of the Basque Health Service were included in the intervention group and followed up for 6 months after the intervention, assessing their ability to self-test and self-manage. The intervention consisted of a patient training programme, providing detailed information on their condition and its treatment, and practical training in how to use a portable blood coagulation monitor and adjust their anticoagulant dose. Comparisons were made with a control group (333 patients receiving OAT under usual care from the same seven health centres).</p><p>Outcome variables were ability to self-manage, quality of the outcome (in terms of time in therapeutic range), and quality of life in the intervention group, and general patient characteristics (age and sex), clinical variables (reason for OAT, INR range), and quality of the outcome (in terms of percentage of INR measurements in range and complications) in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 26.13 % of patients invited to participate in the intervention agreed. Of these, 99 % successfully learned to self-manage their OAT. Just 4.2 % did not complete the follow-up, in all cases for reasons unrelated to self-management, and 4.5 % required additional learning support. Outcomes were better than under usual care in terms of percentage of INR measurements in range (12 %), rate of complications (4 %) and quality of life (9.2 %).</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Patients were only followed-up period for 6 months and the study was conducted in a single health organization. Though patients eligible to participate were selected randomly, they were not randomly allocated to the groups. This is a potential source of selection bias. Data needed to calculate in-range time were not collected from controls; rather the results for the self-management group were compared with external data from other studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Almost all participants achieved competency in self-management, with no differences by age, sex, concurrent illnesses, polypharmacy or educational level. The greatest barrier to self-management was the attitude of patients themselves and those around them. Self-management in primary care is a good alternative to usual care, patients having longer times in therapeutic range and fewer complications, and improving their quality of life. Remote management is a good support tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01878539.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>OAT</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Access</kwd><kwd>Abilities</kwd><kwd>Time in therapeutic range</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI11/02285</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) with vitamin K inhibitors (acenocoumarol, warfarin) and rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran (new anticoagulant drugs) is a preventative therapeutic measure for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (the most common use), valvular diseases and venous thromboembolic disorders. Its use has progressively increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In our study, we only considered the first type, namely, vitamin K inhibitors.</p><p>In the aforementioned cardiovascular diseases, there is a high risk of thromboembolism and OAT has shown to be effective in the prevention of associated complications, although it also increases the risk of bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Approximately 1.7&#x02013;2 % of the Spanish population are on this type of treatment, the figure reaching up to 9&#x02013;10 % in those over 65 years old, and increasing by 10 % per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The mean age of the population continues to rise and, with it, the prevalence of chronic illness; as a consequence, haematology services are becoming overloaded and primary care providers have had to become involved in the monitoring and follow-up of patients requiring OAT. The efficacy of OAT is related to maintaining the patient within a certain INR range (commonly between 2 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Often, however, the INR strays outside this range (35&#x02013;40 % of cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and this is associated with new cardiovascular events, such as thrombosis due to low INR or bleeding due to high INR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. All the publications identified in the literature report high percentages of INR measurements being outside the target range, and hence, regular monitoring is necessary. This can be considered one of the weaknesses of OAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and is associated with new cardiovascular events, such as thrombosis due to low INR or bleeding due to high INR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the optimisation of INR control, patients play an essential role. For this reason, as in other chronic conditions, studies have been conducted exploring INR control with patient self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Self-testing is defined as patients using the coagulometer and calculating the INR themselves; they then submit the results to health professionals, who decide on the appropriate regimen and the date for the next check-up. Self-management is patients adjusting the treatment themselves as a function of their INR self-test results.</p><p>The efficacy of self-management of OAT has been assessed in multiple clinical trials, and their results have been synthesized in a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This review indicates that self-management patients obtain similar or better results (data varying between authors) than patients under usual care, those under self-management keeping their INR in the therapeutic range for longer, and having significantly lower rates of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The associated increase in the number of tests may also be a factor leading to better outcomes (more frequent tests making it easier to identify INR deviations early and promptly adjust medications, increasing the time in-range) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The studies included in the review excluded a variable proportion of patients, due to clinical condition, age, level of education, ability to learn and/or the opinion of clinicians, with specific profiles emerging as a function of age, functional and cognitive status and underlying condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These studies identify multiple advantages of self-management including reductions in the time dedicated to monitoring, both by clinicians and patients, in costs, and in the inconvenience associated with regular testing; as well as improvements in quality of life and satisfaction of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>When assessing the feasibility of introducing self-management in routine practice in primary care, it is first necessary to identify which patients are candidates for this type of care and associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. According to Jefferson Medical College (2005), potential candidates are patients requiring long-term anticoagulation therapy, who are highly motivated, and have sufficient manual dexterity and vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Involvement and education of patients in OAT, in terms of knowledge of their condition and its treatment and management, have been recognised as factors contributing to achieving good outcomes using this treatment model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Further, the use of new information technologies (Internet, e-mail, SMS) may favour patient self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and this should be taken into account. Self-management is not currently part of routine practice with isolated exceptions.</p><p>Taking into account the current situation, the objective of this study was to explore factors related to self-testing and self-management abilities of patients on OAT in primary care, as well as assess the quality of the outcome achieved under this type of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the clinical consequences, comparing with usual care through health centres and haematology services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicentre prospective controlled quasi-experimental study conducted between March 2012 and November 2014 to identify factors associated with the ability to self-manage and the clinical consequences of self-management in OAT patients. The study protocol was published by Tamayo-Aguirre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>We included patients over 16 years of age on OAT (for any reason) from seven different primary care health centres in rural or urban settings of an integrated healthcare organisation (Donostialdea). The overall organisation had a catchment population of approximately 324,000, and 7,213 patients were on OAT (slightly over 2 % of the total population). We excluded patients with serious diseases (hospitalised, or with a terminal diagnosis) and physically or mentally disabled individuals who lacked adequate caregiving, as well as those who had been on OAT for less than 1 year.</p><p>To estimate the appropriate sample size, we considered that for studies of predictive models, it has been established at least 10 events of the dependent variable of interest are needed for each independent variable included in the multivariate logistic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We estimated that we needed at least 100 dependent variable events. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] indicate that approximately 50 % is a &#x0201c;suitable&#x0201d; percentage, and hence we would need 100 suitable and 100 non-suitable candidates, yielding a total of 200 patients. In the study published by Fitzmaurice et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], 24 % of patients declined to participate, 7 % did not attend study meetings, 6 % did not sign the informed consent form, and 3 % were excluded by researchers, amounting to a 40 % loss to follow-up. Assuming then that around 60 % of patients agree to participate in this type of intervention, if we wanted 200 participants in the intervention group, we estimated we would need to recruit at least 333 patients for the initial sample, and for comparison, the same number of controls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient selection and recruitment</title><p>We spread awareness of the project among participating organisations and members of staff potentially affected were informed, with meetings in the form of clinical sessions in health centres. Based on anonymised lists of patients under active anticoagulant therapy at participating centres, the coordinating research unit randomly selected a sample of patients, who were then contacted by their assigned primary care clinicians and invited to participate in the study. Those who agreed to join the intervention group were given a first appointment with a member of the research team who provided them with information regarding the study, requested their written informed consent to participation in the programme and allocated them to a training group. Those who declined to participate in the intervention were invited to participate as controls. They were provided with information about the study, and asked for oral consent, which was considered sufficient as we only needed to access data from their records (no intervention); further, we obtained approval from Osakidetza to use data from the electronic health records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Description of the intervention</title><p>We designed a bilingual (Spanish and Basque) training programme focused on understanding and application of self-management techniques. In this programme, participating individuals received training on OAT, self-testing and self-management (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The training was based on a programme developed in the regions of Arag&#x000f3;n and Catalonia, with written support materials (on a course of oral anticoagulation) provided by Roche, and was adapted to the needs of our study. It started with a workshop in which specialised nurses provided theoretical and practical information on OAT, and subsequently, four workshops were held with each patient individually, in which he/she learned to use the CoaguChek XS coagulometer, interpret INR results, adjust doses and enter related data in the online monitoring application (for more details, see <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Appendices I</xref> and <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">II</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Timetable and content of the training</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Workshop</th><th>Duration</th><th>Type</th><th>Number of patients</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1&#x000a0;h</td><td>group/individual</td><td>2</td><td>OAT, starting self-management</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1&#x000a0;h</td><td>individual</td><td>1</td><td>Coagulometer, tables, Internet</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>30&#x000a0;min</td><td>individual</td><td>1</td><td>Checking, clarification, survey</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>30&#x000a0;min</td><td>individual</td><td>1</td><td>Data entry, starting point</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1&#x000a0;h</td><td>Individual</td><td>1</td><td>End of study, survey</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study variables</title><p>The primary outcome variable was the capacity of patients in the intervention group to self-manage. This was assessed at the time of each INR measurement, considering whether they had taken decisions following the recommendations given (depending on the INR value obtained, the recommendation was to repeat the measurement, increase, maintain or decrease the dose, or contact the doctor) and reported the test result (<xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">Appendix II</xref>). This was based on the daily telemonitoring by the clinician of the actions of the patient. Patients were considered able to self-manage (positive outcome) if 95 % of their actions were correct (according to the recommendations given) and they committed no serious errors (greater than 20 % deviation from the recommendations as specified in <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">Appendix II</xref>).</p><p>Patients were checked on every day through the web service (97 %) or over the telephone (an option used by 3 % of patients), and at the end of the study period (6&#x000a0;months), data collected in the coagulometer were retrieved and compared with those supplied directly by the patients.</p><p>For all participants, we collected data on personal and clinical characteristics, risk factors, all current medications including anticoagulants, time on OAT, and recommended INR range, as well as any vascular complications that developed and INR control in terms of percentage of INR measurements in range over the study period. In intervention group patients, we also assessed time in therapeutic range and quality of life (see below), comparing baseline (when they had been under usual care) and the period under self-management. These data were collected either from the patient him/herself or from the electronic health records of the Basque Health Service. In addition, we collected basic information on individuals who declined to participate (age, sex, current medications, vascular complications and INR control).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Health records of control group patients were reviewed at 6 months after their inclusion in the study. In the case of intervention group patients, once we had checked the ability of a patient to self-manage, he/she started to do so and was then followed up for 6 months (i.e., from the end of the training until the end of the study).</p><p>During the follow-up period (6&#x000a0;months), no meetings were scheduled with these participants. To minimise risks to patients and reassure researchers, data provided by patients remotely (over the web or telephone) were reviewed, and there were no cases in which their level of control was sufficiently poor to indicate a need to intervene. Given the possible need for support, two channels of communication were provided:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Telephone: access to a 24/7 helpline to address both technical and clinical queries</p></list-item><list-item><p>Internet: entering of self-management data (namely, treatment variables, dose changes decided, any clinical incidents occurred or other comments, and the date of the next check-up) into a form on a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://autocontrol.taonet.es/tao">https://autocontrol.taonet.es/tao</ext-link>). The data on this website was reviewed daily by a doctor, with the single goal of assessing whether patients were at risk.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To assess the impact of the intervention in terms of quality of life and patient satisfaction, we carried out a survey based on the questionnaire of Sawicki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] designed to assess quality of life in OAT patients in Germany, previously adapted to the Spanish setting by S&#x000e1;nchez Gonz&#x000e1;lez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and used by D&#x000e1;vila Blazquez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The questionnaire consists of 32 questions grouped to assess five parameters. Intervention group patients were asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and again at 6 months after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>On the one hand, we created a basic profile of patients who declined to participate in the study with sex and age data. On the other, for the intervention and control groups, we considered a wider range of information: reason for OAT, INR range, length of treatment, risks factors, complications before and during the study, polypharmacy, and whether they were independent for activities of daily living or had a caregiver. Using this, profiles of intervention and control patients were created and compared, to determine whether they were significantly different, using the Student&#x02019;s t and the chi-square tests for numerical and categorical variables, respectively.</p><p>We then wanted to assess the results of self-management compared to usual care through health centres and haematology units, and for this, we analysed outcomes as a function of case/control status. Specifically, we analysed the time in therapeutic range, percentage of in-range measurements, and clinical complications. We also explored pre- to post-intervention changes in quality of life in the intervention group.</p><p>To calculate the percentage of time in days when the INR was in the therapeutic range, we used the Rosendaal test (considering a value &#x0003c;60 % to indicate poor control, based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). Further, we calculated the percentage of INR measurements in range during the 6 months prior to the study and the 6 months of the study, for both intervention and control groups.</p><p>The frequency of testing differed between the groups. Patients in the control group continued to be tested at the usual frequency, as scheduled with their usual doctor, while patients in the intervention group (under self-management) were scheduled to self-test every 7 days, in line with the pattern in previous similar studies. The test results of the self-management group were reviewed by a doctor, but no intervention was performed. In the case of controls, their nurse conducted the tests, and their doctor reviewed the results and prescribed their treatment.</p><p>We designed a relational database using Microsoft Access 2010 for all the study data. The descriptive and statistical analysis was carried out using R software version 3.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p>The study was conducted in the Donostialdea Integrated Healthcare Organisation, which has 21 health centres, with a total of 7,212 patients on OAT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We selected seven centres with different characteristics in terms of size, and urban or rural settings, among other factors, leaving a target population of 2,548 patients. The number of patients initially selected from each centre was proportional the total eligible population at the centre.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of patients through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12872_2016_326_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>To achieve the desired sample size for the intervention group, we contacted 1,274 patients (50 % of the selected target population), and 442 (35 %) meet selection criteria and agreed to participate in the intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of this group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;442) that started the study, 101 patients (22.85 %) did not complete the training process: 42 did not attend the first meeting, while 36 withdrew after the first workshop, 20 after the second workshop and 3 just before the end. Out of the 341 patients who completed the training programme, 8 (2.3 %) were not included in the analysis as they had moved into residential care, although they did not have any problems in terms of participation.</p><p>Finally, 333 intervention group patients were included in the analysis (26.13 % of those initially contacted). Out of the 832 individuals that did not take part in the intervention, 367 (29.51 %) declined to participate, 379 (29.74 %) did not met the selection criteria, and 86 (6.75 %) were unable to participate (due to treatment cessation or changes, hospitalisation, pre-surgical admission, moving away from the area or being regularly away, or monitoring in other centres).</p><p>There were no significant differences in participation rate by time on OAT, risk factors, the presence of polypharmacy, or whether patients required a caregiver.

The recommended INR range was 2.0-3.0 in most cases (79 %), being somewhat higher (2.5-3.5) in the others. The mean reason for OAT was heart arrhythmia due to atrial fibrillation followed by aortic valve prosthesis. Regarding length of treatment, most participants had been on OAT for 4 years or more. Around two-thirds of participants were independent, a third required a caregiver, and 10.5 % required home care.

This study demonstrates that patients who attend and complete a self-management programme are successfully able to self-manage, as has been found by other authors, though success rates vary (e.g., Fitzmaurice et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and De Felipe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reporting rates of 57 and 100 % respectively). In our study, 16 patients (4.80 %) found it more difficult than had been expected to achieve the learning objectives, but succeeded with just two additional sessions. Men&#x000e9;ndez-J&#x000e1;ndula et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found a considerably higher rate (13 %) of patients requiring extra support. Cayley, WE Jr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] indicated that between 25 and 90 % of patients may be able to self-test and self-manage, but they did not analyse the underlying reasons; that is, the authors mention some possible barriers but do not assess their relative importance.</p><p>In our study, the main barrier to self-management was related to reluctance of patients to participate, this contributing to reduce the sample analysed to 26.13 % of those contacted. Other researchers have mentioned this issue but did not quantify the extent of the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Overall, therefore, nearly three-quarters (73.87 %) of patients wecontacted were not finally included in analysis of the self-management programme, in most cases for personal reasons, reasons given by caregivers or health professionals, or other non-modifiable factors such as hospitalisation, discontinuation of or changes in treatment, moving away or monitoring in other centres. Similar factors have been identified in some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other authors mention a different range of factors that hinder follow-up of participants, including patient age, medical condition, skills, level of education, willingness, social level, and clinical events, as well as the influence of health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In our case, the rate of withdrawal during the training period was 23 % of those who initially attended.

Notably, 96 % of those initially included in the intervention group achieved good self-management during the 6-month study period (in terms of INR measurements, treatment adjustment, and data entry in more than 95 % of the measurements). Only 14 patients (4.20 %) were lost to follow-up, but this was for reasons unrelated to self-management, compared to a figure of 21 % in the study of Men&#x000e9;ndez-J&#x000e1;ndula et al.

Self-management may be considered an acceptable option if we obtain similar results to those obtained with usual care. In fact, comparing data with those monitored through haematology services and health centres, our self-management patients obtained better INR control (in terms of both percentage of in-range measurements compared to controls and time in-range compared to usual values). Over the last 15 years, there have been a growing number of studies involving patients self-managing OAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], several authors reporting similar results to ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>5. Moreover, we found lower rates of clinical complications (serious or mild), deaths, and admissions and a better clinical course in patients under self-management, confirming observations of Heneghan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Bloomfield et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Analysing the types of complications, we observed that many of them occurred concurrent with other health problems (rectorrhagia with intestinal lesions and haemorrhoids, haematuria with prostate, kidney or bladder cancer, metrorrhagia with cervical or womb cancer), and we propose that these should be the focus of separate research. On the other hand, some other types of bleeding such as epistaxis, gum bleeding, and microhaematuria may be more closely related to OAT, since they did not occur together with other aetiologies.

Patients were contacted to resolve concerns in relation to 2 % of measurements, but in no cases was it considered necessary to intervene or modify the actions taken by patients.</p><p>The 24-h telephone helpline was maintained throughout the follow-up period, to resolve clinical or technical concerns. It was used a mean of 0.6 times per patient during the 6 month period. Of the total of 76 calls received, 32 (42 %) were related to administrative issues and 25 (32.9 %) to technical problems, while 19 concerned self-management itself, all of these calls occurring in the first month of the study.</p><p>These channels of communication with patients during the study period were found to be useful, the web data making it possible to immediately assess patients&#x02019; actions to avoid serious risks, while clinical and technical problems were resolved over the telephone, and though there were relatively few such problems, the helpline strengthened patients&#x02019; confidence. These resources have been important to safeguard patient safety while avoiding regular contact between researchers and patients that would otherwise have been necessary.</p><p>We have found no other studies that have employed such an approach. Telemonitoring has tended to be used as a tool for doctor-patient communication but not for self-managed patients. We believe that these two channels of communication combined make a great tool, both highly practical and feasible, and that their use could be widened to monitoring of patients with other chronic illnesses.</p><p>There was also good participation from health professionals, doctors and nurses at the health centres, despite the fact that at the outset we thought this might have been a weak point of the study. Their support was very valuable. We consider that the information they were given about the study, their supervision, the initial clinical session and open channels of communication were essential for the positive attitudes shown. A possible future line of research would be to explore strategies for changing attitudes of patients, caregivers and health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], in order to assess the possibility of increasing the number of patients under this type of care.

The main barrier to self-management is the willingness of patients and/or caregivers themselves. When achieved, self-management improves INR control, increases the time in therapeutic range, and reduces complications and mortality, while also improving patient quality of life.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barrios</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Escobar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Prieto</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Osorio</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Polo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lobos</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Control de la anticoagulaci&#x000f3;n en pacientes con fibrilaci&#x000f3;n auricular no valvular asistidos en atenci&#x000f3;n primaria en Espa&#x000f1;a</article-title><source>Estudio PAULA Rev Esp Cardiol</source><year>2015</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>769</fpage><lpage>776</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.recesp.2015.04.017</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mueller</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfannkuche</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Breithardt</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauersachs</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Maywald</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohlmann</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The quality of oral anticoagulation in general practice in patients with atrial fibrillation</article-title><source>Eur J Intern Med</source><year>2014</year><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>54</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ejim.2013.12.013</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24477050</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gitter</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaeger</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Petterson</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gersh</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Silverstein</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bleeding and thromboembolism during anticoagulant therapy: a population-based study in Rochester</article-title><source>Minn Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>1995</year><volume>70</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>725</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.4065/70.8.725</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Oake</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Fergusson</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Forster</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van Walraven</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Frequency of adverse events in patients with poor anticoagulation: a meta-analysis</article-title><source>CMAJ</source><year>2007</year><volume>176</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1589</fpage><lpage>94</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1503/cmaj.061523</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17515585</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>G&#x000f3;mez-Doblas</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mu&#x000f1;iz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Roca</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lobos</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Awamleh</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalencia de fibrilaci&#x000f3;n auricular en Espa&#x000f1;a.
