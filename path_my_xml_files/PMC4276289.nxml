The initial treatment involves conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with refractory patients receiving therapy with biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and B cell and T cell inhibitors (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). When treatment outcomes are similar, patients prefer RA therapies delivered subcutaneously (SC) to those delivered intravenously (IV) and prefer medications delivered at home (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). SC administration allows the convenience of receiving treatment outside the clinic, which causes less disruption to daily routines.</p><p>Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized anti&#x02013;IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6 from binding to the soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptor and was developed as an IV infusion. The efficacy and safety of IV administration of TCZ (TCZ-IV) is well documented (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). TCZ-IV is effective as monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs and is currently approved in &#x0003e;70 countries. Recently, SC administration of TCZ (TCZ-SC) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the US in patients with RA at a starting dose of 162 mg every other week in patients who weigh &#x0003c;100 kg, with an increase in frequency to 162 mg every week based on clinical response. In patients who weigh &#x02265;100 kg, the starting dose is 162 mg every week. TCZ-SC every other week is also approved in Japan, and in the European Union, a starting dose of TCZ-SC every week is approved, with modification to every other week for the management of laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>TCZ-SC was initially evaluated in phase I/II studies (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In SUMMACTA, a randomized double-blind phase III study, TCZ-SC 162 mg every week in combination with DMARDs showed efficacy and safety comparable with TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To further characterize the efficacy and safety of a lower dose of TCZ-SC, the BREVACTA study compared TCZ-SC 162 mg every other week with SC administration of placebo (PBO-SC) every other week in adult patients with moderate to severe RA who had an inadequate response to &#x02265;1 DMARDs.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Significance &#x00026; Innovations</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Tocilizumab (TCZ), given subcutaneously at 162 mg every other week, was statistically significantly superior to placebo (PBO) for the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) at week 24.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subcutaneous TCZ given every other week was superior to subcutaneous PBO for all secondary end points, including inhibition of joint damage on radiographs, ACR50/70 response, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints remission.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The safety profile of subcutaneous TCZ was consistent with that in studies of intravenous TCZ.</p></list-item></list>

Patients were required to have had an inadequate response to &#x02265;1 DMARDs that, in up to 20% of patients, could include &#x02265;1 anti-TNF agents. Patients must have received &#x02265;1 traditional DMARDs at a stable dose for &#x02265;8 weeks prior to baseline. Prior to randomization, patients had to have discontinued etanercept for &#x02265;2 weeks; infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, or adalimumab for &#x02265;8 weeks; and anakinra for &#x02265;1 week. Concomitant oral glucocorticoids (&#x02264;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (up to the maximum recommended dose) were permitted if patients had a stable dose regimen &#x02265;4 weeks prior to baseline.</p><p>The major exclusion criteria included ongoing rheumatic or inflammatory joint diseases other than RA, history of malignancy, known active current or history of recurrent infections, positive result for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody, active tuberculosis, serious allergies to biologic agents, and history of diverticular disease or other symptomatic lower gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose to perforations.</p><p>The patients signed informed consent documents that were approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The BREVACTA study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01232569) was a multicenter, phase III, 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, with a double-blind period of 24 weeks followed by an open-label period of 72 weeks. Data to week 24, including the primary end point, are shown. Patients were stratified by geographic region and body weight (&#x0003c;60 kg, 60 to &#x0003c;100 kg, or &#x02265;100 kg). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive TCZ-SC 162 mg every other week or PBO-SC every other week for 24 weeks. From week 12, patients initially randomized to receive TCZ-SC or PBO-SC every other week could receive escape therapy with TCZ-SC 162 mg weekly at the investigators' discretion if there was &#x0003c;20% improvement in SJC and TJC from baseline. TCZ-SC and PBO injections were administered by prefilled syringe. After the first 6 treatments were administered in the clinic, SC injections could be administered at home by the patients or their caregivers or in the clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and assessments</title><p>The primary end point was the percentage of patients with an ACR 20% improvement in disease activity (ACR20) response at week 24 (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Secondary end points included the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR50 or ACR70 response, remission based on the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28; &#x0003c;2.6), and a change from baseline in the radiographic Sharp score as modified by van der Heijde (SHS) at week 24. The pharmacodynamic end point was the observed serum CRP level and ESR over 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory and vital sign measurements, and physical examinations. The safety population included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug and had &#x02265;1 postdose safety assessment. Patients were analyzed according to the first dose administered.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Blood samples were collected at baseline, week 12, and week 24 for antidrug antibody assessment. Samples positive in the initial screening assay were analyzed by confirmation assay. Assays were performed as previously described using a bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). If the confirmation assay was positive, a neutralizing assay was performed to test for the ability to inhibit TCZ activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the primary end point, groups were compared using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for the stratification factors applied at randomization (geographic region and body weight) with a 2-sided alpha level of 5%. Patients who withdrew, patients who received escape therapy prior to week 24, or patients for whom the week-24 ACR20 response could not be determined were considered nonresponders. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug) was used for the primary, secondary, and pharmacodynamic analyses. Patients were analyzed according to the randomized treatment group. The only imputation was the last observation carried forward for the SJC and TJC. Subgroup analyses for the ACR responses and safety were conducted across the 3 weight categories. For the sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis was repeated for the completer population (patients who had a valid week-24 assessment [had a response at week 24] and patients who had not received escape therapy).</p><p>All continuous secondary end points except for radiographic assessment were compared between groups using an analysis of covariance model that adjusted for the stratification factors applied at randomization and the baseline value for the end point being analyzed. All categorical secondary end points were analyzed as per the primary end point. For the SHS, the change between groups from baseline to week 24 was analyzed using the Van Eltern nonparametric method, after adjustment for the stratification factors applied at randomization. Linear extrapolation was applied to patients who withdrew/escaped prior to week 24 and had a valid radiograph reading at the time of withdrawal/escape.</p><p>Based on previous ACR20 response rates of patients in PBO and TCZ-IV 4 mg/kg groups in phase III TCZ-IV trials, the expected ACR20 response was 23% and 46%, respectively. A sample size of 600 patients randomized 2:1 (400:200 patients) would ensure &#x02265;90% power to detect differences between groups with a significance level of 5% and allow for safety profile assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 1,034 patients screened, 437 were randomized to receive TCZ-SC and 219 to receive PBO-SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The ITT population comprised 656 patients (TCZ-SC, n = 437 and PBO-SC, n = 219). For the first dose, 438 patients received TCZ-SC and 218 patients received PBO-SC because a dose administration error occurred in 1 patient. The main reason for screen failure was lack of radiographic evidence of &#x02265;1 joint with definite erosion attributable to RA. The percentage of patients who received escape therapy at week 24 was lower in the TCZ-SC group (16.5%) than the PBO-SC group (41.1%). During the 24-week period, 37 patients prematurely discontinued (28 patients [7%] in the TCZ-SC group and 9 patients [4%] in the PBO-SC group). The most common reasons for withdrawal were AEs or withdrawal of consent. Of the patients who completed 24 weeks, 340 patients (78%) were from the TCZ-SC group and 121 patients (56%) were from the PBO-SC group.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition over 24 weeks.

In the TCZ treatment group, a higher percentage of patients who weighed &#x02265;100 kg experienced &#x02265;1 AE compared with patients in the lower weight categories. Patients in the highest weight category (&#x02265;100 kg) in both treatment groups experienced more SAEs than those in the lower weight categories, although the percentage was lower in the TCZ-SC group than in the PBO-SC group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The BREVACTA study assessed the efficacy and safety of TCZ-SC 162 mg every other week in combination with DMARDs in patients with RA who were inadequate responders to DMARDs (including anti-TNF). The study population had moderate to severe RA, as reflected by the high mean DAS28 score (6.6) and long duration of disease activity (11.1 years). The study met its primary end point by demonstrating the superiority of TCZ-SC every other week over PBO-SC in the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. TCZ-SC was generally well tolerated, and the associated AE profile was consistent with the known and well-established safety profile of TCZ-IV.</p><p>An analysis of all secondary end points, including ACR50/70, inhibition of joint damage, and DAS28 remission, also showed that TCZ-SC was superior to PBO-SC. Additional exploratory analyses demonstrated that differences in ACR20/50/70 response rates between TCZ-SC and PBO-SC patients were similar in patients with an inadequate response to DMARDs versus patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents, and by patients receiving concomitant methotrexate or other DMARDs.</p><p>The TCZ-SC group experienced less joint damage at week 24 compared with the PBO-SC group. This assesment was made at week 24, although phase III studies usually assess radiographic end points at 1 year (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which would allow more time to elapse to observe any changes in SHS since baseline.</p><p>Improvements in ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses were observed in patients who received escape therapy with TCZ-SC every week. The responses in patients who switched from TCZ-SC every other week to TCZ-SC every week demonstrated that an increase in dosing frequency led to improvement in signs and symptoms of RA as measured by the ACR 20/50/70. Of the patients who switched from PBO-SC to TCZ-SC every week, the response was similar to that in the TCZ-SC every week group in SUMMACTA and greater than that in the patients who switched from TCZ-SC every other week to TCZ-SC every week (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The lower ACR response rate in patients who received escape therapy (TCZ-SC every week) after being randomized to receive TCZ-SC every other week may reflect the inclusion of patients who were true biologic TCZ nonresponders and/or those who required a higher initial dose of TCZ to respond to the therapy.</p><p>Previous studies have observed that obesity is associated with poorer treatment outcomes in patients with RA (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Patients who weighed &#x02265;100 kg had poorer ACR20/50/70 responses than patients in the 2 lower weight categories. The &#x02265;100 kg TCZ-SC group had numerically lower ACR50/70 responses than those in the PBO-SC group. The small number of patients in the &#x02265;100 kg group may have accounted for the variation observed in response rates. However, in SUMMACTA (TCZ-SC every week), the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR response or DAS28 remission was similar across the 3 body weight categories at most time points (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Because the TCZ-SC dose is fixed at 162 mg, TCZ-SC every other week does not provide adequate efficacy for patients who weigh &#x02265;100 kg, which may be partly due to the very low blood concentrations of TCZ in the heaviest patient group, as demonstrated by C<sub>trough</sub> levels.</p><p>There were 3 deaths in the TCZ-SC group (all due to infections) and none in the PBO-SC group. The number of deaths was small, and the death rate per 100 patient-years over the first 24 weeks of the BREVACTA study was 1.64 (95% CI 0.34&#x02013;4.80). This was within the range of the first 24 weeks of the double-blind periods of the pivotal phase III TCZ-IV studies (protocol numbers WA17822, WA17823, WA17824, WA18062, and WA18063). The death rates ranged from 0 to 2.14 deaths per 100 patient-years, with the highest rate of 2.14 from a study of TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg monotherapy (protocol number: WA17824) (Roche: unpublished observations). Additionally, from the BREVACTA study, the incidence of infections and serious infections was similar between the treatment groups (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).</p><p>The safety profiles of TCZ-SC and PBO-SC were similar to previous studies of TCZ-IV (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Two SAEs (malignancies) that were considered unrelated to treatment occurred in the TCZ-SC group at a rate of 1.09 (95% CI 0.13&#x02013;3.95) per 100 patient-years of exposure, which is similar to the rate observed previously with TCZ-IV (1.0 per 100 patient-years of exposure) over 52 weeks (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As also observed in the TCZ-IV safety profile, decreases from baseline were seen for neutrophils and platelets in the TCZ-SC group. Increases were observed in transaminases and mean fasting lipid levels in a higher percentage of patients in the TCZ-SC group than in the PBO-SC group. There was no association between SAEs of bleeding events and thrombocytopenia, or serious hepatic events and elevation of liver function tests. One patient who died of sepsis experienced pancytopenia as reported from local laboratory results, which included grade 4 neutropenia. No other patients had associations between grade 4 neutropenia and serious infection. The number of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies was low, with no association between anti-TCZ antibody development and loss of clinical response or AEs. ISRs were more frequent in the TCZ-SC group than in the PBO-SC group, comparable to the incidence observed with other SC therapies in RA.</p><p>In summary, the superiority in efficacy of TCZ-SC 162 mg every other week over PBO-SC in combination with DMARDs was shown. The safety profile of TCZ-SC was comparable with that seen in previous studies of TCZ-IV. The TCZ-SC formulation is a convenient dosing option for patients with RA and will allow patients to self-administer the drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all of the investigators and patients who participated in the study and all members of the BREVACTA (protocol number: NA25220) study team.</p></ack><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
