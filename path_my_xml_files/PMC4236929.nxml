Tracheal tube discomfort is primarily caused by cuff irritation that increases airway secretions and hence, exacerbates cough and produces more discomfort. To keep the patient in a comfortable state a significant amount of sedatives and analgesics are usually administered, particularly in the first few days, though their cumulative effect may increase ICU stay, morbidity and mortality. In addition, these drugs may decrease inspiratory muscle efforts and increase patient-ventilator asynchrony, particularly ineffective triggering.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Therefore, any strategy to decrease sedative/analgesic requirements is appreciated.</p><p>Using of lidocaine hydrochloride with or without addition of sodium bicarbonate (i.e., alkalization) for filling the cuff of ETT instead of air has been studied during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Intracuff alkalized lidocaine has been demonstrated to continuously diffuse across the cuff wall, anesthetize the underlying tracheal mucosa and thereby, reduce the ETT-induced emergence phenomena from general anesthesia, particularly, during surgery of long duration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The application of this technique in ICU patients has not been described previously, despite that it would seem logical in an attempt to improve ETT tolerance and thereby, to reduce the requirements for sedative/analgesic drugs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of intracuff alkalized lidocaine on sedative/analgesic requirements for ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and the consequence of this technique on patient-ventilator interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Institutional review board approval and written informed consent from patient's next of kin were obtained. The study was carried out in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) of Tanta University Hospital during the period from October 2012 to June 2013. Patients who expected to require ventilatory support for a period of more than 48 h were consecutively enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;18 years, body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, post-cardiac arrest, ventilation through tracheotomy, hemodynamic instability, in need for a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &#x02265;8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, excessive amount of respiratory secretions, brain injury and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal disease. Patients were excluded from the study after enrollment, if ventilation was deemed ineffective without muscle relaxation.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to either group S (control group): The ETT cuffs were inflated with normal saline or group L (intervention group): The ETT cuffs were inflated with a mixture of lidocaine 2% (Xylocaine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, AstraZeneca, Paris, France) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) 8.4% (sodium bicarbonate 8.4%, Otsuka pharmaceutical Co., Egypt) at a ratio of 1:1 ml. Randomization was carried out according to a computer-generated random numbers table and syringes containing 10 ml of either saline or alkalinized lidocaine were prepared by the hospital pharmacy. The author and the SICU staff were blinded to the nature of syringes-filled solutions.</p><p>Oral endotracheal intubation was performed after administration of an IV bolus of propofol (Diprivan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) 0.5-1.5 mg/kg and cisatracurium besylate (Nimbex, GlaxoSmithKline, Egypt) 0.5 mg/kg using an ETT tube (3TM, Zhejiang S. Medical Device Co., Ltd, China) 7-7.5 mm inner diameter for women and 7.5-8 mm inner diameter for men. The ETT cuffs (high volume-low pressure) were inflated with either saline or alkalized lidocaine according to group assignment at the minimal occlusive volume (i.e., no leakage was detected under controlled ventilation). They were ventilated with &#x0212e;Vent ventilator (&#x0212e;Vent medical Ltd, Galway, Ireland) using pressure assisted control ventilation. Ventilatory sittings were adjusted to obtain a tidal volume around 6-8 ml/kg delivered with inspiratory flow rate &#x02265;60 L/min. Pressure triggering sensitivity was set between 5 and 1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respiratory rate &#x0003c;30/min and PEEP to maintain PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;90 mmHg with a FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;0.6.</p><p>Sedation was maintained with baseline infusions of propofol 0.2-1 mg/kg/h to achieve a score of 3-4 on the sedation agitation scale (SAS)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and fentanyl (Fentanyl, Hameln pharmaceutical GmbH, Germany) 25-100 &#x003bc;g/h to achieve a score of 0 on the behavioral pain scale (BPS).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The levels of sedation and analgesia were monitored hourly. If at any time they were assessed to be outside the target levels, nurses achieved the target levels either by administering additional boluses of either propofol 10 mg or fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g or by altering the infusion rates. Reversible causes of anxiety and agitation including needing explanations/reassurance, excessive light or sounds and airway obstruction were continuously excluded before altering the infusion rates.</p><p>During the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation, total requirements for propofol and fentanyl were recorded. The episodes of coughing not related to endotracheal suctioning were counted and evaluated according to a three points scale (1: Mild, 2: Moderate and 3: Severe). The ventilator airway pressure-time and flow-time waveforms were captured downloaded and enlarged for counting the numbers of ineffective triggering; defined as a simultaneous decrease in airway pressure and an increase in airflow without assisted cycle.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>The primary endpoint was the total requirements for propofol and fentanyl in the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. A total of 25 patients were required per group to determine that inflation of the ETT cuff with alkalized lidocaine would reduce the sedative/analgesic requirements by 35% based on a previous study by Mallick <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with 95% power (&#x003b1; = 0.05). 32 patients were included per group after calculation of a dropout rate of 25%. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20) and are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or number (%) as appropriate. After testing data distribution, unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparison of parametric date between groups. Non-parametric data (patients&#x02019; sex, primary diagnosis, survival and severity of cough) were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total number of 64 patients of both sexes were recruited in the study. 14 patients were excluded from subsequent analysis: 3 patients in group S were transferred to another hospital and 11 patients (5 patients in group S and 6 patients in group L) required neuromuscular block during the study period because of deterioration of oxygenation.

In other words, intracuff alkalized lidocaine increased ETT tolerance. Furthermore, intracuff alkalized lidocaine reduced the frequency of ineffective triggering.</p><p>Consistent with the current results, Hirota <italic>et al</italic>. reported that inflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff with 5 ml lidocaine (4%) solution significantly reduced tube discomfort in patients undergoing tracheostomy following oral cancer resection as evaluated by a visual analogue scale.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In other studies, instillation of lidocaine onto tracheal mucosa reduced post-extubation cough on the emergence from general anesthesia[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and requirements of sedative/analgesic in artificially ventilated patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This technique was limited by incomplete effectiveness in controlling of cough reflex as the ETT cuff shields underlying mucosa from exposure to instilled lidocaine, possible bronchospasm due to mucosal stimulation from lidocaine instillation and need for special ETT (laser-driven in-tube accelerator [LITA] tube; laryngotracheal instillation of local anesthetic).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Intracuff lidocaine has been shown to overcome the problems experienced with the LITA tube.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, a recent study failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of intracuff non-alkalinized 4% lidocaine in reducing coughing during emergence from general anesthesia in smokers.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The ETT cuff is manufactured from a thin semipermeable hydrophobic polyvinyl chloride membrane that allows slow diffusion of lidocaine and blocking of nociceptive stimuli (i.e., irritant and stretch stimuli) caused by the ETT and its cuff.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Alkalization of lidocaine allowed for quicker and more efficient diffusion and hence use of small doses of lidocaine (40 mg).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown, <italic>in vitro</italic>, that variations in volume and concentration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> injected into the cuff had no effect on the diffusion of lidocaine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the lidocaine: NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (8.4%) ratio (1:1 ml) used in the present study has been shown to result in earlier reduction of anesthesia and spontaneous ventilation at the end of surgery, less cough and restlessness before suctioning and extubation and marked reduction in post-extubation sore throat during the first post-operative day.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Lidocaine is known to be absorbed rapidly from the tracheobronchial mucosa. However, for systemic lidocaine to be effective in reducing ETT discomfort a very higher maximal plasma concentration of lidocaine is required (IV lidocaine 2 mg/kg gives plasma lidocaine levels &#x0003e;3 ug/ml)[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] than that attained in case of lidocaine diffusion with 8.4% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (&#x0003c;0.08 &#x003bc;g/ml),[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggesting that improved ETT tolerance after intracuff alkalized lidocaine is a local rather than a systemic effect.</p><p>Ineffective triggering occurs when patient's effort fails to drop airway pressure below ventilator trigger sensitivity. Though ineffective triggering results mainly from improper ventilatory settings (e.g. inappropriate trigger sensitivity) or abnormal pulmonary mechanics,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] sedatives and analgesics have been shown to depress the inspiratory derive and decrease the inspiratory muscle effort and thus increase ineffective triggering.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the present study, all patients had acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and hence, presumably comparable pulmonary mechanics; also, they were set on low trigger sensitivities (from-5 to-1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Therefore, it is not surprising that the significant difference in frequency of ineffective triggering may be attributed to the difference in sedative/analgesic requirements.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, the reduction of ineffective triggering may be, partly, attributed to increased ETT tolerance and patient's comfort associated with intracuff alkalized lidocaine.</p><p>Monitoring of sedation and analgesia in ICU is inexact. However, the SAS is one of the most valid and reliable tools for assessment of quality and depth of sedation in adult ICU patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Similarly, the BPS is a valid and reliable tool for assessment of pain.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Saline may not be a true control. Singh <italic>et al</italic>. reported that use of saline or 2% of lidocaine without alkalization as liquid media for filling the ETT cuff reduced post-extubation reactions.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, it was reasonable to use saline as a control as otherwise it would have been difficult to carry out the study in a blinded fashion.</p><p>The total dose of lidocaine 68 &#x000b1; 24 mg over 24 h in this study (the mean volume used per ETT was 6.8 &#x000b1; 2.4 ml i.e., 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 ml of 2% lidocaine) is markedly smaller than the lidocaine doses used in the previous studies,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and it is unlikely that toxicity would occur given the dose and duration of this study. On the other hand, lidocaine and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> mixture could be irritative if a cuff ruptures. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed no cuff rupture or obstruction,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which in agreement with the current results. Conversely, some cases of cuff rupture have been reported when lidocaine was used as lubricant or for local anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intracuff alkalized lidocaine improves ETT tolerance leading to reduction of sedatives and analgesic requirements for mechanically ventilated patients and improvement of patient-ventilator synchronization.
