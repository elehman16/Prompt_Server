For patients who fail NSAID treatment or cannot tolerate it, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; blockers are recommended<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> because they reduce inflammation, control disease activity and improve patient functioning and quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4 R5">2&#x02013;5</xref> In the Infliximab as First-Line Therapy in Patients with Early Active Axial Spondyloarthritis Trial (INFAST) study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> patients with axial SpA who had not failed NSAIDs or were NSAID-na&#x000ef;ve showed substantial benefit from combined treatment with NSAIDs and the TNF-antagonist infliximab (IFX). At month 6, partial remission was achieved in 62% and 35% of patients treated with IFX+naproxen (NPX) or placebo (PBO)+NPX, respectively.</p><p>For patients with axial SpA who have achieved remission, the best strategy for maintenance of remission is not known. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), several studies have shown that biologic-free remission, either with or without continuous treatment with methotrexate, can be achieved if patients are treated early enough in the course of the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9">7&#x02013;9</xref> In patients with AS, studies have found that response to TNF antagonists may be sustained over several years, but that response is lost soon after cessation of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of TNF-antagonist treatment in patients with early axial SpA, and it is unclear how long biologic-free remission is likely to be maintained or whether NSAID treatment might aid in maintenance of remission after anti-TNF treatment is discontinued.</p><p>The primary goals of INFAST Part 2, the 6-month follow-up study reported here, were to explore whether biologic-free remission can be achieved in patients with early axial SpA and to determine whether continued treatment with NPX was superior to discontinuing all treatments in order to maintain disease control for 6&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>Part 1 of INFAST (Protocol P05336, NCT00844805) was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial of IFX+NPX vs PBO+NPX treatment in patients aged 18&#x02013;48&#x02005;years with early, moderate-to-severe axial SpA (see online supplementary figure S1). The design of Part 1 of the INFAST study has been reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Briefly, patients enrolled in INFAST Part 1 had been diagnosed with axial SpA of less than 3&#x02005;years&#x02019; duration, were na&#x000ef;ve to biologics and were either NSAID-na&#x000ef;ve at baseline or had been treated with not more than two-thirds of the maximal recommended dose during the 2&#x02005;weeks prior to the screening visit. Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive 28&#x02005;weeks of treatment with either intravenous (IV) IFX 5&#x02005;mg/kg (weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24)+NPX 1000&#x02005;mg/d or IV PBO+NPX 1000&#x02005;mg/d.</p><p>In Part 2, the follow-up period of INFAST that is the focus of this report, patients who had achieved Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) partial remission at week 28 (defined as reaching &#x02264;20&#x02005;mm on a scale of 100&#x02005;mm in all four ASAS domains) were eligible to continue to the follow-up phase. IFX treatment was stopped, and patients were randomised to receive either NPX or no treatment (1:1 ratio) until week 52. For the NPX group, open-label NPX was administered at the dose each patient had received prior to week 28 (1000&#x02005;mg/d or 500&#x02005;mg/d if the higher dose was not tolerated). A computer-generated randomisation list was created by the sponsor and held by the central randomisation centre, which was contacted by the site to assign treatment to each patient as they enrolled. Randomisation in Part 2 was stratified by randomised treatment assignment in INFAST Part 1. Data were collected from October 2009 to September 2011.</p><p>Patients with flares, defined as Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) &#x02265;3&#x02005;cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale during two consecutive visits within 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks of each other between weeks 28 and 52, had a final MRI and were discontinued from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome of INFAST Part 2 was the percentage of patients who maintained ASAS partial remission until week 52. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with disease flare (as defined above) and several other measures of disease activity, inflammation, clinical symptoms, functioning and quality of life (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), BASDAI, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) and EuroQoL 5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D)) were assessed at several points throughout the study.</p><p>Adverse events and other safety measures were also collected.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No sample size calculation was done for this exploratory follow-up study because the sample was determined by the number of patients in remission at the end of Part 1 of INFAST. Anticipating that approximately 60 patients would be in remission at the end of Part 1, with 30 patients per group, the study had an estimated 87% power to detect a 42% absolute difference between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients with ASAS partial remission at week 52 using a Fisher exact test with &#x003b1; set at 0.05. This was considered acceptable because a small effect of NPX would probably not justify continued use of NPX to maintain remission after stopping a biologic treatment.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population for INFAST Part 2 included all subjects who were randomised in the follow-up phase and had at least one efficacy assessment after week 28. The safety population included all patients who were randomised in the follow-up phase. Adverse events were analysed descriptively.</p><p>Treatment group differences in categorical efficacy measures, including the primary efficacy outcome, were analysed using Fisher exact tests. &#x003b1; was set at 0.05. Patients who discontinued early were considered to be non-responders in the analysis of ASAS partial remission. No other data were imputed. Continuous measures were analysed using analysis of covariance with baseline values as covariates. Duration of ASAS partial remission (in weeks) was assessed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method with a log-rank test of the difference between treatment groups. Predictors of duration of remission were explored using Cox regression models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>In Part 1 of INFAST, 158 patients were randomised, and 141 completed the study to week 28. In Part 2, the follow-up phase that included only patients who achieved ASAS partial remission at week 28, 41 patients were randomised to NPX and 41 to no treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013203460F1">figure 1</xref>). The ITT population included 40 patients in each treatment group; 1 patient was excluded from each treatment group because they had no efficacy data after week 28. Each treatment group in Part 2 had 31 patients from the IFX+NPX arm and 9 patients from the PBO+NPX arm in Part 1; the greater number of patients from the IFX+NPX arm reflected the 2:1 randomisation ratio to IFX+NPX vs PBO+NPX in Part 1, and also the greater number of patients who reached partial remission in the IFX+NPX arm in Part 1. Most patients (32/41, 78%) in each of the treatment arms in Part 2 completed week 52 of the trial.</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2013203460F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition for INFAST Part 2.

No deaths occurred.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study of patients with early, active, moderate-to-severe axial SpA who had reached ASAS partial remission following 28&#x02005;weeks of treatment with IFX+NPX or PBO+NPX, remission was maintained at week 52 by similar percentages of patients who either stayed on NPX therapy (47.5%) or in whom all treatments were stopped between weeks 28 and 52 (40.0%). Although the rate of partial remission, a stringent criterion for disease activity, decreased steadily over the follow-up period, other measures of disease activity indicated that most of the substantial improvement achieved over the first 28&#x02005;weeks of treatment was well maintained during the follow-up period. For example, mean BASDAI across treatment groups was approximately 6 at baseline of INFAST Part 1, approximately 0.6 at baseline of INFAST Part 2 (week 28) and approximately 1.5 at week 52. Approximately 90% of patients had BASDAI&#x0003c;3 at week 52. As assessed by several other measures of disease activity, inflammation and functioning (eg, ASDAS-C, CRP and BASFI) improvements achieved during the initial treatment phase of INFAST were generally maintained during the 6-month follow-up period, and very few flares were observed.</p><p>One issue of importance to patients, clinicians and payers is whether patients with axial SpA who are treated with TNF-&#x003b1; antagonists can stop therapy without experiencing disease flare. Although studies in AS populations have shown that patients continue to respond to TNF-antagonist treatment over periods of several years, available evidence indicates that nearly all patients will flare once treatment is stopped,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> suggesting that the biologic-free remission rates found in INFAST would be unlikely in patients with established AS and longer disease duration. In the current study's population of patients with early disease, 78% of the patients in the follow-up study had received IFX+NPX in the initial treatment phase of INFAST. When all IFX treatment was stopped at week 28, almost half of the patients maintained partial remission to week 52. Overall, the data suggest that both combination treatments with IFX+NPX and NPX monotherapy in the first 6&#x02005;months had long-lasting benefits in those patients who reached partial remission, with few patients in any treatment group experiencing disease flares.</p><p>The initial positive responses to treatment in INFAST Part 1 and the well-maintained response shown in INFAST Part 2 are among the highest rates of response for studies of TNF-&#x003b1; antagonist treatment in patients with axial SpA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12 R13 R14">12&#x02013;14</xref> The high response rates are possibly due to the very short disease duration of the population, patient selection for signs of inflammation on MRI and the intensified treatment during Part 1 (either a full dose of NPX or NPX+IFX) in a population of patients that had not yet failed NSAIDs or were na&#x000ef;ve to NSAIDs at study entry. Patients in INFAST reported a mean of fewer than 2&#x02005;years since the onset of symptoms, and previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> have shown that short disease duration is a predictor of better response to TNF-&#x003b1; antagonists in patients with axial SpA and AS. Shorter disease duration was associated with sustained remission in our study, which may indicate the existence of a window of opportunity for treatment of axial SpA early in the course of disease, as has been described in early RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> This is the first trial in axial SpA demonstrating that a remission-induction strategy in patients with very early disease can actually keep these patients in a state of low disease activity, even without medication. One limitation of this study is that it is not known whether these results could be achieved after stopping medication in a population of patients who had already failed NSAIDs.</p><p>Although there was a tendency for slightly numerically better outcomes in patients who received NPX rather than no treatment during the follow-up period, none of these differences were statistically significant. It is difficult to draw any conclusions about the possible superiority of NPX because the follow-up phase of INFAST was an exploratory study that was underpowered to detect smaller differences between the NPX and no-treatment groups. Although significant clinically relevant differences could have been missed because of the small sample size, the small differences between the two groups detected here are likely to be too small to be of clinical significance even if a statistically significant difference had been shown in a study with greater power. The open-label nature of the study might be considered a weakness that could bias the results in favour of the NPX group, but the NPX group was not superior to the no-treatment group, suggesting that the open-label design should not influence the overall interpretation of the data.</p><p>The results of the INFAST follow-up study demonstrated that patients with early, active, moderate-to-severe axial SpA who achieved partial remission during 28&#x02005;weeks of IFX+NPX or PBO+NPX treatment had similar rates of partial remission whether they received NPX or no treatment during 6-months of follow-up. Overall, patients had low disease activity and very few flares during the follow-up period, whether they received NPX or no treatment at all. Whether such a low level of disease activity could be maintained beyond 6&#x02005;months is an important question for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203460-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e898" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Ellen Stoltzfus, PhD, and Kathy Claussen, PhD, of JK Associates, Inc., Conshohocken, PA.
