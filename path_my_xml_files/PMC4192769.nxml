Contrary to type 1 diabetes, the relationship between vitamin D and type 2 diabetes is less clear.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It has been well-corroborated that reducing of total body fat, including visceral fat is one of the strategies in the management of type 2 diabetes. Both in small case&#x02013;control studies and in some large population-based studies have been shown total body fat was inversely associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH] D) levels.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] On the other hand, there were some evidences implying persons suffering from diabetes, have lower serum concentrations of vitamin D.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin D replenishment corrects glycemia and insulin secretion in diabetic type 2 patients with established hypovitaminosis D. Since the vitamin D receptors and vitamin D&#x02013;binding proteins (DBP) are found in pancreatic tissue as well as a relationship between certain allelic variations in the vitamin D receptor and DBP genes with glucose tolerance and insulin secretion has been shown, it has been suggested a role for vitamin D in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Abnormalities in many systemic inflammation markers such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor, C-reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been reported in type 2 diabetes. Some of these immune mediators, such as TNF-&#x003b1; can directly intervene to insulin-signaling, causing insulin resistance through several mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In adipocytes or surrounding skeletal muscle cells, TNF-&#x003b1; may elevate serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and also of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and possibly other proteins that mediate intracellular insulin-signaling. Serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 has been shown to prevent insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which results in impaired downstream insulin-signaling.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Interestingly, it has been reported that vitamin D downregulate the synthesis of several cytokines including IL-2, interferon-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and TNF-&#x003b2;.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In addition, lipodystrophy is associated with lowered insulin sensitivity, suggesting that an adipocyte factor may be involved as a signal in insulin sensitivity, perhaps via leptin or TNF-&#x003b1;.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Leptin also collaborates to reduce intracellular content of triglycerides. Leptin resistance can probably reduce these physiological functions of leptin and assist in maintain excessive free fatty acid flux and intracellular accumulation, leading to insulin resistance and also contributing to beta-cell dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Moreover, high blood levels of leptin seem to play a role in the appearance of hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy as well as in detachment of the retina.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of the study reported here was to assess the probable effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the amount and percent of total body fat, whereby it may affect on serum levels of leptin and TNF-&#x003b1;. The amount of blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was also measured as a tool for monitoring blood sugar control in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>The present randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in diabetes clinic of Taleqani hospital located at Urmia city, Iran, which affiliated to Urmia University of Medical Sciences. According to the method proven at the medical researches committee of the university, we invited type 2 diabetic patients randomly through existing over 1800 documents of diabetic patients. Later, we illustrated our goals and methods would be performed in the survey for all of the invited patients. The patients invited were ones that put on glucose lowering agents, &#x02013; but not insulin - to managing their diseases. The participants were not suffering from other illnesses (such as cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, and/or inflammatory diseases) except diabetes. Furthermore, we included only nonsupplemented patients with vitamin D and/or Ca. All of the subjects pertained to the same ethnicity. Totally, the sum of 51 patients could achieve to final analysis stage of the study in two groups: Group supplemented with 400 IU/d vitamin D3 (<italic>n</italic> = 26) for 14 weeks (vitamin D group) and group administered daily placebo for 14 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 25) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. We used two kinds of edible drops in this study. Vitamin D drops were composed of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU/ml (10 mcg/ml) plus thin vegetable oil (purified component of coconut and palm oil). There are no other chemicals or additives. They were tasteless and odorless. Apparently, the placebo drops are composed of above-mentioned vegetable oil alone.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of groups from recruitment to analysis based on CONSORT 2010 flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-5-1091-g001"/></fig><p>Vitamin D3 or placebo was given to each of subjects by investigator assistant in terms of they belong to which of the studied group. The matching was carried out between subjects of two groups with a view to their sex and age. The subjects included survey sequentially in a course of several days at baseline and postintervention stages of study. To eliminate the seasonal changes in vitamin D nutritional status, we did the baseline and postintervention steps during 4-month (hence mid-autumn to late winter). There were two questionnaires for anyone that each of which were filled by investigator respectively after interview with them. After almost 6-7 weeks, we called the participants up to confirm their collaborations and to consume their drops correctly. At 14<sup>th</sup> week of intervention, we invited again all of subjects separately to consider them and to study the parameters at postintervention stage at the same above-mentioned manner. This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in medical ethics committee regulation and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Tabriz University of Medical Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anthropometric and body composition measurements</title><p>The weight measurements were fulfilled with the lowest clothing in both baseline and postintervention stages.

An inverse association between various anthropometric measures including body mass index (BMI) as well as body fat mass and intake of vitamin D or circulating concentrations of vitamin D has been reported by a number of studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] An epidemiologic study reported vitamin D intake and BMI were inversely associated in both sexes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The principal limitation of this study was its cross-sectional design; hence the causative nature of the association cannot be established. Furthermore, although it was included a large number of subjects as sample population, the vitamin D nutritional status were determined by food frequency questionnaire alone in healthy males and females. In spite of the fact that there are some cross-sectional and case&#x02013;control studies concerning correlations of vitamin D and adiposity in diabetic type 2 patients[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] however a well-controlled clinical trial study is really rare in this context as yet. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to determine the short-term effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on insulin sensitivity in apparently healthy, middle-aged, centrally obese men, no changes in secondary outcome measurements (including BMI and waist circumference) were similarly found with supplementation. None of the studies evaluated subjects&#x02019; physical activity as a confounder. Thus, we may conclude there are influences of fat-free compartments of bone, muscle[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and abdominal organs (liver, kidney, gut)[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] on body composition to explain the lack of such effects.</p><p>Our results could not detect a significant deference in HbA1c between the two stages of the survey in group vitamin D. Although we could not find a statistical difference between postintervention baseline difference means, we found a significant reduction in HbA1c in vitamin D group in comparison with the placebo group at the post intervention stage implying the supplementation of the subjects&#x02019; diet with vitamin D3 in nutritional doses may potentially be effective in repelling their blood HbA1c rise. It should not forget that one of possible reasons for this phenomenon could be elevated levels of the blood HbA1c at the baseline; although it did not reach to a statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.85). There are some studies conducted on persons to determine the effect of vitamin D on HbA1c. Most of these were limited by a small sample size. One of the earliest studies was carried out by Ljunghall <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who studied 65 middle-aged men with impaired glucose tolerance. They found that serum concentrations of vitamin D were not associated with a change in HbA1c; nevertheless, their subjects were at normal range of vitamin D. Recent evidences have demonstrated that persons with type 2 diabetes who have hypovitaminosis D are more likely to have increased HbA1c (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) compared with those persons with diabetes who do not.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In one of the most recent studies Jorde and Figenschau[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported in a randomized, placebo-controlled study after 6-month, HbA1c levels were not significantly different from baseline values in patients with type 2 diabetes who had normal serum 25(OH) D levels. Similar findings were seen in another recent investigation in this regard.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] According to the authors&#x02019; emphasis, this study[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] has several limitations and there could be some elucidations for the lack of effect of vitamin D on glucose metabolism observed. Firstly, the number of patients was too low to draw definitive conclusions. In addition, the included subjects were treated with metformin and insulin, which might have masked any subtle effects of vitamin D. In general, we can say the supplementation of the diet with vitamin D3 in type 2 diabetics could correct their HbA1c levels more likely in patients with sub-optimal amounts of serum 25 (OH) D. Our data indicate the subjects&#x02019; intakes of vitamin D are lower than that of recommended daily allowance recommendations. Hence, our results seem to be rational in this context.</p><p>In our study, a statistical significant increase in serum leptin and decrease in serum TNF-&#x003b1; were indicated after 14 weeks supplementation with 400 IU vitamin D3 in group vitamin D. It has been seen anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies improve insulin sensitivity in obese rodents and TNF-&#x003b1;-deficient mice are protected from obesity-induced insulin resistance on a high fat diet.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It has been documented that anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy may be beneficial in reducing the complications of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a study on four women (52-76 years) with type 2 diabetes in danger of vision loss due to severe macular edema on hypoglycemic therapy, two infusions of the monoclonal anti-TNF antibody, infliximab, (5 mg/kg) in 1-month intervals intravenously showed significant regression in macular edema.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Hence, we assume based on our results, the supplementation of the diabetic type 2 patients&#x02019; diet with 400 IU/d vitamin D may potentially have beneficial effects at least on prevention of their disease long-term complications due to its decreasing effect on serum TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>Despite of a few reports implying vitamin D inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> leptin secretion by human adipose tissue,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] some experimental studies indicate different results. Tarcin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] recently reported a significant elevation in serum concentrations of leptin after therapy with 300,000 IU vitamin D in 23 asymptomatic vitamin D-deficient subjects. Lately, it is found that the leptin dose of 12.5 &#x003b7;g/h significantly lowers blood glucose in mice and that 25 &#x003b7;g/h of leptin normalizes plasma glucose and insulin without significantly reducing body weight, establishing that leptin exerts its most potent effects on glucose metabolism.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Therefore, we can suppose when vitamin D intake is below, the serum leptin level will be low, which it could be followed by increasing appetite and weight gain. Vitamin D supplementation may cause serum leptin increment that it would be lead to weight reduction.</p><p>We have to admit that our study was restricted by no measurements of serum parathyroid hormone, serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and by the absence of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance mensuration. In addition, we used a supplemental dose of vitamin D3 (400 IU/d) for our trial; whereas the doses used for some of above-mentioned clinical trials, were mostly more (sometimes up to 40,000 IU/week).</p><p>In summary, we were not able to demonstrate an effect on body fat mass in subjects with type 2 diabetes after supplementation with vitamin D, but the effectiveness of the supplementation was seen in attenuation of one of the markers of systemic inflammation, TNF-&#x003b1;, as well as in enhancement of the serum leptin levels. There is a need for larger studies with longer duration and graded doses of vitamin D.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
