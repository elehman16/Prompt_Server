While the patient-controlled aspect of this approach achieves higher patient satisfaction than nurse-administered analgesics, many issues continue to plague IV PCA.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The invasive IV route of administration creates risks of infection and analgesic gaps due to catheter infiltration or IV tubing obstructions, while risk of prescribing and programming errors create significant morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The use of morphine, an opioid with slow central nervous system (CNS) equilibration, as the IV PCA opioid of choice has further complicated this approach to acute inpatient pain management. The CNS effector site peak concentration of morphine and its active metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) occurs hours following the IV PCA dosing event and can result in delayed adverse events, such as respiratory depression.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A sufentanil sublingual tablet system (SSTS) (Zalviso&#x02122;; AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Redwood City, CA, U.S.A.) is being developed to overcome these shortcomings of IV PCA while still maintaining patient-controlled delivery. Sufentanil lacks active metabolites, possesses a high therapeutic index in preclinical models (26,000 compared to 70 for morphine),<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and has a rapid equilibration half-life between plasma and CNS (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>k<sub>e0</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;minutes compared to 2.8&#x000a0;hours for morphine).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Due to its highly lipophilic nature, sufentanil can be rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration in the form of a small bioadhesive tablet (3&#x000a0;mm diameter; 0.75&#x000a0;mm thick), which allows for a non-invasive route of administration. The hand-held SSTS device is stored bedside and is preprogrammed with a 20-minute lockout interval and uses a radio-frequency identification (RFID) thumb tag to allow only the patient to operate the device (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Upon set-up of the system, the nurse inserts a small cartridge containing 40 sufentanil tablets (approximately a 2-day supply) into the dispenser tip which is then locked into the controller base and the system is tethered to the bedside or other secure location (wheelchair, gurney, etc.). Phase 2 dose-finding studies in patients following major surgery demonstrated that sufentanil 15 mcg per tablet was the optimal dosage strength resulting in high patient satisfaction and a similar adverse event profile to lower dosage strengths.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sufentanil sublingual tablet system with radio-frequency identification (RFID) patient thumb tag and security tether attached to the bottom of the controller.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="papr0014-0679-f1"/></fig><p>The purpose of this Phase 3 open-label, active comparator study was to compare efficacy and safety of SSTS (15&#x000a0;mcg dose with a 20-minute lockout) to IV PCA morphine sulfate (IV PCA MS) 1&#x000a0;mg dose with a 6-minute lockout for 48&#x000a0;hours following major surgery, with an optional extension to 72&#x000a0;hours. The study's primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority to IV PCA MS as measured by the 48-hour patient global assessment of method of pain control (PGA48). This endpoint was selected as it incorporates both an assessment of analgesic efficacy over a typical duration of postoperative PCA use as well as the method in which it was delivered, both critical elements for evaluating PCA modalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design study with patients randomized to SSMS or IV PCA MS. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on February 24, 2012 (NCT01539538). After centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study by Copernicus IRB (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) or by the clinical sites local IRB, patients 18&#x000a0;years and older, who had provided written informed consent and were scheduled within 30&#x000a0;days to undergo elective major open abdominal (including laparoscopic-assisted open abdominal procedures) or orthopedic (total knee or hip replacement) surgery, were allowed to enroll. Patients undergoing fully laparoscopic abdominal surgeries were excluded, however, surgeries utilizing a laparoscopic-assisted approach, such as partial colectomy, could enroll. Following surgery, qualifying patients were randomized 1:1 to SSTS (15&#x000a0;mcg/dose with a 20-minute lockout) or IV PCA MS (1&#x000a0;mg/dose with a 6-minute lockout) across all study sites. The dose for IV PCA MS was selected to reflect the standard 1&#x000a0;mg morphine on-demand dosing practiced at many hospitals as well as to allow an equivalent opioid dose within the same time period (dosing over 20&#x000a0;minutes allows 15&#x000a0;mcg sublingual sufentanil&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;mg IV morphine based on 300 to 400 potency factor and 60% bioavailability of sublingual sufentanil). A stratified randomization was applied in this study, with age (&#x0003c; 65&#x000a0;years and &#x0003e; 65&#x000a0;years) and type of surgery (total knee replacement and other surgeries) as stratification factors. Key screening exclusion criteria included opioid tolerance (patients could not be taking more than 15&#x000a0;mg oral morphine equivalent per day), documented sleep apnea, or patients requiring supplemental outpatient oxygen therapy. Key exclusion criteria perioperatively were evidence of respiratory difficulties or intractable vomiting in the recovery room, use of perioperative regional anesthetic techniques and local anesthetic wound infiltration in the operating room, or premedication with long-acting opioids. The use of any drug that may affect postoperative pain levels, such as gabapentanoids, steroids, or anti-inflammatory drugs were not allowed intra- or postoperatively. Therefore, patients with a chronic pain condition necessitating treatment with these agents were excluded from the study.</p><p>As a criteria for continued eligibility in the study, at some point during the patient's stay in the recovery room they had to report a pain score &#x0003c; 5 on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no pain, and 10&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worst possible pain. This was required in order to avoid enrolling patients with uncontrolled pain after surgery. However, in order to determine the analgesic benefit of the study drug and to avoid dosing patients with only mild pain intensities, the patient's pain score after leaving the recovery room needed to increase to &#x0003e; 4 just prior to self-administering the first dose of study drug, which initiated the study treatment period. Patients self-administered study drug as needed for pain relief for the full 48-hour study period, with an option to continue for up to 72&#x000a0;hours, if needed.</p><p>No analgesic medication other than study drug was allowed during the study period with the exception of supplemental opioid medication (2&#x000a0;mg IV MS bolus) if necessary in the first 30&#x000a0;minutes of the study to keep a patient comfortable at study initiation or only for pain due to ambulation or with the initiation of passive range-of-motion therapy at any other time in the study. No more than 2&#x000a0;mg IV MS could be administered per hour. If at any time the patient felt that his or her analgesia was not sufficient to remain in the study, the patient was allowed to drop-out of the study due to inadequate analgesia and receive any opioid or adjuvant analgesic as deemed appropriate by the clinical investigator.</p><p>Patients with oxygen saturation levels that could not be maintained at 95% or greater with or without the use of supplemental oxygen, respiratory rate &#x0003c; 8 breaths per minute, or excessive sedation were not allowed access to study drug or supplemental opioid medication until these vital signs had improved. If each adverse event did not rapidly improve under supervision with arousal and vital sign checks, the patient was to be removed from the study.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable was the patient global assessment of the method of pain control (using a 4-point categorical scale where 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;poor, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;fair, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;good, and 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;excellent) at the 48-hour time point (PGA48) with &#x0201c;success&#x0201d; defined as the proportion of patients who responded &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d;. The prespecified criteria for non-inferiority was that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in success rates (SSTS minus IV PCA MS) could not be less than a &#x02212;15%.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included PGA at 24 and 72&#x000a0;hours, as well as healthcare professional global assessment of method of pain control (HPGA) at these time points. Pain responses were assessed using patient reports of pain intensity on an 11-point NRS; and pain relief using a 5-point categorical scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no relief, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;a little relief, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate relief, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;a lot of relief, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;complete relief). Pain responses were measured prior to first dose and at 15, 30 and 45&#x000a0;minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12&#x000a0;hours after study initiation, then every 4&#x000a0;hours through the remainder of the study period. A pain intensity and pain relief score was also obtained prior to each administration of supplemental opioid medication.</p><p>To assess the ease of use of the 2 patient-controlled analgesia systems, validated patient and nurse ease-of-care (EOC) questionnaires were completed and results tabulated.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The patient EOC questionnaire has 23 questions; 21 of which are scored on a scale of 0 to 5 (where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;not at all and 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;a very great deal) and summarized into 6 subscale scores (confidence with device, comfort with device, movement, dosing confidence, pain control, and knowledge/understanding) and a total EOC score. The other 2 questions (satisfaction with level of pain control and satisfaction with method of administration of pain medication) are scored on a 6-point scale (extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied) and combined into an overall satisfaction score. The nurse EOC questionnaire has 22 questions, 20 of which are scored on a scale of 0 to 5 (where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;not at all and 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;a very great deal) and summarized into 2 subscale scores (time-consuming and bothersome) and a total EOC score. Two other questions (satisfaction with level of pain control and satisfaction with device) were scored on a 6&#x02013;point scale (extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied) and combined into a total satisfaction score.</p><p>Safety assessments included spontaneously reported adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), continuous oxygen saturation monitoring, sedation levels measured using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the use of concomitant medications. Blood samples were collected at 24 and 48&#x000a0;hours after the first dose of study drug or at the time of early termination for analysis of either sufentanil concentrations for patients in SSTS group, or MS, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), and M6G concentrations for patients in the IV PCA MS group.</p><sec><title>Statistical Methodology</title><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included randomized patients who received study drug. The primary efficacy analysis was the construction of the 95% CI of the difference in PGA48 success rates between the 2 treatment groups. If the lower boundary of the CI of the difference in the success rate was not less than &#x02212;15%, SSTS treatment would be considered non-inferior to IV PCA MS. A 2-sample, one-sided Z&#x000a0;test on proportions of the primary efficacy variable against the lower equivalence margin (&#x02212;15%) was performed at the &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.025 significance level. A 2-sided superiority test was also performed on this primary efficacy variable as a key secondary analysis.</p><p>Assuming a success rate of 75% for both treatment groups, a sample size of 352 patients (176 per treatment group) was sufficient to provide 90% power to demonstrate therapeutic non-inferiority of SSTS vs. the IV PCA MS treatment. This sample size calculation was based on a one-sided test with &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 15%.</p><p>A parallel lines analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for the analysis of continuous secondary efficacy endpoints derived from the pain assessment data. This ANCOVA model included treatment, center, and surgery type (knee, hip, and abdominal) factors, and baseline pain intensity as a covariate. The least squares (LS) mean of each treatment and its 95% CI were constructed.</p><p>For the analysis of ordinal categorical data, a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test of general association stratified by age group and surgery type (knee, hip, and abdominal) with modified ridit scores was used for the comparison between 2 treatment groups. The survival analysis method was used to analyze the time to event data. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier product limit estimators of cumulative rates of patients who reached the event (ie, termination due to inadequate analgesia) at follow-up time point were calculated. A log-rank test was used to compare 2 treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient Disposition</title><p>Twenty-six U.S. sites participated in the study.

Key secondary endpoints supportive of this finding were faster onset of analgesia and higher patient and nurse satisfaction scores as measured by validated ease-of-care questionnaires. Rapid onset of analgesia, even with sublingual administration of sufentanil tablets, should not be surprising given the high lipophilicity and the rapid <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>k<sub>e0</sub> equilibration half-life of 6&#x000a0;minutes for sufentanil.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As shown in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>, patients utilizing IV PCA MS on average required approximately 5-fold longer (7&#x000a0;hours vs. 1.3&#x000a0;hours) to obtain a mean PID of 1.3, which has been demonstrated as the clinically meaningful pain intensity difference for acute pain conditions.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Over time, the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference scores were similar between the 2 treatment groups; however, the total pain relief scores remained higher in the SSTS group.</p><p>The slow CNS penetration of IV MS not only results in delayed onset of analgesia but also sets up the risk of dose-stacking and delayed adverse events due to a decoupling of the patient's request for analgesia and the resultant peak CNS concentration. While the overall spontaneously reported adverse events were similar between the 2 groups, the more objective measurement of continuous oxygen saturation monitoring demonstrated fewer patients had desaturation events in the STSS group. Whether this is due to the lower therapeutic index for morphine compared to sufentanil, or due to morphine's delayed effector site penetration, is difficult to determine as the desaturation events occurred throughout the 72-hour study. It is also possible that the active metabolite M6G could be contributing to the increased rate of oxygen desaturation. M6G has an even longer equilibration half-life than morphine (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>k<sub>e0</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.4&#x000a0;hours),<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and as demonstrated in this study, is significantly increased with renal impairment. Some hospitals utilize hydromorphone with IV PCA instead of morphine to achieve a more rapid analgesic effect, however, the CNS equilibration half-life is still fairly long (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>k<sub>e0</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46&#x000a0;minutes).<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>While one theoretical advantage of IV PCA is the programmable nature of the device, this flexibility in dosing allows the risk of programming errors, as well as the risk of inappropriately increasing a patient's dose in response to inadequate analgesia. This can occur when the delayed onset of analgesia observed with morphine is attempted to be overcome by increasing the patient's on-demand dose. The delayed wave of morphine entering the effector site in the CNS is then further compounded by the increase in morphine administered per dose and adverse events can ensue. As a result, many hospitals have pre-printed IV PCA parameters to avoid non-opioid tolerant patients from being exposed to these risks. Therefore, the inherent complexity of the IV PCA programmable pump could be avoidable since, for most patients, the increased functionality is never utilized. The data from this study demonstrate that a fixed dosage strength patient-controlled modality, such as SSTS, allows adequate flexibility among patients given the nature of its &#x0201c;as needed&#x0201d; dosing paradigm. With no age or body-mass index limits, the varied demographics of patients entered in this study who were able to achieve safe and effective analgesia is evidence that the rapid CNS-equilibrating opioid sufentanil can be dosed sublingually using a less complex delivery device and avoid the issue of programming or dosing errors. The small percentage of in-hospital patients who are highly opioid-tolerant, on the other hand, do benefit from the additional option of IV PCA basal infusions and programming of higher bolus doses.</p><p>Although evenly distributed between the groups, this study did have a preponderance of white female patients. This is not surprising as it is the most common demographic group among hip and knee replacement patients, which were the majority of surgical patients in this study (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The flexible nature of dosing with patient-controlled analgesia systems in general should minimize concern that these results are representative of only a demographic subpopulation.</p><p>Patient EOC questionnaire results show SSTS patients gave higher scores for all aspects of the system (eg, comfort with device, ease of movement, confidence with dosing) compared to IV PCA MS patients. The SSTS is hand-held and is stored in a bedside holster within clear view of the patient compared to an IV PCA pump which is often not visible to the patient. The device has lights indicating lock-out status, the dosing button lights up and flashes when it recognizes the RFID thumb tag, and the system emits a positive dosing sound when the device has dispensed a tablet. This greater degree of feedback with the SSTS device compared to IV PCA pumps may underlie the higher patient ratings. Nurses similarly had higher EOC questionnaire ratings. The SSTS is preprogrammed and dispenses a solid dosage form, therefore does not require nurse programming, nursing double-checks, or IV tubing concerns, such as priming, patency, carrier fluid and pump requirements. These factors may have contributed to the less &#x0201c;bothersome&#x0201d; EOC subscale rating that the SSTS received by nurses compared to IV PCA. It cannot be ruled out that a new technology may in general be more appealing to patients and nurses, thereby influencing the EOC scoring to some degree.</p><p>Patient-specific RFID technology to minimize &#x0201c;proxy&#x0201d; dosing is an advantage over traditional PCA dosing which can allow family members to dose the patient, resulting in adverse events. Healthcare providers should be observant for diversion of medication; however, this issue in hospitalized patients is very limited compared to the much larger problem of diversion of outpatient-prescribed opioids.</p><p>In summary, the SSTS is an investigational patient-controlled system utilizing sublingual sufentanil tablets to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting. The system has advantages over IV PCA and has been demonstrated to provide rapid analgesia and achieves high patient and nurse satisfaction ratings in clinical use. Although not utilized in this study to avoid confounding analgesic endpoint assessments, a multimodal approach utilized alongside the SSTS would minimize adverse events and optimize postoperative analgesia. Furthermore, compelling pharmacoeconomic advantages should also play an important factor for utilization of SSTS if approved for commercial use in hospitals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>AcelRx
