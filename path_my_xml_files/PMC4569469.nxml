This study compared prooxidant/antioxidant balance responses following two LHTL protocols of the same duration and at the same living altitude of 2250 m in either normobaric (NH) or hypobaric (HH) hypoxia. Twenty-four well-trained triathletes underwent the following two 18-day LHTL protocols in a cross-over and randomized manner: Living altitude (P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 111.9 &#x000b1; 0.6 vs. 111.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 mmHg in NH and HH, respectively); training &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; altitude (~1000&#x02013;1100 m) and training loads were precisely matched between both LHTL protocols. Plasma levels of oxidative stress [advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and nitrotyrosine] and antioxidant markers [ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase], NO metabolism end-products (NOx) and uric acid (UA) were determined before (Pre) and after (Post) the LHTL. Cumulative hypoxic exposure was lower during the NH (229 &#x000b1; 6 hrs.) compared to the HH (310 &#x000b1; 4 hrs.; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) protocol. Following the LHTL, the concentration of AOPP decreased (-27%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and nitrotyrosine increased (+67%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in HH only. FRAP was decreased (-27%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) after the NH while was SOD and UA were only increased following the HH (SOD: +54%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 and UA: +15%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Catalase activity was increased in the NH only (+20%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These data suggest that 18-days of LHTL performed in either NH or HH differentially affect oxidative status of athletes. Higher oxidative stress levels following the HH LHTL might be explained by the higher overall hypoxic dose and different physiological responses between the NH and HH.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by grants from the Minist&#x000e8;re des Sports, de la Jeunesse, de l&#x02019;Education Populaire et de la Vie Associative (MSJEPVA; France; to L.S. and G.P.M.), Institut National du Sport, de l&#x02019;Expertise et de la Performance (INSEP; France; to L.S. and G.P.M.) and Institut Universitaire de France (IUF; France; to V.P.).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Due to legal restrictions imposed by the French government, data are accessible upon request from the Center of Research and Innovation on Sports and requests may be sent to Vincent Pialoux (<email>vincent.pialoux@univ-lyon1.fr</email>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Due to legal restrictions imposed by the French government, data are accessible upon request from the Center of Research and Innovation on Sports and requests may be sent to Vincent Pialoux (<email>vincent.pialoux@univ-lyon1.fr</email>).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that both, hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and exercise [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] elicit prooxidant/antioxidant perturbations. Augmented catecholamine production [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], mitochondrial redox potential reduction [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and activation of xanthine oxidase pathway [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are among the main mechanisms of hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species overproduction. On the other hand, exercise mainly augments oxidative stress through increased production of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x000b0;-</sup>) and oxygen-derived intermediates [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] within the mitochondria as a result of activity-induced O<sub>2</sub> flux increase. Combining altitude/hypoxic exposures and normoxic exercise training is the cornerstone of the &#x0201c;Live High Train Low&#x0201d; (LHTL) modality, routinely used by endurance athletes [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and team sport players [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in preparation for sea-level competitions. It is therefore not surprising that changes in prooxidant/antioxidant balance following LHTL protocols have previously been reported [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In particular, 18-days of LHTL training has been shown to augment oxidative stress and decrease antioxidant capacity in elite runners [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the impaired antioxidant status seems to persist for as long as two weeks after the LHTL cessation [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, 13-days of LHTL did not alter prooxidant/antioxidant balance in elite swimmers [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Authors speculated that the lower hypoxic dose and the lower training intensity during the latter study [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] might explain the lack of significant differences in oxidative stress. Collectively, these data suggest that during a LHTL protocol, both hypoxia and exercise training modulate oxidative status in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>To date, all studies investigating the effects of LHTL on oxidative status were performed in normobaric hypoxia (NH) [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to NH or hypobaric hypoxia (HH) at the same partial pressure of inspired O<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) induces different physiological responses [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two early studies indicated that both brief (40-min) [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and prolonged (10-hrs) [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] exposure to NH results in higher ventilation and lower systemic hypoxemia compared to HH. Although the potential differences in several physiological responses between NH and HH are still debated [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], recent study by Faiss et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that prolonged (24-hrs) exposure to HH results in higher oxidative stress and lower nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability compared to NH. The authors hypothesized that the differences in oxidative stress and NO between NH and HH could be due to higher normobaric hypoxic ventilatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although the differences in oxidative stress and antioxidant status might significantly modulate ventilatory adaptations to LHTL [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as erythropoetic response to hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and consequently influence performance gains, it is currently unknown whether LHTL performed in NH or HH differentially affects prooxidant/antioxidant balance of athletes.</p><p>Accordingly, this study aimed to compare the changes in prooxidant/antioxidant status of well-trained endurance athletes following 18-day LHTL protocol performed in either NH (simulated altitude of 2250 m) or HH (natural altitude of 2250 m). The training volumes and intensities as well as P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were precisely matched on a daily basis between both protocols. We hypothesized that 18-days of LHTL in HH would induce a stronger alteration of oxidative stress and antioxidant status compared to the LHTL in NH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was part of a comprehensive research program investigating physiological, psychological and performance adaptions of endurance athletes to normobaric and hypobaric LHTL protocol.

During the LHTL phase all participants performed supervised training sessions at altitudes between 1100&#x02013;1200 m and resided at natural or simulated altitude of ~ 2250 m. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) responses were measured during each night throughout the LHTL phase using a fingertip portable oxymeter (Wristox 3150, Nonin medical, Plymouth, USA).</p><p>Testing sessions were performed before (Pre) and immediately after (Post) the LHTL phase in a laboratory situated at an altitude of 1150 m.

The main finding of the present study is that 18 days of LHTL in HH result in a higher level of oxidative stress compared to LHTL of the same duration in NH. The increased plasma levels of nitrotyrosine, SOD and UA, clearly indicate higher oxidative stress levels following LHTL in HH. On the other hand, LHTL in NH only resulted in slight reductions in GPX and increased catalase activity. This suggests that the employed combined dose of normobaric hypoxia and exercise training during the NH LHTL was insufficient to meaningfully alter prooxidant/antioxidant balance.</p><p>It has previously been shown that 18 days of normobaric LHTL increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity in elite athletes [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], known to have superior enzymatic antioxidant defense [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the normobaric LHTL protocol in this study did not exert any significant effect on prooxidant/antioxidant balance. While reductions in GPX and FRAP as well as increased catalase activity were observed, no significant changes were noted in any of the other oxidative stress markers (i.e. MDA and AOPP) as well as nitrotyrosine and SOD. These results are in line with the findings of Pialoux et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showing that 13-days of LHTL in swimmers did not modify resting oxidative stress values.</p><p>The NH LHTL data also lend further support to the hypothesis that the benefits of repeated (moderate intensity) exercise training on enzymatic antioxidant system may counteract hypoxia-induced oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, the training intensities in the present study were moderate and collectively lower than in the previous study reporting increased oxidative stress levels following 18-day NH LHTL [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that the rate of electron leakage, underlying the superoxide formation within the mitochondria respiratory chain is stable [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], higher oxygen flux, as observed during high-intensity exercise, should augment ROS production. In addition, the training modes used in this study (i.e. combining cycling, swimming and running) might also partly explain the unaltered oxidative stress status following NH LHTL. Especially, since running has been suggested to result in higher ROS production than swimming as a consequence of higher exercise-induced muscular inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is also noteworthy that the daily, as well as the overall, hypoxic dose (i.e. &#x02265; 12 hrs&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>for &#x02265; 18 days) employed during the NH LHTL was within the minimal recommended values for such protocols [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and that the simulated altitude was within the recommended altitude range (2000&#x02013;2500 m) to achieve optimal acclimatization responses for sea level performance [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Regardless of the relatively low daily hypoxic dose, the NH LHTL resulted in improved VO<sub>2max</sub> and MAP and also induced significant hematological adaptations as detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Collectively, these results reinforce the &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; altitude concept [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] suggesting that preforming LHTL at altitudes between 2000&#x02013;2500 m minimizes the potential detrimental effects of altitude exposures (i.e. overreaching, oxidative stress) while still providing sufficient hypoxic stimuli to enhance performance secondary to favorable hematological and ventilatory adaptations.</p><p>Contrary to the NH protocol, the participants exhibited significantly greater alterations of oxidative status following the HH LHTL. The increases in nitrotyrosine, SOD and UA clearly indicate higher oxidative stress levels following the HH LHTL. Higher SOD activity in HH vs. NH has already been demonstrated during short acute exposures [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The increased SOD production in HH compared to NH is also in line with the increased UA observed in this study. Indeed, the main underlying mechanism of augmented UA production in the context of intermittent hypoxia likely involves activation of the xanthine oxidase pathway that concomitantly results in increased O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x000b0;-</sup> generation [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, FRAP was unaltered following HH LHTL and was decreased as a result of LHTL performed in NH. This may be related to the increased UA levels, since UA is known to have a high antioxidant effect and is one of the main modulators of FRAP in the plasma [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the significant correlation observed between FRAP and UA. The reduced levels of plasma AOPP, only observed following the HH LHTL could thus be explained by this specific UA antioxidant response.</p><p>Although lower levels of both exhaled NO [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and plasma NOx [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in HH vs. NH have previously been demonstrated during short-term exposures, we failed to observe a significant decrease in NOx following HH LHTL (-8%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1). Nevertheless, the increased levels of nitrotyrosine associated with the observed trend for reduced NOx following the HH LHTL collectively suggest an increased ROS production during the HH protocol. This is also supported by augmented SOD activity and UA concentration. In particular, O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x000b0;-</sup> can lead to peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) formation via NO and ONOO<sup>-</sup> can subsequently bound with tyrosine to form nitrotyrosine.</p><p>One potential explanation for the observed differences between NH and HH LHTL in oxidative stress could be the significantly lower average nocturnal SpO<sub>2</sub> levels throughout the protocol in NH compared to HH LHTL protocol. Indeed, we previously reported that the arterial desaturation induced by short exposure to hypoxia exposure was positively correlated with the acute change in plasma oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This finding is also in line with previous reports demonstrating lower hypoxemia levels in NH vs. HH during short-term exposures [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While hypobaria-induced increase in dead-space ventilation has been suggested to underlie the greater hypoxemia in HH [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], other factors such as reductions in alveolar pressure and trans-capillary flux might also play a role [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, although plasma pH was not significantly different between NH and HH at Post (trend for lower pH in HH vs. NH; <italic>P</italic> = 0.09), a negative correlation was noted between changes in pH and SOD. This suggests that the increased oxidative stress observed during HH as compared to NH may have been be influenced by the pH changes. Indeed, acidosis can induce oxidative stress by causing protonation of ONOO<sup>-</sup> leading to radical hydroxyl generation [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137957.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this context, and in line with our previous results [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we can hypothesize that the previously reported differences in ventilatory pattern between NH and HH LHTL [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (e.g. higher nocturnal breathing frequency in HH compared to NH; suggesting lower tidal volumes during HH) could therefore explain the (relative) blood alkalosis in NH. This alkalosis observed in the NH may have reduced the ROS production and could, at least in part, explain the higher plasma oxidative stress measured in HH.</p><p>The cross-over design and a large sample size are clearly the fundamental strengths of the present study. Other important, methodological aspects of this study include: i) the study was performed on highly trained athletes, ii) training supervision during lead-in study phases ensured similar training status before the start of the respective LHTL protocols and iii) both, training and altitude were precisely matched between the NH and HH LHTL protocols.</p><p>There are nevertheless few limitations that need to be addressed. First, the cumulative hypoxic exposure time was significantly lower in NH compared to HH. Since oxidative stress alterations have been shown to follow a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] this difference in hypoxic dose may, at least in part, explain the observed differences. It is notoriously difficult to provide the same daily hypoxic exposure during a LHTL protocol between NH and HH. This is especially true for LHTL protocols performed with elite and well-trained athletes as prolonged daily room confinement might even exert detrimental effects on physiological and psychological responses to LHTL [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The daily exposure times during LHTL in both NH (~ 12-hrs.) and HH (~ 16-hrs.) were in line with the majority of the other hitherto studies as detailed in a recent review [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although our study may not allow us to determine the effect of barometric pressure <italic>per se</italic>, it reveals significant difference between two real-condition LHTL training protocols (HH and NH) in well-trained athletes in regards to oxidative stress and antioxidant responses.</p><p>Second, although the diet was not precisely measured, the same menus were used during both protocols throughout the LHTL phase. Moreover, the diet was low in nitrate/nitrite intake as recommended by Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to limit the potential effects of high dietary nitrate/nitrite intakes on prooxidant/antioxidant balance. The lack of dietary intake assessment does not allow us to determine the potential effects of the non-enzymatic (dietary) antioxidants intakes. It is of note however, that at least during chronic hypoxic exposure, exercise-induced enzymatic adaptations might be more efficient for reducing the systemic oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] than dietary antioxidant supplementation, which has previously been shown ineffective to alleviate HH induced oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It therefore seems unlikely that the diet could explain the observed differences in oxidative stress and antioxidant status.</p><p>It is also of note that the plasma levels of selected prooxidant/antioxidant balance markers were significantly different before both protocols. In particular, the levels of Nitrotyrosine, FRAP, SOD and UA were lower, whereas the levels of GPX were higher before the HH as compared to NH LHLT. Although the participants were recruited at the same time of the yearly competitive cycle and did not seem to differ in their general health or performance status, this observation must be taken into account when interpreting these results.</p><p>Finally, the prooxidant/antioxidant balance assessment in this study was performed by measuring selected markers in the plasma. While these measures represent a valid frame for assessment of systemic oxidative stress, they do not necessarily reflect the oxidative status in other tissues and organs [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to date demonstrating different oxidative stress responses following two 18-days LHTL protocols; one performed in normobaric hypoxia and one in hypobaric hypoxia. The obtained data suggest that hypobaric LHTL might result in significantly higher levels of oxidative stress compared to the normobaric LHTL of the same duration. Higher oxidative stress levels following HH LHTL might be explained by the higher overall hypoxic dose and different physiological responses. Our data also suggest that hypoxia modulates oxidative stress in a dose dependent manner.</p><p>These findings may have important implications for athletes, coaches and scientists employing different LHTL protocols since parameters of performance improvement following such training modalities are closely related to oxidative stress modulation. In particular, alternations in prooxidant/antioxidant balance can significantly alter ventilatory adaptations to LHTL [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as erythropoietic response to hypoxic exposure [<xref rid="pone.0137957.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and might consequently influence the purported performance benefits. Furthermore, this study also reinforces the fact that potential differences between &#x0201c;simulated&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; altitudes, both in regards to the overall hypoxic dose as well as physiological responses, need to be taken into account when utilizing these protocols for clinical or performance-enhancing purposes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by grants from the Minist&#x000e8;re des Sports, de la Jeunesse, de l&#x02019;Education Populaire et de la Vie Associative (MSJEPVA; France; to L.S. and G.P.M.), Institut National du Sport, de l&#x02019;Expertise et de la Performance (INSEP; France; to L.S. and G.P.M.) and Institut Universitaire de France (IUF; France; to V.P.).
