Activated vitamin D is immunomodulatory, and vitamin D deficiency, common in hemodialysis patients awaiting transplantation, is associated with a heightened alloimmune response. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation would prevent alloreactive T-cell memory formation in vitamin D-deficient hemodialysis patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We performed a 12-month single-center pilot randomized, controlled trial of 50,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol (D<sub>3</sub>) versus no supplementation in 96 hemodialysis patients with serum 25(OH)D&#x0003c;25 ng/mL, measuring effects on serum 25(OH)D and phenotypic and functional properties of T-cells. Participants were randomized 2&#x02236;1 to active treatment versus control. D<sub>3</sub> supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D at 6 weeks (13.5 [11.2] ng/mL to 42.5 [18.5] ng/mL, p&#x0003c;0.001) and for the duration of the study. No episodes of sustained hypercalcemia occurred in either group. Results of IFN&#x003b3; ELISPOT-based panel of reactive T-cell assays (PRT), quantifying alloreactive memory, demonstrated greater increases in the controls over 1 year compared to the treatment group (delta PRT in treatment 104.8+/&#x02212;330.8 vs 252.9+/&#x02212;431.3 in control), but these changes in PRT between groups did not reach statistical significance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>D<sub>3</sub> supplements are safe, effective at treating vitamin D deficiency, and may prevent time-dependent increases in T-cell alloimmunity in hemodialysis patients, but their effects on alloimmunity need to be confirmed in larger studies. These findings support the routine supplementation of vitamin D-deficient transplant candidates on hemodialysis and highlight the need for large-scale prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation in transplant candidates and recipients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase needed to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D <xref rid="pone.0109998-Hewison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D can directly modulate the function of T-cells and DCs through a variety of mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0109998-Piemonti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109998-Bhalla1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and can enhance tolerance induction in mice <xref rid="pone.0109998-Adorini1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Importantly, many of the immune effects of vitamin D require local, immune cell production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D from its immediate precursor, 25(OH)D, which circulates in blood <xref rid="pone.0109998-Hewison1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Jeffery1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among the general population <xref rid="pone.0109998-Looker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and is prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The concentration of 25(OH)D is the main clinical indicator of vitamin D status and is used to define vitamin D deficiency. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), there is an elevation in the risk of experiencing adverse health consequences of vitamin D deficiency at 25(OH)D levels &#x0003c;20 ng/mL <xref rid="pone.0109998-Pramyothin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Over 80% of HD patients have serum 25(OH)D concentrations within the insufficient/deficient range despite ongoing treatment with activated vitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] for prevention of uremic bone disease <xref rid="pone.0109998-Sawinski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Jean1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. While there have been uncontrolled studies of nutritional vitamin D (D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub>) supplementation in HD patients and one short-term (3 week) randomized, controlled trial of D<sub>3</sub> supplementation <xref rid="pone.0109998-Jean1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109998-Saab1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the safety, efficacy, and <italic>immunological</italic> impact of nutritional vitamin D repletion in HD patients, particularly in patients already receiving 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, has not been tested in controlled studies.</p><p>Observational studies of kidney transplant recipients show an association between 25(OH)D deficiency and inferior graft outcomes <xref rid="pone.0109998-Bienaim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our previously published data show a strong correlation between 25(OH)D deficiency and elevated memory T-cell alloimmunity in dialysis patients, many of whom are on the transplant waiting list, independent of known sensitizing events <xref rid="pone.0109998-Sawinski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We hypothesized that inadequate concentrations of 25(OH)D contribute to the development of alloreactive memory T-cells by reducing the local synthesis of the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D that is needed to achieve optimal levels in immune cells. To test this hypothesis and to obtain preliminary data for power calculations for a larger multi-center study, we performed a pilot, single-center, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of oral cholecalciferol (D<sub>3</sub>) (versus no supplementation) to assess the impact of increased 25(OH)D on memory T-cell alloimmunity, in patients already receiving 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D as clinically indicated. Our data indicate that D<sub>3</sub> supplementation is safe and effective at correcting vitamin D deficiency in this setting, and may prevent the time-dependent increase of peripheral cellular alloimmunity that occurs in many dialysis patients, establishing a strong rationale for conducting a larger, multi-center RCT to confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical Trial Design</title><p>The protocol for this trial, sample case report form, and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109998.s004">Protocol S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109998.s006">Sample Case Report Form S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109998.s002">CONSORT Checklist S1</xref>.

Randomization was stratified by baseline 25(OH)D (10&#x02013;24 ng/mL and &#x0003c;10 ng/mL). Within each stratum, randomization occurred in permuted 12-subject blocks. Implementation of randomization was performed by a study investigator.</p><p>Those participants randomized to D<sub>3</sub> had a target 25(OH)D concentration of &#x0003e;35 ng/ml.

Those subjects who achieved 25(OH)D concentrations &#x0003e;35 ng/ml were transitioned to 10,000 IU/week. D<sub>3</sub> therapy was directly observed by a study coordinator or investigator. 25(OH)D was measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following randomization in both treatment and control groups, and other clinical information (routine labs, medication dosage) was collected at the same time-points.</p><p>The primary outcome was change in 25(OH)D at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

Because we were unsure of how patients would respond to D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, randomization was performed in a 2&#x02236;1 ratio to ensure an adequate number of patients had an increase in 25(OH)D levels over time, leading us to target an enrollment of 60 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in the control group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 (Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). All analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis. There was no group cross-over, but, only patients reaching the 1-year time point were included in the 1-year data analysis in order to minimize the effect of missing data from patients lost to follow-up in the interim. Data are reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations for continuous variables, as appropriate, and as percentages of total for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics of the groups were compared using parametric (student&#x02019;s t-test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) tests for continuous variables, as appropriate, and Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests for categorical variables, as appropriate. Changes over time were compared between groups using parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) tests, as appropriate. A two-tailed p-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Oral D<sub>3</sub> supplementation is safe and effective</title><p>Of 116 chronic hemodialysis patients screened, 99 (85.3%) had 25(OH)D concentrations &#x0003c;25 ng/mL and qualified for randomization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109998-g001">

Although the comparison of &#x0201c;delta&#x0201d; PRT (1 year &#x02013; baseline) in the treatment vs control group did not reach statistical significance, (delta PRT in treatment group: 104.8+/&#x02212;330.8 vs 252.9+/&#x02212;431.3 in control group, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25), this pilot study provides important data on standard deviation and effect size that can be used to design and power a larger clinical trial. If confirmed in a larger RCT, this would be the first demonstration of a potentially clinically relevant effect of nutritional vitamin D supplementation (D<sub>3</sub>) that could impact standard of practice. These data expand upon our prior cross-sectional observations <xref rid="pone.0109998-Sawinski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and suggest that vitamin D supplements may prevent the induction of environmentally driven, heterologous (cross-reactive) cellular alloimmunity. The results support the therapeutic use of nutritional vitamin D (D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub>) in all hemodialysis patients, especially those on the transplant waiting list who may benefit from vitamin D&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on alloimmunity. We demonstrated potential effects of D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on cellular alloresponses in just one year; as most HD patients on the deceased-donor waiting list wait from 2&#x02013;7 years for a transplant, and the risk for developing cross-reactive anti-donor T-cell immunity increases with longer HD vintage <xref rid="pone.0109998-Augustine1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on heterologous immunity over time may be even greater, and needs to be evaluated in larger prospective multi-center longitudinal studies.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence in the literature that deficiency of 25(OH)D (despite exogenous 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D therapy) reduces local immune cell production of active vitamin D, and thereby promotes inflammation <xref rid="pone.0109998-Jeffery1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Hewison2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. While hemodialysis patients are commonly treated with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D analogs for the prevention of renal osteodystrophy, there are currently no recommendations for the regular surveillance or repletion of the precursor, 25(OH)D, and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this population is high <xref rid="pone.0109998-Jean1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Vitamin D has been reported to inhibit dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and maturation and impair DC antigen presentation to attenuate the alloreactive T-cell response <xref rid="pone.0109998-Piemonti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Penna1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, we noted fewer proinflammatory monocytes in the treatment arm over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109998-t004">
<bold>Table 4</bold>
</xref>), suggestive of an inhibitory effect on APCs, but the difference in this change between treatment and control groups was not statistically significant. Vitamin D has also been reported to promote Th2 immunity while limiting Th1 responses and to inhibit antigen-induced T-cell activation <xref rid="pone.0109998-Boonstra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Bhalla1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which could prevent induction of cross-reactive alloimmunity. We acknowledge that results from this limited RCT do not reveal the mechanisms that underlie our findings; however, they suggest that vitamin D supplementation impacts alloreactive memory formation through a process that is likely to involve local production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and provide a foundation for future detailed mechanistic studies by our group and others.</p><p>Observational studies in the kidney transplant population show an association between 25(OH)D deficiency and inferior graft outcomes <xref rid="pone.0109998-Bienaim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109998-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, a functional polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (<italic>FokI</italic>, rs10735810) leading to increased transcriptional activity has been shown to correlate with improved renal allograft survival <xref rid="pone.0109998-Lavin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Results of our immunological studies are consistent with these clinical observations, and highlight the need for prospective trials of vitamin D therapy in kidney transplant candidates and recipients with a focus on graft and patient outcomes, possibly stratifying by polymorphisms in the VDR and other genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and function.</p><p>Significant limitations of our study include the un-blinded nature and lack of a placebo control, thus introducing the possibility of study subject and investigator bias. However, all laboratory-based assays were performed by technicians unaware of study subject treatment assignment in an effort to minimize investigator bias. Because patients were aware of group assignment, we cannot exclude the possibility that some patients assigned to the control group obtained vitamin D supplements elsewhere. However, as 25(OH)D concentrations remained stable over time in the control group, it is unlikely that these patients were taking clinically significant doses of any vitamin D supplements.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this pilot RCT show that nutritional vitamin D (D<sub>3</sub>) supplementation is safe and effective in vitamin D-deficient HD patients concurrently treated with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and may prevent time-dependent increases in memory T-cell alloreactivity. Because memory T-cell alloreactivity pre-transplantation negatively affects post-transplant outcomes, and because vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher rates of acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients <xref rid="pone.0109998-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, treatment with vitamin D has the potential to improve kidney transplant outcomes and needs to be evaluated prospectively in transplant candidates/recipients. Given the apparent safety and low cost of vitamin D supplements, routine screening and correction of 25(OH)D deficiency should be considered in all dialysis units, with monitoring and reporting of the risks and benefits observed in a larger population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109998.s001"><label>Adverse Events Table S1</label><caption><p>
