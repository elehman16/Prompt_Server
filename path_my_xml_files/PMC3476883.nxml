Moreover, increased short- and long-term ischemic event occurrences have been observed in diabetes patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor has been the mainstay to prevent ischemic events among T2DM patients undergoing PCI. However, the antiplatelet and clinical responses to clopidogrel in PCI-treated patients can be influenced by several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene encoding cytochrome P450 (<italic>CYP2C19*2/*3</italic>, <italic>CYP3A5*3</italic>) and the ATP-binding cassette gene B1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Cilostazol is a dual-inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) and adenosine reuptake in endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells, and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These pleiotropic effects, in addition to platelet inhibition, may affect the occurrence of atherothrombosis in cilostazol-treated patients. The pharmacodynamic and clinical benefit of cilostazol is more prominent in high-risk settings, particularly in diabetes patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Cilostazol maintains intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels, which are markedly abnormal in diabetes patients, making them more susceptible to cilostazol effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, cilostazol metabolism also shows the substantial interindividual variability via <italic>CYP3A5</italic> and <italic>CYP2C19</italic> polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The current analysis evaluated the antiplatelet effect of adding cilostazol (TRIPLE) or double-dose clopidogrel (150 mg/d) (DOUBLE) compared with standard-dose clopidogrel in high-risk T2DM patients undergoing PCI. We also assessed the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms on the effect of these regimens.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This ACCEL-DM (Adjunctive Cilostazol versus double-dose ClopidogrEL in Diabetes Mellitus) study was a subanalysis of T2DM Korean patients who were recruited from prospective, randomized, platelet-function studies. T2DM was defined according to the criteria of American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The local ethics committee approved the study protocol, and signed informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients receiving elective PCI received a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose at least 12 h before PCI or were receiving chronic clopidogrel therapy (75 mg/d &#x02265;5 days). Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients being treated with emergency PCI received a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose, followed by clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for at least 5 days before randomization. After randomization, the TRIPLE group received cilostazol (100 mg b.i.d.), clopidogrel (75 mg/d), and aspirin (200 mg/d) for 30 days. The DOUBLE group received clopidogrel (150 mg/d) and aspirin (200 mg/d) for 30 days.</p><p>Blood samples for platelet function were collected immediately before elective PCI or at least 5 days later after emergency PCI, and 2&#x02013;6 h after the last dose at the 30-day follow-up. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA) were used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Platelet aggregation (PA) values (maximal and 5-min final) induced by ADP (5 and 20 &#x003bc;mol/L) or collagen (6 &#x003bc;g/mL) were determined using an AggRAM aggregometer (Helena Laboratories Corp., Beaumont, Texas). Absolute changes in PA (&#x00394;PA) were defined as changes of values between baseline and 30-day follow-up: &#x00394;PA = baseline PA &#x02212; 30-day PA.</p><p><italic>CYP2C19</italic> genotyping used the ABI SNaPshot reaction. Genotyping for <italic>CYP3A5*3</italic> and <italic>ABCB1 C3435T</italic> was performed using the TaqMan method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</p><p>The primary end point was the absolute change in maximal PA induced by 20 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP (&#x00394;MPA<sub>20ADP</sub>). High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) was defined as 5 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP-induced maximal PA &#x0003e;46% (LTA) or P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) &#x0003e;235 (VerifyNow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on an earlier observed difference in 20 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP-induced maximal PA after adding cilostazol or doubling of the clopidogrel dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). At least 38 patients in each group were needed to detect an absolute difference in 20 &#x003bc;mol/L ADP-induced maximal aggregation of 15% with a power of 90%, a two-sided &#x003b1; = 0.05, and a SD of 0.2.</p><p>Continuous variables were compared using the Student <italic>t</italic> test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, or one-way ANOVA; categoric variables were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or the Fisher exact test. To evaluate the effect of covariates on &#x00394;MPA<sub>20ADP</sub>, a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed including variables showing <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.2 in univariate analysis.

This study demonstrated that the antiplatelet effect of adding cilostazol is not influenced by genetic variations and demographic characteristics and that the double-dose clopidogrel effect is significantly influenced by the <italic>CYP2C19 LoF</italic> variant, which is in line with the recent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A recent study suggested that tripling the maintenance dose of clopidogrel (225 mg/d) in the <italic>CYP2C19*2</italic> heterozygotes achieved levels of platelet reactivity similar to the standard 75-mg dose in noncarriers, but the maintenance dose (300 mg/d) did not result in comparable platelet inhibition among the <italic>CYP2C19*2</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the addition of cilostazol might reduce long-term mortality by 31% over control in PCI-treated patients, without the increase of bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Despite the same HPR during clopidogrel therapy, the linked magnitude of HPR to post-PCI ischemic events appeared greater in the diabetic cohort compared with the nondiabetic cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Diabetes itself increases the activity of inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation activity, which can increase the influence of platelet reactivity on clot formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The inhibitory effect of cilostazol on PDE3, together with its effect on signaling through adenosine, prostaglandin, and nitric oxide on platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and inflammation cascades are likely to contribute to its overall clinical benefits in diabetes patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, the antiplatelet effect of adding cilostazol appears not to be influenced by the <italic>CYP2C19</italic> genotype. Taken together, adding cilostazol may be a safe and commendable antiplatelet regimen to reduce PCI-related clinical events. However, this concept, which is based on several transitional research projects, needs to be validated by large-scale future clinical trials.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, this study was a subgroup analysis with a relatively small number of patients. Because the genetic effect in response to treatments was evaluated with exploratory purposes, this analysis should be conceived as a &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; investigation. Second, this study was performed using candidate gene analysis, and other unknown genetic variants may be relevant in cilostazol and clopidogrel responses. Finally, this study may have overestimated the antiplatelet effect of each treatment because platelet reactivity after PCI can vary over time. However, the observed change between baseline and the 30-day follow-up was 73 PRU in the DOUBLE group, which was similar with &#x0223c;80 PRU result observed from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. nos.
