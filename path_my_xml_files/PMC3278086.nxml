A healthy diet, low in saturated fat and high in fiber, is a popular medical recommendation in preventing CVD.</p><p>One approach to increase motivation to change is to improve awareness of the risk associated with an unhealthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. Risk analogies such as Heart-Age (HA) combine aspects of absolute and relative CVD risk and have been found effective in communicating future CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. In a recent study, those at higher actual CVD risk who received a HA risk analogy were more aware of their future CVD risk than were those exposed to a percentage CVD risk score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although many people report having good intentions to eat more healthily, these are not always translated into action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]. Action plans, also known as implementation intentions, are strategies that can bridge the gap between intention and behavior. A meta-analysis of 94 studies showed that implementation intentions had a medium to large effect on goal achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. Fear appeals may also facilitate change when they are combined with specific instructions on what action to take [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]. While earlier studies explored the value of using action plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>], more recently there has been a greater interest in the characteristics and mechanisms underlying effective plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], such as the creation of a strong cue&#x02013;response relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>].</p><p>Research has also investigated the impact of self-efficacy on behavior change. According to the health action process approach model, <italic>action</italic> self-efficacy acts on the motivational part of decision making, whereas <italic>maintenance</italic> self-efficacy acts on the volitional part of the behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. While some studies report higher self-efficacy in participants making an implementation intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>], others find no difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>].</p><p>Implementation intention research to date has been largely offline (paper and pencil) with little focus and mixed results when their effectiveness has been tested online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. In a study conducted in an occupational setting, use of online implementation intentions backfired, such that participants who did not form an implementation intention exercised significantly more than participants who formed an implementation intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. In an online dietary intervention, implementation intentions were combined with a text message reminder service leading to a reduction in perceived saturated fat intake and portion sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. The present study is one of a few studies designed to act on both the motivational and volitional phase of behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]. We offered a risk communication message to create more appropriate risk perceptions and to increase intention to change, and then helped individuals change their dietary behavior by forming specific plans on how to achieve this. This is also one of the few studies that compared the independent and combined short-term effects of an online health risk communication message and an online implementation intention tool on the promotion of healthy eating in an obese population, who are more likely to be at risk of developing CVD.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary aim of this investigatory study was to test whether participants could form plans via a fully automated Web-based planning tool (PT) and to assess the short-term effects of combining a CVD risk message (Heart-Age, HA) with the planning tool (HA+PT) on participants&#x02019; saturated fat intake, measured by a 2-item scale (TIS) and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) over a period of 3 weeks. A secondary aim was to assess the effects of the heart-age risk message and planning tool on participants&#x02019; risk perceptions, self-efficacy, intentions to change saturated fat intake, and intentions to test cholesterol and blood pressure levels. We expected that the heart-age message would primarily change risk perceptions and participants&#x02019; intentions to change, while the planning tool would act primarily on self-efficacy and behavior. We wanted to explore whether participants could form Web-based plans and whether the combined HA+PT intervention would have a greater impact than either the heart-age message or the planning tool alone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We invited 1187 participants through an online recruitment agency to log in to an open access website to take part in the study. The self-report eligibility criteria included age (30&#x02013;60 years), obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#x02265;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), not having a diagnosis of a heart condition or cancer or being pregnant, and being computer savvy. We chose obese participants because they were likely to benefit from heart-health information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]. To help minimize any imbalance effects created by smokers receiving a higher heart-age score, a UK-representative sample of smokers was distributed across the four conditions of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and Procedures</title><p>This study was conducted between the middle of January and the end of February 2009 and has been registered retrospectively. It was a Web-based, randomized, between-groups study designed to assess the difference in saturated fat intake between four experimental conditions. No participant&#x02013;experimenter contact was present. Participants were given online instructions and completed each week&#x02019;s session from the convenience of their home computer. At week 1 (recruitment), participants were recruited by an online agency, signed an online consent form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>], and completed an online questionnaire on their current saturated fat intake, risk perceptions, self-efficacy, and intentions to change their dietary intake. They also received educational information on the importance of a healthy diet low in saturated fat (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>).</p><p>At week 2 (intervention), those participants who returned to the website were randomly allocated, using a computer-generated list of random numbers, into one of four conditions: (1) control group (CG), (2) PT condition, (3) HA risk message condition, and (4) HA+PT condition. Allocation of the participants in the four conditions was also stratified to balance by age group (30&#x02013;45 years or 46&#x02013;60 years) and gender. In the groups that received the HA risk message, participants filled out online information on their age, gender, weight, height, prescribed blood pressure medication, family history of heart and vascular disease, smoking status, self-prevalent diabetes, self-reported total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and systolic blood pressure. They then received feedback on their future CVD risk in the form of the HA risk message. Participants in the PT condition were asked to identify a list of situations in which they would like to change their saturated fat intake and match these situations with a list of behaviors. Participants in all conditions were asked to fill out a shorter version of the questionnaire asked at baseline. At week 2, participants completed the session once and were not able to revisit the website to make any changes (eg, to create more plans).</p><p>At week 5 (follow-up), participants were asked to complete a follow-up assessment. They received &#x000a3;15 on study completion and were entered in a prize draw for vouchers (&#x000a3;200).</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>The Heart-Age Risk Message Condition</title><p>Heart-age, which is described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>], is the age corresponding to someone of the same gender with the same CVD risk level but with normal risk factors. The definition of normal is based on the following profile: not smoking, not diabetic, systolic blood pressure 125 mmHg (midpoint of normal range: 120&#x02013;130 mmHg), total serum cholesterol 180 mg/dL (4.66 mmol/L; between normal range of 160&#x02013;200 mg/dL or 4.14&#x02013;5.18 mmol/L), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 45 mg/dL (1.17 mmol/L). For example, a 61-year-old man who smokes and has no other risk factors has a 10-year CVD risk of 10% and the HA of a 73-year-old man. In the HA condition, users filled in an online questionnaire and received feedback in form of the HA risk message (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Heart-Age risk message.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i4e100_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>The Planning Tool Condition</title><p>Participants who received the PT selected from a list of 13 situations, in which they were tempted to eat unhealthily and then chose an approach to change their behavior from a list of 13 solutions. For every situation&#x02013;solution pair chosen, a line was drawn visually linking the two together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]. Participants were asked to complete at least 3 situation&#x02013;solution pairs.</p><p>The solutions were based on constructs from the processes of change model (eg, counterconditioning, stimulus control, and helpful relationships) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]. Some nutritionally based behaviors were also included from an accredited site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] after review by an expert nutritionist. The list of situations consisted of both situational cues (eg, having lunch) focusing on the &#x0201c;when and where&#x0201d; and motivational cues (eg, feeling bored) linked to the reasons (&#x0201c;why&#x0201d;) for performing a specific behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]. Motivational cues were divided into three main situations: (1) experiencing positive affect, (2) experiencing negative affect, and (3) being faced with cravings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]. The situations were translated into &#x0201c;if&#x0201d; statements (eg, &#x0201c;If I&#x02019;m having breakfast&#x0201d;) and the list of solutions was translated into &#x0201c;then&#x0201d; statements (eg, &#x0201c;then I will tell myself I can eat healthily&#x0201d;). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref> shows the PT.</p><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The planning tool.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i4e100_fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Control Group Condition</title><p>Participants in the CG received educational information on the importance of a healthy diet low in saturated at week 1 and filled out the same online questionnaires as the rest of the experimental conditions at all study weeks. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>
<italic>Saturated fat intake,</italic> as the primary outcome measure, was assessed at baseline and follow-up by two measures. First, a self-report index of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] was used to record the frequency of consumption of 63 common foods. This FFQ has good test&#x02013;retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .62, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] and validity when compared with 10-day weighed records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]. Second, a two item scale (TIS) (<italic>r</italic> = .78, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) was adapted from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]. Participants were asked to report their agreement in consumption of low saturated fat foods (&#x0201c;I have eaten foods low in saturated fat...&#x0201d;) followed by frequency in consumption of these foods (&#x0201c;How often did you eat foods low in saturated fat?&#x0201d;). The correlation between the two measures was &#x02013;0.320 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) at week 1 and &#x02013;0.291 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) at week 5. Negative correlations are due to reverse scales used for the self-perceived items.</p><p>
<italic>CVD risk perceptions</italic> measured participants&#x02019; perceived risk in an absolute sense and comparative with their age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. The first item (Q1) examined perceptions of individual CVD risk (&#x0201c;I think that my chances of getting heart disease in the short term are...&#x0201d;). The second item (Q2) compared participants&#x02019; risk perceptions against those of other people of their age (&#x0201c;Compared to an average person of my age and sex, my chances of getting heart disease are...&#x0201d;). Responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale at weeks 1 and 2.</p><p>
<italic>Intention</italic> to reduce saturated fat intake was measured at weeks 1, 2, and 5 on a 7-point Likert scale via 10 items, which were highly intercorrelated (Cronbach alpha = .92), so were analyzed as a composite score. At follow-up, there were two further questions on participants&#x02019; intentions to assess their cholesterol and blood pressure over the next month.</p><p>
<italic>Action and maintenance self-efficacy</italic> were modified from previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]. Action self-efficacy (alpha = .84), which was measured at all study times, consisted of 4 items focusing on confidence to overcome obstacles. Maintenance self-efficacy (alpha = .89), assessed only at follow-up, consisted of 11 items exploring confidence in sustaining change in the face of difficulties. Items were measured on a 4-point scale (not at all, barely true, mostly true, exactly true).</p><p>
<italic>Planning and outcome expectancies</italic> items were adapted from previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] and measured on a 4-point scale. Planning comprised 2 items: &#x0201c;I have my own plan regarding (1) when, (2) how to reduce my saturated fat intake.&#x0201d; Outcome expectancies consisted of 11 items linked to the positive and negative expectancies of reducing saturated fat intake (eg, &#x0201c;If I reduce my saturated fat intake&#x0201d;... &#x0201c;food won&#x02019;t taste as good,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;I will feel good&#x0201d;).</p><p>
<italic>Feedback on the intervention</italic> was assessed at week 2 and at follow-up on a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Participants were asked to rate the intervention in terms of its emotional impact, personal relevance, interest, trustworthiness, credibility, and enjoyment. All items were adapted from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Considerations</title><p>Analysis of the outcome measures was restricted to those respondents who completed the follow-up assessments. Response to the CVD risk perceptions was analyzed using a generalized linear model with a cumulative logistic link function and multinomial distribution. Baseline scores and heart risk-adjusted age were included as covariates. As with all the analyses other potential covariates (eg, smoking, BMI, social economic status) were retained if significant in the model. Similar models were used for the intention-to-change and intention-to-test questions, and self-efficacy, planning, and feedback items, but omitting the heart risk-adjusted age covariate.</p><p>Mean change in self-perceived saturated fat intake within a group was assessed using analysis of variance with baseline included as a covariate. The groups were compared using another generalized linear model with a cumulative logistic link function and multinomial distribution. Data from the index of food was summarized to yield the total calorie intake per participant and the percentage of total energy intake contributed by saturated fat. We analyzed all of these data using analysis of variance models with baseline covariates always included and any other significant covariates retained. All analysis was carried out using version 9.1.3 of SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Local Research Ethical Review Requirement</title><p>The study protocol (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>) was approved by an independent research ethics committee (Colworth Research Ethics Committee) in the South of England on December 4, 2008 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>).

The planning tool boosted self-efficacy and intention and reduced perceived saturated fat intake for one of the measures (TIS) but not the other (FFQ). A CVD risk message improved people&#x02019;s awareness of their risk relative to their age. Contrary to our expectations, combining a CVD risk message with the planning tool did not lead to bigger reductions in saturated fat intake than when they were presented on their own.</p><p>In line with theories of behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>], the planning tool was better than the control group at increasing self-perceived consumption of low saturated fat foods (TIS). The same finding was not true for our second measure of saturated fat intake (FFQ). Also, participants in all conditions reported a change in percentage saturated fat intake measured by the FFQ, whereas participants in all conditions apart from the control group reported a change in their TIS score. Similar findings in terms of discrepancies between the FFQ and self-perceived items have been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]. This implies that the two self-perceived saturated fat intake items were better able than the FFQ measure to differentiate between the conditions. However, both come with limitations, which we discuss in the next section.</p><p>In line with our hypothesis, the planning tool was also better than the control group at boosting participants&#x02019; intentions to reduce saturated fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and action self-efficacy in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]. However, maintenance self-efficacy did not differ between the conditions at follow-up. This might be because participants who formed plans and encountered difficulties needed further support (eg, coping plans) to maintain their healthy eating. A previous study found that action plans are more effective at the early stages of change, while coping plans are instrumental at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>].</p><p>In support of previous studies, receiving the heart-age risk message led to more appropriate risk perceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>], linked to participants&#x02019; risk relative to their age group. Presentation of risk information also increased women&#x02019;s intentions to test their cholesterol. The latter finding is important because people who are aware of their cholesterol levels can receive more precise risk estimates.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, combining the heart-age risk message with the planning tool (HA+PT) did not lead to a bigger reduction in saturated fat intake. A mismatch might have been created between the global CVD risk message and the specific target plan, confusing smokers with a high heart-age, who saw smoking cessation as the primary route to better health rather than diet. Alternatively, cognitive overload might have confounded the impact of HA+PT on saturated fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>]. The length of time spent interacting online may also have been a factor, with the HA+PT taking the longest (12.47 minutes vs 10.91 for HA and 7.84 for PT). Future research could explore whether there is a benefit from reducing cognitive load through the use of a delay between presenting risk information and forming plans.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations, Advantages, and Future Studies</title><p>The impact of conditions on our two measures of saturated fat intake changes was inconsistent, and this could be due to the limitations present in the FFQ and the TIS. Underreporting of food consumption is a recurrent challenge for FFQs and is most pronounced among overweight and obese people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>]. Also, FFQs were initially designed to estimate individual intake relative to a population rather than to detect small changes in individual dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>], for which they might not be sufficiently sensitive. The present FFQ did not account for individual variation in portion sizes but instead assumed the average portion of the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>], which might differ from portions consumed by our obese participants.</p><p>On the other hand, self-perceived items like the TIS have been designed to detect differences between conditions in experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>]. However, some have claimed that reported changes are influenced by demand characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>], with participants in more active conditions being more aware of study aims and so responding differently. Two previous studies counter the argument of demand characteristics by showing no difference between conditions for awareness of the study&#x02019;s hypothesis or feelings of obligation to comply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. Further research is needed to improve our ability to measure change in dietary intake (eg, through more objective measures).</p><p>To our knowledge, our planning tool is the first fully automated system to test online if&#x02013;then plans in the format of an interactive volitional help sheet. An advantage of our approach was that participants could choose more personally relevant situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] from the list, promoting a sense of autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>]. However, a disadvantage is that the list did not include highly idiosyncratic situations that a participant might have entered through a free-text entry approach. Future studies could evaluate the relative impact of guiding participants to appropriate cues versus giving them complete autonomy.</p><p>As this was the first evaluation of a fully automated PT, we used a completers, per-protocol analysis, which, although limiting interpretation of the application of our results, allowed us to focus on the impact of the tool when used appropriately. Further research is needed to test the effectiveness of an implementation intention-based automated PT at a population level (via intention-to-treat analysis) over longer periods of time and to evaluate the impact of reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>].</p><p>Another advantage of the current study was that we assessed risk perceptions at two time points, giving us the opportunity to measure change in risk perceptions. Also, whereas previous research has used fictitious illnesses and hypothetical scenarios to communicate risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>], our study risk corresponded to participants&#x02019; personal characteristics, making it more relevant. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to combine implementation intentions with personally relevant health risk information through a Web-based medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Web-based tools provide a good opportunity to present risk information and plan behavior change. In the present study, the HA risk message helped improve obese people&#x02019;s awareness of risk relative to their age, and the PT reduced levels of perceived saturated fat intake. Future research is required to identify ways of matching motivational and volitional strategies to change behavior.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Andrew Hinton and Steve Baker from Tessella PLC had full access to all of the data and take responsibility for the integrity of the data.
