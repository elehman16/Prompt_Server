<italic>Objective</italic>. Evaluation of the efficacy of Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste in &#x0201c;clearing internal heat.&#x0201d; <italic>Methods</italic>. This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled parallel design clinical test of a product that was already on the market. 72 subjects were randomly assigned to control group (group A with Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste) or treatment group (group B with Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste) with ratio of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2. Subjects were instructed to brush with 1g toothpaste for 2 minutes each time, 2 times per day in a 4-aweek test period; measurement with the rating scale on the efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for the herbal toothpaste was done at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks of toothpaste usage. <italic>Results</italic>. The rating scale on efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for the herbal toothpaste reveals that the primitive points of 72-case intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 67-case per-protocol (PP) analysis for subjects in group A and subjects in group B were found to be reduced progressively with statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The overall effective rates for group A and group B were, respectively, 62.50%, 56.25% (ITT) and 62.50%, 60.64% (PP). The statistical results indicated that the symptoms of fire-heat for both groups of subjects have been improved after application of toothpaste. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. The efficacy of Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste in &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; was confirmed by the trial as compared to Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste. And its efficacy was objectively evaluated by the rating scale on efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat.&#x0201d;</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>With the quickened pace of life and increased pressure of work for nowadays people, oral diseases such as toothache, sore, or bleeding gums occur very commonly. Most of these symptoms were considered &#x0201c;excessive internal heat&#x0201d; by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Meanwhile, as one of the daily necessities of oral cleaning agents, many types of herbal toothpaste claim to have the efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat.&#x0201d; When consumers select toothpastes, their decisions were not only based on cleaning factors, but also on considerations for dental care and prevention of oral diseases. Because of cultural and geographical factors, herbal toothpastes with efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; were estimated to have enormous market opportunities in China. Currently, there were a few reports [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on the efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; by TCM for oral diseases, and effectiveness of herbal toothpastes has been found. </p><p>Traditional Chinese medical science paid extra attention to dental hygiene and prevention and treatment of diseases at early time. Totally eight categories were documented in the sections that involve oral diseases in Prescriptions for Universal Relief in Ming Dynasty (early at 15 centuries BC) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and ancient TCM doctors had already accumulated very abundant experiences in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases. </p><p>Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste, containing the essence scientifically extracted from the natural herbs of honeysuckle and mint with function of anti-inflammation and sterilization as well as heat-clearing and detoxication, is a kind of toothpaste of TCM exclusively manufactured by P&#x00026;G Technology Co., Ltd, which has been identified to effectively remove bacteria in the mouth and freshen breath to prevent gum disease, therefore, keeping overall health for teeth and gums.</p><p>The purpose of this clinical trial was to scientifically evaluate the efficacy of Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste, using our reported rating scale (the 3rd edition) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with good reliability and validity on efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for the herbal toothpaste developed in prophase. The selected positive control toothpaste was Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste with effect of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat,&#x0201d; containing herbal essence, of which the main ingredients were honeysuckle and mint for tingly fresh breath and all day protection, soothing oral ailments like toothaches, mouth ulcers, and inflamed gums. The control product has been in the China market for a long time with the following claim: reducing internal heat. We therefore chose them as a comparison to the Crest brand.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Data and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Demographic Data</title><p>All subjects were recruited by the Research Institute of Crest Oral Care, Beijing P&#x00026;G Technology Co., Ltd., and the trial period was from August 26, 2009 to September 23, 2009. 72 subjects were randomly divided by ratio of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2 into control group with 24 subjects (group A) and test group with 48 subjects (group B). As it was the first time to evaluate the &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; efficacy of Crest herbal product, more data were needed to get a clear understanding relative to the control product, so 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2 ratio recruiting was used in this study.</p><p>72 subjects were typical permanent residents in Beijing, among whom were 16 of males and 56 of females, aged between 19 and 55, with average age of 28, and randomly divided into two groups with the ratio of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2, and toothpaste A or toothpaste B was provided, respectively, where 24 subjects were arranged in group A and 48 subjects in group B. After unblinding, it was found that Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste was provided for group A, while Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste was for group B. The period of using the toothpaste was 4 weeks, collecting data of oral cavity and related symptoms of oral conditions for subjects after the end of the second week and the fourth week. </p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Diagnostic Criteria and Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><sec id="sec2.2.1"><title>2.2.1. Diagnostic Criteria</title><p>Diagnostic criteria for oral diseases of &#x0201c;syndrome of fire-heat&#x0201d; by TCM were formulated as referred to by Diagnostics of TCM edited by Chen and Wilson [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Medical history: causative factors such as excessive spicy diet, tiredness, or excessive smoking and alcoholic drinking were found.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Symptoms: they are recurrent attacks of toothache, swelling and aching of gum, gingival bleeding, oral ulcers, halitosis, bitter taste of mouth and dry pharynx, and so forth, often accompanied by sore throat, hydrodipsia, constipation, and yellow urine. </p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis: the patient has swelling and aching of gum, halitosis, red tongue, yellow coat, and red throat.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The above mentioned seven symptoms include toothache, swelling and aching of gum, gingival bleeding, aphthous stomatitis, halitosis, bitter taste of mouth, and dry pharynx; if the patients were with one of three (with three) or more they can be diagnosed as having &#x0201c;syndrome of fire-heat.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.2"><title>2.2.2. Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Inclusion Criteria encompass those who met the diagnostic criteria for oral diseases of &#x0201c;syndrome of fire-heat&#x0201d; by TCM; those who had no serious organic and mental diseases; those whose course of disease was within a month; those whose ages ranged from 18 to 55; those who had signed informed consent form (ICF). </p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.3"><title>2.2.3. Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The following subjects were excluded from this study: younger than 18 or older than 55; being pregnant or breast-feeding; being allergic to this toothpaste; used other brands of toothpastes for treatment; those who had complications from other diseases in cardiovascular system, cerebrovascular system, and hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic system as well as psychiatric patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Clinic Trial Design</title><p>We adopted a randomized, double-blind, single-center, and parallel control with positive toothpaste design for this study.</p><p>PROCPLAN procedure statement of SAS was used to design randomization of the trial. Statistical Analysis System (SAS) was software developed by North Carolina State University in 1966, with complete data access, data management, data analysis, and data presentation features. SAS was often used in the pharmaceutical industry for a variety of experimental studies, which could be done with simple programming. PROCPLAN procedure statement; of SAS was used to give a statement of randomized design. In this study, we gave a number of seeds randomly, and inputted statements meet the condition of this trail in the PROCPLAN procedure statement, then SAS outputted the therapeutic assignment corresponding to serial numbers from 01 to 72, which was, the randomized arrangement of treatments received by 72 subjects.</p><p>The requirement and design of blinding: verification toothpastes were packaged and provided by sponsor according to the randomization allocation table. The design of two-grade blind method was adopted, of which the first grade was the two treatments (group A or B randomly assigned) corresponding to each serial number from 01 to 72, while the second grade was the group (control group, treatment group) corresponding to A or B treatment. The allocation concealment of both grades was separately sealed up in duplicate for each, stored at the office of study site in the head organization and the sponsor. Two-grade unblinding was performed after cases collection. First of all, we clarified the code of two treatment groups corresponding to each serial number to perform statistical analysis and then identified the code of group (control group, treatment group) corresponding to each treatment group after completion of statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

The formation of oral fire-heat symptom is related to the factors such as excessive spicy diet, tiredness, or excessive smoking and alcoholic drinking, as well as long-term depressed emotion leading to fire symptom [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in consideration of the manifestations of oral fire-heat symptom especially in young subjects, it mainly belongs to stomach-fire pattern manifestation such as toothache, swelling and aching of gum, gingival bleeding, oral ulcers, halitosis, bitter taste of mouth, and dry pharynx often accompanied by sore throat, hydrodipsia, constipation and yellow urine, and red tongue with thick yellow coat [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Based on the TCM theory, patients who suffered from oral fire-heat pattern could be easily diagnosed by a TCM doctor according to medical history and symptoms. However, such oral fire-heat pattern was often neglected by the patients, so we have developed a self-report rating scale (the 3rd edition) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (with good reliability and validity) to objectively evaluate oral fire-heat pattern. Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste, containing herbs of honeysuckle and mint with heat-clearing and detoxing, functions can protect teeth and gums. Honeysuckle, Flos Lonicerae, is a medically useful TCM herb, with the function of clearing heat and removing toxicity and of antibacterial activity [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mint, <italic>mentha haplocalyx</italic>, is also commonly used in TCM, with the function of eliminating pathogen, in addition to fresh breath [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Also Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste with the efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; is designated as positive control in the trial. Both herbal toothpastes with exotic herbal ingredients for tingly fresh breath and all day protection contain nature's best herbs which soothe oral ailments like toothaches, mouth ulcers, and inflamed gums. </p><p>Evaluation with the rating scale (the 3rd edition) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] on efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for the herbal toothpaste indicated that no significant difference between Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste and the positive control was found in aspect of improving the accumulated points of oral fire-heat syndrome, for the subjects, level of oral fire-heat syndrome and overall effective rate. Meanwhile, we simultaneously observed the evaluation by the doctor with the symptoms grading scale of fire-heat pattern (SGS-FHP) for the herbal toothpaste, and the results also indicated that no significant difference between Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste and the positive control was found (this will be published in another report). This suggested that Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste has the equal efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d;, while the availability of efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste can be evaluated objectively by the rating scale (the 3rd edition) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] on efficacy of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; for the herbal toothpaste.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms that the Crest Herbal Crystal Toothpaste has the effect of &#x0201c;clearing internal heat&#x0201d; with Colgate Herbal Salty Toothpaste as the on-market control.
