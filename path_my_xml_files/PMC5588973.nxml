In that context, UNICEF and IRD have developed a locally produced, multiple micronutrient fortified lipid-based nutrient supplement. This food is innovative, in that it uses fish instead of milk as the animal source food. Very few supplementary foods have non-milk animal source foods, and in addition they have not been widely tested. This trial will assess the novel food&#x02019;s acceptability to children and caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a cluster-randomised, incomplete block, 4&#x000d7;4&#x02009;crossover design with no blinding. It will take place in four sites in a community setting in periurban Phnom Penh. Healthy children aged 9&#x02013;23 months (n=100) will eat each of four foods for 3&#x02009;days at a time. The amount they consume will be measured, and at the end of each 3-day set, caregivers will assess how well their child liked the food. After 12 days, caregivers themselves will do a sensory test of the 4 foods and will rank them in terms of preference.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical clearance was received from the University of Queensland Medical Research Ethics Committee (2014001070) and from Cambodia&#x02019;s National Ethics Committee for Health Research (03/8 NECHR).</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: LNS-CAMB-INFANTS; NCT02257437.

In 2014, 32% of all children under 5 years (and 40% of children aged 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;years old) were stunted, 10% were wasted and 24% were underweight<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> indicating, respectively, chronic and acute malnutrition, and a combination of the two. This malnutrition may be attributed in large part to poor complementary feeding,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which remains inadequate for achieving optimal growth outcomes and micronutrient status.</p><p>Adequate complementary feeding can reduce and prevent malnutrition.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In Cambodia, the traditional weaning food is <italic>borbor</italic>, white rice porridge with added salt or sugar, which is low in nutrient density. Improvements to complementary feeding may be achieved with supplements, such as micronutrient powders, and supplementary foods. The latter include fortified blended products that are mixed with water to make a porridge (eg, corn-soy blend++ or CSB++, now called Supercereal Plus), biscuits that can be eaten directly (such as BP100) or ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs). RUSFs are usually lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs), which are often pastes such as the peanut-based Plumpy'Nut. Although until fairly recently, prevention of malnutrition has relied on fortified blended products, these new LNSs are proving very effective, both as RUSFs and ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs). Compared with the existing products, LNSs are higher in energy, have a longer shelf life and are convenient since they require no preparation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>
</p><p>Regardless of how effective a product may be, it still needs to be acceptable in a given setting. In other words, children must be willing to eat the product and caregivers must be willing to feed it to them. Acceptability to children can be measured by how much they eat and how readily, while acceptability to caregivers is measured in terms of their sensory perception of the food, that is, of the smell, colour, consistency and taste.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Other important factors affecting acceptability are price and convenience of preparation.</p><p>In Cambodia, various supplements and supplementary or therapeutic foods, including Sprinkles micronutrient powders, CSB++, BP100 and Plumpy'Nut, have been used or trialled. However, they have met with low levels of acceptability and success, either in trial or in practice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Moreover, they are relatively expensive to procure and ship to Cambodia. For these reasons, and due to budget constraints, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in Cambodia phased out CSB++ distribution in 2014. A recent study estimated that only 20% of Cambodian caregivers purchase supplementary foods for their children.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Hence, the Cambodian Ministry of Health sought a locally produced ready-to-use food (both therapeutic and supplementary versions) containing macronutrients and micronutrients that can be adapted for use in Cambodia. It is expected that locally produced products are more likely to be acceptable and cheaper than the imported products. They also have the advantage of contributing money and capacity to the local economy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>In 2009 in Vietnam, UNICEF, the Institut de Recherche pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement (IRD) and the National Institute of Nutrition had developed a supplementary food from local ingredients including rice, soy, mungbeans, sugar, milk powder, oil and multiple micronutrients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12</xref> This product proved acceptable and effective and is now widely used. Drawing on that successful experience, UNICEF and IRD created a Cambodian ready-to-use food (in both supplementary and therapeutic versions) in early 2014, using fish, rice, soy, mungbeans, oil and sugar. Based on promising initial results, the product was finalised as a micronutrient-fortified snack.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives and hypothesis</title><p>This trial aims to establish the acceptability of the locally produced Cambodian RUSF for children under 2&#x02009;years and their caregivers. Its acceptability will be compared with other supplementary foods that are or have been used in Cambodia, namely CSB++ and Sprinkles micronutrient powders.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Design and methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial is a cluster-randomised, incomplete block, 4&#x000d7;4&#x02009;crossover design.

</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Study site</title><p>The study will be conducted in periurban Phnom Penh. This population has been selected because the urban poor comprise about one quarter of the Phnom Penh&#x02019;s residents, or approximately one-quarter of a million people,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> who experience high rates of child underweight and stunting (35.6% and 29.1%,&#x02009;respectively).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Furthermore, the populations are large and dense enough to yield the required sample size.</p><p>The study will be conducted in four test-feeding sites such as pagodas or health centres identified based on convenience. There will be two teams of data collectors working at two test-feeding sites each. In this way, all children at a given site will be eating the same food, which will reduce bias related to social interaction and varied responses to different foods. Children and caregivers will come at the same time each day for the 12 days, which will reduce bias related to feeding times.</p><p>The four test-feeding sites will be randomly allocated to begin on one of the foods as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> below, using an Excel random number table and a randomised incomplete block design.

</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The main outcome of interest is the amount of food the children consume. We define acceptability as mean consumption of at least 50% of the food offered, and high acceptability as consumption of 75% or more, assume an SD of 30% and aim to detect a difference in consumption of 20%.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 17</xref> To ensure a precision of 0.05, power of 0.8 and p&#x0003c;0.05, the required sample size is 20 children. Assuming 20% attrition, we need to enrol 24 children and caregivers. This sample size is the same as a similar acceptability study, and the attrition assumed is similar.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>The sample size was calculated using G*Power (V.3.1.9.2). The four clusters and repeated measures were taken into account in the calculation. The four sites were purposefully chosen to represent urban poor populations and were similar. Since this is effectively a pilot study inasmuch as we have no data on the acceptability of two of four of the foods, we have no knowledge about variability within or between cluster sizes, nor of how baseline covariates would affect the sample size. Thus, baseline covariates were not taken into account in sample size calculation.</p><p>However, with such a small sample size, it may not be possible to perform regressions. Therefore, we will recruit a sample of 100 caregivers and children, which is considered a typical sample size for a hedonic test<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and is larger than most of the samples for similar studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13 17 19 20</xref> Attrition rates in those studies have been less than 10%; therefore, our sample size of 100 should be more than adequate.

The recording will be transcribed and translated into English.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Outcomes and their measurement</title><p>The main outcome of interest is how much the children consume. In the absence of clear guidelines on acceptability for supplementary food, we define acceptability as mean consumption of at least 50% (50 g of the porridges or 16&#x02009;g of the snack) of the food offered in approximately 15&#x02013;30&#x02009;min and consumption of 75% (75 g or 24&#x02009;g, respectively) or more as high acceptability. This is in keeping with similar acceptability studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 17</xref>
</p><p>The secondary outcome is caregivers&#x02019; assessment of their child&#x02019;s preference for the food. It is likely that caregivers&#x02019; assessment of their child&#x02019;s preference is strongly correlated to the child&#x02019;s consumption; thus, this subjective maternal/caregiver assessment is considered an appropriate method of determining acceptability of a food to a child.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

Such products need to be affordable, effective and acceptable.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This locally produced Cambodian RUSF attempts to respond to those needs.</p><p>The comparators chosen, CSB++ and Sprinkles, have been used in Cambodia with limited success. CSB++ proved&#x02009;acceptable in trials but not in practice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 13</xref> Sprinkles appeared to be acceptable and did improve the micronutrient status of Cambodian children in one trial. However, there was no improvement in anthropometric measures, and the improved micronutrient status did not persist beyond the 18-month duration of supplementation.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p><p>Since there is no evidence that micronutrient powders alone contribute to growth,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;31</xref> it was decided that the novel food should contain both macronutrients and micronutrients and be energy dense, in order to promote linear growth and weight gain as well as improved micronutrient status.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 32</xref> Moreover, since peanut-based RUSFs have not proved acceptable in Cambodia,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and because local production standards may not be adequate to safeguard against aflatoxin contamination,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref> peanut-based products will not be used.</p><p>The WHO recommends daily consumption of animal source foods for their high protein, energy and micronutrient availability and for their contribution to micronutrient status, linear growth and non-fat mass gain.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> Usually, milk or whey powder is the animal source food used in supplementary foods including CSB ++ and&#x02009;various RUSF/RUTFs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 17</xref> However, milk powder is expensive and imported. For this food, it was replaced with fish, which is inexpensive, readily available and more adapted to Cambodian tastes. While there are precedents for replacing milk in supplementary foods for cost-effectiveness,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> until now, very few have used meat, fish or eggs, and they have generally not been tested for efficacy on a wide scale.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20 39&#x02013;41</xref> Not surprisingly, given the novelty of the foods, the results of the acceptability studies have concluded that although caregivers prefer their traditional food, the children consumed equal amounts of the supplementary food or liked the supplementary food.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> By comparing a supplementary food with fish and one with milk (CSB++) to Sprinkles with <italic>borbor</italic> (a food traditionally given to infants but also consumed by the wider population), our trial will contribute much-needed data on the food preferences of Cambodian caregivers and children. This will potentially open the way for further development of locally produced supplementary foods with an animal source food other than milk.</p><p>Finally, since most studies on supplementary foods are from Africa, this trial will be an important contribution to the body of evidence from Asia.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>Based on WFP&#x02019;s experience<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and earlier acceptability studies,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 42</xref> it is expected that the locally produced Cambodian RUSF will be more acceptable than CSB++ and Sprinkles. If it does prove acceptable, a 6-month efficacy trial will follow.</p><p>If the novel RUSF proves efficacious in trial, UNICEF hopes to scale up production, with the aim of producing a local product that is cheaper than imported RUSFs. A variety of distribution methods will be considered, including free distribution to malnourished children (and possibly to pregnant women) as well as commercialisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e229" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015958.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e230" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-015958.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BB developed the original research design and refined it with FTW, SM, MG, CC and AL.
