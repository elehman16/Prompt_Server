Elimination of asymptomatic infections requires active treatment approaches, such as mass testing and treatment (MTaT) or mass drug administration (MDA), as infected persons do not seek care for their infection. Evaluations of community-based approaches that are designed to reduce malaria transmission require careful attention to study design to ensure that important effects can be measured accurately. This manuscript describes the study design and methodology of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate a MTaT approach for malaria transmission reduction in an area of high malaria transmission. Ten health facilities in western Kenya were purposively selected for inclusion. The communities within 3&#x000a0;km of each health facility were divided into three clusters of approximately equal population size. Two clusters around each health facility were randomly assigned to the control arm, and one to the intervention arm. Three times per year for 2&#x000a0;years, after the long and short rains, and again before the long rains, teams of community health volunteers visited every household within the intervention arm, tested all consenting individuals with malaria rapid diagnostic tests, and treated all positive individuals with an effective anti-malarial. The effect of mass testing and treatment on malaria transmission was measured through population-based longitudinal cohorts, outpatient visits for clinical malaria, periodic population-based cross-sectional surveys, and entomological indices.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mass test and treat</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Asymptomatic infections</kwd><kwd>Transmission reduction</kwd><kwd>Kenya</kwd><kwd>Study design</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5U01GH000048</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000200</institution-id><institution>United States Agency for International Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GHN-T-00-06-00001-00</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The threefold increase in malaria control and elimination funding over the last decade has resulted in widespread increased coverage of malaria control interventions, including vector control with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), improved case management with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), and intermittent preventive treatment for high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has been postulated that the scale-up, specifically of LLINs, ACT, and IRS, is responsible for the estimated 40% decline in malaria case burden in Africa from the year 2000 to 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Yet, gains have been heterogeneous, and in some endemic areas, despite heavy investments in these interventions, malaria prevalence, morbidity, and mortality remain high. As more countries approach elimination or aim for rapid malaria transmission reduction towards pre-elimination, new tools and strategies are necessary to complement existing ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The search for new tools to reduce malaria transmission towards elimination has led to a renewed focus on targeting the infectious human parasite reservoir, particularly the asymptomatic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In some low transmission settings,&#x000a0;&#x0003e;60% of the infected population is asymptomatic; this proportion typically increases with increasing transmission intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mosquito infection studies have demonstrated that blood meals from persons with asymptomatic infections can result in transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and it has been postulated that in areas of seasonal transmission, the asymptomatic population may sustain transmission through the dry seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, individuals with asymptomatic infections are likely to be infected for longer durations of time, some for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as they are less likely to seek care and be directly impacted by strategies such as improved case management. Strategies that specifically target the asymptomatic population, such as mass test and treat (MTaT) campaigns where all community members are tested for malaria, and all positives are treated, and mass drug administration (MDA) where all community members are treated for malaria without testing, are potential complementary tools for rapid malaria transmission reduction towards elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Research trials and public health programmes implementing MDA to control or eliminate malaria have been conducted for at least a century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The majority of the MDA studies, including the influential Garki Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], have shown a significant decrease in parasite prevalence shortly after MDA rounds, but when the trials were over, and in the absence of ongoing delivery of preventive services, a rebound in infection prevalence was observed, frequently as early as 6&#x000a0;months after trial completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recently published literature review found that only 12 of 182 (6.5%) published reports of MDA resulted in success towards elimination with a definition of zero indigenous cases of malaria in the target population for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;months after the end of all MDA rounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Of note, in many of these MDA trials other key malaria control interventions (high coverage with effective vector control, case management, and surveillance and response including active case detection) were not in place during or after the trials.</p><p>In the era of ACT with long chemoprophylactic half-lives (e.g., dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine) and the potential adjunct of drugs with gametocytocidal (e.g., primaquine) or insecticidal (e.g., ivermectin) activity, there is renewed interest in evaluating time-limited mass treatment strategies to accelerate transmission reduction in the context of high coverage with other malaria control interventions. Robust mathematical models have been created to explore the impact of MDAs and MTaTs on malaria transmission. These models suggest that, in conjunction with high and sustained LLIN coverage and treatment with artemisinin-based combinations, interventions targeting the asymptomatic reservoir, such as MTaT and MDA, help to drive transmission in an area towards elimination; however, results differ based on transmission setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, recently published field studies assessing either modified focal screen and treat strategies, where small discrete geographic areas are identified for screening and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], or mass test and treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in different transmission settings suggest that MTaT may effectively identify the majority of the asymptomatic infected population and reduce malaria transmission. However, a study of MTaT in a low transmission setting in Zanzibar did not reduce malaria incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and more recently, and subsequent to the study described in this manuscript, a World Health Organization expert review group stated that with current diagnostic tests, MTaT could not be recommended for malaria transmission reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, there were concerns that MDA may exert excessive drug pressure that may lead to adverse events in uninfected persons or enhance the development and spread of anti-malarial resistance; there was less concern for these negative outcomes for MTaT strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, with MTaT, there was concern that the sensitivity of available rapid diagnostic tests would be too low to identify a large enough proportion of infected individuals to make a significant impact on malaria transition.</p><p>This manuscript describes and provides a discussion of a study design and methodology to evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness, and costing of a community-based MTaT strategy for malaria in an area of high transmission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The objective of this study was to measure changes in malaria transmission outcomes resulting from community MTaT compared to case management alone in a setting of high coverage with LLINs.

</p><p>Secondary objectives included measuring the acceptability of MTaT to the local community, assessing adherence to anti-malarial regimens, costing of the intervention, and documenting the impact of MTaT on gametocyte prevalence and serologic markers of transmission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study area and population</title><p>The study was performed in Siaya County, western Kenya, within the catchment area of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), containing approximately 220,000 individuals, described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The vast majority of the HDSS population is of the Luo ethnicity, and work as subsistence farmers. Families reside in compounds that consist of the house of the head of the compound, and a house for each of his wives and their children. Three times a year, a household census is conducted in the HDSS area during which household listings are updated, compounds are mapped, and a survey instrument is administered to document household demographics including births, deaths, in-migration, out-migration, and migration from one area within the HDSS to another, termed trans-migration. To supplement information collected during HDSS survey rounds, villagers who work for the HDSS are incentivized to report births and deaths as they occur. The Ministry of Health began training and supporting Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), who themselves are community members, to implement community-based health strategies at the household level in 2013-just prior to the initiation of this study. Their activities include providing malaria-specific testing with RDTs and treatment of positives with ACT to symptomatic individuals in the household. Coverage and capacity of this strategy were low at the onset of this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>KEMRI and CDC Health and Demographic Surveillance System. <bold>a</bold> Location of western Kenya in Kenya. <bold>b</bold> Location of KEMRI and CDC Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in western Kenya. <bold>c</bold> Mass test and treat clusters within KEMRI and CDC HDSS</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2017_1883_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Malaria transmission is high and occurs year-round with two peak transmission seasons in May&#x02013;July and November&#x02013;December, coinciding with the end of the long and short rains, respectively. LLIN distribution campaigns and the roll-out of ACT and RDTs have been supported in this area through the KEMRI and CDC collaboration and with other partners including the Kenya National Malaria Control Programme, the U.S. President&#x02019;s Malaria Initiative, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Since the widespread introduction of insecticide-treated nets into the HDSS area in 1997, malaria prevalence by microscopy has decreased in children aged 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years from&#x000a0;&#x0003e;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to approximately 39% in 2013; <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the predominant malaria parasite species comprising&#x000a0;&#x0003e;95% of all infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The proportion of community members with infections detected by microscopy who did not report a fever in the previous 2&#x000a0;weeks varies by age and is&#x000a0;&#x0003e;90% in many age groups [Desai M, personal communication].</p><p>Since mortality data have been collected in the HDSS using verbal autopsy methods, there has been a threefold reduction in the malaria-specific mortality rate in children&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years from 13.2 per 1000 person-years in 2003 to 3.7 per 1000 person-years in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The number of malaria infective mosquito bites per night dropped from approximately 300 in the early 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to&#x000a0;&#x0003c;20 in 2010, and the vector population temporarily shifted from <italic>Anopheles gambiae s.s.</italic> and <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> to <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> before <italic>An. funestus</italic> re-emerged as the primary vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Household ownership of at least one LLIN, universal coverage (defined as 1 bed net per every two persons per household), and use prior to study initiation were 81, 67, and 57%, respectively [Were V, personal communication]. Indoor residual spraying has not been implemented as a programmatic strategy in Siaya County.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a three-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial. Blinding of study participants or study staff to the intervention was not considered feasible or ethical. Ten of the 61 health facilities within the HDSS in Siaya County were purposively selected based on the following criteria: (1) high absolute malaria caseloads, (2) proximity of the facility to major roads for transport of supplies and samples, (3) government owned and run, and (4) minimum overlap with other known interventional/observational studies in the facility catchment; health facilities were chosen to maximize the distance between them, and all were at least 5&#x000a0;km from the next nearest health facility. All villages whose midpoint was located within 3&#x000a0;km of each health facility were included in the study. The villages surrounding each health facility were divided into three clusters along village boundaries such that the population was approximately evenly divided. One of the three clusters surrounding each health facility was randomly selected for the intervention, and the remaining two served as controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The purpose of the second control cluster was to allow the possible addition of a second intervention in the future. As no additional intervention arm was included in the study, for analysis purposes, the two control clusters were merged so that the study comprised 10 intervention and 10 control clusters with equal sample sizes. To reduce contamination between intervention and control clusters, the sampling frame for evaluations were limited to a core area within each cluster. The core area was defined as an area within the cluster that was&#x000a0;&#x02265;300&#x000a0;m from the perimeter of the cluster. The 300&#x000a0;m distance was chosen on the basis of previous studies at the site that indirectly demonstrated that the mass effect of a community based intervention (LLINs) extended to approximately 300&#x000a0;m based upon both entomologic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and epidemiologic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] data.&#x000a0;The area between the core and the perimeter of the cluster was defined as the buffer; though the intervention was performed in the buffer, data from individuals residing within the buffer area were not used for evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study protocol and informed consent and assent forms were approved by the KEMRI Scientific and Ethics Review Unit (KEMRI protocol #2380). The CDC institutional review board relied on the KEMRI Scientific and Ethics Review Unit for approval. The Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board approved the protocol and importation of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sigman-Tau, Pomezia, Italy) for the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Training</title><p>Prior to participant contact, study staff were trained in Good Clinical Practices and the protocol. Each cadre of staff were trained according to their study responsibilities, including consenting participants, using tablets and personal digital assistants (PDAs), administering questionnaires, collecting blood samples and performing RDTs, implementing treatment algorithms, and entering data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Community mobilization</title><p>Prior to study initiation, and again before each MTaT round, local District Health Management Teams were approached to discuss the study purpose, procedures, and timelines. Formal meetings were held with the village chiefs and heads of schools within the study area. Informational letters and flyers were distributed within these communities, and were followed by <italic>barazas</italic> (community meetings) during which study staff briefly described the study and answered questions from the community members. Short messages were transmitted during radio-spots in the local language to broadcast to the communities, and provided information for community members to contact study staff with questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Consenting process</title><p>Prior to any interaction with a potential study member, CHVs described the study to the compound head and requested permission to individually consent all household members. Caregiver consent was required for all children&#x000a0;&#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years of age (except mature minors, which includes pregnant women and mothers&#x000a0;&#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years of age), and, in accordance with local guidelines, an additional written assent was required for children aged 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years of age. When day-school-going children attending school and residing within the community were not available at the house, study teams obtained informed consent from the child&#x02019;s parent, and then organized trips to the schools, sought permission from teachers, and identified, assented, and performed study procedures on the selected children on the school campus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Community acceptance of MTaT</title><p>Two series of qualitative data collection activities were performed within six randomly selected MTaT communities prior to the intervention and after the first MTaT round to evaluate acceptability and strategies for improving the intervention. A total of 36 focus group discussions were conducted with men, women, and opinion leaders, and 12 individual or small group interviews were performed with community health workers. Methodology and results were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Mass testing and treatment rounds</title><p>A mathematical model was calibrated to a pre-trial prevalence of 35% by slide microscopy between 2 and 10&#x000a0;year olds, incorporating historical trends in insecticide-treated net use and first-line treatment, as well as vector species composition and bionomics informed by entomology data from the KEMRI and CDC study site. The double-peaked seasonality pattern was generated using local rainfall data. All possible monthly combinations of a 2&#x000a0;year, three round per-year MTaT providing a curative drug with a prophylactic period fitted to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data of the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine at 80% coverage, were simulated. Correlation between rounds were simulated with a co-efficient calibrated to mimic a hard-to-reach 10% of the population who only have a 10% probability of taking the drug at each round. The optimal combination was that which minimized clinical incidence within the population over the course of the intervention. Model results suggested that three annual rounds should be performed (1) prior to the short rains, (2) after the short malaria peak, and (3) just prior to the long rains, before the major malaria transmission season (Walker P, personal communication).</p><p>During MTaT rounds, CHVs visited every compound within the intervention clusters. After obtaining individual informed consent from all eligible members the CHV collected a blood sample using finger or heel prick to determine malaria parasitaemia by RDT (Carestart&#x02122; Malaria HRP-2/pLDH (Pf/PAN) Combo Test RDT; Somerset, NJ, USA). Additional drops were spotted on Whatman 903 filter papers (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA) from the first 5000 participants encountered during the MTaT rounds to be used for real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection of malaria parasites. CHVs completed a short questionnaire programmed on PDAs using Visual CE version 12 (SYWARE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Inc., Cambridge, USA) or tablets using Open Data Kit version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], to evaluate recent presence of malaria-associated symptoms, malaria prevention methods (e.g. LLIN use), care-seeking, use of medications, and migration. RDT positive women of child-bearing age (13&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years of age) who were not visibly pregnant, reported a last menstrual period&#x000a0;&#x02265;4&#x000a0;weeks before the visit, and did not report being pregnant, were privately offered a urine pregnancy test at home. Those who refused pregnancy testing were referred to the closest study health facility for treatment. All participants testing positive for malaria or anaemia were treated according to an algorithm consistent with the Kenya Ministry of Health National Malaria Treatment Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] that was pre-programmed into the PDA or tablet (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Those with signs of severe malaria (including prostration, altered consciousness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] or anaemia were referred to study health facilities for further evaluations and treatment. Study staff directly observed the first dose of anti-malarial treatment, and revisited a sample of 200 compounds, selected by probability proportional to size, to evaluate each individual who had been treated with anti-malarials one week after treatment for anti-malarial adherence.

For ease of sampling, compounds were selected, and all individuals in the compounds were enrolled. A conservative coefficient of variation of 0.3 for between-cluster and&#x02014;compound variance was used. Twenty compounds were selected per cluster for a total of 400 compounds across the study area (200 in each arm), and a total population of approximately 2000 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Incidence of malaria infection</title><p>The incidence of malaria infection was measured using active surveillance in a population-based cohort from the intervention and control clusters.

From within the 20 compounds in each of the 20 clusters included in the cross-sectional survey, 33 individuals were randomly selected for a total sample size of 660 individuals (330 control and 330 intervention) aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;1&#x000a0;year. At the time of recruitment, all cohort participants were provided an LLIN and tested for malaria, and were treated with artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine for malaria to clear subpatent infections. Cohort participants made scheduled monthly visits to the closest study health facility, and were encouraged to attend the health facility in case of illness. At both scheduled and sick visits, participants were administered a questionnaire on recent history of fever, health-seeking behaviour, LLIN use, and medication use in the month since the previous visit. Blood samples were obtained by finger pricks at each scheduled and sick visit for malaria testing by RDT and microscopy, and haemoglobin testing using a HemoCue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. A blood spot was also dried on a Whatman 903 filter paper for testing by rRT-PCR. Treatment decisions were made according to RDT and Hemocue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> results.

As the population of individuals harbouring asymptomatic infections has been increasingly implicated in sustaining malaria transmission there has been renewed interest in evaluating time-limited MTaT in different transmission settings with high coverage of malaria control interventions for rapid malaria transmission reduction. The study site in western Kenya provided distinct advantages for evaluating MTaT including; (1) high malaria transmission despite high coverage with LLINs, (2) the existence of a HDSS through which sampling frames and population level data including births, deaths, and migration have been continuously monitored, (3) over 30&#x000a0;years of historical data on epidemiological and entomological malaria indices, (4) advanced laboratories and research infrastructure, and (5) strong relations with the communities and public and private health sectors in the region. In this manuscript, the strengths and limitations of the study design choices are discussed.</p><p>Interventions such as MTaT are designed to be effective at high coverage levels and, therefore, must be evaluated at the community level, but the cost and complexity of cluster-randomized trials combined with the heterogeneity of malaria transmission and differential access to health care complicate the design of such trials. To minimize differences in the spatial distribution of malaria transmission, differences in treatment availability and provider proficiency, the effect of distance on health-care seeking, and LLIN coverage, each cluster around the study health facilities was randomly assigned to the intervention or control arm, and only villages with a centroid within 3&#x000a0;kms from the health facilities were included. The result of this decision was that clusters abutted one another and were relatively small for campaign-style interventions, which are intended to be implemented over larger geographic spans for transmission reduction. This smaller size and geographic proximity may artificially increase the impact of migration as individuals may be more likely to migrate out of a smaller geographic cluster than a larger one, and through daily movement, may be more likely to enter a cluster that is closer to where they reside than one that is geographically distant.</p><p>Migration is known to play a major role in malaria transmission as parasites are transported from one area to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], or one cluster to another. In this trial, migration and contamination of parasites into other clusters, was likely non-differential, and thus may bias the outcome to the null. It was recognized that human migration was unavoidable and would serve as a limitation to evaluation, and measures were taken to quantify it during MTaT rounds, at cohort visits, and through the HDSS census, however daily movement between clusters was not quantified. To mitigate the impact of daily movement on the outcome measure while maintaining statistical tenets for cluster numbers, there was a consideration for creating much larger clusters that were geographically distant from one another, while maintaining the same number of clusters for statistical validity. However, this would have been cost-prohibitive and the necessary geographic separation would likely have led to significant confounding from transmission differences and health facility associated factors such as stockouts and care-seeking behaviour. When choosing a study design, researchers must carefully weigh the benefits of bias mitigating decisions versus the introduction of contamination. Smaller clusters were used in this study. Other study designs for evaluating population-based interventions such as stepped-wedge approaches, through which larger clusters can be more easily created, were considered, however at the time, the statistical rigor and the practicality of these designs were in question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p>The frequency and timing of test and treat rounds in this study are based on robust mathematical models. These models account for multiple variables including LLIN coverage, usage, and baseline transmission levels. All models are based on assumptions from years of research in malaria in general, and specifically to the study site. The models suggest that clearing the parasite reservoir during the dry season, when the number of sub-clinical infections and vectors are lowest, would be the most effective way of reducing transmission, and that spacing the rounds 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;months from each other and ensuring at least one of the rounds is delivered immediately before the peak transmission season would be the most cost-effective way of performing this. However, model assumptions are constantly being updated as new field data are collected. Data from this study will be incorporated into the models to refine them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ultimately, the success of MTaT campaigns in rapidly reducing malaria transmission or eliminating malaria will reside on community acceptability, the degree and duration of impact, number of years of intervention needed, and the cost-effectiveness.
