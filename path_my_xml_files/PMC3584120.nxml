In Experiment 1, we show that after watching 16 PSAs participants who received oxytocin, compared to those given a placebo, donated to 57% more causes, donated 56% more money, and reported 17% greater concern for those in the ads. In Experiment 2, we measured adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin levels in blood before and after participants watched a PSA. As predicted by the model, donations occurred when participants had increases in both ACTH and oxytocin. Our results indicate that PSAs with social content that cause OT release will be more effective than those that do not. Our results also explain why some individuals do not respond to PSAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies.

In 2010, $131 billion were spent in the U.S. to persuade people to engage in some action after viewing, listening to, or reading, an ad <xref rid="pone.0056934-Kantar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. So far, there is no secret formula to designing an effective marketing campaign. There is an old saw in which a marketer says, "Only one-half of my advertising budget is effective; I just don't know which half." That is the marketer's dilemma: how to determine which ads are effective. This paper reports two neuroscience experiments designed to identify why public service ads are effective by measuring--and pharmacologically manipulating--the brain mechanisms that are expected to produce behavioral effects.</p><p>We choose to use public service advertisements (PSAs) because they provide a clear metric of behavioral change: donating money to the featured cause. Many PSAs produce attitude changes toward issues in ads, but actions do not always follow positive attitudes. One way to increase attitude strength is to grab participants&#x02019; attention <xref rid="pone.0056934-Petty1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Indeed, most of the empirical marketing literature has focused on the attentional effects of advertising &#x02013; how successful ads stand out from the thousands of messages consumers see each day <xref rid="pone.0056934-Milosavljevic1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Sacharin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While the strength of an attitude is associated with behavioral changes <xref rid="pone.0056934-Ajzen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, why attitude changes do not always lead to actions is a mystery.</p><p>In the present study, we adapted the first formal advertising model, AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) <xref rid="pone.0056934-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> to identify the physiologic correlates of attention and action in the context of PSAs. In our augmented model, we propose that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin (OT) are key neurologic contributors to successful PSAs due to their relationships with attention and action. Our mapping from physiologic factors to the AIDA model is imperfect, as we focus solely on attention and action, but it is included for pedagogical purposes. By extending the AIDA model, we ground our approach in an existing framework and generate testable hypotheses that seek to identify why some PSAs, particularly those with social content, are effective.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Attention</title><p>The AIDA model posits that attention, interest, desire, and action are the four components of successful advertisements. The goal of a PSA is to produce a particular behavioral action, and the first step is to attract viewers' attention. Eye-tracking studies have shown, for example, that attention to an ad is related to purchase decisions <xref rid="pone.0056934-Lohse1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and that reduced attention can have an adverse impact on sales <xref rid="pone.0056934-Janiszewski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For advertisements that last 30 seconds to two minutes, the likely neurochemical signal of attention is ACTH <xref rid="pone.0056934-Born1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Spruijt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. ACTH is a mediator of attention and distress <xref rid="pone.0056934-Mauri1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Sandman2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is released in seconds following a stimulus <xref rid="pone.0056934-DeWeid1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and prepares the organism to act in response to environmental change. In animal studies, ACTH inhibits habituation <xref rid="pone.0056934-File1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> indicating that attention can be sustained in spite of repetition. In humans, ACTH helps maintain performance over time <xref rid="pone.0056934-Gaillard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and increases visual attention <xref rid="pone.0056934-Sandman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Without attention to the ad, the message in the PSA is unlikely to produce an action.</p><p>We measure ACTH rather than cortisol because message stimuli (ads) are of limited duration, typically too short for a change in cortisol to occur <xref rid="pone.0056934-Nicholson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Action</title><p>PSAs are designed to persuade people to make positive changes in their lives or to help others <xref rid="pone.0056934-Bagozzi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. They can raise awareness of potential dangers (such as drug abuse, smoking, or obesity), but may or may not be effective in affecting behavior <xref rid="pone.0056934-Murry1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Several researchers have shown that effective PSAs elicit empathy in viewers <xref rid="pone.0056934-Bagozzi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Shelton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For example, Shen (2010) used high and low empathy television PSAs about smoking and drunk driving to show that messages that elicited greater empathy were more effective in changing attitudes <xref rid="pone.0056934-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Similarly, televised fund-raising appeals that focused on the benefits to others resulted in larger donation pledges than appeals that focused on the self <xref rid="pone.0056934-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Ads that elicit empathy may have a behavioral effect because the ad viewer shares the emotions of the characters shown in the ad. For example, participants who were asked to listen to an interview from a convicted drug user's perspective tended to give more money to a drug-related charity than those directed to listen from their own perspective <xref rid="pone.0056934-Batson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Empathy may change behavior because those who are emotionally engaged want to alleviate their own distress <xref rid="pone.0056934-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, to feel good for supporting a cause <xref rid="pone.0056934-Arnett1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, or to assuage the suffering of others <xref rid="pone.0056934-Batson3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies of messaging effectiveness have used psychological manipulations of empathy <xref rid="pone.0056934-Batson2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Batson4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Loggia1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In these studies, empathy was made salient by instructing subjects to listen to pleas from people requesting assistance, read messages from people asking for help, or to watch people in need on video clips. Participants inevitably respond differently to these stimuli so that the degree of empathic engagement varies and the subsequent impact on behavior is indirect. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been associated with the subjective experience of empathy in a number of studies. For example, after participants watched a 100 second fund-raising video for St. Jude's Children's Hospital, OT measured in blood increased 47% <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In that study, the change in OT correlated with experienced empathy. Barraza and Zak <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> also show that empathy also predicted the money sent to a stranger in a zero-sum monetary transfer.</p><p>Studies that infuse synthetic OT into human beings have also documented changes in behaviors associated with emotional engagement, including increased accuracy in recognizing others' emotions from photographs <xref rid="pone.0056934-Domes1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, increased charitable giving <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and an increase in the time spent looking at people's eyes in photographs of faces <xref rid="pone.0056934-Guastella1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A recent study using OT infusion reported an increase in a multifaceted empathy test compared to participants on placebo <xref rid="pone.0056934-Hurlemann1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This body of research indicates that OT increases empathy physiologically <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This literature led us to hypothesize that OT is the neurochemical that motivates action after viewing a PSA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>A Physiological Model of Effective PSAs</title><p>The previous section established a relationship between ACTH and attention, as well as between OT and empathy. The Physiologic Model of Effective PSAs (PMEP), presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056934-g001">Figure 1</xref>, adds these two neurochemical correlates to the AIDA model. We hypothesize that when viewing a PSA, attention is quantifiable physiologically by measuring the change in ACTH. Actions following a PSA with social content are hypothesized to be associated with a change in OT. The PMEP posits that it is the ACTH-OT interaction that indicates that a PSA is likely to be effective in both attracting attention and affecting a behavioral change. But why are both necessary?</p><fig id="pone-0056934-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056934.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Physiologic Model of Effective PSAs (PMEP).</title><p>A physiologic model of attention and action is shown after viewing an advertisement with social content. We propose that attention will be reflected in a sympathetic nervous system response measurable by a change in ACTH. A response to the ad that results in an action will be driven by a change in OT. The model includes cases in which individuals do not attend to the ad and do not respond by engaging in an action after the ad.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0056934.g001"/></fig><p>Physiologically, one must attend to a social stimulus before the release of OT signals the organism to engage in an action <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In natural social interactions, the orienting signal can be a sign of distress or a request for help. Advertisements, especially PSAs, often use this strategy, by presenting a scenario in which the characters in the ad are in trouble, or likely to be so. With respect to ACTH and OT release, our previous work suggests that the brain does not effectively differentiate between in-person interactions and those viewed on a computer monitor <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>The value of the PMEP is that it identifies measurable and objective factors that we hypothesize lead to behavioral actions. Our approach does not rely on self-report attitude changes or hypothetical behaviors. Rather, it is grounded in workings of the brain's autonomic nervous system. Because this part of the brain does not require a conscious decision, most people are unaware that their brains have released ACTH or OT.</p><p>If the PMEP is confirmed experimentally, it provides a new approach to evaluate PSA effectiveness for those who create and study these ads. At the same time, there is substantial individual variation in the stimuli that cause, and the amount of, ACTH and OT synthesis so that the PMEP is only expected to hold on average across a population, and not for each particular individual. Further, the PEMP only applies to PSAs and not to advertising relating to goods or services. Purchase decisions have been associated with a change in dopamine in mid-brain regions of the brain that is associated with the desire to obtain a good <xref rid="pone.0056934-Knutson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In contrast, PSAs nearly always feature social content suggesting a role for OT that may not be found, for example, in an ad for a chocolate bar or new car unless these ads had significant social content.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Testing the Model</title><p>We designed two experiments to test the PMEP. We used PSAs in our experiments because we could measure actual behaviors in response to these ads, donations to the featured charities, rather than simply attitudes. The novel part of the model is the role of OT, so Experiment 1 tests whether OT affects actions in response to PSAs. In Experiment 1, we manipulated OT pharmacologically to establish a causal relationship between OT and donation decisions in response to PSAs. This follows protocols we have used to establish the causal effect of OT on prosocial behaviors between strangers <xref rid="pone.0056934-Kosfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. If there were no effect of OT on viewers' actions following a PSA, then the proposed model would be invalidated.</p><p>It is important to note that OT seldom produces &#x02018;all for you, none for me&#x02019; decisions as OT only modulates activity in a network of brain regions that are involved in decision-making <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. When the external context and a person's internal state are congruent, OT is likely to have a behavioral effect. This may explain why a PSA may not affect the behavior of all those who hear, read or view it. When a PSA resonates with an individual's personality traits and physiologic state, perceived persuasion is higher and attitude changes have been shown to follow <xref rid="pone.0056934-Cesario1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. One of the authors (Morin, C.) provided the PSAs we tested from commercial sources. This does not alter our adherence to PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we sought to confirm the interactive physiologic mechanisms for attention and action in the PMEP. To do this, we measured endogenous changes in OT and ACTH levels in blood before and after participants watched a PSA from Experiment 1. We expected that the PSA would cause an increase in both ACTH and OT release in most participants. Further, we expected that participants who had increases in both ACTH and OT would be the ones most likely to donate to the charity in the ad.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Experiment 1: Exogenous OT Infusion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Institutional Review Board at Claremont Graduate University approved this study.

All participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment and a lab administrator assigned random numeric codes to participants to mask their identities. The recruiting text solicited participation by noting that participants would earn between $30 and $100. Earnings were paid in cash at the end of the experiment by a lab administrator who was not part of the study to maintain participant anonymity. One participant did not finish the experiment due to computer malfunction, producing a final sample size of 40. Participants' ethnicities were mixed (55% Caucasian, 30% Asian, 12.5%, mixed race, and 2.5% African-American). Women were excluded from the study because the effect of OT varies with a woman's menstrual cycle <xref rid="pone.0056934-Salonia1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and because OT contracts the uterus so that there was a possibility that OT infusion could cause an unintended abortion.

Each ad lasted between 30 and 60 seconds. Ads were counterbalanced across sessions. Immediately after viewing each ad, participants had to report how they felt about the ads (questions below), and were asked to answer a single question regarding the content of the ad. The content questions were designed so that participants could easily answer them. Participants were informed that a correct answer to the content question earned them $5. The post-PSA questions were included to motivate attention to the stimulus and to compensate participants for the experiment.</p><p>Following the content question, participants were queried by computer to donate some portion of their $5 earnings to a charity associated with the advertisement. The charities were: Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Drug Abuse Resistance Education, Student Against Destructive Decisions, I Have a Dream Foundation, American Cancer Society, and American Lung Association of California. The donation decision was done privately by computer. Donations from participants were sent to the charitable organizations at the end of the study.

Those who received OT donated to more causes after viewing ads and had larger average donations than those who received a placebo. Our analysis indicated that OT affected donations by selectively altering the susceptibility to concern for self and others, moving participants to act in response to ads that induced concern for others. It should be noted that OT did not increase concern for people in all ads, but when OT elicited greater concern, donations followed.</p><p>Participants who received a placebo were persuaded to donate by ads with greater self-relevance, while those on OT were more persuaded by ads that concerned other people, consistent with OT's ability to alter the self-other balance <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This result also reveals the importance of matching personal states with advertisement content. Although participants on OT did not report greater concern for all ads, they reported more engagement and opened their wallets when the ad content was congruent with their heightened empathy. This suggests that a PSA that raises OT will be most effective when it directs individuals' attention to the needs of others. Absent such an approach, ads focused on the viewers' own needs appear to be most effective.</p><p>While it is important to acknowledge that many factors affect decisions to donate to charities other than the ones studied here, our results complement previous findings from studies of OT infusion and the sharing of money with a stranger. In one study, intranasal infusion of 24IU of OT caused a 17% larger monetary transfer denoting trust in an unknown person in the lab compared to those given a placebo <xref rid="pone.0056934-Kosfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Monetary transfers were made in this experiment because of the expectation of a larger return of money from the person who was trusted. What is surprising in the present study is that the alteration in the self-other balance occurred when participants watched public service ads with actors portraying fictional scenes and that this caused out-of-pocket donations to the issues promoted in the ads. This finding complements the increase in generosity to another person after an infusion of 40IU of OT in a zero-sum setting <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and in donations to charity <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>The affective mechanism at work appears to be enhanced empathy.

OT infusion is known to carry a small risk of miscarriage for pregnant females, and therefore most OT infusion studies, including our Experiment 1, exclude women. Male and female participants were included in Experiment 2 as there was no reason for a gender exclusion when measuring endogenous OT release.

While the present contribution advances the scientific understanding of effective PSAs, we acknowledge it does not exhaust all possible ways the AIDA model can be measured or influenced biologically. In particular, we focus exclusively on measuring attention and action as factors that can be directly measured and manipulated experimentally. Interestingly, we did not find an interaction between attention and concern for others based on self-report data (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;.05), while it was apparent in the hormone data. This difference further reinforces the value of obtaining physiologic measurements rather than self-reports. The AIDA model is typically tested using self-reports and the findings here suggest this may be inappropriate because the brain mechanisms producing attention and action identified in the PMEP occur largely outside of one's conscious awareness.

Activities that induce the brain to release OT include watching an emotional video clip <xref rid="pone.0056934-Barraza2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, being trusted <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak5" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>), being touched <xref rid="pone.0056934-Morhenn1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, attending a wedding <xref rid="pone.0056934-Geddes1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, petting one's dog <xref rid="pone.0056934-Odendaal1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, moderate stress <xref rid="pone.0056934-Heinrichs1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, holding one's infant <xref rid="pone.0056934-Feldman1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0056934-Matthiesen1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, sexual activity <xref rid="pone.0056934-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and perhaps even Tweeting <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056934-Penenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Our findings suggest that advertisements that feature these activities may induce OT release. If our results generalize beyond PSAs, then a body lotion commercial would be more effective when it shows the lotion being spread on someone's skin, especially by another person, than simply featuring the lotion bottle.</p><p>Positive in-person interactions also induce OT release <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and marketing in stores and at events can also be crafted based on the research reported here. If additional research shows that the PMEP extends to ads for products, then in-person marketing should focus on i) attracting attention, and ii) building emotional connections with potential customers that take their needs into account. This approach indicates that effective marketing campaigns should be seen as ways to build relationships and solve customers' problems rather than focusing on a one-time sale. Marketing that causes OT release is a step toward building an emotional relationship with a product or brand.</p><p>An important caveat from this research is that those with pharmacologically-enhanced OT in Experiment 1 did not donate to the charity for every advertisement they viewed. The ads that caused participants to donate money varied across individuals. This suggests a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; approach to stimulate OT release will not work for advertisers. For example, we have found in every study in our lab that women release more OT after a stimulus than do men <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We have also shown that pharmacologically-elevated testosterone, which inhibits the action of OT, decreases generosity toward a stranger in a &#x02018;share the money&#x02019; task with a stranger <xref rid="pone.0056934-Zak6" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. The OT triggers cataloged above will vary across population segments including gender and other factors so marketers will have to continue to segment the population they seek to influence. While we have unmasked part of the neurobiology of effective public service advertisements, crafting persuasive ads will still require skill and nuance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0056934-Kantar1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Kantar Media reports U.S. advertising expenditures increased 6.5 percent in 2010.
