examining the soleus H-reflex in the ready position adopted immediately before making a
return during badminton games. [Subjects] Sixteen individuals with (badminton group) and
16 without (control group) experience of playing badminton were studied. [Methods] Each
subject was instructed to take up various stances for returning a shuttlecock to measure
the H- and M-waves in the soleus. [Results] The H-wave was significantly decreased when
gripping a racket was held in the dominant hand than compared to just standing in the
badminton group. In contrast, in the control group, no significant differences were
observed between when standing and the other stances. [Conclusion] Based on these results,
the excitability of spinal motor neurons may have been reduced (H-wave suppression) by
badminton training to increase the instantaneous force (power training).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Badminton</kwd><kwd>H-reflex</kwd><kwd>Receive stance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During badminton games, it is necessary for players to use high-level stroke skills in
various situations<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Players need to be
able to select and execute a large number of stroke, in different situations, after
selecting highly strategic shots to disrupt their opponent&#x02019;s readiness, rather than simply
returning the shuttlecock<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example,
when an opponent takes up the ready position in front of the net, it is appropriate to
return the shuttlecock by placing a clear shot behind the opponent, and an opponent takes up
the ready position in the back section of the court, a drop shot falling near the net is
appropriate. During a rally, a player needs to select the most appropriate shot to disrupt
an opponent&#x02019;s readiness, and as soon the opponent&#x02019;s readiness disrupted, deliver the most
offensive shot to earn a point<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Reports about strokes have been made in some previous studies of badminton games, which
focused on the development of skills for delivering effective services and overhead
strokes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, or the characteristics of upper-limb muscle activities of skilled
badminton players when hitting a smash<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, in badminton rallies, quick movements are essential for returning the
shuttlecocks at various speeds in all directions. To win a rally, increased leg strength
enabling rapidly movement to the spots where the shuttlecock falls<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and endurance to continue moving without decreasing the
speed of movement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, are crucial. In addition, in order to effectively return a
shuttlecock (to disrupt an opponent&#x02019;s readiness), it is necessary to deliver a stroke in a
stable stance. In these situations, players need to instantaneously predict the spot where
the shuttlecock will fall, and immediately begin to move to it. However, no studies have
examined the mechanisms by which badminton players instantaneously react to shuttlecocks,
and move. In which demands, instantaneous lower-limb muscle movements are particularly
needed. If badminton players have the ability to instantaneously activate their own
lower-limb muscles, the excitability of their spinal motor neurons controlling the fibers of
such muscles may be characteristic. The soleus H-reflex has frequently been the focus of
previous studies<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, as it is considered to
represent the excitability of spinal motor neurons. Accordingly, in line with this, the
present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of badminton players&#x02019; motor neuron
excitability by examining the soleus H-reflex in the ready position immediately before
making a return.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen individuals with experience of playing badminton (mean age: 20.9&#x000b1;2.1; years of
experience: 8.3&#x000b1;3.0) and 16 without such experience (20.1&#x000b1;1.2) were studied. All subjects
were provided with explanations regarding the study objectives and its safety before
obtaining their consent to voluntarily participate in this. This study, which was conducted
with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the Health Science University
(approval number: 13).</p><p>Neuropack (NIHON KOHDEN) was used for the measurement of the M- and H-waves. Before
measurement, it was confirmed that cutaneous resistance was 2 k&#x003a9; or less. Silver plated
electrodes for recording were placed on the skin of the medial part of the soleus on both
sides, while bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached to the popliteal fossa of the
dominant and non-dominant legs. Subsequently, electrical stimulation was intracutaneously
applied to the tibial nerves to measure the M- and H-waves in the medial part of the soleus;
and their thresholds and maximum values were recorded by gradually increasing stimulation.
For H-wave measurement, the stimulation level was set to obtain H-wave amplitudes of
approximately 30% of the maximum M-wave value (Mmax), as well as the M-wave of 4 to 8% Mmax,
at a frequency of 0.2&#x02005;Hz<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. When
recording the H-reflex, it was confirmed that the M-wave remained unchanged. When changes
were observed, the recorded values were discarded due to considering the possibility of
changes in the stimulation level. The H-reflex was measured in the ready position before
receiving a shuttlecock with or without a racket held in the dominant or non-dominant hand,
in addition to a static upright stance. The subjects were instructed to maintain these 5
stances, and the H-wave was recorded 10 times, and the mean was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>H-wave after tibial nerve stimulation of stance in a representative badminton

maximum H-wave values was calculated. Subsequently, the difference between the minimum and
maximum M-wave values (Mmax) as a response to maximum stimulation in the supine position was
calculated to normalize the H-wave value as a percentage of the Mmax.</p><p>For statistics, the statistical software Stat View was used. Significant differences were
examined by performing one-way analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparisons,
adopting the Tukey-Kramer method with a significance level of 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The H-wave rate of each stance was calculated, using the values when just standing as 100%

In the badminton group, the H-wave significantly decreased when holding a
racket in the dominant hand compared to when standing. In contrast, in the control group, no
significant differences were observed between when standing and the other stances.
Furthermore, the H-wave was suppressed in all stances compared to when standing in the
badminton group, while it was promoted in the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Muscle stimulation excites type Ia afferent fibers, and consequently activates spinal alpha
motor neurons, leading to the contraction of stimulated muscles (stretch reflex). The H-wave
obtained with electrical stimulation has been used as an index for evaluating the spinal
control of muscle contraction during the stretch reflex, as it represents the excitability
of spinal motor neurons. In previous studies, the soleus H-wave obtained by eliciting
stimuli was shown to be greater when standing compared to walking<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this may be explained by the mechanism in which the
stretch reflex stabilizes the ankle joint when standing (increased H-wave), while it
interferes with the swing phase when walking (decreased H-wave). In short, a greater
amplitude of the H-wave amplitude contributes to ankle fixation and stability. The H-wave
also varies between different exercise tasks, such as walking and running, and stances, such
as prone and standing positions<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the soleus H-wave has been
reported to be greater in swimmers than in non-swimmers<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, the H-reflex level is lower in professional
ballet dancers than in athletes in general<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these findings, long-term physical training may
specifically influence the excitability of spinal motor neurons. In the present study, on
comparison of the soleus H-wave of those with and without experience of playing badminton
were compared, and its values was significantly lower in the former when experienced players
held in the dominant hand, while those with no experience of playng badminton showed a
markedly different tendency. Some previous studies reported that the H-wave amplitude is
greater in athletes mainly engaged in endurance training than in those mainly engaged in
power training<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such training-dependent
(endurance/power) variation in the H-wave may be associated with differences in the
lower-limb loading level. For example, the H-wave decreases in the prone position compared
to when standing under the influence of gravity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and increases in a microgravity environment or underwater<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this respect, continuous badminton training suppresses the soleus
H-wave, presumably due to being power-focused. In badminton games, it is necessary for
players to deal with shots at various speeds, such as drop shots near the net and high-speed
smashes, and appropriately the return shuttlecocks. Therefore, badminton players need to
increase the instantaneous force of their legs to execute rapid movements. In fact, their
leg strength levels have been reported to be high<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study suggest that the excitability of
badminton players&#x02019; spinal motor neurons may be suppressed by training to increase the
instantaneous force (power training). Furthermore, the reduced excitability of spinal motor
neurons when playing badminton may be associated with an increased ability to move to feet
rapidly. Considering that badminton is regarded as a lifelong sport for a wide range of age
groups, regardless of the sex, and that it increases the stepping ability (by suppressing
the excitability of spinal motor neurons), this sport is also likely to be an effective
fall-preventing on approach.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Research Grant of the Health Science University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cabello Manrique</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Badillo</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Analysis of the characteristics of competitive
