Examinations and samplings were performed at Pediatric Dentistry Department, Dental School of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, from May to June 2015. Written informed consent form was signed by volunteers (parents or caregiver of children). Sixty-one healthy children were recruited for the study. Grouping by randomized, double-blind method, there were 31 and 30 samples for the probiotic and control group, respectively, at the beginning of the study.</p><p>The inclusion criteria included 3- to 6-year-old children with initial dental caries and no systemic conditions, who had not received any product containing probiotics, xylitol, corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, and local fluoride therapy for at least 4 weeks before taking part in the study. The volunteers had no gingivitis or periodontal diseases. Children were excluded from the study if they became ill or used medications. Caries-free children were excluded as well.</p><p>The drops for the two groups were randomized according to a computer-generated random table. For blinding purposes, the packaging of the probiotic and placebo drops were dark brown bottles and completely similar and sealed. The bottles were coded A or B by someone who was not involved in the study procedures so that drops were indistinguishable. Neither the researcher nor the volunteers knew which subjects belonged to which group (double-blind). The codes were deciphered at the end of statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>The probiotic and placebo drop</title><p>The probiotic drop (Pedilact, Zist-Takhmir, Iran) was used, which contained <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> ATCC 15820 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming unit [CFU]/mL), <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 55730 (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL), and <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis</italic> ATCC 15697 (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL).

Its other constituents included sunflower seed oil, medium chain triglyceride oil, silicon dioxide, and a flavoring agent. This drop has been approved by the Center of Pharmaceutical Products, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and is routinely prescribed in Iran for the treatment of diarrhea, flatulence, and colic in infants and children by pediatrician. The placebo consisted of the same constituents except for the probiotics and was manufactured by Zist Takhmir Company too.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Parents were instructed to keep the drop bottle in a refrigerator and given five drops to their children before bedtime for 2 weeks.</p><p>It was recommended not to brush their teeth for at least 1 h after taking the drop and refrain from eating and drinking.

In addition, the volunteers were asked to fill out a table for 2 weeks after each time they used the drop. After 2 weeks, salivary samples were once again collected and sent to the microbiologic laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>Clinical examinations and sampling were carried out by a pediatric dentist (investigator 3).

A questionnaire including demographic features and oral health data was completed. The number of decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/DMFT) was recorded for all teeth (inclusion criteria of 1&#x02013;3 with initial stages of dental caries). DMFT was recorded in the 6-year-olds for permanent teeth. It should be noted that radiographic examinations for proximal caries detection could not be performed due to limitations and lack of Ethics Committee approval.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Collection of salivary samples</title><p>Salivary samples were collected by one operator twice for each volunteer: Before the intervention and 1 day after the end of intervention. The parents were asked to prevent the child from eating, drinking, and brushing before each sampling procedure from the time of waking up until the sampling procedure was completed. Due to different flow rates of saliva during the day, the salivary samples were collected during the early hours of the morning (7:30&#x02013;8:30). In addition, to prevent the effect of individual differences during the stimulation of salivary flow in the present study, unstimulated salivary samples were collected.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Each child was asked to evacuate his/her saliva (minimum 1 mL) into a sterile container.

In each block, volunteers were divided into two groups according to their first SM or LB counts (&#x02265;10<sup>4</sup> or &#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup>). These binary groups considered as dependent variables. Other variables (dmft/DMFT, age, gender, probiotic/placebo consumption) were considered as independent variables.

However, it had no effect on LB counts.

Cildir reported that use of this drop for 25 days in 4&#x02013;12-year-old children with cleft lip/palate did not result in any difference in SM and LB counts.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, the same composition in a study by Caglar <italic>et al</italic>. with the use of gum and lozenge resulted in a significant decrease in SM counts.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Cildir <italic>et al</italic>. believed one possible explanation was the complex interaction of probiotics with the oral cavity microflora of children with cleft lip/palate and also the small sample size.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Stensson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] evaluated the effect of such a drop by pregnant mothers during the last month of pregnancy and by their newborns up to 1 year of age on the prevalence of dental caries in deciduous teeth at 9 years of age. Although no significant differences were found in salivary counts of SM and LB, the rate of caries-free state increased and the rate of proximal caries decreased. In that study, colony counts were determined 8 years after administration of probiotics. The possible effect of this drop on caries without any change in bacterial counts might be attributed to an increase in SIgA in the probiotic group, resulting in the inhibition of the activity of SM, which can be considered another mechanism of probiotics.</p><p>One of the important reasons for differences between the results of the present study might be the use of a combination of three different species of probiotics and their synergistic effect on the inhibition of SM.</p><p>The exact mechanisms of action of probiotics are unknown.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> showed better adherence to &#x0201c;saliva-coated hydroxyapatite blocks&#x0201d; than <italic>bifidobacteria</italic> in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Antibacterial substances production and competition with pathogenic microorganisms for adhesion sites and/or substrates are suggested roles of probiotics in reducing oral pathogenic germs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The effects of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> on changing SM counts have been evaluated in various studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] To our knowledge, the effect of <italic>B. infantis</italic> on combination with other LB on salivary SM counts has not been evaluated.</p><p>Another factor is the use of different vehicles such as dairy products, chewing gum, and drops to transfer probiotics. The probiotic vehicles are suitable for all the ages, especially for young children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The concentrations of probiotics might decrease in dairy products over time, and the process of food preparation might affect the viability of bacteria and decrease the number of viable bacteria to below the recommended levels.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A drop was selected in the present study because it is safe, available, and used routinely in Iran for the treatment of diarrhea, flatulence and colic, and prevention of various allergies (respiratory and cutaneous) in newborns and children as an over-the-counter medication. The concentration of bacteria in this drop is consistent with those in previous studies. Use of a drop in younger children is easier than the use of mouthwashes, chewing gum, and dairy products and its effect on orodental health has not been evaluated to date. In the present study, the use of the probiotic drop for 2 weeks resulted in a decrease in LB salivary counts; however, the difference was not significant compared to the control group.</p><p>Contrary to the majority of studies which have shown a decrease in SM counts,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in relation to LB the majority of studies have not shown any change in LB counts.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A lack of change in LB counts has been observed in various studies in association with a decrease in SM counts,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which might be attributed to various mechanisms of action of probiotics in the oral cavity. Some probiotics exert their oral effects by colonizing the oral cavity or other mechanism similar to the explanation provided by Stensson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In a study, LB counts increased in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> group, with no changes in <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> group.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Others reported that LB counts increased.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The increase in LB counts during the study period might be considered colonization of LB in the oral cavity, rather than an increase in caries risk because as discussed previously not all the LB increase caries risk.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, complexities of the interaction of biofilm and interactions between bacteria found in the oral cavity might explain such diversities in the results in relation to LB.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] It should be pointed out that popularity and acceptance of drops were high among patients. In this study, culturing techniques were used to determine salivary bacterial courts. Although use of chair-side kits is easier, they are semi-quantitative and the gold standard in this field is the culture technique.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>To increase control and the study power, the double-blind, controlled, and placebo design was used. In addition to the determination of inclusion and exclusion criteria, logistic regression was used to compare changes in SM between the two groups with high and low concentrations of SM by controlling other similar factors. It was shown, similar to previous studies, that in the probiotic group the rate of decrease in colony counts increased with an increase in the initial counts of SM.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It might be concluded that it appears probiotic drop is more effective in individuals with higher SM counts. Therefore, it is advisable, in future studies, to determine salivary SM counts in subjects in the first step and include subjects with high SM counts.</p><p>It does not seem that permanent establishment of probiotics occurs after discontinuation. Therefore, daily consumption of probiotics seems necessary to achieve its potential impact;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] however due to limitations 2 weeks study period was considered in this study. Due to some limitations, different species of salivary lactobacillus were not considered in the present study which may affect results and a follow-up study after the drop withdrawal would be interesting as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of a drop containing a combination of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and LB for 2 weeks resulted in a decrease in salivary counts of SM; however, the salivary counts of LB did not change. In addition, it appears use of the drop was more effective in subjects with higher SM counts. However, further studies are required with different combinations of probiotics in the form of a drop so that a conclusion can be reached in relation to the efficacy of this form of administration. It seems that a combination of different probiotic species results in an increase in efficacy through synergism as well.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was funded by Vice Chancellery for Research (Grant number 393875, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Bahram Soleimani for his valuable aids in statistical analyses and study design, Prof. A Talebi, Ms. Dehdashti and Amini for microbiological analyses, the staff of Pediatric Dentistry Department for their supports during sample collection and intervention period and all volunteers who cheerfully participated in the study.
