Duloxetine (Dulox) and dexamethasone (Dex) are used in multimodal analgesia to reduce opioid use and side effects. Dulox is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and has efficacy in chronic pain conditions. Dex enhances postoperative (PO) analgesia and reduces PO nausea and vomiting (PONV).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Seventy-five female patients were randomly allocated into one of three equal groups. GI received Dulox 60 mg orally and 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) intravenous infusion (IVI) over 15 min, GII: received as GI except Dex 0.1 mg/kg was mixed with NS and GIII received identical placebo for Dulox capsule and Dex IVI, 2 h preoperatively. Patients&#x02019; vitals, visual analog scale (VAS), and sedation score were assessed at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, and 12 h postoperatively. Total pethidine requirements, plasma cortisol, PONV, and patients satisfaction were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>PO time for 1<sup>st</sup> rescue analgesic was significantly high in GI and GII compared to GIII and in GII compared to GI. There was a significant less VAS score, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and a high sedation score in GI and GII compared to GIII at 30 min, 1, 2, and 6 h postoperatively. Total pethidine requirements were significantly less in GI and GII compared to GIII 12 h postoperatively. There was a significant reduction in the 2 h PO serum cortisol (&#x003bc;g/dl) and a significant increase in the PO patients satisfaction score in GI and GII compared to GIII. PONV was decreased significantly in GII compared to GI and GIII.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The use of oral Dulox 60 mg combined with Dex 0.1 mg/kg IVI is more effective than oral Dulox 60 mg alone, 2 h preoperatively, for improving PO pain by reducing the requirements for rescue analgesia and PONV.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dexamethasone</kwd><kwd>duloxetine</kwd><kwd>postoperative pain</kwd><kwd>side effects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central sensitization develops after the surgical incision with a remarkable postoperative (PO) pain. Analgesic treatment results in preventing the establishment of altered central processing leading to a reduction in PO and chronic pain development.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The best use of analgesic adjuncts aiming of decreasing opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects necessitates getting acquainted with their dose-response relationships when combined with opioids to optimize the analgesic efficacy with less side effects from the combinations.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Duloxetine (Dulox) is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and is prescribed for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and major depression.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Dulox, which blocks persistent late Nav1.7 Na<sup>+</sup> currents present in both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, is useful in the treatment of pain caused by diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and may prevent transient PO anxiety that is common in female patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The oral bioavailability of Dulox (60 mg dose) averaged 50% with maximum plasma concentration occurring approximately 6 h after the dose and its elimination half-life is 12 h.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Dulox is affected by smoking Tobacco. Tobacco smoke contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that induce certain hepatic enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and possibly CYP2E1 significantly lower serum concentrations of Dulox (approximately 50%) than nonsmokers.

The secondary aim was to compare the effects of Dulox to Dulox plus Dex to record the patients&#x02019; vitals (heart rate [HR], mean arterial pressure [MAP]), arterial SpO<sub>2</sub>, sedation score, visual analog scale (VAS), the first analgesic requirement time, patients satisfaction, plasma cortisol, and adverse effects (e.g., PO nausea and vomiting [PONV], pruritus).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>After approval by the institute ethics committee and registration with the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03250494), this study was conducted in Ain-Shams university hospitals, from December 2014 to January 2016, on 75 female patients aged between 25 and 35 years old of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II scheduled for elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries for infertility to determine whether there are any defects such as scar tissue, endometriosis, fibroid tumors and other abnormalities of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries under general anesthesia. A written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Patients were not admitted to the study if any of the following criteria were present: (1) patient's refusal, (2) duration of surgery more than 90 min, (3) allergy to any drugs of the study, (4) smokers, history of drug or alcohol abuse, (5) treatment with antidepressants, (6) history of diabetes or epilepsy, (7) history of chronic pain or daily intake of analgesics within 24 h before surgery, (8) treatment with systemic glucocorticoids within 4 weeks before surgery, and (9) impaired kidney or liver functions.</p><p>This study was designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded parallel study. Patients were randomly allocated into 3 equal groups, group (I) (GI) (<italic>n</italic> = 25) each patient received Dulox capsule (60 mg) orally with sips of water 2 h preoperatively and 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline [NS]) IV infusion (IVI) over 15 min (Placebo), group (II) (GII) (<italic>n</italic> = 25) each patient received combined Dulox capsule (60 mg) orally with sips of water and Dex 0.1 mg/kg diluted in 100 ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 min, 2 h preoperatively and group (III) (GIII) (control group) (<italic>n</italic> = 25) each patient received a placebo capsule identical to Dulox capsule and 100 ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 min, as a placebo for Dex 2 h preoperatively. Dulox was presented as Cymbalta<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> capsules manufactured by Lilly del Caribe Inc. and Dex was presented as Dex Sodium Phosphate ampoules 8 mg in 2 ml. Randomization was done using computer-generated number table of random numbers in a 1:1 ratio and conducted using sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelope. Active Dulox capsules were indistinguishable from placebo capsules and placebo capsules contained starch. The study drugs were prepared by the hospital pharmacy and follow-up of patients was conducted by the anesthesia residents not involved in any other part of the study.</p><p>During the preoperative anesthetic evaluation, patients were familiarized with 10 cm marked VAS for PO assessment of pain, where 0 cm defines no pain, and 10 cm defines the maximum intolerable pain. Patients were also assured that they would receive intramuscular injection of pethidine 0.5 mg/kg (to avoid respiratory depression that could result in hypoxia and respiratory arrest and to guarantee sustained prolonged release) once they experienced pain postoperatively (patients with VAS &#x0003e;3) in the gynecological ward. The gynecological ward nurses were familiar with sedation score, VAS, the first analgesic requirement time and adverse effects (e.g., PONV, pruritus) and recorded the scores and side effects on nursing records.</p><p>The general anesthesia technique was standardized for all the patients as well as monitors including 5 lead ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, pulse oximetry and capnography after intubation using Datascope monitors. Neuromuscular function was monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. After establishing an IV line, induction of general anesthesia with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and sleeping dose of propofol followed by rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate orotracheal intubation was done. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen 50% in air and sevoflurane 1%&#x02013;2%. Ranitidine (50 mg/ampoule) was given diluted in 10 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (NS) slowly (IV) over 10 min as a gastroprotective regimen. At the end of the surgery, the residual neuromuscular paralysis was antagonized with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg). After satisfactory recovery, patients were extubated and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) where they were monitored with ECG, NIBP, and pulse oximetry.</p><p>Assessment of patients&#x02019; vitals (HR, MAP), arterial SpO<sub>2</sub>, sedation score, VAS, the first analgesic requirement time, and adverse effects (e.g., PONV, pruritus) were done at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, and 12 h postoperatively.</p><p>PO pain was evaluated at rest based on visual analogue scale, first time to ask for rescue analgesia and total pethidine requirements in 12 hours (mg) postoperatively were recorded.
