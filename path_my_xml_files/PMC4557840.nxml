People with eczema are often keen to try out non-pharmacological therapies like silk therapeutic garments that could reduce itching or the damage caused by scratching. However, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these garments in the management of eczema has yet to be proven. The CLOTHES Trial will test the hypothesis that &#x02018;silk therapeutic garments plus standard eczema care&#x02019; is superior to &#x02018;standard care alone&#x02019; for children with moderate to severe eczema.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Parallel group, observer-blind, pragmatic, multi-centre randomised controlled trial of 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration.</p><p>Three hundred children aged 1 to 15&#x000a0;years with moderate to severe eczema will be randomised (1:1) to receive silk therapeutic garments plus standard eczema care, or standard eczema care alone. Primary outcome is eczema severity, as assessed by trained and blinded investigators at 2, 4 and 6&#x000a0;months (using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)). Secondary outcomes include: patient-reported eczema symptoms (collected weekly for 6&#x000a0;months to capture long-term control); global assessment of severity; quality of life of the child, family and main carer; use of standard eczema treatments (emollients, corticosteroids applied topically, calcineurin inhibitors applied topically and wet wraps); frequency of infections; and cost-effectiveness. The acceptability and durability of the clothing will also be assessed, as will adherence to wearing the garments. A nested qualitative study will assess the views of a subset of children wearing the garments and their parents, and those of healthcare providers and commissioners.</p><p>Randomisation uses a computer-generated sequence of permuted blocks of randomly varying size, stratified by recruiting hospital and child&#x02019;s age (&#x0003c; 2&#x000a0;years; 2 to 5&#x000a0;years; &#x0003e; 5&#x000a0;years), and concealed using a secure web-based system. The sequence of treatment allocations will remain concealed until randomisation and data collection are complete.</p><p>Recruitment is taking place from November 2013 to May 2015, and the trial will be completed in 2016. Full details of results will be published in the National Institute for Health Research Journal series.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN77261365">ISRCTN77261365</ext-link> (registered 11 November 2013).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Eczema</kwd><kwd>Silk</kwd><kwd>Clothing</kwd><kwd>Fabric</kwd><kwd>Atopic eczema</kwd><kwd>Atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Eczema (synonymously atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that affects around one in five children and appears to be increasing in prevalence worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Whilst most cases of eczema can be successfully treated with topical medications, many parents express inconvenience and/or concern in using these preparations and are keen to explore non-pharmacological treatment options.</p><p>Some types of clothing can cause irritation to the skin, and current guidelines recommend the use of loose cotton clothing, and the avoidance of wool and other rough fibres next to the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In response to this need, new clothing products have become available in recent years, with many marketed as having beneficial effects in the treatment of eczema. The therapeutic silk garments included in this study are available on prescription in the UK, at a cost ranging from &#x000a3;35.15 to &#x000a3;52.54 for a child&#x02019;s bodysuit/top and &#x000a3;24.95 to &#x000a3;32.49 for child&#x02019;s leggings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) supporting the use of these garments is currently limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Searching the Global Resource of Eczema Trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (last search date: 19 March 2015), 9 small RCTs assessing the effects of therapeutic clothing have been published to date. Two trials investigated silver-coated textiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; one investigated cellulose fibres with seaweed enriched with silver ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; one investigated an anion textile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; two investigated types of ethylene vinyl alcohol fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and three investigated silk clothing (DermaSilk&#x02122;, Esp&#x000e8;re Healthcare Ltd, Shefford, UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The 3 silk clothing trials were too small (22, 30 and 22 participants respectively) to provide robust evidence and inform clinical practice. Due to the limited evidence available, the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (NIHR HTA) prioritised the need for a large pragmatic trial to establish whether or not silk therapeutic clothing is cost-effective in the management of children with eczema. This led to a funding call in 2011 with the subsequent commissioning of the <underline>CLOTH</underline>ing for the relief of <underline>E</underline>czema <underline>S</underline>ymptoms Trial (CLOTHES ID: 11/65/01). The chosen comparator group was standard eczema care, so that the additional benefits of silk therapeutic clothing as an adjuvant to standard care could be assessed.</p><p>The CLOTHES Trial has been developed with support from the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network, and delivered with assistance from the National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>Research hypothesis: that silk therapeutic clothing plus standard eczema care is superior to standard eczema care alone.</p><p>The primary objective is to assess whether silk therapeutic clothing, when used in addition to standard eczema care, reduces eczema severity in children with moderate to severe eczema over a period of 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to i) estimate the &#x02018;within trial&#x02019; cost-effectiveness of silk therapeutic clothing from a National Health Service (NHS), and separately a family, perspective; ii) to explore parent/guardian and child views on, and experiences of, using silk garments and factors that might influence the use of these garments in everyday life; and iii) to examine prescribers&#x02019;/commissioners&#x02019; views of the use of silk garments, to inform prescribing practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The CLOTHES Trial is a multi-centre, parallel group, observer-blind, pragmatic RCT aiming to recruit 300 children with moderate to severe eczema. Participants are randomised to 2 groups using an allocation ratio of 1:1, and are followed up for a period of 6&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome is eczema severity measured using a validated scale by trained and blinded research nurses at baseline and 2, 4 and 6&#x000a0;months after randomisation.</p><p>Participants randomised to therapeutic clothing are further randomised (1:1) to receive one of the two brands of clothing used in the trial (DermaSilk&#x02122;, Esp&#x000e8;re Healthcare Ltd, Shefford, UK or DreamSkin&#x02122;, DreamSkin Health Ltd, Hatfield, UK).</p><p>At the end of the 6-month RCT, participants in the standard care control arm are provided with silk garments so they have the opportunity to try the garments for themselves, and to encourage retention in the trial. All participants are followed up for a further 2&#x000a0;months (observational period).</p><p>During the first 6&#x000a0;months of trial recruitment, an internal pilot was conducted to assess ability to recruit, adherence with the intervention, and retention in the trial. The criteria for continuation (&#x02265; 50&#x000a0;% recruitment and retention) were met and the main trial has continued as planned. Adherence with the trial intervention, quantified as wearing the trial garments more than 50&#x000a0;% of the time, was also very high amongst trial participants (87.5&#x000a0;%) over this period.</p><p>Alongside the trial, qualitative methods are being used to explore barriers and facilitators to the use of the silk garments amongst participants in the trial (children and their parent/guardian), healthcare professional prescribers, and healthcare commissioners. Participants/parents are invited to take part in interviews/focus groups once their participation in the main trial has ended (8&#x000a0;months). Prescribers and commissioners have been identified via existing professional networks, and structured telephone interviews conducted.</p><p>Flow of participants through the trial is summarised in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_921_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants, interventions and outcomes</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>Recruitment is taking place in five recruiting centres in the United Kingdom: Queen&#x02019;s Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust; Chase Farm Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust and St Mary&#x02019;s Hospital, Isle of Wight NHS Trust.

Also in this age group children are growing rapidly making it likely that they would require replacement garments within the 6-month trial period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants are randomised to receive either standard eczema care plus silk garments, or standard care alone.</p><sec id="FPar3"><title>Silk garments</title><p>The medical device under investigation is a knitted, sericin-free silk therapeutic garment with a CE mark for use in eczema. Sericin is a protein that coats the outside of silk fibres and has the potential to cause allergic reactions. Medical-grade silk (such as silk used for stitches during operations) has the sericin removed for this reason.</p><p>The two products being used are DermaSilk&#x02122; (Esp&#x000e8;re Healthcare Ltd, Shefford, UK) and DreamSkin&#x02122; (DreamSkin Health Ltd, Hatfield, UK), as these were the two brands of silk garments available on prescription at the time of trial design. Participants are instructed to wear the clothing as often as possible during the day and at night. Participants receive three sets of garments (long-sleeved vest and leggings, or body suits and leggings depending on the age of the child). This was thought to be a sufficient number of garments to allow for continual use between washes. Washing instructions are provided in line with manufacturers&#x02019; recommendations.</p><p>The product is prepared at the trial coordinating centre by removing branding labels and packed into blinded, trial-specific packaging. Upon randomisation, garments are sent directly to participants&#x02019; homes from the coordinating centre, to maintain the blinding of local site staff. Garments are replaced as required during the 6-month RCT (e.g. because they are worn out or because the child has grown). Once the randomised part of the trial is complete at 6&#x000a0;months, garments are not replaced.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Standard care</title><p>All participants continue with their standard eczema care in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] including emollients, corticosteroids applied topically and calcineurin inhibitors applied topically. No efforts are made to intervene in or change a child&#x02019;s standard eczema care unless the research nurse thinks that the skin may be infected. If a research nurse suspects infection they recommend that the participant contacts their normal medical team for confirmation of infection and subsequent treatment or change to eczema management.</p><p>If a child is currently using &#x02018;specialist&#x02019; cotton clothing (e.g. special sleep suits with built-in mittens), the use of these garments is recorded, but is not grounds for exclusion.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Adherence</title><p>Adherence to wearing the garments is collected on weekly questionnaires until 6&#x000a0;months and then again at the end of the study (8&#x000a0;months). Participants randomised to standard care plus silk garments have the option of using a sticker or tick chart to record the days and nights when they wear the clothing for the first 6&#x000a0;months. This acts as an aide-m&#x000e9;moire for questionnaire completion.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Concomitant medication</title><p>All participants continue with their standard eczema care; however, they are asked not to start any new treatments for their eczema (other than antibiotics for skin infection) during the period of the trial. Participants are asked to refrain from using other prescription clothing and discouraged from routinely using bandages or wet or dry wrap dressings. Any change to a child&#x02019;s treatment regimen, or use of wet/dry wrapping, is recorded but the child remains in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Core outcome domains for collection in eczema trials have been defined as being eczema signs, eczema symptoms, quality of life and long-term control of flares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The scale captures eczema signs (erythema (redness), excoriation (scratching), oedema/papulation (swelling and fluid in the skin) and lichenification (thickening of the skin)).

A small treatment response could still be worthwhile to the NHS since this non-pharmacological treatment is assumed to have no adverse effects, and eczema is widely prevalent among the general population.

Recruitment has primarily been from dermatology and paediatric allergy clinics at the local sites and through self-referral as the result of direct local advertising (articles in press, radio and TV interviews, websites and forums).

Randomisation is stratified by recruiting hospital and by child&#x02019;s age: &#x0003c; 2&#x000a0;years; 2 to 5&#x000a0;years; and &#x0003e; 5&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Investigators and research nurses access the randomisation website by means of a remote, Internet-based randomisation system developed and maintained by the Nottingham CTU. The sequence of treatment allocations will be concealed until interventions have all been assigned and recruitment, data collection, and all other trial-related assessments are complete.</p><p>After each allocation, the Nottingham CTU coordinating centre is notified so that participants can be informed by letter of their treatment allocation, and receive their supply of therapeutic clothing if appropriate. Upon entry into the trial, participants in the therapeutic clothing arm are further randomly allocated to one of two therapeutic clothing brands available on prescription in the UK. They are not aware which brand of clothing they have received. Packaging, labelling and distribution of clothing is performed by staff at the coordinating centre and sent to participants by post. Sizes are determined by collection of the participant&#x02019;s height at randomisation</p><p>Whilst it is not possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation, efforts have been made to minimise expectation bias by emphasising in the trial documents that the evidence supporting the use of therapeutic clothing for eczema is currently limited, and that we do not yet know if this clothing offers any benefit over standard care. The participant-facing study documents also avoid the use of value-laden terms such as &#x02018;specialist&#x02019; or &#x02018;therapeutic&#x02019; clothing for the same reason.</p><p>Where possible, research nurses remain blinded throughout the trial: participants are reminded in the study literature and in their clinic appointment letters not to wear the clothing when they attend the clinic, or to mention the clothing in any way when talking to the research nurses. All questions relating to the acceptability and use of the clothing are completed by either postal or on-line questionnaire (according to patient preference), and telephone and Email contact with participants is made by trial staff from the coordinating centre whenever possible. If the research nurses become unblinded, this is recorded and will be used to inform a sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Full details of blinding arrangements are summarised (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of blinding status</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Blinding status</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Not blinded</td><td>Not possible to blind participants, efforts will be made to minimise expectation bias</td></tr><tr><td>Research nurses and PI</td><td>Blinded</td><td>Participants will be reminded in their clinic appointment letters not to wear the clothing when they attend the clinic, or to mention the clothing in any way when talking to the research nurses</td></tr><tr><td>Trial staff at Nottingham CTU</td><td>Not blinded</td><td>Will be the main point of contact for participants wishing to contact the research team, will package and post the clothing to the participants according to the randomisation schedule, and will provide general advice</td></tr><tr><td>Statistician</td><td>Blinded</td><td>Statistician will finalise the analysis plan prior to revealing the treatment codes</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>
