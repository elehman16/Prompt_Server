Subjects with fasting plasma glucose concentrations of 100-125 mg/dL, 2 h glucose tolerance test levels of 140-200 mg/dL or both, for &#x0003c;2 months, were defined as eligible individuals. Subjects should have controlled state of glycaemia and lipid profile levels and were allowed to follow their prescribed medications during the study without changing their dosage. Exclusion criteria were defined as smoking; presence of kidney, liver, heart or respiratory disorders or inflammatory intestinal diseases, immune-deficiency disorders, taking antiinflammatory drugs and being in pregnancy or breast - feeding periods. To determine sample size, we used HbA1c as our main marker in another study, which is under review. Sample size was determined based on the primary information obtained from the study by Ejtahed <italic>et al</italic>. using following formula: <inline-graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-5-1239-g001.jpg"/>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] To detect an effect size of 0.7, power of 80% and one-tailed significance level (&#x003b1;) of 0.05, 50 participants (25 participants for each group), were adequate. For expected dropout rate, we increased sample size to 60 (30 per group).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The present study was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Volunteers were randomly assigned to take probiotic or placebo capsules. The randomization process in our study was conducted using blocks of size 2; we matched patients of each block based on age and sex. Subjects were instructed to keep their capsules under refrigeration and take each capsule once a day, after lunch for a period of 8 weeks. We also asked patients to maintain their usual dietary habits and lifestyle, without any medication change.</p><p>Intervention group were asked to take one 500 mg probiotic capsule every day for 8 weeks.

Control group received identical capsules containing starch. In this double-blinded study, the allocation of intervention or control group was concealed, and a nonaware person distributed probiotic and placebo capsules in identical containers, and neither the researchers nor the subjects were aware of the treatment assignments. Study participants received 56 capsules during the study period; 28 capsules in the beginning for the first 8 weeks of trial and 28 4 weeks later (in the middle of the study) for the rest 4 weeks of the study.</p><p>We weekly interviewed participants by telephone calls to monitor their compliance.

Body composition analyzer (Jawon Medical Company, Korea) measured weight while subjects were with light clothes and bare feet and hands, with 0.1 kg precision. Height was measured using a stadiometer with 0.5 cm precision in a normal standing position without shoes (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). body mass index (BMI) was then calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Physical activity levels were estimated through daily physical activity records completed in the beginning, in the middle and end of the intervention. Physical activity levels were calculated as metabolic equivalents/day.</p><p>An expert dietitian took three 24 h dietary recalls in the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the study. Nutritionist 4 software then calculated participants&#x02019; intake of specific nutrients.</p><p>Blood samples were collected after 12 h overnight fasting at the beginning and after 8 weeks. Samples were clotted in a 5-10 min period and then centrifuged at 3500 g for 10 min. Serum total cholesterol (TC) and TG levels were measured by enzymatic and colorimetric methods with Parsazmoon kits (Parsazmoon, Karaj, Iran). To measure serum HDL, other lipoproteins were blocked by antibodies, and HDL was specifically determined by enzymatic methods (Parsazmoon, Karaj, Iran). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was calculated by means of Friedewald formula.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] All the biochemical measurements were done in the laboratory of IUMS, Isfahan, Iran.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured at the first day and last day of the intervention using a mercury sphygmomanometer, in accordance with American Heart Association protocols.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We asked patients to have a 10 min rest before measurement of their blood pressure.</p><p>Ethics Committee of IUMS approved the research process (No. 392157), and written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants prior to commencement of the study (Trial had been registered in the Iranian registry of clinical trials, available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir">http://www.irct.ir</ext-link>, identifier: IRCT2013022411763N5).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We analyzed data using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and numeric variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard errors (SEs).

Mazloom <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that probiotic capsules containing lactic acid bacteria did not have any favorable effects on fasting blood glucose levels, insulin resistance and blood lipids, after 6 weeks of intervention. Other studies show beneficial effects of probiotic consumption in diabetes management: Yadav <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that dahi, a fermented dairy containing lactobacillus bacteria, can delay the onset of glucose intolerance, hyper-insulinemia, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress in high fructose-fed rats. Ataie-Jafari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] evaluated the effects of probiotic yogurt in diabetic subjects. Their study showed that daily consumption of 300 g probiotic enriched-yogurt reduced total and LDL cholesterol concentrations compared with the control group. Moroti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used symbiotic shake, as a combination of probiotics and prebiotics product, in their intervention group. According to their research, 4 week consumption of symbiotic products can decrease serum TC and TG levels and increase HDL-C concentration, significantly. Lewis and Burmeister[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] conducted a study on 80 hypercholestrolemic volunteers who received two capsules containing lactobacillus acidophilus, 3 times a day for 6 weeks. Similar to our results, they could not show any significant effects of probiotics intake on serum blood lipid. In regard to cholesterol lowering effects of probiotics, several mechanisms can be proposed. Fermentation products of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> bacteria, mainly short chain fatty acids, can inhibit enzymatic synthesis of cholesterol, and these bacteria may inhibit absorption of cholesterol by chelating it. They also assimilate and incorporate cholesterol as part of their cell membranes.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It has been demonstrated that some species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> bacteria are able to lower cholesterol levels.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In the present study, we used capsules containing lactobacillus bacteria and Bifidobacteria as well as other strains and ingredients that did not beneficially affect different markers of blood lipids.</p><p>Life-threatening DM complications on one hand and its increasing prevalence, on the other hand, calls for natural and safe strategies to control and delay these outcomes.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes is a strong predictor of diabetes[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and it can put individuals at CVD risk.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Recently it has been documented that patients with type 2 DM show an alteration in their gut microbial composition; therefore, the use of probiotics towards modifying gut microflora become a new way of regulating glucose metabolism.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on blood lipids and lipid ratios as well as blood pressure in persons with pre-DM for 8 weeks, and compare these effects with a placebo group. Probiotic capsules in the present study were able to improve systolic blood pressure compared with the placebo. However, this finding did not exist anymore after adjusting for possible confounders. Results of our study are consistent with results from different animal and human studies demonstrating that probiotic administration contributes to improved systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure or both.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>It seems that probiotic administration in forms of dairy or other food items function more properly than probiotic capsules. The reason for this fact is that people show more enthusiasm for consuming ordinary foods rather than capsules, especially probiotics with lower familiarity for society. On the other hand, participants might have forgotten to take prescribed supplements regularly although the research executors were continuously in touch with study participants. Moreover, we did not use any biochemical marker to assess individuals&#x02019; compliance to prescribed capsules. We did not control other possible probiotic source, especially dairies since they are a part of usual diet and important source for calcium. According to dietary intakes obtained from 24 h. recalls, a probiotic group had lower energy intake from dietary fat that could confound the results although this difference was marginally significant. We noted the point that participants underreported their fat intake since the calculated amounts are below normal levels. Our study has strengths too. Few studies have used purified probiotics in the form of supplements to evaluate their exclusive effects. Numbers of human studies in this area are limited, and most of the trials have done on animals. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was first to evaluate effects of probiotics in prediabetic patients. Our recommendation for future researchers is to control for confounders such as dietary habits, dairy intake and using fermented foods as much as they can and use markers to evaluate patients&#x02019; compliance, stool sampling as a detector of bacteria load. Dosage of probiotic used in our study play effective roles on our results. Studies of larger sample size and during longer duration are suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our study shows that probiotics do not improve TC, LDL-c, TGs, TG/HDL or LDL/HDL although placebo group had increased TG/HDL and decreased HDL-c that differed significantly from probiotic group. Results of our study show that probiotic administration can lead to improvement in systolic blood pressure. However, these effects did not remain significant after adjustment for confounding variables. There is a need for more powerful experiments in this area with more sample size, higher dosage of probiotics and controlling for possible confounders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was extracted from MSc dissertation, approved by Food Security and Research Center and School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (code 392157).
