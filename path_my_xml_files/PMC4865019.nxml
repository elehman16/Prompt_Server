This calls for psychosocial interventions that effectively support caregivers of PwD in daily life and help them handling their care responsibilities.</p><p>Various psycho-social interventions have been developed in recent years for caregivers of PwD, including psycho-education, emotional support, practical assistance, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and multi-component interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Overall, research has shown significant but small effects of current interventions on caregiver outcomes. A common feature in these studies is that outcome measures include retrospective self-assessments that are highly susceptible to emotional and cognitive biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, retrospective methods do not provide information about fluctuations in subjective experiences over time and across situations that caregivers of PwD may face due to the continually changing care demands.</p><p>The Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) is an innovative approach in assessing subjective experiences in real-time within the flow of daily life. ESM consists of a structured diary method in which repeated self-assessments are electronically recorded the moment they occur, in their natural setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ESM offers the possibility to provide a more accurate and detailed view of caregiver functioning, since it enables daily fluctuations in subjective experiences to be explored and it minimizes retrospective recall biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, ESM might be a valuable addition to standard retrospective methods, particularly in older populations with an increased incidence of memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there has been growing interest in adapting ESM to clinical practice. By using modern technology, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and apps, momentary data are immediately available to both caregivers and professionals. This creates the opportunity to develop ESM interventions that provide explicit, visualized feedback on implicit dynamic patterns of feelings, experiences, and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Receiving feedback on behavior can result in emotional and behavioral change, something already known from the field of behavioral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The feedback may help caregivers redirect their behavior towards situations that are conducive to positive emotional experiences. In this way, ESM offers the opportunity to actively involve caregivers in their own empowering process and to provide more personally tailored support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both these aspects have been demonstrated to be essential in effective psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A focus on positive experiences facilitates a more positive interaction between the caregiver and the PwD and increases positive emotions in both the parties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. According to the &#x02018;broaden-and-build theory&#x02019;, positive emotions elevate the ability to cope with stressful situations and might consequently help to increase caregivers&#x02019; feelings of being capable of caring for the PwD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Positive emotions could thus be an important target in caregiver support interventions, increasing caregiver well-being and reducing long-term negative impacts, such as stress and burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, ESM-derived feedback on positive affect was provided to persons with depression during a 6-week intervention period. Its results showed that personalized feedback increased self-awareness and resulted in a significant decline in depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In another ESM study, in which depressed individuals collected ESM data for scientific purposes but without receiving feedback, some participants reported that responding to the ESM questionnaires had already &#x02018;helped them&#x02019; and enhanced their awareness of their daily functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. So far, few studies have applied ESM in caregivers of PwD in the context of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that ESM is a feasible method for use with this often elderly and vulnerable population (van Knippenberg et al.: Dealing with daily challenges in dementia (Deal-id study): an innovative approach to assess caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life, submitted). However, to date, no ESM interventions have been developed to support caregivers of PwD in dealing with daily challenges associated with dementia. This paper describes the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of the ESM-based intervention program &#x02018;Partner in Sight&#x02019; for spousal caregivers of PwD.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims</title><p>The specific objectives of the current study are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Process evaluation</italic> to investigate the internal and external validity of the intervention based on sampling quality (recruitment, randomization, and reach) and intervention quality (relevance, feasibility, and performance according to protocol).

The experimental condition in which caregivers participate in the ESM-intervention &#x02018;Partner in Sight&#x02019; (ESM data collection including feedback) will be compared with a pseudo-experimental condition (ESM data collection without feedback) and a control group (care as usual). Data will be collected pre- and post-intervention and at two- and six-months follow-up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_834_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population will consist of spousal caregivers of community dwelling people with all subtypes and stages of dementia. No age limit will be applied. Participants will be recruited in memory clinics (Maastricht University Medical Center&#x02009;+&#x02009;(MUMC+), Atrium Medical Center Parkstad), ambulatory mental health care institutions (Virenze-RIAGG Maastricht, Lionarons GGZ), dementia day care centers (Sevagram, NOVIzorg, Orbis Glana, Proteion, care farm Ransdalerveld), and caregiver support services (Hulp bij Dementie, Steunpunt Mantelzorg) in the southern region of the Netherlands, and via the website of the Dutch Alzheimer Society. The clinician or care counselor who is involved in the treatment of the PwD will approach caregivers to participate in the study. Subsequently, potential participants will be contacted and screened by the researcher to make sure that they fully meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) being a spousal caregiver of a person with a diagnosis of dementia; (2) sharing a household with the PwD; and (3) informed consent obtained. Exclusion criteria will be: insufficient cognitive abilities to engage in ESM; being overburdened or having severe health problems based on clinical judgment of a knowledgeable practitioner; taking care for a PwD caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), acquired brain injury, Down syndrome, chorea related to Huntington&#x02019;s disease or alcohol abuse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p>Caregivers will be randomly assigned to the experimental group, pseudo-experimental group, or control group. Randomization will be computer-generated and conducted by an independent statistician. Block randomization will be performed to diminish the risk of an unbalanced assignment to the three treatment arms. Randomly permuted blocks with variable block sizes (3, 6, and 9) will be used, by which the block size and specific order will be chosen randomly at the beginning of each block. This reduces the risk of predicting group assignment and keeps research staff blind to the randomization process. The design of this study is single-blind. An independent research assistant, who is being blinded to the treatment allocation, will conduct the baseline, post-intervention and follow-up assessments, and will be asked to evaluate success of blinding and reasons for possible unmasking on the Case Record Form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>ESM procedure</title><p>ESM will be carried out using the PsyMate, an electronic touchscreen device that is specifically designed to monitor experiences and behavior in daily life and that offers the possibility to provide immediate ESM-derived feedback (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psymate.eu/">www.psymate.eu</ext-link>). The PsyMate has been extensively studied and refined in several studies concerning psychiatric populations (e.g. psychosis and depression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a recent ESM study with spousal caregivers of PwD, the PsyMate was considered to be a user-friendly and easily accessible device (van Knippenberg et al.: Dealing with daily challenges in dementia (Deal-id study): an innovative approach to assess caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life, submitted).</p><p>The PsyMate will be programmed to generate ten beeps (sound and vibration) per day at random intervals between 7:30&#x000a0;AM and 10:30&#x000a0;PM. ESM will be used as an assessment tool during the baseline assessment (three consecutive days&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 beeps in total) and the post assessment (three consecutive days&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 beeps in total) to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, ESM will be used as an intervention tool during the 6-week intervention period (three consecutive days per week&#x02009;=&#x02009;10&#x000d7;3&#x000d7;6&#x02009;=&#x02009;180 beeps in total). In order to include different days of the week, the PsyMate will beep alternately on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, or Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday during the intervention period.</p><p>After each beep, caregivers will be asked to complete a questionnaire presented on the screen of the PsyMate, including current affect (four positive affect and eight negative affect items), self-esteem (four items), physical well-being (four items), as well as current context and activities (daily life activities, social company, location and events). At the end of each questionnaire, caregivers will have to indicate whether the beep disturbed them. Answering all questions will take approximately three minutes per beep (van Knippenberg et al.: Dealing with daily challenges in dementia (Deal-id study): an innovative approach to assess caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life, submitted). Additionally, the PsyMate will be programmed to generate a morning and evening questionnaire at the beginning and end of each day. The morning questionnaire consists of six items regarding their sleep quality during the previous night and their current level of energy. The evening questionnaire contains twenty-five items concerning the caregivers&#x02019; daily sense of well-being and competence, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the PwD during that day. Responses will be rated on 7-point Likert scales (ranging from 1 &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to 7 &#x02018;very much&#x02019;), bipolar scales (ranging from &#x02212;3 &#x02018;very unpleasant/very unimportant&#x02019; to +3 &#x02018;very pleasant/very important&#x02019;), a Visual Analogue Scale (ranging from 0 &#x02018;worst imaginable health&#x02019; to 100 &#x02018;best imaginable health&#x02019;), and box-checking formats. Responses cannot be corrected afterwards. An overview of the ESM items with corresponding response choices and concepts is presented in the <xref rid="Sec34" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>. The specific items of the ESM questionnaires were developed and selected according to information available from previous ESM studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], knowledge about the experiences and situations that caregivers of PwD could be expected to encounter in daily life, and the guidelines for item development created by ESM experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, the ESM questionnaires were recently tested in a feasibility study that yielded positive results (van Knippenberg et al.: Dealing with daily challenges in dementia (Deal-id study): an innovative approach to assess caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life, submitted).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study procedure</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Baseline assessment (T0)</title><p>After the randomization procedure, a baseline assessment (T0) will take place in the caregiver&#x02019;s home or at the MUMC+ according to their preference. Participants will be asked by the research assistant to sign the informed consent before continuation of the study procedure. Next, a demographical interview will be conducted to assess caregiver and care recipient characteristics. Additionally, caregivers will be asked to participate in a 3-day ESM baseline measurement, starting the day after the baseline assessment. A 30-min briefing will be provided during the baseline assessment to ensure that they fully understand the procedure and how to operate the PsyMate. A demo questionnaire will be presented to familiarize caregivers with the device and a leaflet containing all relevant information regarding the use of the device will be handed out. Finally, the caregivers will be asked to complete a number of retrospective questionnaires at their own convenience as part of the effect evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention period</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Experimental group</title><p>Caregivers in the experimental group will participate in the 6-week intervention &#x02018;Partner in Sight&#x02019; and collect ESM data for three consecutive days a week. Every two weeks they will receive ESM-derived feedback in a face-to-face session with a coach in their home or at the MUMC+ according to their preference. This sums up to a total of three feedback sessions. The aim of the feedback sessions is to provide an overview of the caregiver&#x02019;s everyday functioning, including their mood (i.e. levels of positive affect), daily life activities, and social interactions. The focus will be on positive rather than negative emotional experiences and how these relate to specific daily contexts. In this way, we try stimulate caregivers to redirect their behavior towards situations that elicit positive emotions.</p><p>At the beginning of each feedback session average levels of positive affect experienced during the past two weeks will be presented. Subsequently, a feedback module on <italic>daily activities</italic> and/or <italic>social interactions in daily life</italic> will be discussed with the caregiver. Feedback modules are based on an existing ESM intervention, which has proven to be effective in people with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During the first feedback session the module &#x02018;<italic>daily activities&#x02019;</italic> will be discussed with the caregiver. The data may, for example, illustrate that positive emotions increase during moments of active relaxation, while the caregiver is actually spending the least amount of time on active relaxation activities. The coach will stimulate caregivers to think about the findings and to implement new insights into their daily lives. In the second feedback session the module &#x02018;<italic>social interactions in daily life&#x02019;</italic> will be added. A caregiver might state, for example, that he prefers to spend his time alone, without any company. The feedback, however, may show that positive emotions are experienced particularly while being in company instead of when being alone. This finding might induce an increase in social interactions, which in turn may lead to increased positive emotions. The third session will combine both modules. At the end of each session the weekly progress in levels of positive affect yielded by daily activities and/or social interactions will be evaluated. A more detailed description of the feedback modules is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Feedback modules of the intervention &#x02018;Partner in Sight&#x02019;</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Feedback Module</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1 Daily activities</td><td>- Pie chart of the average time spent on different activities (e.g. caring for partner, household, active relaxation, passive relaxation, resting, self care) during the past two weeks</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph demonstrating the relationship between different kind of activities and experienced levels of positive affect</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Pie chart of the average time spent on active relaxation in the presence and absence of the PwD</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph showing experienced levels of positive affect during active relaxation in the presence and absence of the PwD</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Pie chart of the average time spent on passive relaxation in the presence and absence of the PwD</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph showing experienced levels of positive affect during passive relaxation in the presence and absence of the PwD</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1 &#x00026; 2 Social interactions</td><td>Added:</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Pie chart of the average time spent in different kinds of company (e.g. partner, friends, family, colleagues, alone) during the past two weeks</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph demonstrating the relationship between different types of social company and experienced levels of positive affect</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1 &#x00026; 2</td><td>See description above</td></tr><tr><td>1,2,3</td><td>General graphs</td><td>- Graph including information on average levels of positive affect during the past two weeks</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph demonstrating the weekly progress in levels of positive affect during the course of the intervention</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph demonstrating the weekly progress in levels of positive affect yielded by daily activities</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>- Graph demonstrating the weekly progress in levels of positive affect yielded by social interactions</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

The SSCQ consists of seven items, rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (agree very strongly) to 5 (disagree very strongly). The items reflect three domains of caregivers&#x02019; feelings of being capable to care for the PwD: satisfaction with their own performance as a caregiver (2 items), satisfaction with the PwD as a care recipient (3 items), and consequences of involvement in care for personal life of the caregiver (2 items). A total sum score (range 7&#x02013;35) will be calculated for each participant. Higher sum scores represent higher levels of sense of competence.

The NPI-Q evaluates twelve neuropsychiatric domains, including: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavioral disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. For each domain, the caregiver answers a screening question to indicate whether the symptom is present or not. If present, the severity is rated on a scale from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). Total sum scores range from 0 to 36. Additionally, a caregiver distress score is rated for each domain on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (not emotionally stressful) to 5 (extremely stressful). The Dutch version of the NPI-Q has been investigated and appears to be a valid instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p><italic>Quality of the relationship:</italic> quality of the relationship will be assessed using four items of the University of Southern California Longitudinal Study of Three-Generation Families measures of positive affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The items represent: general closeness, communication, similarity of views on life, and degree of getting along with each other. Answer scales range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very). Caregivers will answer these items in terms of the current situation and to what extent the relationship changed since illness onset (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;much better, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;much worse).

The RUD-lite assesses both formal and informal resource use, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal point of view. Costs will be calculated by multiplying the quantity of resource use by the cost price per resource unit and will include the period from the baseline assessment until the last follow-up assessment (6&#x000a0;months).

The potential effects of the intervention may help caregivers to keep on caring and prevent them from developing (more) health problems and becoming overburdened. This study contains several unique aspects. To our knowledge, this is the first ESM intervention for caregivers of PwD. ESM might be a promising tool in both research and clinical practice, since it offers the possibility to provide more detailed information on caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life. In this study we will use ESM as an intervention tool, but also as an assessment tool to evaluate the effects of the intervention. Therefore, an important advantage is that the results of this study represent a high level of ecological validity. Another unique aspect is that our intervention focuses on positive rather than negative experiences during the caretaking process. Positive emotions are important facilitators of adaptive coping and might increase caregivers&#x02019; feelings of being capable to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The ESM intervention might enhance caregivers&#x02019; self-awareness and redirect their behavior to situations that are conducive to positive emotional experiences. Moreover, the intervention includes ESM-derived feedback that is tailored to the caregivers&#x02019; personal situation and actively involves them in their own empowering process. Both are known to be important aspects of effective caregiver support interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The inclusion of a pseudo-experimental condition in our study design allows us to unravel the added value of the ESM-derived feedback to the use of the PsyMate in general. Caregivers might benefit from the use of the PsyMate without receiving any feedback, since repeated self-assessments may lead people to pay more attention to their internal states and own behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Lastly, the intervention program will be delivered in daily practice and offers the possibility to be integrated in future clinical practice. The additional process and economic evaluation will provide valuable information on potential facilitators and barriers to implementation, and on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>Certain limitations need to be acknowledged in advance. There is a possibility of sample bias. Although participants will be recruited in a wide range of different institutions, the group that agrees to participate in the study might differ from the group that refuses to participate. In general, participants are expected to be relatively young, more highly educated, and more pro-active in seeking for support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Moreover, recent results from our feasibility study, in which caregiver were asked to collect ESM data for only six consecutive days, showed that a large number of caregivers refused to participate because of a too busy time schedule (van Knippenberg et al.: Dealing with daily challenges in dementia (Deal-id study): an innovative approach to assess caregiver functioning in the flow of daily life, submitted). The even more time-intensive nature of the current study might, therefore, cause a selection bias towards caregivers that are not yet facing extreme difficulties in the caregiving process. It is also expected that a number of participants will drop out of the ESM intervention prematurely. In this specific population, it is likely that participants drop out for specific disease related reasons, such as institutionalization or death of the PwD. In a previous ESM study with persons with depression, 15&#x000a0;% of the participants did not complete the 6-week ESM intervention period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The face-to-face sessions with a coach and the delivery of personalized feedback, however, might increase caregivers&#x02019; motivation to participate given that usual care for dementia caregivers often does not, or very infrequent, include counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study will provide a valuable contribution to the growing knowledge on m-health interventions for caregivers of PwD. Our ESM intervention &#x02018;Partner in Sight&#x02019; is expected to be effective in terms of caregiver well-being and might be an innovative approach to support caregivers of PwD in managing daily challenges during the course of the disease.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The Medical Ethical Committee of the MUMC+ approved this study (#143040).
