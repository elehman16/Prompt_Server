In 2014, approximately 1.2 million new TB cases globally were HIV co-infected; 74% were in Africa (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). TB is responsible for one quarter of deaths among PLHIV (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). TB case fatality rates are 16&#x02013;35% in PLHIV in the absence of ART, compared with 4&#x02013;9% in HIV-negative individuals (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). ART substantially reduces mortality risk by 64&#x02013;95%, and is associated with a reduction in recurrent TB (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Three clinical trials demonstrated that initiating ART early during TB treatment (within 2&#x02013;4 weeks) greatly increases AIDS-free survival by 34&#x02013;68% among individuals with advanced HIV disease (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend ART initiation for all PLHIV as soon as possible after TB treatment initiation, regardless of CD4+ count (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Despite this compelling scientific evidence and strong endorsement by the WHO, data from high-burden, resource-limited countries suggest that when ART is provided to HIV-infected TB patients in programmatic settings, uptake is suboptimal, and few co-infected patients initiate ART within the recommended timeframe (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, retention in ART programs has been limited (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Although studies have described various interventions to address this evidence-to-program gap (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), few have rigorously assessed a combination approach that includes programmatic, structural, and psychosocial interventions that target the various barriers commonly described in the literature (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, there is a need for implementation science research that not only evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination approaches, but also provides information on the acceptability of the interventions from both the patient and provider perspectives, as well as pragmatic information on the implementation process (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Lesotho is a landlocked country surrounded by South Africa with the world's highest TB incidence (852 per 100,000) (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and the second highest HIV prevalence (23%) (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); 72% of TB patients are co-infected with HIV (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The Government of Lesotho has made admirable strides in addressing the dual epidemics. At the time of study start in 2012, 88% of TB patients had a known HIV status and 97% of those diagnosed with HIV were placed on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis; however, the rates of ART initiation and retention during TB treatment remained suboptimal (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>We describe the design of the Start TB Patients on ART and Retain on Treatment (START) Study, a mixed-methods, cluster-randomized implementation science study that aims to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of a combination intervention package (CIP) designed to improve early ART initiation and retention during TB treatment, as well as TB treatment success, among HIV-infected TB patients in Lesotho.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The START Study is a two-arm, mixed-methods, cluster-randomized trial. Twelve health facilities with integrated TB/HIV clinics (the clusters) were randomized to deliver a CIP or standard of care (SOC), following stratification by facility type (hospital or health center).</p><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted in Berea District of the Kingdom of Lesotho, a lower middle income sub-Saharan African country of 2.1 million people (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In 2014, 9,856 cases of all forms of TB were reported. The treatment success rate for new and relapse TB cases registered in 2013 was 70%, short of the WHO's 85% target (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The majority of people in Lesotho receive health care at health centers staffed by nurses, who provide outpatient care and preventive services. Complicated cases are referred to district hospitals. Nurses can initiate TB treatment for smear positive cases at the health center level; smear negative cases are referred to the hospital for evaluation and treatment initiation by a medical officer. At the health center level, TB/HIV services including provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling and the provision of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and ART are well integrated with TB treatment and are provided as one-stop services. At the hospital level, ART is integrated within TB clinics, as per national guidelines. Typically, each clinic providing TB/HIV services is staffed by one to three nurses, plus one or two lay counselors, supported by 20&#x02013;30 village health workers (VHW). TB treatment, ART, and cotrimoxazole are dispensed on-site. Sputum smear microscopy is available through specimen transport to district hospitals by motorbike on a weekly basis.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Policy context and collaboration with the Government of Lesotho</title><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) National Tuberculosis Program was engaged from the study conception and design stage, when applying for funding. This participatory approach (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was adopted to ensure that the study objectives were aligned with MOH priorities for controlling the TB/HIV epidemic. The MOH is represented among the investigative team as well as the Stakeholder Advisory Committee. By engaging the MOH and other key stakeholders early and often in the planning and implementation of the study, we aimed to foster country ownership and maximize the impact of the study's findings on policy and programming.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Facility selection</title><p>Twelve of 17 public health facilities in Berea District were selected for participation. The remaining five health facilities were excluded from the sampling frame because patient volume was very low (on average, fewer than six TB patients notified per quarter). Both hospitals (<italic>N</italic>=2) and health centers (<italic>N</italic>=10) were included to enhance generalizability. A single district was chosen in collaboration with MOH to enhance internal validity by ensuring comparability of health facilities randomized to either study arm, and maximize cost efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20004"><title>Assignment to study arm</title><p>Assignment to a study arm was done at the health facility level as opposed to the individual participant level. Health facilities were stratified by facility type (i.e. hospital or health center), and then numbered sequentially within each stratum. Intervention status was randomly assigned within each stratum by an investigator using SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All HIV-infected TB patients at facilities assigned to the SOC condition received standard of care supported by the Lesotho MOH, while all those enrolled in facilities assigned to the CIP condition received the standard of care plus the intervention package. Given the nature of the interventions, participants, health care workers, and study staff were not blinded to the assigned study arm.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20005"><title>Standard of care</title><p>At health facilities randomly assigned to SOC, the usual procedures for the management of HIV-infected TB patients were followed. Lay counselors offered HIV testing to all TB patients, and integrated treatment for TB and HIV is provided by nurses who are trained in the National Guidelines for Tuberculosis (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). As per national guidelines, HIV-infected TB patients are to be started on ART 2&#x02013;4 weeks after initiating TB treatment, regardless of CD4+ count. There is no standardized, nationally approved curriculum to provide patients with treatment and adherence literacy.</p><p>Directly observed therapy for TB may be provided by a nurse at the health facility, but is generally provided by a treatment supporter, who is usually a family member. Designation of a treatment supporter by the patient is not verified by the nurse. Treatment supporters are not required to accompany patients to clinic visits, and thus often do not receive any education on TB or adherence. VHW are trained to be treatment supporters; however, there is no formal referral system to ensure that patients are linked with them. VHW are minimally supervised, and they communicate infrequently with providers at nearby health facilities.</p><p>TB patients return to the health facility monthly for a 30-day supply of medications and monitoring of side effects and adherence. The tracing of patients lost to follow-up is usually attempted on a quarterly basis but outreach activities are often limited owing to lack of transportation and means of communication.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20006"><title>Combination intervention package</title><p>At health facilities randomly assigned to CIP, the intervention was delivered to all TB/HIV patients during regular clinic visits as part of routine care. All nurses and VHW affiliated with the TB/HIV clinic were trained to implement the CIP. CIP contained programmatic, structural, and psychosocial components, including: 1) nurse training and mentorship in TB/HIV co-treatment, using a clinical algorithm; 2) reimbursement of transportation costs to monthly clinic visits for patients and treatment supporters; 3) health education for patients and treatment supporters by VHW using a treatment literacy curriculum; and 4) real-time adherence support using short message service (SMS) text messaging and trained VHW. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref> shows a comparison of the study arms.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of study arms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard of care (SOC)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Combination intervention package (CIP)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training on national TB guidelines for nurses</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ART provision to TB/HIV patients in integrated clinics</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient-identified treatment supporter for TB treatment</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nurse training and mentorship in TB/HIV co-treatment using a clinical algorithm</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reimbursement of transportation costs to monthly clinic visits for patients and treatment supporters</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health education for patients and treatment supporters by village health workers using TB/HIV treatment literacy curriculum</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real-time adherence support using automated SMS text messages and trained village health workers</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Programmatic components of CIP: nurse training and mentorship in TB/HIV co-treatment, using a clinical algorithm</title><p>All nurses working in CIP clinics participated in a 2-day training on the scientific evidence and guidelines regarding treatment of TB/HIV co-infection, the importance of early ART initiation during TB treatment to improve survival, and use of a clinical algorithm to manage TB/HIV patients. Job aids, such as laminated desk charts and posters depicting the algorithm, were provided for each consultation room to support intervention delivery. Clinic nurses used the algorithm to initiate ART; monitor for adherence, treatment response, and side effects; and diagnose and manage adverse events, including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Nurses explained to TB/HIV patients that ART can improve survival, encouraged ART initiation, and referred patients to the facility-based lead village health worker (LVHW) for further education. Nurses also delivered specific adherence messages and assessed ART and TB treatment adherence at follow-up visits, referring patients to the LVHW for additional adherence counseling. A nurse program monitor visited the clinics two to three times per month to provide ongoing mentorship in TB/HIV co-treatment to the clinic nurses and LVHW and provided refresher training as needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural component of CIP: reimbursement of 
transportation costs</title><p>TB/HIV patients initiating ART were asked to bring their treatment supporter to their monthly clinic visits, so that they could participate in education and counseling sessions with the LVHW, and discuss any adherence problems. Both patients and treatment supporters were reimbursed for transportation costs in the amount of 15 loti (approximately 1.4 USD) after each clinic visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Psychosocial components of CIP</title><p>Psychosocial components of CIP were delivered by VHW, whose role encompassed social support, system navigation, referrals, and advocacy. VHW responsibilities included providing information; communicating with patients; encouraging ART initiation, adherence to ART and TB treatment, and retention in care; offering support and empathy; providing referrals; and advocating for patients. In order to improve VHW oversight and coordination, one to two VHW were assigned to be LVHW at each facility, according to patient volume. LVHW were chosen by a joint committee of their peers and the nurse in charge, and received a monthly stipend of 750 loti (approximately 70.0 USD). All VHW completed a 4-day training in both didactic learning and interactive techniques, including case studies and role-playing to develop skills. LVHW completed an additional 2 days of training on their additional responsibilities at the health facility, as well as their role supervising VHW in the community.</p><p>LVHW assigned new TB/HIV patients initiating ART to a community-based VHW, who provided adherence support between clinic visits. VHW conducted home visits and contacted patients by phone, weekly for the duration of TB treatment, to discuss adherence and side effects. They also followed up with patients who missed clinic appointments, contacting the LVHW or nurse for guidance when necessary, and linked patients with community-based services as needed. VHW were provided with airtime vouchers (40 loti, approximately 3.7 USD) each month.</p><p>LVHW used a TB/HIV treatment literacy curriculum to provide group health education sessions at the health facility. They also met individually with TB/HIV patients and their treatment supporters to provide ART preparation and adherence counseling for the duration of their TB treatment. A scripted, illustrated flipchart was developed for LVHW. It provides information on the natural history of HIV, importance of early ART initiation, use of TB and antiretroviral medications, common side effects, and the importance of adherence. In response to an expressed need from LVHW, a second flipchart that provides information on and support for HIV disclosure was also developed.</p><p>In addition, LVHW enrolled TB/HIV patients initiating ART and their treatment supporters in an automated text messaging system supported by Dimagi Commcare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dimagi.com/">www.dimagi.com/</ext-link>), using a customized mobile phone application. This system sent text messages in Sesotho, including medication adherence messages and appointment reminders. Adherence messages used code words (Did you eat your meal today?) to protect patients&#x02019; confidentiality. They were sent on a daily basis during the first month of ART, then on a patient-specified schedule (daily or weekly) for the remainder of TB treatment. Appointment reminders were sent 2 and 1 day prior to each clinic visit. The time of day for all messages was chosen by the recipient. LVHW described text messaging in detail and practiced receiving text messages with patients and treatment supporters until they felt comfortable with the technology. LVHW also dispensed airtime vouchers (40 loti, approximately 3.7 USD) to patients and treatment supporters at their monthly clinic visits, so that they were able to communicate with their VHW or nurse in case of difficulties.</p><p>In addition, LVHW managed the clinic appointment system, including scheduling appointments, checking the appointment book to confirm attendance, and notifying the assigned VHW if any patients missed their appointments. They escorted patients to other services at the health facility when needed. They also supervised the VHW in the community on a weekly basis using a standardized checklist, and held monthly meetings with the VHW and clinic nurses at the health facility to discuss patient challenges.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0002-S20007"><title>Study participants</title><p>The different groups of study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Participants. <italic>All newly registered TB/HIV patients</italic> at study sites in both conditions are represented by the large circle; those who initiated ART during the first 2 months of TB treatment (ART early initiators) are depicted in blue, while those who did not initiate ART or initiated ART after the first 2 months of TB treatment (ART non/late initiators) are depicted in green.

Secondary outcomes include: 1) time to ART initiation, 2) ART adherence, 3) change in CD4+ count, 4) sputum smear conversion, 5) TB treatment adherence, 6) cost-effectiveness, and 7) acceptability. All outcomes pertain to the individual participant level. ART initiation is defined as the percentage of TB/HIV patients newly registered during the period of observation who initiated ART during TB treatment, based on review of clinic records. ART retention is defined as the percentage of measurement cohort participants who attended their 6-month clinic visit (within a 1-month window) and reported ART use. Deaths and transfers will be considered not retained. TB treatment success is defined as the percentage of TB/HIV patients whose TB treatment outcome is documented in the TB register or treatment card as treatment completion or cure, as defined by the WHO (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Time to ART initiation will be expressed as the number of days from TB treatment initiation to ART initiation. Adherence is determined separately for ART and TB treatment and defined by the percentage of total prescribed doses ingested, averaged across medicines for each month of treatment, from the unannounced pill counts. Change in CD4+ count is defined as the difference in CD4+ count 6 months after TB treatment initiation. Sputum smear conversion is defined as the percentage of smear positive pulmonary TB cases that converted to smear negative after 8 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Incremental cost-effectiveness will be estimated as the ratio of the incremental costs of the CIP per ART initiation, retention, and TB treatment success. Acceptability of intervention components will be characterized via in-depth qualitative analysis and interpretation (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref> lists the study outcomes for each group of participants.</p><table-wrap id="T0002" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Study outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study outcome</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All TB/HIV patients</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measurement cohort</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Key informants &#x02013; ART early initiators</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Key informants &#x02013; ART non/late initiators</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Key informants-health care workers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ART initiation<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF0001">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ART retention<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF0001">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB treatment success<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF0001">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time to ART initiation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ART adherence</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change in CD4+ count</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB treatment adherence</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sputum smear conversion</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incremental cost-effectiveness</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acceptability of intervention components</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reasons for ART non/late initiation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF0001"><label>a</label><p>Primary outcomes.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="S0002-S20012"><title>Sample size and power calculations</title><p>Power calculations for all TB/HIV patients were based on our primary outcomes ART initiation and TB treatment success.

When the study was designed, available data demonstrated that only 27% of HIV-infected TB patients in Lesotho had received ART, and the TB treatment success rate was 70% for new smear positive cases, 64% for new smear negative and extrapulmonary cases, and 62% for retreatment cases (HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases combined) (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

In addition, when measuring adherence in the measurement cohort, an as-treated analysis will be used to exclude participants who died or discontinued medications due to adverse events. Generalized linear mixed models (Proc Glimmix procedures in SAS v9.3 with a random intercept for study site) will be applied to test for a difference between study arms for dichotomous (ART initiation, ART retention, TB treatment success, sputum smear conversion) and continuous (ART adherence, change in CD4+ count, TB treatment adherence) outcomes; frailty models (Proc Phreg procedures in SAS v9.3 with random intercept for study site) will be utilized for time to event analysis (time to ART initiation) to account for the clustering of characteristics that may occur among patients attending the same study site. These approaches will provide appropriate adjustments to the standard errors accounting for potential non-independence of observations (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Models will include fixed effects for study condition, patient characteristics, time-varying adherence measures and CD4+ count (for change in CD4+ count) and random effects for site. Participants who transferred to another site before ART initiation will be censored, and death before ART initiation will be treated as a competing risk.</p><p>For the cost-effectiveness analysis, a model will be created to estimate the incremental cost of CIP relative to SOC. The costs will be composed primarily of the variable costs involved in training nurses and convening VHW, but will also include the costs of administering SMS messages and the fixed costs involved in administering the intervention. The incremental cost-effectiveness of CIP will be estimated as the ratio of the incremental costs to incremental effectiveness with effectiveness measured in terms of the study's primary outcomes.</p><p>For analysis of acceptability of the CIP, two investigators will independently review the first five interviews from each group of key informants to develop a preliminary checklist of codes using a grounded theory framework (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The individual checklists will be compared and reconciled to create a coding dictionary, which will be used by the study team to independently code each interview. Additional codes will be added if they emerge in the analysis of subsequent interviews. Codes will accordingly serve as building blocks for qualitative concepts and themes. Themes will be cross-checked to enhance inter-rater reliability, and negative case analysis and critical reflexivity will be used to strengthen analytic credibility (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).

The study utilizes an implementation science framework to not only assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the combination approach, but also provide information on the acceptability of the interventions from both the patient and provider perspectives, as well as pragmatic information on the implementation process. The study interventions target known programmatic, structural, and psychosocial barriers to early ART implementation in high-burden, resource-limited settings, and were selected for their promise, practicality, and feasibility of implementation and scale-up in TB/HIV programs in diverse contexts. The goal of this study is to improve health outcomes among PLHIV in Lesotho, and generate generalizable knowledge that could be applied to similar high-burden, resource-limited settings.</p><p>We used a cluster-randomized design for a number of reasons. First, the delivery of study interventions at the health facility level is conducive to the study's implementation science approach as it mimics the way in which the CIP would be delivered outside of a study setting. In addition, it was considered more feasible for the clinic staff to provide all patients at the site with the same intervention package, rather than deliver the CIP to some patients and not others, which would be the case in an individual-randomized design. Furthermore, though there were no data to support that the CIP would be superior to the SOC, individual randomization might have resulted in some patients randomized to SOC feeling that they were receiving substandard care, which in turn might have influenced their engagement in care and, consequently, the key study outcomes of ART initiation and retention.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, the cluster-randomized approach permits the causal attribution of observed outcomes to the CIP by comparing them to the counterfactual scenario, while reducing selection bias (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Second, the use of mixed methods (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), whereby the collection and analysis of quantitative data is followed by the utilization of qualitative research tools in a sequential explanatory phase, will allow us to evaluate the acceptability and utilization of intervention components, and collect reasons for the lack of or late initiation of ART in TB/HIV patients. Third, the participatory approach, with meaningful stakeholder engagement in both the design and implementation phases, has fostered MOH ownership at the national and district levels, and will help to ensure the successful integration of study findings in policy and programmatic contexts. In addition, we are testing an innovative, multifaceted intervention that builds on the evidence base of prior scientific work, while addressing the diverse barriers to ART initiation and retention in TB/HIV patients. Finally, the selected study sites have adequate heterogeneity, covering facilities in both urban and rural locations in low-land, foothill, and mountainous areas, which will strengthen the external validity of findings.</p><p>The limitations of the study design include the potential for unanticipated health system inefficiencies to impact CIP implementation, including interruptions in health care worker availability, laboratory commodities, and drug supplies. However, any changes in these elements are likely to be similar across study arms and reflect system dynamics captured in implementation science. In addition, the reliance on routinely collected programmatic data for some study outcomes means that data may be incomplete for some study participants. Standardized data quality assurance procedures implemented at all study sites aim to mitigate the amount of missing data. Furthermore, as the study is limited to one district, there is the potential for contamination and migration, which would result in a decrease in power to detect a difference between study arms. However, given the goal of assessing CIP effectiveness in a health systems context, it is important to evaluate the impact in realistic programmatic scenarios, while seeking to understand the findings by monitoring spillover and crossover through process documentation. Last, the study design precludes evaluation of the effectiveness of individual components of the CIP, which would require a considerably larger sample size. However, qualitative results will highlight patient and provider perspectives on the utility of various intervention components, and process data will demonstrate utilization of each study intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The START Study aims to improve early ART initiation and retention during TB treatment. Achieving this goal will result in improved health outcomes among PLHIV as well as reduced HIV and TB transmission in the population.
