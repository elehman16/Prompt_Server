The surface of each biopsy needle cannula was cleaned with fine sandpaper (no. 4000) and then subjected to electrochemical etching (connected as the anode [&#x02212;]) for 15 seconds in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (1:1, vol/vol). After thorough rinsing with distilled water and shaking off excess water, the distal part of each cannula (5 cm long) was immersed in the PVA solution and dried in a stream of warm air. The coating and drying process was repeated once more and the needle was covered with cap and stored in the fridge before further application.</p><p>After the coating process, 20 DEBNs have been randomly separated into 3 groups in a 1:2:1 ratio.

The most popular representative of this group is ciprofloxacin, which is still widely used as prophylaxis mainly due to its good prostatic penetration, oral dosage, and safety profile.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In 2011, Batura <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated a significant reduction in postbiopsy infectious complications by adding amikacin to ciprofloxacin in TRUS-Bx prophylaxis.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The combination has been proposed based on microbiological analysis that showed high susceptibility of urine and bloodstream isolates to amikacin in patients undergoing TRUS-Bx. However, this combined prophylactic protocol is not commonly used, even though its effectiveness has been confirmed by other authors.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> One of the main reasons for this is the lack of an oral form of amikacin as well as the need for systemic administration of 2 antibiotics which complicates the prophylaxis and exposes the patient to potential complications.</p><p>The broad antibacterial spectrum of combined amikacin and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis as well as attempts of their intraprostatic injections rise to the concept of the DEBN. With this solution, antibiotics released from the surface of the biopsy needle may act in the prostatic tissue contaminated by rectal flora.</p><p>Drug-eluting biopsy needles have been coated with PVA. This is a water-soluble synthetic polymer which allows the incorporation and release of ciprofloxacin and amikacin in a relatively short time of TRUS-Bx.</p><p>The HPLC analysis revealed that both studied antibiotics were released from DEBNs in physiological saline. Relatively low CV and SD values of antibiotic concentrations released from needles (from group I) may indicate a repeatable methodology of DEBN coating process. For all experiments, only 5-cm-long parts of DEBNs were coated with an antimicrobial layer. This was due to the assumption that the length of a biopsy needle inserted into the prostate tissue usually will not exceed this dimension.</p><p>The injection simulation test (group II) showed gradual and stable release of amikacin and ciprofloxacin from DEBNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533034617722080">Figure 2</xref>). However, the dynamics of antibiotic release in saline probably not fully reflects the real situation during TRUS-Bx due to different friction forces. The average concentration rates exceeded the S value for <italic>E coli</italic> established by EUCAST from first to ninth immersion for amikacin and in all immersions for ciprofloxacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533034617722080">Figure 2</xref>). Despite that the average concentration rates of amikacin did not exceed S value in the last 3 immersions, the simultaneous use of amikacin and ciprofloxacin may reduce the number of infectious complications associated with TRUS-Bx. These results provide further support for the high likelihood of therapeutic success of DEBNs.</p><p>The above data correlated well with the bacterial growth inhibition test where large zones of <italic>E coli</italic> inhibition surrounding DEBNs (group III) have been observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1533034617722080">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the fact that the strain used in experiment (ATCC 25922) is a multidrug-sensitive <italic>E coli</italic> strain (commonly used in quality control study), the inhibitions zones are the result of simultaneous bacteriostatic activity of amikacin and ciprofloxacin. The probable positive effect of such DEBNs for fluoroquinolone-resistant strains was not confirmed. This is a certain limitation of the study. However, it can be expected that all amikacin susceptible strains should also be included in its effect due to the level of amikacin release proved in HPLC analysis.</p><p>The expected clinical benefits of DEBN include single-stage drug release during biopsy, combined antibiotic prophylaxis, precise operation in the area of potential infection, smaller doses of administered drugs, and potentially decreased infection rates. This, however, cannot be deduced from the <italic>in vitro</italic> study and needs to be tested in a clinical trial.</p><p>The clinical proof of DEBN&#x02019;s efficacy may be associated also with cost-effectiveness of this solution. Affordable price of coating technology and high costs of management of TRUS-Bx-related infections should be compared with the reduction in infections rates. Adibi <italic>et al</italic> who performed analysis of fluoroquinolones-based versus intensive antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUS-Bx stated that second regimen was substantially more cost-effective even if it is more expensive.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1533034617722080" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p><p>In addition to the use of DEBN as TRUS-Bx antimicrobial prophylaxis, this idea may be used in other applications such as biopsy of other organs or the use of different drugs with, for example, analgesic, antibleeding, or anti-inflammatory activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-1533034617722080"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The HPLC analysis and the bacterial growth inhibition test showed that DEBNs released high concentrations of amikacin and ciprofloxacin and have strong bacteriostatic activity against <italic>E coli</italic>. Adopting this novel strategy for antimicrobial prophylaxis may reduce the rate of infectious complications related to transrectal prostate biopsy. However, the clinical introduction of DEBN requires further studies on stabilization of the active layer and increasing the amount of released drugs during multiple injections. Confirmation of its preventive role, in terms of infectious complications after TRUS-Bx, has to be evaluated in a clinical trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-1533034617722080"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1533034617722080"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn999-1533034617722080"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Marcin Sieczkowski, MD, FEBU <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0837-9863">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0837-9863</ext-link>
