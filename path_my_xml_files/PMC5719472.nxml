This includes conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities (World Health Organization, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Developmental disorders and delays are a public health priority and are included in the World Health Organisation mental health Gap programme (WHO mhGAP) to bridge the treatment gap for priority mental health conditions in low resource settings (Dua <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). WHO mhGAP guidelines recommend Parents Skills Training (PST) for developmental disorders and delays.</p><p>Based upon the findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature WHO has developed a PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays (Reichow <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Two key features of WHO PST are (a) the programme takes a task-shifting approach where non-specialists including social workers, nurses, teachers, community volunteers, caregivers and parents can deliver this programme in community-based facilities or schools to the families of children with developmental disorders and delays (b) it takes a trans-diagnostic approach &#x02013; it addresses a range of different developmental disorders and conditions and does not require an expert diagnosis of developmental disorders and delays to qualify treatment. However fragile health systems, lack of funding and lack of trained health personnel remain the key bottlenecks to scale up and sustainability of such priority public health intervention packages in low resource settings (Eaton <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these challenges, we developed an integrated model of service delivery (incorporating social, technological and business innovations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) for children with developmental disorders and delays in low resource settings (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). An android application was developed to incorporate the WHO mhGAP-IG diagnostic and management guidelines and WHO PST for developmental disorders and delays in a standardised way. The intuitive tablet-based training and intervention delivery tool can be used to deliver evidence-based interventions in low resource settings by non-specialist. The model was found to be feasible, acceptable and resulted in change in client outcomes. The proof of concept of the integrated model of service delivery has already been published (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

(2) Can the WHO PST programme improve child's social communication and joint engagement with caregivers, improve child's social and emotional well-being, improve family empowerment, and result in better caregiver's health related quality of life? (3) Can the integrated model of service delivery for developmental disorders and delays (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) serve as a scalable method of delivering WHO PST programme in low resource settings? (4) What factors can inhibit and promote the large-scale implementation of WHO PST programme for developmental disorders and delays?</p><p>The primary effectiveness hypothesis is that WHO PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays plus Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU) is superior to ETAU alone in improving functioning in children with developmental disorders and delays in rural Rawalpindi.</p><p>Secondary effectiveness hypotheses are that WHO PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays is associated with improvements in child's social communication and joint engagement with the caregiver, Child's social and emotional well-being, family empowerment, care giver's health related quality of life and reduction in family's stigmatizing experiences.</p><p>Primary implementation hypothesis is that the integrated model of service delivery for WHO PST program is a feasible, acceptable, appropriate implementation strategy that results in fidelity, adoption and penetration of the parents&#x02019; skills training program and increases the reach of evidence-based services for families and children with development disorders and delays in low resource settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study settings</title><p>Study will be conducted in 30 rural Union Councils (UCs)-the smallest administrative units- of sub-district Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi district, Pakistan (approximate population 1 million). Sub-district Gujar Khan, representative of northern Punjab and Pothohar region, is a rural sub-district situated about 35&#x000a0;km south east of the Rawalpindi city.</p><p>Each UC has a Basic Health Unit (BHU) that provides health care to local population. BHU is staffed by a medical doctor, a dispenser, 15&#x02013;20 Lady Health Workers (LHWs) working under supervision of Lady Health Supervisor, Lady Health Visitor, and a Vaccinator. Nearest specialist mental health care facility is the Institute of Psychiatry, Rawalpindi. One public special education school for children with special needs caters to the needs of children with all kinds of special needs in Gujar Khan.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Design</title><p>The trial is defined as an effectiveness implementation hybrid cluster randomised trial-type II because the focus of evaluation is the effectiveness of intervention delivery and implementation strategies at scale. This is the appropriate design to use because there is evidence to support the feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, appropriateness of the implementation strategies in the proposed settings (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There is evidence on the effectiveness of WHO PST program strategies (Reichow <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rahman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2016<italic>a</italic></xref>). However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of intervention and implementation strategies at scale. This will be the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of scaled up implementation of WHO PST program in real world settings.</p><p>The first and second research questions will be answered by single blind cluster randomised control trial (cRCT) with two arms. Implementation effectiveness will be evaluated using the updated implementation research framework of Proctors <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and the RE-AIM framework (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://re-aim.org/">http://re-aim.org/</uri>). We will use the Applied Mental Health Research Dissemination and Implementation (AMHR D&#x00026;I) measurements to collect data at organization, provider and consumer levels post program implementation (AMHRG, personal communication). We will calculate the RE-AIM basic and summary indices on implementation outcomes. Quantitative and qualitative techniques will be utilised to supplement the implementation data. Data will be gathered from the implementation checklists (number of family volunteer trained, number of Family Networks established, tracking attendance of sessions and implementation and intervention fidelity) completed during the trial and through process evaluation during and after intervention delivery.</p><p>A cRCT design having UC as the unit of randomisation was preferred. Randomising smaller units, for example villages within the UCs, would lead to contamination and spillage of information in between the intervention and control villages. Hence, randomising a UC could reduce the probability of contamination between the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>WHO PST programme delivered by family volunteers</title><p>The core of the intervention is the WHO PST programme delivered within the broader context of WHO mhGAP programme implementation in Pakistan. WHO PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays (field trial version 1.0) consists of eight sessions delivered in group format by a lay-facilitator. The PST Programme aims to provide evidence-based PST for caregivers of children with developmental disorders and delays that can be implemented locally in low- and middle-income countries. The primary aims of the programme are to promote better understanding and acceptance of developmental disorders and developmental delays and help parents apply skills that promote child development, communication and functioning. The secondary aims of the programme include strengthening caregivers&#x02019; coping skills and psychological well-being, and promoting child adaptive behaviours. It is expected that the programme will facilitate stigma reduction against persons with developmental disorders and result in increased inclusion and participation of children with developmental disorders and delays. The WHO PST programme is available on request.</p><p>Following the WHO PST adaptation guide, we adapted the pre-publication draft of the WHO PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays for implementation in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The adapted WHO PST programme for children with developmental disorder and delays delivered by family volunteers <italic>consists</italic> of nine weekly sessions. It is delivered by a &#x02018;champion&#x02019; family volunteer in group settings through the use of intuitive tablet-based android application that serves as a training, intervention-delivery and monitoring tool. The key psycho-educational contents (&#x02018;key messages&#x02019; and strategies) of PST have been incorporated into &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; narratives of the lives of three children with developmental disorders, their family members, and other supporting characters. An artist has converted the characters into &#x02018;Avatars&#x02019; (graphic image representing each character) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), which are used to voice the narrative scripts. The details of the service delivery model and training, supervision and monitoring tool have been described elsewhere (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

These are parents or caregivers of children with developmental disorders and delays, have at least eight grades of formal education, are voluntarily willing to be trained and supervised by the trainers for at-least 6 months duration of the programme and cascade the training to 4&#x02013;5 families in their villages. Our earlier work has established that lay health workers can deliver evidence-based psychological interventions in Pakistan (Rahman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2016<italic>b</italic></xref>). The training and supervision of champion family volunteers will follow a cascade model (Murray <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The training in the WHO PST will be delivered using an android application hosted on a tablet device. The master trainers will train 10 trainers in the WHO PST programme. The training will consist of 10 days class-room training followed by case studies under the supervision of master trainer. The master trainer will perform live competency rating of the trainers on the case studies using an adapted version of ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors (ENACT) for PST for developmental disorders and delays (Kohrt <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The trainers have all completed at-least Masters in Clinical Psychology and have at-least 1 year of experience in working with children and families with developmental disorders and delays.</p><p>Only competent trainers (having mean score of 2.5 on each domain of ENACT adapted for WHO PST programme competency and fidelity rating) will be allowed to train and supervise champion family volunteers. The trainers will cascade down the training to the champion family volunteers using tablet-based tool, who will, then, deliver the PST programme to the 4&#x02013;5 families under their care in local villages.</p><p>The champion family volunteers will be supervised by the trainers, who will be supervised by the master trainers on monthly basis. The fidelity of program delivery will be established by the master trainers by rating a random sample of sessions using the ENACT adapted for WHO PST program.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Enhanced treatment as usual</title><p>Treatment as usual in primary healthcare centres in Rawalpindi for childhood developmental disorders usually consists of no treatment, or a range of alternate treatment regimes, such as multi-vitamin syrups and tablets. Evidence-based mental health care is currently not available in primary healthcare centres. For this study, the treatment as usual is enhanced in two ways:(a) LHWs in the ETAU arm will receive training in recognising signs and symptoms of developmental disorders and delays and making referrals to their primary care physicians for treatment; and (b) These primary care physicians will receive training in mhGAP developmental disorders standard module by the specialist at Institute of Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Center for mental health in Pakistan.</p><p>If, during this treatment or during the study's assessments participants in ETAU arm show severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis, uncontrolled epilepsy) or problems (e.g. behavioural problem) that require immediate specialist treatment and follow-up, they will be referred to the child mental health facility at the Institute of Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Center. The ETAU group will receive treatment when both arms will complete their follow up evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Participants&#x02019; recruitment</title><sec id="sec3-3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Children aged between 2 and 12 years residing in the study area for the duration of the study will be invited to participate in the trial. Inclusion criteria are as follows:

HDRF has a database of about 3000 families and children with developmental disorders and delays gathered by interactive voice response (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and snowballing sample technique as a part of the Foundation's service delivery to the community.</p><p>For the purpose of the trial we will need to identify 540 parent-child dyads from within 30 clusters (18 parent-child dyads from each cluster) to complete baseline and endpoint assessments. However according to the existing database of children, we expect that in each UC/cluster there will be more than 18 children fulfilling the eligibility criteria. For the purpose of the trial, within each UC, evaluation zones will be made to assess the impact of PST programme for children with developmental disorders and delays delivered by family volunteers.</p><p>These evaluation zones will be made by randomly selecting one LHW out of the total 15&#x02013;20 LHWs serving a particular UC. The random selection will be carried out by an independent researcher not involved in the trial using a simple random table. If the required number of dyads is not completed from one LHW catchment area, we will include the catchment areas of adjacent LHW to reach the required sample size from each UC. This patch of contiguous area/catchment areas of LHWs within that UC will serve as the impact evaluation zone for our trial related outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Randomisation</title><p>As it is a cRCT, unit of randomisation is cluster. Each cluster is the smallest administrative unit, called UC. Thirty UC clusters will be randomised to the intervention and control arms on a 1:1 allocation ratio using a permuted-block randomisation method. SAS PROC PLAN is carried out to generate a randomisation list by an independent statistician based at University of Liverpool. Allocation of clusters will be carried out by an independent person not involved in the conduct of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Informed consent</title><p>The trained research team along with LHW will approach the families within the evaluation zones of the UCs to seek informed consent for participation in the trial. For the families who consent for participation in the trial, the research team will evaluate caregiver-child dyad against trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline assessments will be completed for consenting parent-child dyads. LHW will inform the families about the allocation status. Families randomised to intervention arm will be organised into networks with one champion family volunteer for 5&#x02013;7 families. A record of outcome of screening, assessment against eligibility criteria, and reasons for refusal will be maintained for those who do not consent for participation in the trial. At the endpoint, researcher will verbally reaffirm the consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Sample and power calculations</title><p>The effect size estimates for the primary outcome measure (WHODAS-Child) are informed by the results of the pre-post feasibility study in Pakistan (Hamdani <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and are in line with the effect sizes reported in a recent WHO supported systematic review of literature for non-specialist delivered psychosocial interventions for developmental disorders in lower middle income countries (Reichow <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>We aim for a conservative effect size estimate of 0.35 for the primary and secondary outcome measures in the definitive cluster randomised trial.</p><p>We propose to recruit a sample of 540 parent-child dyads in 30 clusters (on average 18 parent-child dyad per cluster), equally distributed among the intervention and control arms. This will give 93% power at 5% two sided significance level with an ICC of 0.01 and will account for 15% attrition rate.</p><p>Since the study addresses developmental disorders and delays, which are manifested in multiple ways, we expect the clusters to be heterogeneous with respect to diagnosis, severity, age and co-morbid conditions, hence we have chosen a lower value of ICC of 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8"><title>Outcomes evaluation</title><p>Baseline and end point assessments (6 months post intervention) on the sample of 540 parent-child dyads will be conducted by the trained research assessment team blind to the allocation status of the trial participants. Research assessment team is trained in administration of all outcome assessment tools, interviewing techniques, and principles of good clinical practices. The assessments will be completed at a venue of participant's choice-either at their own house, or the LHWs house called the &#x02018;Health House&#x02019; or at any other household within the community.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-9"><title>Primary intervention effectiveness outcome</title><sec id="sec3-9-1"><title>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule Child Version (WHODAS- Child 2.0)</title><p>The WHODAS is a 36-item questionnaire measuring functioning and disability.

However, robust scientific evaluation of the programme and its implementation strategy is mandatory before making it publically available. The WHO PST is being tested in 13 different sites across the globe including Pakistan. This is the first definitive evaluation of the WHO PST Programme in low resource setting. The current study is unique in that it incorporates evidence-based intervention strategies with social, technological and business innovations for sustainable and scalable delivery in real world settings.
