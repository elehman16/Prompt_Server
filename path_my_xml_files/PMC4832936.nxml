They will suffer a series of physical and psychological symptoms, from the fluctuation in sex hormones or decrease in their levels before and after postmenopause. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been widely accepted as actively preventing osteoporosis after postmenopause, and relieving the syndromes associated with perimenopause and postmenopause. Thus, HRT can effectively improve the quality of life after menopause. However, the relationship between HRT and breast cancer is still in dispute, and has associated risks such as apoplexy and venous thrombosis,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] limiting its application in women with related risk factors. Nonhormonal drugs are well accepted owing to their limited side effects. <italic>Cimicifuga foetida</italic> (<italic>C. foetida</italic>) extract has been approved as a nonprescription drug for the treatment of early menopausal and perimenopause syndromes. In recent years, <italic>C. foetida</italic> has been used as a plant medicine in the domestic market; it is extracted from <italic>C. foetida</italic> and triterpenoid saponin is the main ingredient. Clinical trials have demonstrated that <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract was effective in alleviating the climacteric complaints of menopausal women.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the present study, ultrasonic technology was used to achieve the following: Monitor breast changes occurring during the clinical treatment of postmenopause related syndromes; evaluate the ultrasonic parameters before treatment, after 1-year of treatment and after 2 years of treatment in early postmenopausal women receiving <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract, estradiol valerate + medroxyprogesterone, and estradiol valerate + progesterone soft capsule therapy; and to evaluate the safety of the drugs regarding the breast as a reference for clinical medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 96 early postmenopausal patients were recruited from July 2009 to July 2010 at the Department of Gynecology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, China. Participants were randomly and equally assigned into three groups by means of block randomization. The groups were: The <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract therapy group (Group A; 32 cases); the estradiol valerate and medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy group (Group B; 32 cases); and the estradiol valerate and progesterone soft capsule therapy group (Group C; 32 cases). The patients recruited were early menopausal, aged 40&#x02013;60 years, and were experiencing climacteric symptoms. Patients in the early menopause stage were defined as going through amenorrhea for 6 months and within 5 years, as having a serum E2 concentration of &#x0003c;30 pg/ml, and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration of &#x0003e;40 U/L. Major exclusion criteria included: The presence of uterine fibroids (fibroid diameter &#x02265;5 cm or a uterus size equivalent to that measured at &#x02265;8 gestational weeks); a history of diabetes or hypertension; a history of thromboembolism; severe endometriosis, epilepsy, asthma or hyperprolactinemia; a first degree relative having a history of breast cancer; undergoing HRT in the past 3 months; having experienced drug or alcohol abuse in the past 3 months; and an endometrial thickness &#x02265;0.5 cm after withdrawal bleeding. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients before enrollment in the study. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design and treatment protocol</title><p>Patients were expected to take the medication over a period of 2 years. Patients in Group A took three tablets of <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract (100 mg/tablet) daily for 2 years. Patients in Group B took one tablet of estradiol valerate (E2V) for 30 days each cycle; from the 19<sup>th</sup> day, two tablets of medroxyprogesterone acetate (2 mg/tablet) were added to the treatment and the therapy was continued for 24 cycles. Patients in Group C took one tablet of E2V for 30 days each cycle; from the 19<sup>th</sup> day they also took two capsules of progesterone (progesterone soft capsules) for 12 days, and the treatment was also continued for 24 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Ultrasonography system</title><p>All sonographic examinations were performed using a commercially available scanner (GE LOGIQ 5 PRO, Conn. Fairfield, CT in USA) equipped with an L5&#x02013;L10 transducer for ultrasound. Machine presets for breast examination were selected so that multi-sectional scanning of the breasts could be conducted before treatment, and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. When undergoing scanning, the patients lay on their backs, with their two hands lifted high above the head and exposed their breasts; they were thoroughly scanned from the outer top to the outer bottom, from the inner top to the inner bottom in turn, making a straight cut, cross cut, and bevel cut. From the upper outer quadrant through to the cross section of the thickest part of the breast, we measured the largest anteroposterior diameter (i.e., the thickness of the breast glandular section through to the long axis section of the main duct below the papilla), and the internal diameter of the main duct. We recorded the thickness of the glandular section, the internal diameter of the duct, gland structure and color Doppler flow imaging. The average values for the thickness of the left and right breast and the internal diameter of the duct were obtained when collecting the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Indexes/variables</title><p>Patient data were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (weight/height<sup>2</sup>), waistline, hipline, waist-hip ratio (waistline/hipline), blood pressure, pulse, and the results of regular physical and gynecological examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS software package version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., USA), and a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as being statistically significant.

It is listed as a vegetable drug for the treatment of dysmenorrhea associated with the climacteric syndrome and the premenstrual syndrome by German Commission E.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Some researchers have demonstrated that black cohosh (one variety of cohosh grown in North America and Europe) can relieve postmenopausal syndromes.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, the drug is an ethanol extract of the rhizome of <italic>C. foetida</italic> (usually called <italic>Cimicifuga nanchuanensis</italic> or west cohosh) containing 2 mg of 27-deoxidation <italic>Cimicifuga</italic> pavilion in each 33.3 mg extract. Its effectiveness in relieving postmenopausal symptoms has been proven in our previous study,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but there are no published reports regarding its effectiveness in treating the breast in China. Our study used ultrasound to monitor the changes in breast structure, gland thickness and duct width to evaluate the effects of the <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract, and the changes in the breast after sequential treatment with various estrogen and progesterone regimens.</p><p>In the three therapy protocols used in the current study, the glandular section thickness had no trend regarding atrophy after 2 years of treatment. There was no significant difference in glandular thickness in the <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract treated group before and after treatment; thus, this extract was regarded as being effective in preventing the atrophy trend in breast thickness, but the detailed mechanism involved still requires further study. A significant difference was found in the glandular thickness in the other two hormone therapy groups after 2 years of treatment. This finding could be related to the influence of exogenous estrogen and progestin on the breast.</p><p>Some studies have reported that the breast duct gradually becomes wider after the menopause, probably related to the prolonged postmenopausal period, atrophy of the atini caused by a lack of estrogen and progesterone, flattening or disappearance of the breast duct epithelial cells, and cystic dilatation of the lumen.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the current study, the breast duct had been prevented from expanding in width in the three groups. In Group A, the width of the breast duct had a downward trend after 1 and 2 years of treatment, but there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The change in groups B and C had an identical downward trend, and there was a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The nodules detected before treatment and after 1-year of treatment disappeared or exhibited no distinct change in the three groups. New breast nodules had appeared after 2 years of treatment: There was one case in Group A, two cases in Group B and four cases in Group C, with breast hyperplasia after the molybdenum target check. Thus, it was found in the present study that <italic>C. foetida</italic> did not increase the incidence of malignant breast tumors after 2 years of treatment and estradiol valerate + medroxyprogesterone and estradiol valerate + progestin soft capsule therapy also did not increase the incidence of malignant breast tumors after 2 years of treatment.</p><p>Our study used ultrasound examination and the breast molybdenum target check to observe the changes in breast structure during treatment. Use of only one of these two check methods limits the accuracy of breast cancer identification while use of both methods increases the identification rate of this cancer. High-frequency ultrasound can clearly display skin, subcutaneous fat, glandular tissue, fascia and pectoral muscle. It can also detect small pathological changes in the breast and the surrounding tissues and small calcifications inside the breast; in addition, it can clearly reveal small structures in the various tissues of the breast without being influenced by the glands, and successfully observe the echo features and blood flow inside and around lesions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The main basis for assessing lesions using ultrasound is as follows: The grayscale ultrasonographic characteristics and colored blood flow distribution; the image features of pathological changes associated with anisotropic growth speed; infiltrative growth pattern; surrounding stromal reaction; and malnutritional calcification.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The advantage of molybdenum target X-rays is its extreme sensitivity to the tumor nodule shadow and microcalcifications. The features of breast cancer are embodied in the easy identification of the molybdenum target, such as microcalcifications. Breast cancer readily occurs in middle-aged or elderly women whose breasts have partly degenerated and contain a considerable amount of fat, which facilitates a good comparison on the molybdenum target tablets. Although the molybdenum target shows a good image of the lesion outline, its disadvantage lies in its poor visualization of the internal structure of the lesion. The image is forward overlapped, and some of the lesions can be obscured by the glandular structure nearby, especially in women whose breasts are compact. However, these disadvantages can be compensated for using ultrasound examination; this can clearly show the tumor's location, shape, structure and its invasion into the surrounding tissues. According to some studies, there is no significant difference in the accuracy rate of ultrasound and molybdenum target methods.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Their sensitivity in detecting breast cancer is 80.2&#x02013;90.7% for ultrasound and 82.7&#x02013;83.3% for the molybdenum target method. Combination of the two imaging methods obviously increases the accuracy of breast cancer detection with an improved sensitivity of 93.8%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p><italic>The 2011 Guidelines of the International Postmenopause Association</italic> point out that hormone treatment has risks regarding breast cancer, thrombembolia, apoplexy and other conditions. <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract treatment is a good choice for the patients who worry about treatment risks. <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract is derived from the <italic>Ranunculaceae cimicifuga</italic> plant. In China, <italic>Cimicifuga</italic> was first recorded 2000 years ago in the text of Shennong's Herbal Classic as curing diseases.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In the present study, after 2 years of treatment with <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract there was no significant difference in breast thickness, duct width and gland structure before and after treatment. Thus, no distinct effects regarding <italic>C. foetida</italic> extract were considered to have occurred in relation to the breast within 2 years of treatment.</p><p><italic>C. foetida</italic> extract can be used to alleviate climacteric symptoms involving minor adverse effects, and is gaining popularity. As compared with hormone treatment, the different mechanism of action of this plant extract provides a new option for the treatment of patients with menopausal syndrome, who are not suitable or reluctant to accept hormone treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Yuan-Yuan Ji</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
