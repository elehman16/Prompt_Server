However, valid evidence of the efficacy of APM is lacking. Controlling for the placebo effect of any medical intervention is important, but seems particularly pertinent for the assessment of APM, as the symptoms commonly attributed to a degenerative meniscal injury (medial joint line symptoms and perceived disability) are subjective and display considerable fluctuation, and accordingly difficult to gauge objectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A multicentre, parallel randomised, placebo surgery controlled trial is being carried out to assess the efficacy of APM for patients from 35 to 65&#x02005;years of age with a degenerative meniscus injury. Patients with degenerative medial meniscus tear and medial joint line symptoms, without clinical or radiographic osteoarthritis of the index knee, were enrolled and then randomly assigned (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to either APM or diagnostic arthroscopy (placebo surgery). Patients are followed up for 12&#x02005;months. According to the prior power calculation, 140 patients were randomised. The two randomised patient groups will be compared at 12&#x02005;months with intention-to-treat analysis. To safeguard against bias, patients, healthcare providers, data collectors, data analysts, outcome adjudicators and the researchers interpreting the findings will be blind to the patients&#x02019; interventions (APM/placebo). Primary outcomes are Lysholm knee score (a generic knee instrument), knee pain (using a numerical rating scale), and WOMET score (a disease-specific, health-related quality of life index). The secondary outcome is 15D (a generic quality of life instrument). Further, in one of the five centres recruiting patients for the randomised controlled trial (RCT), all patients scheduled for knee arthroscopy due to a degenerative meniscus injury are prospectively followed up using the same protocol as in the RCT to provide an external validation cohort. In this article, we present and discuss our study design, focusing particularly on the internal and external validity of our trial and the ethics of carrying out a placebo surgery controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District and the trial has been duly registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

The definition of the concepts &#x02018;degenerative&#x02019; or &#x02018;traumatic&#x02019; in the context of meniscal injuries is arbitrary in nature.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is a protocol paper; the trial is underway, but has not been completed.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Middle-aged men and women with knee pain attributed to degenerative knee disease (a degenerative meniscal injury accompanied by varying degrees of knee osteoarthritis (OA)) constitute the largest group of patients referred to orthopaedic surgeons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4">1&#x02013;4</xref> The prevailing understanding regarding the aetiology and treatment of degenerative knee disease is quite mechanical in nature: knee pain perceived by the patient is attributed to a degenerative meniscus injury or chondral derangement. The symptoms related to degenerative meniscus injury are commonly chronic and fluctuating in nature. However, somewhat paradoxically, a recent population-based MRI study showed degenerative meniscal tears to be highly prevalent in middle-aged and elderly adults and they seem to be asymptomatic in the majority of individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> The current treatment strategy of early degenerative knee disease includes rest, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticosteroid injections, physiotherapy and ultimately arthroscopic removal of mechanical derangement (arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) or debridement).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> In the USA alone, one million knee arthroscopies are performed annually to treat degenerative knee disease, making arthroscopic surgery of the knee by far the most common orthopaedic procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Many patients report improvement (reduced knee pain, better function and improved quality of life) after this kind of surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12 R13">10&#x02013;13</xref> However, similar results have also been obtained with conservative treatment in randomised, non-placebo-controlled trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref> To date, there is a dire lack of high-quality evidence (from randomised controlled trials, RCT) on the efficacy of APM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> This issue cannot be addressed simply by evaluating the outcomes of patients who have undergone surgery, as the role of the underlying degenerative process and the surgical procedure cannot be unravelled in such a study design.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>It is widely agreed that controlling for the placebo effect is a critical aspect of experimental design in any clinical research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> A comprehensive meta-analysis of the &#x02018;placebo effect&#x02019; indicated that subjective outcomes may be attributable to &#x02018;placebo effects&#x02019; or bias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> As subjective measures or patient-reported outcomes&#x02014;such as the amount of pain or perceived disability&#x02014;are often used and also widely recommended as primary outcomes in assessing the success of treatment of degenerative orthopaedic complaints,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> the issue of the possible &#x02018;placebo effects&#x02019; of surgery is of utmost relevance. This is an obvious argument favouring the use of sham surgery to control for the imminent bias. Optimal blinding of both the patient and the physician-researcher is another clear asset of the sham-surgical model: patients are biased towards favourable outcomes after surgical intervention because they want to believe that they chose the correct option for their care. This &#x02018;leap of faith&#x02019; is believed to be greater in surgery than in medical trials, in which the perceived and real risks of the intervention may be more subtle, less severe and do not involve the pain and risks of invasive procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Equally importantly, sham surgery is ideal for minimising the investigator-bias through true blinding of the outcome assessor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></p><p>Although the first-ever sham surgery controlled clinical trial was published as early as in 1959,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> there has been a paucity of placebo surgery controlled trials in orthopaedics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Even discussion regarding the use of the sham surgery model has been limited and generally condemning or censorious.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The essential question regarding the ethics of the use of placebo surgery concerns the dilemma between the provision of the highest standard of research design (the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial) and the highest standard of ethics (to do no harm to the patient).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> When evaluating the merits of a study protocol, the institutional review board (IRB) should consider not only the risks and benefits that may result from the research but also the possible long-term effects of applying knowledge gained in the research as among the research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Dowrick and Bhandari recently proposed that there are four areas that deserve particular attention when deciding on the appropriateness of a sham surgery controlled RCT, namely the equipoise, risk minimisation, informed consent and deception. As our views on the last three issues are thoroughly expressed in the ethical annex (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>), we will focus here on equipoise. In short, the statement by Dowrick and Bhandari<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> that &#x0201c;In orthopaedics, the reality is that many treatments are &#x02018;known,&#x02019; &#x02018;accepted,&#x02019; or &#x02018;standard&#x02019; but may not yet be &#x02018;proven&#x02019; in the true sense of the word as it applies to scientific research&#x0201d; captures the essence of equipoise and APM.
<boxed-text id="bx1" position="float"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Ethical considerations of using placebo surgery control, as outlined by Miller<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></title></caption><p>I. Is there scientific and clinical value in conducting this study?</p><p>Despite being the most common orthopaedic procedure, there exists no randomised, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy (risk-benefit ratio) of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). We would like to emphasise that a properly conducted efficacy trial on APM could provide better evidence-base for this procedure and theoretically eliminate unnecessary procedures or at least provide the field with prognostic factors for good/poor outcome.</p><p>II. Is the use of placebo surgery methodologically necessary or desirable to achieve valid results?</p><p>Given on the one hand the subjective and somewhat vague nature of the symptoms related to degenerative meniscus injury (fluctuating course of symptoms that range from one individual to another from spontaneous disappearance of the symptoms to quite dramatic impairment in the quality of life), and on the other, the well-known strong placebo effect of surgical interventions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> we feel confident in stating that there is indeed no alternative to using placebo surgery as a control.</p><p>III&#x02013;V. Risk&#x02013;benefit assessment</p><p>A basic ethical requirement of clinical research is to minimise risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> This does not mean that risks can be reduced to zero or that risks must be minimal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> The risks inherent in our placebo surgery procedure are related to spinal anaesthesia and arthroscopy. Spinal anaesthesia does carry a modest risk (mainly of postspinal headache), but similar risks have been considered acceptable for other medical investigators, such as spinal tap for neurological diseases or when used to carry out muscle biopsies for neurological or orthopaedic study designs or bronchoscopy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> As for the risks related to knee arthroscopy per se, the most common are wound infection, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with respective incidences of 0.22%, 0.12% and 0.08%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> There is naturally also a risk for iatrogenic lesions (chondral surfaces) inside the knee during the procedure, but given the fact that all surgeons performing the operations in the RCT are highly skilled with experience of hundreds of previous knee arthroscopies, these are considered negligible. In addition, knee arthroscopy is commonly used as a diagnostic procedure for patients with knee pain, and accordingly the patients allocated to the placebo surgery arm can be considered to gain by being assured that no pathology other than a degenerative meniscus injury exists in their knee joint. The other ethical dilemma regarding our procedure actually lies at the heart of our study design, the potential harms and benefits related to the resection of the torn meniscus. The existing evidence shows quite convincingly no benefit of knee arthroscopy in the prevention of the degenerative process (knee osteoarthritis (OA)),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36 R37 R38">36&#x02013;38</xref> and accordingly few would argue that the goal of APM in patients with degenerative meniscus injury is solely to relieve symptoms. On this note, there is naturally a risk that patients allocated to the sham arm will suffer from the delay in getting the potentially beneficial procedure, a risk that we have attempted to minimise by allowing patients to request a reassessment of their symptoms (and potentially cross over to the APM arm) after 6&#x02005;months of follow-up. It should also be noted that all the risks discussed above are related to the current treatment strategy of degenerative meniscus injury, the resection of the meniscus and the recent evidence actually implies that meniscectomy is associated with an increased risk of future knee OA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> Finally, we contend that there are no objective tools for measuring risk-benefit ratios in research. As Gillett has suggested: &#x02018;an acceptable procedure for the placebo arm of a surgical trial is one that carries no more risk than the investigation that would be used to diagnosis and treatment&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> We argue that the relatively minor risks related to placebo procedure were justifiable to answer the clinically important question of whether arthroscopic surgery is effective in the treatment of degenerative meniscus injury.</p><p>VI. Do the individuals give informed consent?</p><p>The ethical issues of the trial will be thoroughly explained and discussed with each recruited patient, both verbally and in writing. The basic principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki will be followed throughout the execution of the trial. Accordingly, each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any given moment without having to explain this decision in any way. Finally, the possibility of being randomised to placebo surgery will be reiterated to each participant before the actual randomisation.</p></boxed-text></p><p>RCT is considered the gold standard of research design in terms of methodological rigour (internal validity). Ideally, a well-designed RCT should not only have high internal validity but also preferably high external validity (generalisability).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> However, realistically, such a &#x02018;wish&#x02019; is an obvious paradox, as there is an almost inevitable trade-off between internal and external validity. In essence, the purpose of a true <italic>efficacy</italic> (or explanatory) trial is to demonstrate that an intervention can work theoretically under optimal conditions (&#x02018;best-case scenario&#x02019;). The patients recruited are thus carefully selected to obtain as homogeneous a sample as possible and they are also treated under ideal conditions (eg, by the most skilled/experienced physicians). An effectiveness (or pragmatic) trial, in turn, is aimed at testing how an intervention works under usual practice circumstances, and for this reason has a high external validity, but the internal validity is usually lower.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> Relton <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> recently described a novel &#x02018;cohort multiple randomised controlled trial&#x02019; design, in which the benefits of a large observational cohort and a pragmatic RCT can be combined. However, this pragmatic design cannot be used for trials with a placebo comparator (ie, &#x02018;true&#x02019; efficacy design) as the patients may not receive placebo in routine healthcare.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the protocol of our ongoing placebo surgery controlled trial assessing the efficacy of APM. To address some of the problems related to both efficacy and effectiveness RCTs, we also briefly introduce a novel &#x02018;RCT within-a-cohort design&#x02019;.

In addition, every patient has been informed of their right to withdraw from the trial whenever they desire without giving the researchers any reason for their decision.</p><p>We have enrolled patients at the outpatient clinics of five secondary or tertiary hospitals in Finland. The study was first launched at one site, but to improve recruitment after 2&#x02005;years (and to ensure multicentre design with its obvious benefits to the generalisability of the results), the study was expanded to four additional sites. The sites were selected on the basis of having an established practice of knee arthroscopy and also an experienced arthroscopic knee surgeon keen to participate in the study. All orthopaedic surgeons involved in the actual interventions of the study are members of the Finnish Arthroscopy Association and have experience of more than 1300 (range 1300&#x02013;2500) knee arthroscopies with an annual rate of at least 200 (range 200&#x02013;350) arthroscopies. Before the actual launch of the study at the four additional study centres, the protocol was discussed in the minutest details to ensure that it would be adhered to in a similar manner in all five centres. The principal clinical investigator and the study coordinator also visited every centre at least once before the study was begun at these selected sites. Further, regular meetings have been held biannually among all study members to ensure that the protocol is carried out as planned.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients referred to any of the five orthopaedic surgeons and complaining of knee pain consistent with a meniscus injury were assessed for eligibility.

By prospectively following up all patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for their degenerative meniscus injury (and not just those randomised to the efficacy RCT), we are able to obtain several distinct groups of patients with distinct prognostic factors. These groups will enable us to address several interesting hypotheses regarding the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). (B) A theoretical scheme based on Cochrane's three-step hierarchy of evidence for addressing the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of APM. By comparing the treatment response of groups C and D, we can address the efficacy of APM: Is the APM superior to placebo? Then, to elucidate whether our RCT truly represents a &#x02018;best-case scenario&#x02019; (a <italic>true</italic> efficacy trial), we will assess whether the outcome of group E is superior to any subgroup of patients within the pragmatic cohort (B). If these hypotheses hold true, we can continue to &#x02018;the second ladder of evidence&#x02019;, effectiveness. We feel that the treatment response observed in the pragmatic cohort (B) should be clearly more robust than the placebo effect of APM to claim that evidence of effectiveness exists. The placebo effect of APM, in turn, can be &#x02018;extracted&#x02019; by subtracting the difference between the groups D and C (blinded APM minus blinded placebo) from the outcome of group E (open APM), a group that should entail the combined effects of placebo and APM. Finally, if evidence of effectiveness is obtained, we can proceed to the assessment of the possible cost-effectiveness (&#x02018;cost-efficacy&#x02019;&#x02014;extrapolation) of APM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012002510f02"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The symptoms currently believed to be attributable to a torn meniscus are mostly subjective (pain, discomfort and possible functional deficits) and fluctuating in nature, and accordingly our outcomes are patient-administered outcome measures.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87 R88 R89 R90 R91">87&#x02013;91</xref> Explanatory trials are designed to measure the efficacy of an intervention&#x02014;to find out if the treatment exerts a biological effect in a research setting <italic>under ideal and controlled conditions</italic>. The factors most consistently found to predict a poor outcome after APM in patients with a degenerative meniscus injury are advanced knee OA and chondral damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref> Also, lateral meniscectomy has been identified as a predictor of poorer prognosis rather than medial meniscectomy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref> Accordingly, to obtain a population with &#x02018;best-possible response to APM&#x02019;, we chose to recruit patients with a stable knee, no or minimal OA and an isolated, degenerative injury of the medial meniscus. Although age per se is not a predictor for poor outcome, it has been shown to be associated with increased prevalence of OA and (consequently) inferior functional recovery after APM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Similarly, women have also been found to have a less favourable prognosis after APM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref> These two factors were thus used as stratifications.</p><p>Acknowledging the obvious risk of high internal but low external validity due to the strict eligibility criteria, we decided to also keep track of the patients eliminated from the RCT by prospectively following these individuals with the same outcome assessment arsenal used in the RCT. One of the reasons for collecting this pragmatic cohort was to safeguard against bias attributable to patients declining to take part in a placebo surgery controlled trial. However, unlike in the trial by Moseley <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> (only about 40% of the eligible patients agreed to participate), we have been very successful in convincing patients to participate (15% of eligible patients declined). This pragmatic cohort will also be used to corroborate or refute whether our efficacy (RCT) population represents the best-case scenario (those with optimal response to APM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Single versus multiple surgeons/CENTRES</title><p>The study by Moseley <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> has also been criticised for having only one surgeon performing all operations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref> Similar to Moseley <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> we also began our trial in only one centre/surgeon, but once the study protocol had been thoroughly refined, it was expanded to four additional sites. The inclusion of five surgeons/study sites entails one problem: we chose to use &#x02018;study site&#x02019; as our fourth stratification (separate randomisation sequences for each site), and accordingly, there is an imminent risk of uneven randomisation as the number of patients allocated at each of the four additional sites is relatively small (projected to be 10&#x02013;20/site) and there are three stratifications in the randomisation. However, the use of separate randomisation sequences was a conscious choice, as we wanted to retain the possibility of analysing the data separately from each site.</p></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Randomisation</title><p>By postponing the randomisation into the operation suite, we have managed to completely eliminate the chance that any eligible patient who gives informed consent would decline to participate in the trial after being randomised. Even though our &#x02018;RCT within-a-cohort&#x02019; design allows us to also follow up those declining, the elimination of postrandomisation declining obviously decreases the risk of bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Outcome assessment and statistical analysis</title><p>According to the CONSORT statement,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref> authors should not only define the prespecified outcome considered to be of the greatest importance to relevant stakeholders, but they should also indicate the prespecified time point of primary interest when outcomes are assessed at several time points after randomisation. Few would argue that the goal of treatment in patients with degenerative meniscus injury is anything but to relieve symptoms, particularly as the existing evidence quite convincingly shows that degenerative meniscus injury per se and APM both inevitably lead to the development of knee OA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36 R37 R38">36&#x02013;38</xref> As noted previously, it can take up to 6 months postoperatively to obtain the full benefit from the APM,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref> but a more lasting relief of symptoms seems to be confounded by eventual progression of the underlying degenerative process. Accordingly, to be able to showcase the potential efficacy of APM on pain and the quality of life while minimising various types of confounding (eg, non-retention/loss to follow-up and progression of knee OA), we chose a 12-month time point as our time point of primary interest. However, the potential beneficial or detrimental short-term effects of either of the studied procedures (eg, possible transient accelerated recovery) can also be assessed using the data from the 2-month and 6-month follow-up assessments. Further, as Moseley <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> were also criticised for reporting only average change of a group,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref> we decided to ask our patients about their global impression of change with their knee status and their satisfaction with their knee. These two questions enable us to also report the outcome of our population as a proportion of patients who consider they have benefited from the treatment.</p><p>As for the prespecified outcome of the greatest importance to patients, Moseley <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> developed a patient-administered outcome instrument of their own, a methodological choice that was criticised as the tool was not properly validated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref> We have chosen three validated outcome instruments in our trial. To safeguard against potential problems associated with multiplicity of analyses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref> our solution is twofold. We will use the Bonferroni method to appropriately adjust the overall level of significance and also take this issue into account in interpreting our findings: to be deemed hypothesis-proving, the intervention-induced changes have to be well aligned and clinically meaningful in all three validated primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The definition of the concept &#x02018;degenerative&#x02019; or &#x02018;traumatic&#x02019; in the context of meniscal injuries is arbitrary in nature. Traditionally, meniscal injuries or tears have been classified as traumatic or degenerative based on the aetiology (injury mechanism) or morphology (tear pattern observed in MRI or at arthroscopy), but no validated and generally agreed criteria exist to make the distinction between the two entities. Even the definition of the word &#x02018;trauma&#x02019; represents a challenge. Although a &#x02018;traumatic&#x02019; onset of symptoms is indeed an exclusion criterion in our RCT, the majority of patients with a &#x02018;degenerative&#x02019; meniscus injury do experience some kind of twisting movement or other relatively modest injury prior to the onset of their knee symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref> Accordingly, all patients with sudden injuries related to their own voluntary muscle activities (such as kneeling, bending or kicking) and patients with a minor twisting of the knee were included in our trial. In essence, our criteria labelling a tear as &#x02018;traumatic&#x02019; describe a more substantial event, such as falling from a chair, stairs or bicycle or slipping on ice. To increase the validity of the classification of the meniscus injury, our assessment includes not only history/clinical examination but also MRI and arthroscopy. Finally, our RCT within-a-cohort design allows us to examine whether the response to APM of those excluded from the RCT because of &#x02018;traumatic&#x02019; meniscal injury differs from those included in the RCT.</p><p>A similarly controversial issue is the differentiation of chondral injuries that require surgical procedure (debridement, microfracture or any other procedure) from those that should be considered merely osteoarthritic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref> To the best of our knowledge, there is no objective classification system (either MRI or arthroscopy based) for this distinction. Our rationale was to use preoperative MRI to verify that the patients&#x02019; symptoms could be due to degenerative meniscus injury (and to exclude possibly rare situations as knee tumours). No cartilage lesions detected in MRI were considered an exclusion, but the final decision whether or not to include the patient in the trial was made at arthroscopy, where the meniscus injury (and commonly associated chondral lesions) were visually and physically (probing) verified and assessed. As there really is no valid (RCT -based) evidence to show that surgery would provide any clinically meaningful improvement in patients with degenerative chondral lesions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> we instructed our surgeons to generally forbear from surgical intervention. However, if a single large chondral flap or local deep osteochondral lesion was found, the surgeons were given permission to carry out the surgical procedure they deemed appropriate and the patient was excluded. Finally, the only difference between our two allocation groups is whether a meniscus resection was carried out or not. Accordingly, if we made a wrong decision concerning chondral lesions, they should still be evenly divided into the two study arms, thus not compromising our primary objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Interpretation of the results: introducing various potential scenarios</title><p>To illustrate the various potential findings of the study, we have fitted different scenarios within a larger context of Cochrane's three-step hierarchy of evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>B). This scheme outlines the requirements for evidence to justify claims of proven efficacy, effectiveness and, ultimately, the cost-effectiveness of APM.</p><sec id="s4d1"><title>Quantifying the placebo effect</title><p>The placebo effect refers to a positive change in symptoms related to a participant's perceptions of the treatment rather than to the mechanisms of the treatment itself.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> After the publication of their pilot study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref> Moseley <italic>et al</italic> were questioned about the possibility that patients who enrolled in their placebo surgery controlled study would be more &#x02018;suggestible&#x02019; and therefore more susceptible to the placebo effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref> Moseley responded by proposing two alternative scenarios: either the patients in their RCT would be more susceptible to the placebo effect than the patients who declined to be in the study (suggesting that the characteristics and personality traits of patients who choose to enrol in the studies are different from those declining) or patients who enrol in the RCT are more susceptible to the placebo effect than patients who undergo surgery outside a study. For the sake of brevity, we will not enter into a lengthy elaboration of these two alternative interpretations (which can be found in the detailed response by Moseley<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>).</p><p>Translating this line of thought into our study design, potential differences in the responses to treatment between the RCT study groups (C, D and E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A) are attributable to either the effect of resection (groups C vs D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A) or the magnitude of the placebo effect (groups C vs E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A). What makes our design unique is the opportunity to actually disentangle (quantify) the respective effects of &#x02018;resection&#x02019; and &#x02018;placebo&#x02019;. Further, by comparing (with appropriate baseline adjustment) these estimates with the treatment responses observed in the patients who have undergone APM outside our study (group B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A) and the more heterogeneous pragmatic cohort (group A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A), we should also be able to extrapolate the potential effectiveness of the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>B). Theoretically, the placebo effect is more robust in the &#x02018;open label&#x02019; (E) and pragmatic groups (A and B) than in the efficacy trial groups (C and D) due to the doubt inherent in any &#x02018;blinded&#x02019; RCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002510F2">figure 2</xref>A). To summarise, there is a placebo effect in all five study groups, not just the placebo surgery group (D).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article, we present a protocol for a randomised placebo surgery controlled trial to assess the efficacy of APM in patients with degenerative meniscus tear.
