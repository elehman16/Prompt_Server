The exposure window of traditional prospective ECG gating was set at 30%&#x02013;80% of the cardiac cycle. For the Doppler group, the length of diastasis was analyzed by Doppler. For lengths greater than 90 ms, the pulsing window was preset during diastole (during 60%&#x02013;80%); otherwise, the optimal pulsing intervals were moved from diastole to systole (during 30%&#x02013;50%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean heart rates of the traditional ECG and the Doppler-guided group during CT scanning were 75.0&#x000b1;7.7 bpm (range, 66&#x02013;96 bpm) and 76.5&#x000b1;5.4 bpm (range: 66&#x02013;105 bpm), respectively. The results indicated that whereas the image quality showed no significant difference between the traditional and Doppler groups (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.42), the radiation dose of the Doppler group was significantly lower than that of the traditional group (5.2&#x000b1;3.4mSv vs. 9.3&#x000b1;4.5mSv, P&#x0003c;0.001).

However, since Einstein et al. estimated a significant number of potential radiation-induced neoplasms from coronary CTA <xref rid="pone.0063096-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the high effective dose and potential adverse consequences of coronary CTA have aroused greater attention and have limited the general application of the technique <xref rid="pone.0063096-Redberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Until now, many methods have been developed and applied to reduce the radiation dose, among which prospective electrocardiograph (ECG) gating is one effective method that has demonstrated the obvious advantage of allowing for a decreased patient dose <xref rid="pone.0063096-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063096-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, it is only effective when the heart rate is low <xref rid="pone.0063096-vonBallmoos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Traditionally, when the heart rate &#x0003c;65 bpm, diastole is recommended as the optimal pulsing window for a relatively longer phase with less motion of the coronary arteries. As the heart rate increases, however, the lengths of R-R intervals are shortened correspondingly, with diastole compressed significantly. As a result, it is difficult to produce an optimal image quality exclusively at diastole, as some patients should be scanned during systole <xref rid="pone.0063096-Seifarth1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063096-Leschka3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In this case, the pulsing windows are usually expanded to cover both systole and diastole, which results in a higher radiation dose (1, 17, 18).</p><p>Numerous studies have mainly focused on the relationship between the heart rate and the optimal pulsing windows to guide the clinical utility of prospective ECG gating for patients with a high heart rate. The results, nevertheless, are contradictory, as the optimal pulsing window does not always change regularly with the heart rate. For example, Leschka et al. believed that the narrowest reconstruction window providing diagnostic image quality was 60&#x02013;70% for a heart rate &#x0003c;60 bpm, 60&#x02013;80% for a heart rate of 60&#x02013;70 bpm, 55&#x02013;80% for a heart rate of 70&#x02013;80 bpm, and 30&#x02013;80% for a heart rate &#x0003e;80 bpm (20), whereas Weustink et al. concluded the optimal exposure windows to be at 60&#x02013;76%, 30&#x02013;77%, and 31&#x02013;47% for a heart rate &#x02264;65 bpm, 66&#x02013;79 bpm, and &#x02265;80 bpm, respectively (19, 29). The possible reason may be that the physiological phase is associated not only with heart rate but also with other factors, such as filling pressures and heart function <xref rid="pone.0063096-VanKraaij1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A &#x003b2;-blocker is therefore recommended to control the heart rate. Although using a &#x003b2;-blocker has been proven to be an effective approach with which to lower the patient's heart rate, it is ineffective and may have adverse effects in some patients <xref rid="pone.0063096-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>A precise definition of an optimal ECG pulsing window is therefore required for prospective ECG gating scanning in patients with a high heart rate. Since Doppler ultrasound has been proven to be a helpful methodology with which to predict the physiological phase <xref rid="pone.0063096-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, it is hypothesized that, compared with the traditional prospective ECG-gating protocol, prospective ECG gating incorporating Doppler ultrasound analysis (Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating) has the potential to compress pulsing windows from both systole and diastole to systole or diastole in order to reduce patient dose <xref rid="pone.0063096-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present study, we evaluated the patient dose and diagnostic accuracy of CTA incorporating Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating in patients whose heart rate could not be brought under 65 bpm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Our study protocol and radiation dose measurements were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinan Military General Hospital (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063096.s001">Protocol S1</xref>).

Among the 102 patients whose heart rate could not be brought under 65 bpm by the &#x003b2;-blocker as well as 38 patients with a heart rate &#x0003e;65 bpm and contraindications for &#x003b2;-blockers (asthma and severe chronic obstructive emphysema), the subjects were randomly divided into a traditional prospective ECG-gating group and a Doppler-guided prospective ECG-gating group.

prospective ECG gating has been suggested as a useful procedure to reduce radiation dose, it only works when the heart rate is low. A &#x003b2;-blocker is therefore recommended before CTA to control the heart rate, but is ineffective in some patients <xref rid="pone.0063096-vonBallmoos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of CTA incorporating Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating in patients with a high heart rate. The results indicated that compared with traditional prospective ECG gating, prospective ECG gating incorporating Doppler analysis could decrease radiation dose significantly while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, especially for patients in whom the &#x003b2;-blocker proves ineffective and might have adverse effects.</p><p>Due to the consistent movement of the heart, it is critical to find a relatively tranquil duration in which to scan and reconstruct the coronary artery. Studies have confirmed that there are two durations suitable for image reconstruction. One corresponds to the diastasis in diastole, while the other takes place in systole <xref rid="pone.0063096-Herzog2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Theoretically, when the heart rate &#x02264;65 bpm, it is better to assess vessel lumen in diastole due to the increased blood flow, vasodilatation effect, and comparatively longer duration <xref rid="pone.0063096-Steigner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, when the heart rate is increasing, the optimal pulsing windows fluctuate, rather than locating at diastole or systole stably or changing regularly with heart rate <xref rid="pone.0063096-Seifarth1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063096-Leschka2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, at a high heart rate, the optimal pulsing windows should cover both systole and diastole in order to maintain image quality, resulting in a significantly increased patient dose. Incorporating the results of previous studies, we selected 30%&#x02013;80% as the pulsing windows for traditional prospective ECG gating <xref rid="pone.0063096-Leschka3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The present study showed that Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating, which can analyze the true length of physiological phase, may offer the possibility of locating pulsing windows exclusively at systole or diastole and thus decrease radiation dose. Previous study has demonstrated that when the length of diastasis &#x0003e;90 ms, the optimal image quality could be obtained at diastole. Otherwise, when the length of diastasis &#x0003c;90 ms, the diastole is not suitable for optimal reconstruction, and the reconstruction windows should be set at systole <xref rid="pone.0063096-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As the pulsing windows were compressed from 30%&#x02013;80% to 60%&#x02013;80% or 30%&#x02013;50%, the Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating could reduce radiation dose by nearly 44% of patient dose.</p><p>It is worth noting that in our study, the effective dose of Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating was still higher than those of previous studies based on patients with a low heart rate (5.2mSv vs. 2.2&#x02013;4.2mSv) <xref rid="pone.0063096-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063096-Shuman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063096-Stolzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the present study showed a significant lower dose in patients with a high heart rate. In a study using 320-detector CT, when the heart rate &#x0003e;65 bpm, the radiation dose increased from 3.9 mSv in patients with a heart rate &#x0003c;65 bpm to 12.3 mSv, which was also two times more than the dose for Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating <xref rid="pone.0063096-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Generally, three main factors influence the radiation dose in patients with a high heart rate. The first is the length of exposure window. As mentioned above, this new technique of Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating cardiac CT angiography has the ability to compass the pulsing windows from 30%&#x02013;80% to 60%&#x02013;80% or 30%&#x02013;50%. The second is the temporal resolution, determined by the hardware of CT scanners. If the temporal resolution is not sufficient to reconstruct a diagnostic image in patients with a high heart rate, the multi-segment reconstruction method should be applied to improve the effective temporal resolution, which increases the exposure time and patient dose significantly. Although the exposure windows were compressed greatly by Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating in the present study, the multi-segment reconstruction was applied by 320-detector CT, which led to a redundant dose when the heart rate is high <xref rid="pone.0063096-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As we can see from the results, the dose in patients with a heart rate &#x0003e;80 bpm was significantly higher than that in patients with a heart rate between 65 and 80 bpm for the application of the three-heart-beat acquisition mode. It is possible that dual-source CT (DSCT), with an advanced temporal resolution of 82.5 ms, could reduce the radiation dose further by applying Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating <xref rid="pone.0063096-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The third factor is the application of the iterative algorithm. The iterative reconstruction algorithm allows the dose to be lowered while maintaining image quality <xref rid="pone.0063096-Beister1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As the iterative algorithm was not applied in the first generation of 320-detectors CT, the radiation dose was still comparatively high. A recent study on the second-generation 320-detector CT scanner with iterative reconstruction in patients with a low heart rate showed a significantly reduced radiation dose, which could decrease radiation dose still further than the present CT scanner <xref rid="pone.0063096-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, the reduced radiation dose should not depend on one technique alone, but on a synthetic application of low dose techniques. Further study combining narrower pulsing windows, higher temporal resolution, and an iterative reconstruction algorithm may decrease the requisite radiation dose further.</p><p>Another reason for the redundant dose of the study was the differing conversion factor in dose estimation. Previous studies usually applied k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.014 mSv&#x000d7;mGy<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000d7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017 mSv&#x000d7;mGy<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000d7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as the conversion coefficient, which however is chest conversion factor. Recent studies have suggested that the conversion coefficient changes depending on organ, scanning mode, patient size, X-ray tube voltage, and other factors <xref rid="pone.0063096-Huda1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Applying dual-source CT, Hurwitz et al. suggested that the conversion factor for cardiac CT should be k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025 mSv&#x000d7;mGy<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000d7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0063096-Hurwitz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As mentioned above, Einstein et al. suggested that the conversion factor (k) should be 0.029 mSv&#x000d7;mGy<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000d7;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 320-detectors CT <xref rid="pone.0063096-Einstein2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which is significantly higher than the conversion factor used in previous studies.</p><p>It is worth noting that the procedure of CTA with Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating was more time-consuming and costly than the traditional method. However, patients whose heart rate could not be brought to desired levels only made up 8.3% of the total patients and thus did not disturb the work routine significantly. With regard to individual protection from radioactivity, Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating may reduce the patient dose by nearly 44%. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the cost-effectiveness of Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating in order to prove that the 44% of radiation dose saved benefits long-term survival.</p><p>There are two limitations to our study. First, patients with arrhythmia were excluded from this study, as it was difficult for Doppler to forecast the tranquil duration interval. Second, the study was performed by applying first-generation 320-detector CT. In the future, the advantages of Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating should be confirmed with other scanners.</p><p>In conclusion, in terms of decreasing the patient dose, ECG gating for coronary CTA improves from retrospective without dose modulation to retrospective with dose modulation to prospective mode. The current study indicates that Doppler-guided prospective ECG gating, a new method of ECG gating, may reduce effective doses further, while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, particularly in patients with an elevated heart rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063096.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
