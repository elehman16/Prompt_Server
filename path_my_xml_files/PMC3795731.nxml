The improvement in short-term renal allograft survival seen with these agents, however, has not translated into similar degree of prolongation in long-term survival <xref rid="pone.0075591-The1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Progressive deterioration of allograft function is multifactorial, with chronic CNI toxicity being an important contributor. Long-term CNI use is also associated with other adverse effects such as increased risk of hyperglycemia and malignancies <xref rid="pone.0075591-Nankivell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Wimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The introduction of other immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus (SIR) raised the hope that elimination of CNI exposure might be possible <xref rid="pone.0075591-Mourad1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>SIR, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was specially promising in this regard. When combined with CNI, SIR use leads to worsening of renal function as a result of potentiated nephrotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0075591-MeierKriesche1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. CNI avoidance using SIR with anti-CD25 antibody or anti-thymocyte globulin, MMF and steroids, has provided comparable 1-year patient and graft survival and similar incidence of acute rejection. This has, however, come at the price of increased risk of surgical complications including lymphocele and delayed wound healing <xref rid="pone.0075591-Buchler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075591-Valente1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Late conversion after patients already showed evidence of CNI nephrotoxicity has been disappointing, as shown in the CONVERT trial <xref rid="pone.0075591-Schena1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Deferred pre-emptive switch to SIR from CNI after the period of highest immunological risk, but before development of CNI-related irreversible tubulointerstitial damage, can be a promising strategy. This approach entails replacing CNI with SIR after the period of risk for wound complications has passed (2 weeks to 6 months post-transplant). Studies evaluating this approach have reported a variable gain of renal function with different adverse event rate <xref rid="pone.0075591-Budde1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) suppress immune responses to self and non-self antigens and play an important role in the development and maintenance of transplantation tolerance in experimental models <xref rid="pone.0075591-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Increased T<sub>reg</sub> number and T<sub>reg</sub> associated gene expression profiles have been found in cell lines derived from renal transplant recipients with stable graft function compared with those with chronic allograft dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0075591-Tsaur1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>SIR promotes conversion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>naive</sup> T Cells to CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub>s <xref rid="pone.0075591-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, cyclosporine A (CsA) completely inhibits this process <xref rid="pone.0075591-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, we show that a deferred pre-emptive switch 2 months after transplantation from a CNI-based immunosuppressive regime to a SIR based one leads to a significant improvement in GFR over 6 months without a side effect penalty. Furthermore, we show that change to SIR results in a consistent and sustained expansion in the regulatory T-cell population.</p><p>We randomized the patients 2 months post-transplant in order to avoid the period of maximum immunological risk. At that time, the chances of surgical problems are likely to be minimal and exposure to CNI will not be that advanced that attempt to preserve renal function might be futile. A small number (3 in CNI group and 5 in SIR) were randomized six months after transplantation. However, number of such patients was rather small and they were equally distributed in the two groups. Thus our randomization style was similar to that of CONCEPT Trial <xref rid="pone.0075591-Lebranchu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In terms of primary end point, our findings confirmed the observational studies and clinical trials that show better preservation of GFR with mTOR inhibitors compared to CNIs <xref rid="pone.0075591-Budde1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There was gain of eGFR of 8.23 ml/min as early as day 15 in SIR group, which had increased to 12 ml/min at 180 days. In contrast, the eGFR did not change in the CNI group. In our final analysis of eGFR, we did not include data of the patients who had acute rejection. Both the patients were in CNI group. If we had included these two patients, the difference in eGFR would have been even more robust. This gives further strength to our results.</p><p>In contrast to other studies that have shown a high incidence of side effects after conversion to SIR, we noticed surprisingly small number of adverse events and none of the patients needed to discontinue SIR due to adverse events. There was no episode of rejection in SIR group and only two rejections in CNI group. Both the patients could not achieve baseline renal function and one patient had graft loss. BPAR in patients taking SIR at 12 months in SMART <xref rid="pone.0075591-Guba1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, CONCEPT <xref rid="pone.0075591-Lebranchu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and CONVERT <xref rid="pone.0075591-Schena1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> trials has been found to be around 17%, whereas it was 7.4% in Spare the Nephron trial.<xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> The infection rates in SIR and CNI groups (17% vs 8.5%) were no different, a finding similar to the SMART, CONCEPT and Spare the Nephron trials. In CONVERT trial, however, infection rates were higher in patients taking SIR. Another encouraging finding was lack of development of proteinuria in the SIR group. Proteinuria &#x0003e;1 gm was seen in only 5.8% and 4.2% patients at the end of 2 and 3 years respectively in the Zeus trial. Likewise, in Spare the Nephron trial only 3 patients had to switch treatment for proteinuria and in CONCEPT trial it was less than 10%. However, trials with late conversion like CONVERT trial showed proteinuria of 23.6%. As proteinuria is considered to be a marker of health of graft kidney over long term, this distinction of early and late conversion is of massive importance <xref rid="pone.0075591-Schena1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Budde2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Lebranchu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>At the end of six months, hemoglobin and lipid levels in our study were not significantly different in both the groups from baseline.

In our study, however, only one patient complained of aphthous stomatitis. Since this problem is encountered early after exposure to SIR, we hope that this excellent tolerability will be maintained over long term as well <xref rid="pone.0075591-Schena1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075591-Guba1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>One unique adverse event in patients taking SIR was enthesitis, not previously reported with SIR. This suggests the need of vigilance for musculoskeletal side effects on further follow up.</p><p>No patient refused further participation because of any side effect. Patients who withdrew consent, they did it in early part of study. At that time more frequent visits were required, that they were not able to follow-up.</p><p>There are some differences in the patient population in this study from the ones reported earlier. We included only patients with live donor first time kidney transplant. Only 18% of our study population received induction therapy. In SMART<xref rid="pone.0075591-Guba1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, ZEUS<xref rid="pone.0075591-Budde1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and CONCEPT<xref rid="pone.0075591-Lebranchu2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> studies, all patients received induction therapy while in SPARE THE NEPHRON<xref rid="pone.0075591-Weir2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> trial 70% of the study population had received induction therapy. These trials included deceased donor renal transplants as well. Thus risk profile of our patients should be seen in the context of less robust induction therapy as well.</p><p>Search is on for strategies that could affect the repertoire of immune cells in a way as to tilt the balance in favor of cells that would inhibit antigen specific response. CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population is thought to be instrumental in downregulating alloantigen specific immune response. T<sub>reg</sub> generation and maintenance requires activation by T cell receptor engagement and IL-2 signaling. However, the influence of immunosuppressive medications on T<sub>reg</sub> homeostasis in humans <italic>in vivo</italic> remains a subject of exploration.</p><p>We found prompt and sustained expansion in the T<sub>reg</sub> population with SIR but not CNI. This effect was be not affected by prior exposure to CNIs. In an observational study, T<sub>reg</sub> frequency in peripheral blood of renal transplant patients receiving CNI was lower compared to those receiving SIR <xref rid="pone.0075591-Segundo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Korczak-Kowalska showed that T<sub>reg</sub> percentage in SIR treated patients did not differ from that observed in healthy individuals, but was significantly higher compared with CsA-treated patients <xref rid="pone.0075591-KorczakKowalska1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This effect seems to be unaffected by the duration of transplant. In a recent study, Carroll et al <xref rid="pone.0075591-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> showed similar increase in T<sub>reg</sub> population in 13 renal transplant recipients with squamous cell carcinoma randomized to SIR 21 years after transplantation. This expansion was not noted in the comparator CNI arm. A similar increase has been seen following induction with Campath-1H <xref rid="pone.0075591-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Noris et al showed that the reconstituted T-cell population following depleting induction using Campath-1H had greater proportion of T<sub>reg</sub> in patients who received SIR compared to those on CsA <xref rid="pone.0075591-Noris1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It can be speculated, therefore, that a combination of Campath-1H induction and maintenance therapy with SIR may be tolerogenic. The long-term sustainability of this expansion needs to be evaluated. We also need to study the differential effect of these two agents on other immune parameters such as B-cell division and dendritic cell function.</p><p>This trial had certain limitations. The CNI group had larger proportion of genetically related donors. Because of resource limitations, HLA matching was not performed for genetically unrelated donors (including spouses), but the CNI group had potentially greater degree of HLA matching. Another caveat that limits the applicability of our results is the short duration of follow-up. These patients will need to be observed for a longer period to confirm these findings.</p><p>In conclusion, deferred preemptive conversion from CNI to SIR 2 months after transplant in low risk recipients is safe and leads to a gain of about 12 mL/min over a 6-month period. Switch to SIR is also associated with expansion in T<sub>reg</sub> population. These findings need confirmation on longer follow up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0075591.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
