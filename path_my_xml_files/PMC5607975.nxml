Background</title><p>
Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) [cis-(Pt(NH3)2Cl2), cisplatin)], commonly referred to as CDDP, is a synthetic and anticancer compound (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) which is used depending on the type and histological degree of tumor, disease stage, and the patient&#x02019;s tolerance to side effects (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Cisplatin can damage both cancer and healthy cells and nephrotoxicity is one of the complications due to cisplatin (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
</p><p>
Risk of nephrotoxicity due to cisplatin is an obstacle to using high doses of this drug and hence achieving maximum therapeutic effect. Cisplatin can cause apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells (LLC-PK1) through activating mitochondrial pathways (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, frequent nephrotoxicity is one of the most important limitations of cisplatin-based chemotherapy which is associated with many complications and high mortality rate (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
</p><p>
Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity occurs due to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydroxyl radicals, which leads to lipids peroxidation, oxidation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and destruction of cell membrane. Producing such free radicals causes decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), variations in some blood-based biomarkers, and incidence of acute tubular nephrotoxicity. These complications occur mainly in proximal tubes (S3 segment) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Cisplatin enters into renal epithelial cells and may cause damage to mitochondrial nuclear DNA compounds. Then, it may cause predisposition to apoptosis and necrosis via producing ROS and activating mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial pathways (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
</p><p>
Carotenoids, including lycopene, are very strong antioxidants and can prevent the toxic effects of other substances in the body (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Carotenoids can react chemically with ROS and oxidize, and therefore prevent cell damage due to ROS (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, simultaneous use of antioxidant compounds and anticancer drugs is still being debated, because excessive use of antioxidant compounds can intervene in chemotherapy and cancer treatment (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Besides that, no ameliorate impacts have been obtained on the use of antioxidants in some studies (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
</p><p>
Despite oxidative agents play the most important role in renal tissue damage and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and few studies have investigated this issue in human beings. Thus, the role of antioxidants should be investigated in preventing such damages. Some studies are seeking to detect the best protective agent for different tissues.
</p><p>
The role of lycopene has not yet been adequately studied in protecting against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Besides that, to the best of our knowledge, no similar study has yet been conducted in Iran.
</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>
Aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic and protective effects of lycopene on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in humans.

3.1. Patients
</title><p>
In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 120 people were selected from the patients referring to the hematology and oncology clinic of the Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences by convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria were considered to be suffering cancer without primary involvement or renal metastasis, being candidate for administration of 70-100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin, 20-80 years old, creatinine (Cr) &#x0003c; 1.5 mg/dL, normal hearing, no underlying nephropathy and the performance status of 0-2 of Karnofsky. Using random allocation software, we assigned the patients randomly to two groups of cases and controls. The control group was received cisplatin and a standard regimen of kidney injury prevention (hydration + magnesium sulfate).
</p><p>
The case group were administered lycopene+ cisplatin alongside a regimen of kidney injury prevention (hydration + magnesium sulfate). Death, allergy to lycopene, hearing loss, significant neuropathy, and metastatic renal involvement were considered as exclusion criteria.
</p></sec><sec id="s3-0-2"><title>
3.2. Intervention and biochemical measurements
</title><p>
Appropriate therapeutic doses of cisplatin were intravenously administered to all the patients according to their body mass index and underlying disease(s) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Any patients of the case group took a lycopene tablet (25 mg) each 12 hours from 24 hours before to 72 hours after cisplatin administration (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To investigate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum Cr (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and GFR (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) were measured.
</p><p>
At the beginning of the study and on the days 7 and 21 after cisplatin administration, 5-cc blood samples of the participants were taken for measurement of BUN and Cr. Then, GFR was calculated with to Crockroft-Gault formula.

To compare quantitative variables, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used and to compare qualitative variables, chi-square and, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered the level of significance.
</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>4. Results</title><p>
Overall, 120 patients participated in this study. Sixty patients, assigned as cases, received lycopene and a standard regimen of kidney injury prevention and the rest, controls, received only the standard regimen of kidney injury prevention. Fifty-eight (48.3%) participants were female. In the control group, 27 (45%) and in the case group, 31 (57.7%) people were female with no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.465).

According to repeated measure ANOVA, the changing trend of serum Cr was not significantly different between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.131), although this trend was significant throughout the study in both groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011).
</p><p>
In addition, a significant change in GFR was seen throughout the study (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with a significant difference between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). A decreasing trend of GFR was seen in the control group, however, GFR increased in the case group on the first three days and then decreased partially.
</p><p>
A significant change was seen in BUN throughout the study (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) too. Additionally, a significant decrease in BUN was seen in both groups on the day three (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), but BUN increased in the case group on the day 21, however, the corresponding increase was less marked in the control group.
</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5. Discussion</title><p>
In this study, GFR decreased throughout the study in the control group, but increased in the case group within the first three days and then slightly decreased. BUN had a significantly decreasing trend in both groups with a more marked decrease in the case group, maybe due to hydration. Besides that, a significant change was seen in Cr alongside the study with no significant difference between the two groups.
</p><p>
In this regard, a study demonstrated that cisplatin administration to mice is associated with nephrotoxicity, decreases the GFR, and an increase in Cr and plasma urea. This also caused renal dysfunction associated with increased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in renal tissue. Atessahin et al demonstrated that administration of lycopene, before and after cisplatin administration, significantly protected kidneys against nephrotoxicity following cisplatin administration and improved the biomarkers in rats (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
</p><p>
In the study of Dogukan et al, the Cr and plasma urea levels were significantly lower in cisplatin + lycopene, administered group than cisplatin-administered group after the induction of nephrotoxicity. Moreover, lycopene significantly prevented increase in MDA and caused decrease in lipids peroxidation in mice. Finally, they concluded that lycopene plays a protective role against nephrotoxicity after administration of cisplatin (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the study of Erman et al, mice were assigned to four groups, control, lycopene, cisplatin, and cisplatin+ lycopene.
</p><p>
Following nephrotoxicity induction, the findings indicated that use of lycopene, after cisplatin administration, caused decrease in serum BUN, Cr, and other measured biomarkers. Thus, lycopene administration significantly resulted to protect kidneys against the complications due to use of cisplatin (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
</p><p>
A study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of lycopene on ischemic reperfusion renal damage in rats in the short term. After the induction of nephrectomy and perfusion ischemia in rats, the blood samples of rats were investigated for renal biomarkers. Pektas et al found, the pathological score, MDA, glutathione, and catalase of the control group were higher than those of lycopene-treated group. Therefore, lycopene may have protective effects on kidney injuries and related surgeries (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
</p><p>
In a study on the effect of lycopene on mercuric chloride-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, the findings indicated that lycopene reduced the toxicity due to HgCl(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) through preventing lipids peroxidation and changing delta-aminolevulinate acid dehydratase, and antioxidant enzymes, although it could not prevent the kidney injury induced by HgCl(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
</p><p>
Overall, antioxidant compounds can decrease the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, which has been confirmed in this study and other researches. Lycopene, an antioxidant, contributes to decreasing oxidative stress and preventing cancer (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The positive effects of antioxidant compounds have already been demonstrated on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. In a study on the effect of capsaicin on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, use of capsaicin, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, was found to be effective in decreasing tissue damage and serum levels of BUN and Cr (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
</p><p>
Ju et al studied the effects of apigenin, a flavonoid, on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and proximal tubular epithelial cells, and found that apigenin caused decrease in P53 activity and therefore decline in apoptosis in renal cells (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In another study, simvastatin and rosuvastatin was found to be effective in decreasing kidney injuries and lipids peroxidation due to cisplatin (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A study on the effect of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids on nephrotoxicity and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress reported consistent findings, indicating that this compound caused decrease in some blood-based biomarkers such as BUN and Cr through exerting antioxidant effects (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
</p><p>
However, the study by Mazaheri et al demonstrated that <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> essential oils had no effect on the serum levels of urea and Cr, renal tissue damage, and kidneys weight (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, a study demonstrated that not only did pomegranate flower extract protect mice against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity but it also exacerbated renal tissue damage, although this extract has antioxidant properties (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This inconsistency can be due to various antioxidant capacities of different substances, lack of extracting effective substances, and the interactions of other substances with treatment course in other studies.
</p><p>
Although antioxidant compounds can exert anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects on renal cells, the mechanism of cisplatin anti-cancer effect is to induce cell toxicity and cell apoptosis. Excessive use of antioxidants and associated supplements can intervene in cancer treatment, as a review of clinical trials reported that use of antioxidant supplements during chemotherapy and radiotherapy helped to protect tumor and hence reduced survival (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
</p><p>
Therefore, excessive use of these compounds prevents this drug from acting efficiently and effective doses should be sought out. Use of antioxidants is addressed as an approach to prevent cancer. Fighting oxidative stress and free radicals, antioxidants can exert their preventive effects. As a result, antioxidants should be cautiously used to treat cancer and addressed as adjuvant therapies accompanying main treatments.
</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>
Lycopene can be effective in decreasing the complications due to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through affecting some markers of renal function. Therefore, use of lycopene, at appropriate doses, can be considered an adjuvant therapy, alongside chemotherapy and complementary therapy, to decrease the effects of nephrotoxicity. A limitation of the present study was related to the biomarkers used to diagnose nephrotoxicity. BUN and serum Cr may delay the diagnosis of nephrotoxicity. Therefore, use of other biomarkers seems necessary to diagnose nephrotoxicity early.
</p><p>
More biomarkers should be investigated and necessary standards of sensitivity and speed should be considered in the studies on nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, the effective doses of lycopene in decreasing nephrotoxicity with no drug interactions should be sought out.
</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>
This is a retrospective single-center study with a limited proportion of patients. Thus, multi-centric studies on this titles suggests. Moreover, future studies are recommended to compare the effects of different antioxidant compounds on nephrotoxicity, to examine the effects of lycopene on the long-term prognosis in patients, and to investigate potentially unknown interactions.
