rhythmic auditory stimulation gait training can improve balance and gait ability in stroke
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty participants were randomly divided into three
groups: inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory stimulation training group (n=10),
inclined treadmill training group (n=10), and treadmill training group (n=10). For all
groups, the training was conducted for 4 weeks, 30 minutes per session, 5 times per week.
Two subjects dropped out before study completion. [Results] All variables of balance and
gait, except for the timed up and go test in the treadmill group, significantly improved
in all groups. Moreover, all variables showed a more significant improvement in the
inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory stimulation group when compared with the other
groups. Timed up and go test, Berg balance scale, 6&#x02005;m walking test, walking speed, and
symmetric index were significantly improved in the inclined treadmill group when compared
with the treadmill group. [Conclusion] Thus, for stroke patients receiving gait training,
inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory stimulation training was more effective in
maintaining balance and gait than inclined treadmill without rhythmic auditory stimulation
or only treadmill training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rhythmic auditory stimulation</kwd><kwd>Inclined treadmill</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke show various muscle abnormalities, including a combination of
denervation, disuse, remodeling, and spasticity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These reduce their balance ability and lead to gait disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abnormal gaits cause flexion and extension synergy patterns due to compensatory actions of
muscles, etc., on the unaffected side, impairment of proprioceptive sensibility, and
abnormal coordination of stiffened muscles of the lower limb<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a substitute of stair climbing exercise, inclined treadmill walking training, which is
aimed at improving these gait disorders, is being considered as an essential means for
indoor and outdoor movements of the disabled, the elderly, or pregnant women who are unable
to use stairs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Rhea et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that treadmill walking training,
compared with walking on flat ground, is characterized by a shorter step length. Oh, Kim,
and Woo<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that treadmill walking
training has negative effects on gait asymmetry. Sensory elements play an important part in
compensating for these weaknesses<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) can be used as a complementing intervention<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this intervention, the external auditory
sense of rhythms generates rhythmic and more symmetrical alternate movements in the lower
limbs of stroke patients who show gait asymmetry<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Existing studies have not shown
consistent results regarding the effects of treadmill walking training on the gait of stroke
patients. In particular, with regard to balance and gait, which are essential for the
activity and participation of stroke patients, there are no systematic studies showing the
effects of inclined treadmill walking training with RAS thus far.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the effects of inclined treadmill
walking training with RAS on balance and gait in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study population included 30 patients diagnosed with stroke at B Hospital located in
Gangwon-do, South Korea who provided written consent and understood the purpose of this
experiment. They were randomly assigned to three groups of 10 subjects each: the inclined
treadmill with RAS training group (experimental group 1, G1), the inclined treadmill without
RAS training group (G2), and the only treadmill training group (G3). This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea National University of Transportation
(approval No. KNUT IRB-18). The subjects in each group walked on a treadmill (S23T; Taeha
Mechatronics, Republic of Korea). For G1, RAS was additionally applied using a metronome
(Fretway Metro, Fretway, USA). Regarding treadmill speed for G1, G2, and G3, the patients&#x02019;
most favorite speed was adopted in the first week, and this speed was increased by 5% in the
second week. An additional 5% increase was made in the third week and no increase was made
in the fourth week. The treadmill incline for G1 and G2 was set at 5% (2.86&#x000b0;). Although a
treadmill incline of 10% was set in the second and third weeks, this increase was not
applied for those who were unable to perform treadmill walking at this inclination. No
change in the incline was made in the fourth week. For the beat of the metronome in G1, the
subjects&#x02019; cadence measured using a wireless three-axis accelerometer was applied in the
first week<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This beat was increased by 5%
increments in the second and third weeks, without any change in the fourth week<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each group performed its respective
training five times a week over a 4-week period. Each session lasted for 30 minutes. One
patient each in G2 and G3 dropped out of the experiment. The timed up and go (TUG) test and
the Berg balance scale (BBS) test were performed to measure the subjects&#x02019; balance ability.
For the measurement of their gait ability, spatiotemporal gait abilities such as walking
speed, cadence, single limb support of the affected side (SLS), and symmetric index (SI)
were measured using the 6-minute test (6MWT) and the wireless three-axis accelerometer
(G-WALK; BTS S.T.A., Italy).</p><p>PASW 18.0 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-squared test and Kruskal-Wallis H test
were performed to test homogeneity between the two groups, and the results showed that the
two groups were homogeneous (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G1</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G2</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.8 &#x000b1; 14.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.3 &#x000b1; 7.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.2 &#x000b1; 13.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.8 &#x000b1; 10.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.7 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.8 &#x000b1; 9.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.8 &#x000b1; 10.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3 &#x000b1; 11.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.8 &#x000b1; 7.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.4 &#x000b1; 10.3 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.6 &#x000b1; 8.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.1 &#x000b1; 8.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis (H/I)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemiside (Rt/Lt)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>M: male, F: female, H: hemorrhage, I: infarction, Rt: right, Lt: left</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).

Previous studies have reported that repetitive rhythms combined with movements of patients
with central nerve system damage were effective in improving their ability to perform
exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, repetitive
rhythms enhanced coordination and improved gait because of improved movements in the pelvis
and the shoulder girdle<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, G1 showed statistically significant higher improvements in the TUG and BBS when
compared with G2 and G3, whereas G3 did not exhibit statistically significant differences
within the group. This result suggests that the training for G1 was more effective than that
for G2 or G3 in improving the balance in stroke patients. In addition, regarding gait, G1
showed statistically significant higher improvements in all variables when compared with G2
and G3, and G2 exhibited statistically significant higher improvements in 6MWT, walking
speed, and SI when compared with G3.</p><p>All three groups showed improvements in gait endurance, which can be attributed to the
effects of task-specific training for 30 minutes a day. In addition, inclusion of RAS
reduced the subjects&#x02019; postural sway<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This effect can be attributed to effective movements derived from rhythmical walking.
Rhythms affect brain activities through encoding and, thus, can provide the feedback of
nerve roots and generate instinctive movements<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The more effective outcome in balance, gait speed, and cadence
could be due to improvements in SLS following the RAS-induced rhythmical walking. Thaut et
al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the application of
treadmill walking training with RAS in stroke patients led to statistically significant
improvements in gait symmetry. This result is in agreement with that of the present study.
For the route of RAS, as the body subconsciously responds to the signals of rhythms, unlike
the general auditory route, these signals are transmitted to the cerebral cortex through the
supraspinal auditory system<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
improvements in balance and gait could have been more significant in the present study.</p><p>However, our study had a limitation in that the study sample was small and included only
patients with stroke who were capable of walking. Therefore, the results of this study
cannot be generalized for all stroke patients. Thus, future longer-term studies with a
larger sample size should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Carda</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cisari</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Invernizzi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Sarcopenia or muscle modifications in neurologic diseases:
