Football Fans in Training (FFIT), developed in Scotland, successfully tackled these problems by engaging overweight/obese male football fans in sustained weight loss and positive health behaviours, through program deliveries at professional football stadia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Aims: 1) Adapt FFIT to hockey within the Canadian context and integrate with Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; (evidence-based lifestyle program) to develop Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT); 2) Explore potential for Hockey FIT to help overweight/obese men lose weight and improve other outcomes by 12&#x000a0;weeks, and retain these improvements to 12&#x000a0;months; 3) Evaluate feasibility of recruiting and retaining overweight/obese men; 4) Evaluate acceptability of Hockey FIT; and 5) Conduct program optimization via a process evaluation. We conducted a two-arm pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT) whereby 80 overweight/obese male hockey fans (35&#x02013;65 years; body-mass index &#x02265;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited through their connection to two junior A hockey teams (London and Sarnia, ON) and randomized to Intervention (Hockey FIT) or Comparator (Wait-List Control). Hockey FIT includes a 12-week Active Phase (classroom instruction and exercise sessions delivered weekly by trained coaches) and a 40-week Maintenance Phase. Data collected at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks (both groups), and 12&#x000a0;months (Intervention only), will inform evaluation of the potential of Hockey FIT to help men lose weight and improve other health outcomes. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed using data from self-reports at screening and baseline, program fidelity (program observations and coach reflections), participant focus group discussions, coach interviews, as well as program questionnaires and interviews with participants. This information will be analyzed to inform program optimization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Hockey FIT is a gender-sensitive program designed to engage overweight/obese male hockey fans to improve physical activity and healthy eating choices, thereby leading to weight loss and other positive changes in health outcomes. We expect this study to provide evidence for a full-scale confirmatory pRCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

In 2014, 21.8&#x000a0;% of Canadian men self-reported height and weight that classified them as obese (i.e., using body mass index, BMI) and 40.0&#x000a0;% of Canadian men were classified as overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A recent study by the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, analyzing records of 3.95 million people from 189 studies worldwide, showed that men had higher all-cause mortality for every additional five BMI points over 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (relative to BMI 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), compared to women (hazard ratios and 95&#x000a0;% CIs: 1.51 (1.46&#x02013;1.56) for men vs 1.30 (1.6&#x02013;1.33) for women) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The increased risk of death was also higher in younger people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Men suffer poorer health outcomes on many measures of health status compared to women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Men seem less knowledgeable about health risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; and are less likely to access, interpret and apply information to maintain and improve their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. According to the 2012&#x02013;2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey, only 24&#x000a0;% of men achieved the recommended levels of physical activity, and the majority spent their waking hours being sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite this, the issue of gender is often neglected when planning and implementing health promotion and chronic disease prevention and management strategies.</p><p>Chronic diseases share several lifestyle risk factors including obesity/overweight status, physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits and low health literacy, which if reduced, could prevent or eliminate most chronic diseases and their complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Canada, these trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which are more pronounced in rural and small urban settings, may help explain the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased mortality rates found in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since 2003, there has been a steady increase in the number of men who are obese in Canada; in 2003, 16&#x000a0;% of men were obese compared to 21.8&#x000a0;% in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These trends are alarming and pose threats to men&#x02019;s individual health and the health care system as a whole.</p><p>Men may deny illness or delay treatment, ignore health concerns or engage in high-risk behaviours to prove adherence to the construct of masculine toughness or strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Men&#x02019;s behavioural choices are also influenced by culture, class, ethnicity, context, age and life events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even so, increasing evidence shows that when gender issues are used to inform program design and delivery, men will engage in weight management initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Men may also be more open to participating in physical activity that is linked in some way to sport, athleticism, and competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Although this could exclude certain settings or ages, there is evidence that walking &#x02013; a universally accessible form of physical activity &#x02013; is appealing, at least when introduced within the right context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>While health promotion programs targeting men have been implemented in other countries including Australia and the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], programs have only recently started to emerge in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and few options exist, particularly in rural and small urban regions of Canada where the burden of chronic disease is greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In general, men are reluctant to engage in healthy lifestyle and weight loss programs, seem less aware than women of their overweight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and associate increased body size with muscularity and masculinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Physicians can play an important role in the dissemination of physical activity recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as approximately 82&#x000a0;% of Canadians have reported having a regular doctor place they go for care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Most physicians, however, do not regularly assess or prescribe physical activity as part of a routine care, and even when discussed, few provide specific recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In a survey conducted in men living in small urban and rural communities in Canada, we found the following healthy lifestyle strategies appealed to men: 1) physical activity goals set with the help of a coach; 2) training for an event such a charity walk or sport; 3) in-person sessions with a coach and their peers in a fun atmosphere; and 4) technology-supported healthy lifestyle tools. A common theme that arose from our survey was the importance of support from other men. Men also frequently indicated that they would be motivated to lead a healthier lifestyle if it made them feel better (e.g., more energy, less pain, better sleep) and improved their fitness and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Men appear to harbour misperceptions about the dietary behaviours required to lose weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and perceive dieting and organized weight loss programs as &#x02018;feminized&#x02019; domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, interventions that target men will be more likely to succeed if they encompass physical activity as well as diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and similar to our findings, if they include peer groups they can identify with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Programs situated in a sporting context where participants had a strong sense of affiliation have been found to be both effective and to have low dropout rates, due to high ratings of participant satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The social and psychological connections (e.g., identity, validation, belonging) that being a fan creates are powerful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and this is particularly true in group contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Using a pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (pRCT) design, Football Fans in Training (FFIT), a gender-sensitised, weight loss and healthy living program developed for delivery to men through Scottish professional football clubs by club coaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], demonstrated that the professional football club setting was a powerful &#x02018;draw&#x02019; for overweight and obese men at high risk of future ill-health across the socio-economic spectrum and clinically significant weight loss and cost-effectiveness 12&#x000a0;months after baseline measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Canadian hockey is core to Canadian culture: two-thirds of adult Canadians follow the game as a fan and 8 out of 10 identify hockey as a key part of what it means to be Canadian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In many areas, particularly small towns and rural areas, junior hockey clubs are the primary fan-base. These junior hockey clubs are often a rallying point in these communities, attracting a large number of fans (disproportionately male) to games, often more than in urban areas. The Ontario Hockey League (OHL), a semi-professional Junior A hockey league, is a member of the Canadian Hockey League, with one of the world&#x02019;s largest hockey fan-bases; for example, last season, more than 9 million fans attended Canadian Hockey League games, many in small urban centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) may provide a preferred sport-fan venue to engage at-risk Canadian men. Hockey FIT will be based on FFIT, but adapted to hockey within the Canadian context, and, to strengthen sustainability, will be integrated with components of our lifestyle prescription program (Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122;). The Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program is grounded in scientific evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and members of our pan-Canadian Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; Network have demonstrated that the program can be applied to numerous community-based settings in urban and rural areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aims</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim 1: Adaptation and integration of FFIT and Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; to create Hockey FIT</title><p>Hockey FIT was adapted from FFIT for the Canadian context using the love of hockey to encourage middle-aged, overweight and obese men to lose weight, increase physical activity and live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>The Principal Investigator and other members of the Central Research Team (including the coach for the London site) went to Glasgow, Scotland in January 2015 to meet with FFIT researchers and observe FFIT sessions. While there, research team members attended two 90-min FFIT sessions at different clubs and were introduced to the format used to deliver FFIT programs, and coaching techniques to make the sessions enjoyable and interactive. The FFIT Coach Handbook was used as a reference for creating Hockey FIT sessions and developing the Hockey FIT Coach and Participant Handbooks.</p><p>We adopted the study design used by FFIT (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section), but instead of targeting at-risk male soccer fans as was done in Scotland, we focused on hockey fans in Canada. The lifestyle prescription and the technology support tools protocols from the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] were incorporated into the adapted FFIT approach, to develop Hockey FIT. As part of the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program, participants receive individualized healthy living prescriptions for exercise, physical activity (step counts) and healthy eating, and are supported in-person to achieve their prescriptions and set goals with the help of a trained coach. To support longer-term maintenance of healthy lifestyles, participants are also offered free-of-charge access to technology-based coaching and support options (e.g., smartphone apps, private web-based social network, and telephone coaching).</p><p>Throughout the design of Hockey FIT, the research team made changes to the FFIT program design, to ensure the content followed Canadian guidelines and would resonate with Canadians. This included changing wording and doing conversions in some of the measurement tools (e.g., chips to fries; converting units of pints to cups; etc.). As well, Canadian resources were substituted in place of their British counterparts (e.g., Canada&#x02019;s Food Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). During FFIT, all sessions took place at the home stadium of the soccer team and were run by club community coaches (i.e., employees of the soccer clubs). For Hockey FIT, sessions were held at either the home arena of the hockey team or at a local fitness club and coaches were University-level students.</p><p>The Coach and Participant Handbooks were edited and reviewed by the Hockey FIT coaches, the Principal Investigator and other research team members in development of the final versions. The coaches ran five mock Hockey FIT sessions, using members of the research team and their friends and/or family as study participants. The research team also met weekly during the Hockey FIT program delivery to discuss progress, fidelity and further changes to the program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim 2: Potential for Hockey FIT to positively impact health outcomes</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a 12-week, two-arm, pilot pRCT of Hockey FIT, as well as a process evaluation of the Hockey FIT program, in which male hockey fans of two OHL teams (London Knights and Sarnia Sting), were individually randomized (1:1) to the Intervention (Hockey FIT) group (starting Hockey FIT program immediately) or the Comparator (Wait-List Control) group (starting Hockey FIT program after a 12-week delay). The 12-week active phase of the Hockey FIT intervention was followed by a 40-week maintenance phase. Measurement sessions were conducted at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks (both groups) and then again at 12&#x000a0;months (intervention group only).

</p><p>Study recruitment began in April 2015 and the intervention periods started on May 12, 2015 (London site) and May 27, 2015 (Sarnia site). Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board approved this study and all participants provided written informed consent. The pRCT portion of this study was registered on February 26, 2015 with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02396524).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Location</title><p>The Central Research Team is located at Western University (London, ON, Canada). The London Knights team is in a medium-sized media market in London, Ontario (population 366,151 in 2011), and the Sarnia Sting team is in a smaller urban centre in Sarnia, Ontario (population 89,555 in 2011). The Hockey FIT program sessions were delivered at GoodLife Fitness Centres Inc., Budweiser Gardens (home arena for the London Knights), or the RBC Centre (home arena for the Sarnia Sting). All measurement sessions were conducted at either Western University (London site) or the RBC Centre (Sarnia site).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>A recruitment target of 80 male hockey fans of the London Knights and Sarnia Sting (40 per team; 20 men per arm within each team) was based on a sample size calculation for a subsequent full-scale RCT, following methods by FFIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To detect a 5&#x000a0;% difference in weight loss between intervention and comparison groups at 12&#x000a0;months, with a standard deviation of 19.9&#x000a0;%, 80&#x000a0;% power and a 0.05 two-sided significance level, 250 men are required in each arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. To allow for 25&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up, a very conservative estimate, the sample size was increased to 335 men in each arm. A target of 670 men reflects the need to recruit 40 male hockey fans from 17 different OHL teams. The need to recruit 40 male hockey fans per site is reflected in this pilot trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment &#x00026; participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through a variety of methods: team email blasts, team social media accounts (i.e., team twitter feed posts), posters, traditional media-based advertisements (newspaper, TV, radio, community magazines), Hockey FIT website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], word of mouth, and/or direct contact with potential recruits at the OHL team arena on game day. Those interested in participating in the study contacted the Hockey FIT Research Coordinator by email or telephone. The Research Coordinator pre-screened individuals for eligibility by phone or email; specifically, interested individuals were asked about their gender, age, height, weight and availability to attend Hockey FIT sessions on a certain day of the week, for 12&#x000a0;weeks, starting on a set date. Individuals deemed likely to be eligible were then invited to attend an in-person screening session. <italic>Inclusion criteria:</italic> Men aged 35&#x02013;65 years, with an objectively measured BMI of at least 28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and meet safety requirements using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. <italic>Exclusion criteria:</italic> Unable to comprehend the letter of information and consent documentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Screening</title><p>The formal screening process for each man lasted approximately 20&#x000a0;min. Screening only proceeded once participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Following this, men self-completed the PAR-Q; if a participant answered, &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to one or more of seven questions on the PAR-Q, a research team member completed a Health Care Provider Clearance form to highlight specific concerns regarding the man&#x02019;s ability to perform physical activity. This form was then provided to the Study Physician and Principal Investigator who determined whether the individual was cleared to participate in Hockey FIT. To conclude the screening session, participants were taken individually to a private area for measurements of height (Seca 213 portable stadiometer) and weight (Tanita HD351 digital weight scale). All eligible men were then invited to continue with a baseline measurement session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization, allocation &#x00026; blinding</title><p>Following baseline measurement (including seven days of tracking steps via a pedometer), participants returned for an enrolment and allocation session. The randomization sequence was computer-generated [1:1 in block sizes of 4 and stratified by site (London or Sarnia), using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Statistical Analysis Software)] and concealed using opaque envelopes until interventions were assigned (by an individual not involved in generating the randomization sequence). Participants were allocated in correspondence to the numerical order of the randomization envelopes and their order of appointments.</p><p>All participants (intervention and comparator) were provided with copies of Canada&#x02019;s Food Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. All participants were also given an adverse events log and the research team member allocating participants stressed the importance of keeping the research team and/or their Hockey FIT coach informed of any injuries, illnesses, or changes in medication for the entirety of the study. Participants allocated to the intervention group were informed to keep their pedometer for use over the duration of the program. Participants allocated to the comparator group were asked to return their pedometer and continue with usual activities, without further intervention from the research team. Following completion of the 12-week measurement sessions, participants in the comparator group were invited to take part in the Hockey FIT program, following the exact same protocol as the intervention group.</p><p>Due to the nature of the study, participants and coaches could not be blinded to group allocation. During 12-week measurement sessions, a blinded assessor conducted all weight measurements in a separate room; no other measurements were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Hockey FIT program</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>12-week active phase</title><p>The Hockey FIT program uses group-based delivery to help men achieve changes in health behaviours and indicators.

</p><p>All participants received Hockey FIT handbooks at the first session. Nine sessions took place at a local GoodLife Fitness club, whereas three sessions (#1, #5, #11) were held at the affiliated hockey team&#x02019;s arena. It was not possible to hold all Hockey FIT sessions at the hockey team arena due to logistical reasons; however, sessions at the arenas were critical in that they provided an association between the team and program. Hockey FIT head coaches were male graduate students in Kinesiology with extensive backgrounds in coaching (one with extensive background in hockey coaching). The Hockey FIT assistant coaches were senior female university students in Kinesiology, who also had a background in playing hockey.</p><p>Sessions are comprised of: 1) classroom-based education focusing on healthy eating and physical activity, delivered in an interactive, non-didactic style; and 2) exercise sessions where men receive training in aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises, incorporating their love of hockey &#x0201c;off the ice&#x0201d; (i.e., stick handling drills with rubber pucks), and tailored to individual abilities. At the start of the program, more time is allocated to education during each session, but as the program progresses, the amount of time spent on the classroom education decreases, while the amount of time spent on group-based exercise increases. This also coincides with the intensity of the exercise sessions increasing and the educational content becoming more focused on reviewing previously learned content.</p><p>Similar to FFIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the delivery of Hockey FIT, but not its core components, is flexible to: 1) allow coaches to run the program to complement their own strengths/weaknesses; 2) match the personalities of a particular group of men; and 3) work within given delivery environments (e.g., arenas, health club facilities, or community centres). Hockey FIT includes components designed to appeal to male hockey fans such as: team-based incentives (i.e., visits from players); elements of competition (i.e., during exercise sessions); and use of humour to help men address sensitive topics (i.e., weight gain).</p><p>Coaches also provide instruction on behaviour change techniques (BCTs) effective in physical activity and dietary interventions (e.g., self-monitoring, specific goal setting and review, and feedback on behaviour) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. These BCTs are associated with control theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and were mapped to FFIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; the program also draws on other BCTs including social cognitive theory and self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Coaches promote peer and other forms of social support as these have been shown effective in preventing relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>At two different time points (session #4 and #10), participants completed the Step Test and Exercise Prescription (STEP) tool in order to receive a personalized target heart rate (65&#x02013;85&#x000a0;% of estimated maximum heart rate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Coaches then encouraged participants during aerobic activities to exercise at their training heart rate and/or at a rating of 5&#x02013;8 on the 10-point modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Throughout the 12&#x000a0;weeks, participants took part in an incremental pedometer-based walking program. Participants also set and tracked individualized lifestyle prescriptions for physical activity (steps), exercise and healthy eating; these prescriptions were modified over the 12-week program when necessary to match participant progress.</p><p>In preparing for the <italic>Maintenance Phase</italic>, men were introduced to eHealth technology support tools, including the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps smartphone app (providing a virtual coach and tools to sustain increased physical activity) and their own team&#x02019;s Hockey FIT social network &#x02013; a secure, closed, web-based network of their Hockey FIT group and Head Coach on Tyze Personal Networks (i.e., participants could not invite other individuals into the network).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>40-week maintenance phase</title><p>Participants were encouraged to continue with their lifestyle prescriptions and sustain their behaviour change with the support of the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps app and the Hockey FIT Social Network. Men were encouraged to use the Network to share success stories, share resources (e.g., healthy recipes), ask questions and keep in touch with others in the group, including the Hockey FIT coach. The platform was a place where resources from the program were shared and made available to all participants. In addition to being used for casual exchange, the Hockey FIT Social Network platform was also used by the Head Coach to send out standardized messages (at 1, 3, 5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5&#x000a0;months following the active phase) containing reminders and encouraging messages about sustaining healthy lifestyle behaviours.</p><p>Six months after the completion of the Active Phase, participants were invited to attend a Hockey FIT Reunion (combining participants from both sites), which consisted of a one-hour booster session followed by lunch and free entry to a London Knights vs. Sarnia Sting game (held in London, ON). The Head Coaches from both London and Sarnia ran the booster session, which focused on reinforcing topics such as goal setting, stages of change and re-setting lifestyle prescriptions, and included an exercise segment focused on aerobic activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome evaluation</title><p>At each site, all participants began the study at the same time and teams of research staff completed measurement sessions over an approximate 2-week period (at each time point). All randomized men were contacted at each follow-up, including those in the intervention group who did not complete the Hockey FIT program. Questionnaires were mailed for self-completion (and a time arranged with the study team for pick-up) for any participants who agreed to assessment but were not willing or able to come to a measurement session. Since the comparator group were offered the opportunity to take part in the Hockey FIT program shortly following the 12-week measurement session, individuals in this group did not participate in any follow up measurements beyond 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>At baseline, participant demographic and clinical characteristics were collected including: age, marital status, education, occupation, ethnicity, health status, smoking status, medical conditions/history and medications.</p><sec id="FPar3"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The following outcome measures were taken at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks in both groups, and then again at 12&#x000a0;months in the intervention group only:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>

</p><p>All self-reported measures were collected using paper-based, self-administered questionnaires. Outcome measures were modelled after the FFIT evaluation but included a few differences: 1) the Hockey FIT evaluation replaced the Short Form-12 with the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L questionnaire for a simple measurement of health-related quality of life and pilot of the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L for ease of use for planning for a future economic evaluation; 2) Hockey FIT added the Starting the Conversation Questionnaire to obtain a simple single score of healthful eating; and 3) Hockey FIT also included measurement of physical activity via pedometers.

Hockey Fans in Training is based on a gender-sensitive approach that appeals to men, but tailored to delivery within a Canadian context. As observed by Evans et al. we &#x0201c;&#x02026;need to move from description toward interventions in ways that mobilize what we have learned about masculinities and men&#x02019;s health and illness practices. Furthermore, men-centered interventions should also be targeted to specific sub-groups, while being responsive to men&#x02019;s particular life course health issues&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In this study our aims are to: adapt FFIT and integrate this with Health<italic>e</italic>Steps<sup>TM</sup> to create Hockey FIT; examine the potential for Hockey FIT to improve health in overweight/obese men; evaluate feasibility (recruitment, retention) and acceptability of Hockey FIT; and finally to optimize Hockey FIT using findings from a process evaluation. If our pilot results are promising, we intend to conduct a large-scale pRCT to be able to gain confirmatory evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Hockey FIT, as well as acceptability of the Hockey FIT program in overweight and obese men. These future efforts will then be used to support scale-up of the program across a broad distribution of settings and communities, with the overall goal of improving men&#x02019;s health.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCTs</term><def><p>Behaviour change techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DINE</term><def><p>Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-3L</term><def><p>European Quality of Life &#x02013; 5 Dimensions &#x02013; 3 Level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFIT</term><def><p>Football Fans in Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hockey FIT</term><def><p>Hockey Fans in Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I-PANAS-SF</term><def><p>International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p>Metabolic Equivalent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHL</term><def><p>Ontario Hockey League</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAR-Q</term><def><p>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pRCT</term><def><p>pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSES</term><def><p>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STC</term><def><p>Starting the Conversation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STEP</term><def><p>Step Test and Exercise Prescription</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the following organizations (and key individuals) for their contributions to the Hockey FIT pilot study: London Knights, Sarnia Sting, GoodLife Fitness, Saint Elizabeth Health Care (Tyze Personal Networks), The Marketing Department, Bank of Montreal, and Bell Media.
