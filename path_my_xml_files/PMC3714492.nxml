In the Prasugrel Optimizing Antiplatelet Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus (OPTIMUS-3) study, in patients with DM and coronary artery disease (CAD), prasugrel provided a higher inhibitory platelet activity than high-dose clopidogrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A prespecified, subgroup analysis of the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel&#x02013;Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38 (TRITON-TIMI 38) showed that prasugrel significantly reduced the incidence of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with clopidogrel (12.2 and 17.0%, respectively, HR 0.70; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) among DM patients, although without significant DM status-by-treatment interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Of note, no benefit on mortality was observed with prasugrel over clopidogrel. Furthermore, in the subgroup analyses of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, the reduction in the primary composite end point, all-cause mortality, and stent thrombosis with no increase in major bleeding in DM patients by ticagrelor was consistent with the overall cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). While interpreting the above subanalyses, it has been proposed that prasugrel may be the preferred treatment option in DM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), although a word of caution has been raised by others for comparison between PLATO and TRITON regarding early ischemic events in such patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>There are no direct clinical outcome comparisons of ticagrelor versus prasugrel. In a pharmacodynamic comparison of ticagrelor versus prasugrel in ACS patients undergoing PCI and exhibiting high PR (HPR) while on clopidogrel, ticagrelor reduced PR to a lower level than prasugrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary PCI, both ticagrelor and prasugrel appeared similarly effective in reducing PR during the first 24 h, with lower PR achieved with ticagrelor than prasugrel at day 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In the current study, we aimed to compare the pharmacodynamic action of ticagrelor versus prasugrel in DM patients with ACS undergoing PCI who had been pretreated with clopidogrel.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study protocol</title><p>In consecutive type 2 DM patients with ACS undergoing PCI with drug eluting stent implantation, we performed a prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blind, investigator-initiated, crossover study to compare platelet inhibition by 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily versus 10 mg prasugrel once daily. At the time of PCI, clopidogrel-naive patients and those on 75 mg clopidogrel for &#x0003c;7 days without initial loading dose received 600 mg clopidogrel. Patients on clopidogrel &#x0003c;7 days but with 300-mg loading or those on clopidogrel for &#x0003e;7 days did not receive any additional loading. Patients were excluded if they had periprocedural IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, age &#x02265;75 years, body weight &#x0003c;60 kg, active bleeding, bleeding diathesis, chronic oral anticoagulation treatment, PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting during the previous 3 months, hemodynamic instability, platelet count &#x0003c;100,000/&#x003bc;L, hematocrit &#x0003c;30%, HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;10%, creatinine clearance &#x0003c;30 mL/min, severe hepatic dysfunction, use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, increased risk of bradycardia, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All patients received an intra-arterial dose of 70 IU/kg heparin. After PCI, all patients received aspirin 100 mg/day indefinitely. All patients were on DM treatment for at least 1 month, which was kept constant during the study period.</p><p>After a baseline blood sampling while on clopidogrel and at least 24 h post-PCI, patients were randomized (day 0) in a 1:1 ratio using computerized random-number generation by an independent investigator to 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily or 10 mg prasugrel once daily, until day 15 postrandomization. At day 15 &#x000b1; 2, a visit was performed for PR measurement and safety evaluation, with the blood sample being obtained 2&#x02013;4 h after the last study drug dose, followed by crossover directly to the alternate therapy for an additional 15 days without an intervening washout period. Compliance to antiplatelet therapy was assessed by interview and tablet counting. At day 30 &#x000b1; 2, patients returned for the clinical and laboratory assessment as they did on day 15. Physicians and operators who performed platelet function testing were blinded as to the actual drug used, while an independent physician monitored bleeding and adverse event data. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of our institution. All patients gave their informed written consent.

However, both agents effectively treat HPR. These results are in the same line of evidence with studies in mixed (DM and non-DM) patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In the OPTIMUS-3 study, in DM patients with CAD, prasugrel resulted in a higher inhibitory platelet activity than high-dose clopidogrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In prasugrel-treated patients, PR was 120 PRU at 7 days (24 h after the last maintenance dose), and the HPR rate was 2.9%. In DM patients also undergoing PCI for ACS and treated by clopidogrel, switching to 10 mg prasugrel daily resulted in a reduction of PR and HPR at 1 month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Our findings concerning prasugrel are in agreement with these results. To our knowledge, there has been no previous pharmacodynamic study with ticagrelor exclusively in DM patients. In diabetic rats, the ADP-induced platelet aggregation was strongly reduced by ticagrelor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The consistent, very low PR levels achieved with ticagrelor in our DM patients are similar to those described in stable CAD and in ACS patients undergoing PCI and exhibiting HPR while on clopidogrel and receiving this agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, the primary end point's absolute reduction with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was 4.8%, while in the PLATO trial, the primary end point's absolute reduction with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel was 2.1%. This has led to the suggestion that prasugrel treatment may a be a more appropriate choice when treating DM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Our results point in the opposite direction, since ticagrelor appears to be a stronger antiplatelet agent than prasugrel in DM patients, in consistency with pharmacodynamic results from direct comparisons of the two agents in mixed populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Prasugrel might be, indeed, more suitable than ticagrelor for DM patients. This hypothesis, however, should be clinically tested with a direct comparison of the two agents in a DM population. If this scenario proves to be valid, our study suggests that differences other than PR reduction will be sought between the two agents. The possibility that, despite very high levels of platelet inhibition achieved by ticagrelor, this treatment may not be sufficient for adequate protection against ischemic events in patients with DM has been raised previously, along with the possible requirement of other therapy, beyond the antiplatelet, antithrombin, or long-term anticoagulation one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Of note, in the diabetic cohort of the Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRILOGY ACS) trial, prasugrel did not significantly reduce the frequency of the primary end point, as compared with clopidogrel, a finding consistent with the overall trial results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Only one method of platelet function testing was used, and in a recent study, altering antiplatelet therapy on the basis of results from VerifyNow did not change clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, the Verify Now assay is most likely the best validated platelet function test and has been found to correlate well with light transmittance aggregometry, which is considered to be the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; method. Active metabolites were not measured and pharmacokinetic correlations cannot be made. Since the majority of ACS patients in our area still receive clopidogrel at first medical contact, switching thereafter to the newer agent most commonly in the PCI hospital, we did not study clopidogrel-naive patients for recruitment purposes. This practice, however, is commonly followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Our study was a pharmacodynamic one, and no conclusions on the clinical outcome of DM patients treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel can be drawn. Therefore, our results could be considered preliminary, though hypothesis generating.</p><p>In DM patients with ACS who had been pretreated with clopidogrel and underwent PCI, ticagrelor achieved a significantly higher platelet inhibition than prasugrel. Both antiplatelet agents effectively treated HPR. The relevance of these findings to the clinical efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and prasugrel in DM patients needs further elucidation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
