The main product of the mevalonate pathway is cholesterol; however, the pathway also produces a number of nonsterol isoprenoid side products, which are important regulators of angiogenesis, proliferation, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HMG-CoAR inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and in xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Statins have been suggested to lower the cancer incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but to date epidemiological studies have failed to confirm an association between statin use and overall breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A lower incidence of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors has, however, been reported among statin users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between postdiagnosis statin use and breast cancer recurrence has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We previously demonstrated an association between tumor-specific HMG-CoAR expression and improved prognosis in both breast cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Using immunohistochemistry in 511 incident breast cancer cases within the population-based prospective cohort Malm&#x000f6; Diet and Cancer Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we demonstrated that increased levels of HMG-CoAR protein expression were associated with favorable characteristics such as a smaller tumor size, low histological grade and ER positivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A validation study confirmed these findings and demonstrated that HMG-CoAR was an independent prognostic marker, associated with an improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) that was particularly evident in ER-positive tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Based on these findings we sought to investigate the predictive value HMG-CoAR expression in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. The relationship between HMG-CoAR expression and tamoxifen response was initially examined <italic>in vitro </italic>using a cell line model of tamoxifen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was then examined in a gene expression dataset published by Chanrion and colleagues containing 155 primary breast tumors obtained from patients treated with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally HMG-CoAR protein expression was examined in premenopausal patients with stage II (pT2 N0 M0, pT1-2 N1 M0) invasive breast cancer. These patients had participated in a prospective randomized trial for 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no systemic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>MCF-7 cells and their tamoxifen-resistant derivative LCC9 were obtained from Prof. Robert Clarke (Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA) and were maintained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blot analysis was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

HMG-CoAR-F (5'-GGACCCCTTTGCTTAGATGAAA-3') and HMG-CoAR-R (5'-CCACCAAGACCTATTGCTCTG-3') primers were designed using Primer Express software (Version 2.0; Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and were used to amplify a HMG-CoAR-specific DNA fragment with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Relative HMG-CoAR expression levels in untreated MCF-7 cells versus LCC9 cells were calculated using the qBase real-time PCR relative quantification software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], with all samples normalized to 18s rRNA. Negative controls included a no-template control and a no-reverse-transcriptase control.

A sample of 10<sup>5 </sup>cells was plated in 96-well plates and grown for 48 hours. Fresh medium containing various concentrations of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and cells were incubated for 5 days. On day 5, 50 &#x003bc;l of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) in PBS were added to each well. After 4 hours at 37&#x000b0;C, the medium was carefully removed from the wells and the remaining formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The absorbance at 570 nm was read on a microplate reader.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Cohort I consisted of a gene expression dataset published by Chanrion and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], containing 155 primary breast tumors obtained from patients who had undergone initial surgery between 1989 and 2001 at the Cancer Research Center of Val d'Aurelle in Montpellier, the Bergoni&#x000e9; Institute in Bordeaux, or the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Turin. The median follow-up time for all patients was 5.5 years. The aim of this study was to identify a gene expression signature associated with tamoxifen resistance. Eight tumors were ER-negative, and six of these tumors were progesterone receptor (PR)-positive. No patient received neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy as first-line therapy. All patients were treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (20 mg daily) for 5 years. One hundred and twenty-one patients also received adjuvant radiotherapy. Recurrence was observed in 52 patients (48 distant metastases and four local recurrences) with a median relapse time of 37.1 months. Raw gene expression data and clinical data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO:GSE9893] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The log ratio of gene expression values was used without further transformation. For statistical analysis, HMG-CoAR expression levels were analyzed as a continuous variable.</p><p>Cohort II consisted of 564 premenopausal women with primary breast cancer in the south and southeast regions of Sweden were enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial and were randomized to either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (<italic>n </italic>= 276) or a control group (<italic>n </italic>= 288) irrespective of hormonal receptor status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tamoxifen on RFS, and the study has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. RFS was considered local, regional, distant recurrences and breast cancer-specific death, but not contralateral breast cancer. The inclusion criteria were premenopausal patients, or patients younger than 50 years, with stage II (pT2 N0 M0, pT1-2 N1 M0) invasive breast cancer treated by modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with axillary lymph node dissection. Postoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy) was administered after breast-conserving surgery, and all lymph-node-positive patients received locoregional radiotherapy. Less than 2% of the patients received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for patients without breast cancer events was 13.9 years. The ethics committees at Lund and Link&#x000f6;ping Universities approved the study. Oral informed consent was registered for all patients. The results of the trial have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the trial has been included in the Oxford meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue microarray construction</title><p>Five hundred paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were used for tissue microarray (TMA) construction. TMAs were constructed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In brief, two 0.6 mm cores were taken from areas representative of invasive cancer and were mounted in a recipient block using a manual arraying device (MTA-1; Beecher Inc.).

HMG-CoAR was not expressed in the nucleus. Discordant cores were reassessed jointly and a consensus was reached. HER2 and Ki-67 were assessed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ER-negativity and PR-negativity was defined as &#x0003c;10% positively staining nuclei, according to current clinical guidelines in Sweden.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in distribution of clinical data and tumor characteristics between HMG-CoAR-negative and HMG-CoAR-positive tumors were evaluated using the chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to illustrate differences between RFS according to HMG-CoAR expression. Cox regression proportional hazards models were used to estimate the impact of HMG-CoAR expression on RFS and overall survival (OS) in both univariate and multivariate analysis, adjusted for tumor size, age at diagnosis, ER status, HER2 status, lymph node status and Nottingham Histological Grade in the entire cohort. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative hazards adjusted or not for potential prognostic factors. The model was used in Cohort II to estimate the interaction effect between tamoxifen treatment and HMG-CoAR expression in order to measure any possible difference in treatment effect based on HMG-CoAR expression. For this purpose an interaction variable was constructed: TAM treatment (+/-) &#x000d7; HMG-COAR (+/-). All calculations were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided and <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HMG-CoAR is associated with tamoxifen response <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The specificity of the anti HMG-CoAR antibody was confirmed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Our results demonstrate a potentially important association with tamoxifen response both <italic>in vitro </italic>and using two independent breast cancer cohorts, one of which encompasses a randomized control trial of premenopausal stage II disease.</p><p>A wealth of evidence supports the role of tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; however, resistance to tamoxifen is a significant clinical problem - and the Oxford meta-analysis reported a relapse rate of 15%, and an 8% incidence of breast-cancer-specific mortality within 5 years of the commencement of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The introduction of aromatase inhibitors may lead to an improvement in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but resistance to aromatase inhibitors may become a problem over time. In premenopausal women, tamoxifen remains the endocrine drug of choice and both inherent and acquired resistance may be more prevalent in this population. Tamoxifen resistance in premenopausal women is quite hard to quantify accurately as the majority of premenopausal patients receive adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy; however, Ryden and colleagues reported a recurrence rate of 39.7% at 10 years in the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy in the trial from which Cohort II was derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An ability to identify patients who will respond to endocrine therapy prior to commencing treatment would be extremely beneficial.</p><p>To that end, the data presented here are particularly interesting. Cox regression analysis confirmed HMG-CoAR was an independent prognostic marker in both cohorts. Cohort I was a nonrandomized cohort consisting of a mixture of premenopausal and postmenopausal patients and therefore cannot be used to validate a predictive biomarker; however, this cohort provides important information, particularly as HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was measured as a continuous variable. The relationship between HMG-CoAR protein expression and tamoxifen response was examined in Cohort II, a randomized exclusively premenopausal cohort, and a Cox interaction analysis revealed an interaction between tamoxifen treatment and HMG-CoAR expression. Subset analysis of Cohort II revealed that tumors expressing both ER and HMG-CoAR were particularly sensitive to tamoxifen, but tumors that expressed either ER or HMG-CoAR also responded to tamoxifen. In addition HMG-CoAR-positive/ER-positive patients had a significantly improved response to tamoxifen compared with HMG-CoAR-negative/ER-positive patients.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies by our group, none of the tumors expressed high levels (3+) of HMG-CoAR. This difference could potentially be explained by the fact that Cohort II was an exclusively premenopausal cohort with stage II breast cancer, which also explains the positive association with lymph node status seen in the present study. In our two previous breast cancer studies we demonstrated an inverse relationship between tumor size and HMG-CoAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and therefore the absence of small stage I tumors from Cohort II could explain the lack of tumors expressing high levels of HMG-CoAR in this study. This argument is further strengthened by the inverse relationship between HMG-CoAR mRNA expression and tumor size demonstrated in Cohort I in this study, as this cohort also included a significant number of small stage I tumors. We are unable to explain the positive association between Her2 and HMG-CoAR seen in Cohort II, but this could potentially be explained by the association with lymph-node-positivity.</p><p>Such findings raise the possibility of pharmacological interventions to increase tumor-specific HMG-CoAR expression as a potential therapeutic option for breast cancer. Statin-induced mevalonate depletion has been shown to result in an adaptive induction of HMG-CoAR expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and MCF7 breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Treatment of MCF7 cells with mevastatin resulted in a 10-fold to 15-fold induction of HMG-CoAR activity in association with a 2.5-fold to 3.5-fold induction of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that treatment with statins may increase tumor-specific HMG-CoAR expression <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, this suggestion remains to be fully elucidated. Given our findings that increased levels of HMG-CoAR expression are associated with an improved response to tamoxifen in ER-positive tumors, a combination of tamoxifen and statins may be a new therapeutic option. Further studies, however, are required to investigate the value of HMG-CoAR expression as a predictive marker of response to statin treatment.</p><p>Despite an ever-growing body of literature describing the anti-neoplastic properties of statins, epidemiologic data regarding their preventive effect against cancer in general - and breast cancer in particular - remain inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In the adjuvant setting, a recent preoperative window trial of ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ </italic>and stage I breast cancer was the first to demonstrate that statins can inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], raising the possibility that the combination of statins and well-established chemotherapeutic and endocrine agents may be an option. A synergism between statins and trastuzumab, rapamycin and epirubicin has been demonstrated in breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; however, a synergistic relationship between tamoxifen and statins has yet to be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data describe HMG-CoAR as a significant predictor of tamoxifen response in premenopausal breast cancer patients with both ER-positive and ER-negative tumors. Using a cohort of patients who had participated in a randomized control trial with long-term follow-up, we have demonstrated that tumor-specific HMG-CoAR expression predicts response to tamoxifen. Tumors that express both ER and HMG-CoAR had an excellent response to tamoxifen, but tumors that express ER or HMG-CoAR also respond to tamoxifen. These findings suggest that the combination of tamoxifen and statins may be a viable and well-tolerated therapeutic option for a subset of breast cancer patients, which warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ER: estrogen receptor; HMG-CoAR: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase; MTT: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; OS: overall survival; PR: progesterone receptor; RFS: recurrence-free survival; TMA: tissue microarray.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>DJB, KJ, MU and FP hold pending intellectual property in relation to HMG-CoAR as a prognostic biomarker in epithelial ovarian cancer and a predictive biomarker in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer.
