Inherent in all intervention trials is the need to monitor and report adverse events. The vast majority of adverse events are anticipated, and only unanticipated problems as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that are protocol-related warrant reporting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current National Institute on Aging (NIA) guidelines on adverse event surveillance require documentation of all adverse events with expedited reporting (within 48&#x0202f;h of Principal Investigator notification) of all serious adverse events (SAE) to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and NIA irrespective of protocol relationship [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Adapted from current adverse event reporting guidelines under Department of Health and Human Services Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Part 46.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0015">Resources required to meet NIA reporting guidelines may be prohibitive for intervention trials of older adults. Typically, personnel record adverse event data on paper forms including the nature and time of the event, associated hospitalizations, when the Principal Investigator was notified, and whether the event is ongoing or warrants reporting to external entities or study participants. This process may be labor-intensive for older adults that have differing susceptibilities to SAE. Specifically, nursing home residents may be high-risk for SAE by virtue of functional disabilities, grouped quarter living hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious disease outbreaks) and greater comorbidities compared to highly functional older community dwellers. Thus, high-risk nursing home residents are more likely than older community dwellers to meet SAE definitions during participation in intervention trials. However, data regarding SAE occurrence in low-risk intervention trials of older adults are lacking [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Quantifying SAE incidence in low-risk intervention trials of older adults may inform trial monitoring protocols and resource allocation for clinical personnel. For example, if expected SAE incidence is low, Principal Investigators may consider assigning less personnel time and effort towards SAE surveillance.</p><p id="p0020">As investigators from two older adult clinical trials, one among a cohort of community dwellers (i.e., lifestyle interventions and independence for elders [LIFE] trial) and one among a cohort of nursing home residents (i.e., CRANberry capsules for prevention of urinary tract infection in Nursing home residents at Yale [CRANNY]), we are uniquely positioned to describe SAE using primary data from two distinct older adult populations. This study aimed to describe the incidence of SAE per participant-month of surveillance in LIFE (including only participants at the Yale site) and CRANNY and to describe the incidence of protocol-related, unanticipated SAE among participants in LIFE and CRANNY to inform resource allocation for SAE monitoring and reporting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0025">This study consisted of 200 participants enrolled in the LIFE trial at the Yale site, and 185 participants enrolled in the CRANNY trial. Only the Yale participants in LIFE were included to allow for comparable samples sizes and geographic distribution between both clinical trials. Participants in LIFE were sedentary older men and women with functional limitations randomized to a physical activity intervention or a successful aging health education intervention targeting prevention of major mobility disability. Participants in CRANNY were women nursing home residents age 65 or older who were randomized to cranberry capsules versus placebo capsules for reduction or prevention of bacteriuria plus pyuria.

Protocol-relatedness of the SAE was defined as a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in research.

Generalized linear models with Poisson distributions using natural logarithms for time at risk offsets were used to generate rates and 95% confidence intervals for events per 100 person-years of follow-up adjusted for overdispersion.

Data regarding the expected frequency of SAE are relevant to Principal Investigators when planning personnel time and effort required for adverse event surveillance, particularly in trials of older adults who have variable predisposition to adverse events. In this secondary analysis of two low-risk intervention trials in older adults, there were no unanticipated hospitalizations and deaths irrespective of protocol-relatedness. As expected, hospitalizations and deaths in the nursing home trial were frequent, but none of these SAE were protocol-related. Collectively, these data may inform personnel allocation for SAE surveillance.</p><p id="p0060">Recent data highlight the cost and time-intensive nature of systemic reporting of all adverse events and SAE [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the CRANNY trial, approximately 70% of two research nurses' time was devoted to overall adverse event surveillance, and on average 15&#x0202f;h per week per nurse was spent on assessing and recording SAE. Performing chart review, retrieving hospitalization records, and adjudicating records accounted for 15&#x0202f;h per week spent assessing SAE in CRANNY. This degree of personnel investment may be disproportionately high in studies with more limited resources and impede the conduct of intervention trials in older adults with multiple comorbidities. Based on our data, we propose that future studies consider quantifying the degree of personnel investment required according to observed versus expected SAE occurrence.</p><p id="p0065">Our findings correspond with prior clinical trials of nursing home residents and older community dwellers. Prior exercise program and physical rehabilitation studies in nursing home residents have shown no adverse events [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Adverse events were also rare among nursing home residents participating in clinical trials of vitamin D, melatonin, and donepezil [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. Collectively, these data may guide budget development for monitoring adverse events in clinical trials of older adults.</p><p id="p0070">Notably, all 116 SAE in CRANNY were reported to the NIA within 48&#x0202f;h of Principal Investigator notification. This finding is important because recent reports suggest SAE are frequently underreported or unreported in publications [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In one study of 300 clinical trials posted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0010">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, many SAE were omitted from publication [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>].

First, only one site from LIFE was examined. These results may not be representative of the broader LIFE study [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, these findings would not impact our conclusions and parallel literature highlighting variability in adverse event reporting and the need for standardization [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Second, CRANNY included exclusively women nursing home residents. It is unclear whether SAE incidence would be similar in men. Third, SAE criteria were more inclusive for LIFE versus CRANNY, and we did not account for lifestyle intervention intensity. Nevertheless, there were no unanticipated deaths and inpatient hospitalizations from LIFE, and thus our conclusions remain unchanged.</p><p id="p0080">In summary, in two intervention trials of older adults, there were no unanticipated hospitalizations and deaths, and all deaths were unrelated to the study protocol.
