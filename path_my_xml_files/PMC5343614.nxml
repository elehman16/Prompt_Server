This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid, resorcinol and phytic acid solution in chemical peeling of melasma in comparison to 50% glycolic acid.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This clinical trial was performed, on 42 female patients with bilateral melasma. Severity of melasma was assessed by melasma area and severity index (MASI). Combination of (20% azelaic acid + 10% resorcinol + 6% phytic acid) was used as a new peeling agent on the right side of the face and 50% glycolic acid on the left side every 2 weeks for 6 times. Follow-up was carried out for 3 months after the last session. Any decrease in MASI score and unwanted complications following peeling were evaluated and compared during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Patients showed marked improvement as calculated with MASI score before and after treatment in both sides of the face. The efficacy of combination formula (azelaic acid, resorcinol and phytic acid) was similar to glycolic acid, but with fewer complications. There was no statistically difference in improvement between two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

It is reported that using high concentrations and a larger number of glycolic acid peels have shown a positive effect on melasma. Furthermore, azelaic acid has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antikeratinizing effects, which make it useful in a variety of dermatologic conditions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Triple-combination agent is formulated as follows: 20% azelaic acid[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] +10% resorcinol[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] +6% phytic acid[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in hydroalcoholic base. The purpose of the current prospective study was to determine if the triple-combination agent, compared with glycolic acid peel, produced significant improvement of melasma in women with facial melasma with skin type III and IV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted between January, 2012 and October, 2012, on 42 female patients with melasma at department of dermatology in Isfahan University of medical sciences. Female patients between 18 and 65 years old with skin type IV or less with bilateral facial melasma were eligible if they had epidermal or mixed melasma based on wood's light examination at the time of recruitment were resistant or intolerant to topical therapy and hypersensitivity to hydroquinone products. Exclusion criteria, included: Skin type more than IV, pregnancy, use of 4% hydroquinone formulation within 3 months of entry; history of chemical peels, microdermabrasion or facial laser treatment within 9 months of entry, history of drug hypersensitivity, active orolabial herpes infection, history of hypertrophic scar or keloid, uncooperative patients for follow-up and sun protection after peeling and in cases, which erythema is persistent until the next session. This study was investigated and approved in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (number: 390540) and written informed consent after the participating patients were explained about and informed of the purposes of the study, was obtained from them all. A detailed history was taken from each patient at the onset of the study. A careful wood's light examination of melasma was performed including the following: Site, distribution, homogeneity and the color of the patches. Clinical assessment of melasma severity was graded with the melasma area and severity index (MASI) score.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In this scoring system, the face is divided into four areas: Forehead, right malar, left malar and chin that correspond respectively to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total face area. The melasma in each of these areas was graded on three parameters [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Graded of melasma in each of face areas</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-9-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Then, the MASI score calculated on each side of the face at baseline and before each session by the equation:</p><p>MASI score on right side of the face:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-9-g002.jpg"/></p><p>MASI score on the left side of the face:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-9-g003.jpg"/></p><p>Where D is darkness, H is homogeneity, A is area, F is forehead, MR is right malar, ML is left malar and c is chin. The values 0.3, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.1 stand for respective percentage of total facial area. Maximum MASI score for total face is 48 and on each side of the face is 24.</p><p>Photographic assessment color photograph for each patient were performed at a baseline and before each session and at the end of treatment. All photographs were taken using a canon-digital camera, 8 megapixels. All patients were photographed in the same place with fixed illumination and distance. Peels were performed using the previously mentioned protocol.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The patients cleaned their face before treatment and then the face was defatted with aceton solution. A small fan chilled the treated area. Nearly, 50% glycolic acid solution was applied on the left side of the face for all patients. Using the standard cotton-tipped applicators, the 50% glycolic acid was spread over the melasma area on the left side of the face. The forehead area was treated first, following by the malar area and finally the chin area. an erythematous response or burning sensation by the patient were the end point. If neither of them occurred, 50% glycolic acid was left for 5 min, after that it was washed with tap water.</p><p>Combination formula (20% azelaic acid + 10% resorcinol + 6% phytic acid) solution was applied on the right side of the face for all patients, with the same manner. Again an erythematous response or burn sensation by patient were end points, if not present, it left for longer than previous agent. All treatment regimens manufactured and prepared in Isfahan University, Faculty of Pharmacy. A moisturizing sunblock was applied (sensitive skin sunblock SPF 30). Patients who complained from discomfort or redness and exfoliation of the face were given 1% hydrocortisone skin cream to be applied twice daily.</p><p>Patients were seen regularly every 2 weeks to assess the response to treatment, to record the side effect and to calculate MASI score for each patient.</p><p>All patients were evaluated for the frequency of complications and type of complication (erythema, dyspigmentation, burning, atrophy and scar) on each side of the face before beginning the peeling.</p><p>All analyses were performed by SPSS version-20 and data are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD and number (percent) as appropriate. Repeated measurement of analysis of variance test was used to compare the mean of MASI score during 10 weeks treatment between two groups. On the other way, MASI score in each week and change in MASI score at each time point compared with baseline between two sides of the face were assessed using paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Furthermore, Chi-square test was used for comparison of the frequency of complications between groups. The level of significance is considered to be less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Four patients of 46 reviewed patients were not eligible and did not enter to the study.

Finally, 41 patients completed the study and analyzed either; most patients had noted a relationship with sun exposure. The mean age studied patients was 35.21 &#x000b1; 9.16 years old and 78% of them were married.

At week-2 MASI score in (20% azelaic acid + 10% resorcinol + 6% phytic acid) group was decrease more than glycolic acid groups, but in weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10, MASI score in glycolic acid group was decrease more than (20% azelaic acid + 10% resorcinol + 6% phytic acid) group.
