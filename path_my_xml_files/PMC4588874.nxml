The 30-min controlled use session comprised an intensive use of the e-cigarettes with a total of 50 puffs taken every 30&#x000a0;s for comparison to a single conventional cigarette having a typical machine-measured nicotine yield (~0.8&#x000a0;mg). <italic>Ad lib</italic> product use conditions provided insight into more naturalistic product use behaviors and their accompanying smoking urge reductions.

E-cigarette and cigarette nicotine plasma levels were comparable for up to one hour of use. After both sessions (90&#x000a0;min), nicotine exposure was the highest for the cigarette, with all e-cigarettes showing 23&#x000a0;% to 53&#x000a0;% lower plasma concentrations. During controlled use, peak reduction in smoking urge for e-cigs occurred later than for the cigarette. After completion of both sessions, significant smoking urge reduction persisted for most of the tested e-cigarettes, albeit at levels lower than that provided by the tobacco cigarette. Nicotine content, vehicle differences, and the presence of menthol did not significantly affect smoking urge reduction by the e-cigarettes. No subjects were discontinued due to AEs.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are rapidly becoming a popular alternative to cigarette smoking worldwide and are garnering significant attention as potentially reduced-exposure replacements for conventional cigarettes (cigarettes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. E-cigarettes consist of a battery, heating component, and a cartridge containing tobacco-derived nicotine in a solution composed of glycerin and/or propylene glycol (PG), and flavorings. Upon activation, the heating element heats the solution to generate an aerosol that is inhaled by the consumer in a manner that mimics smoking.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies with early-generation e-cigarettes found that they delivered markedly lower levels of plasma nicotine than conventional cigarettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recent studies have reported that experienced subjects using later-generation e-cigarettes containing 9 to 24&#x000a0;mg/mL of nicotine attain significant increases in plasma nicotine concentrations over baseline values that can be similar to those obtained from conventional cigarette smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These results suggest that an acclimation to the product may be necessary for na&#x000ef;ve smokers to become familiar with the characteristics of the specific e-cigarettes in order to effectively use them in a subjectively enjoyable manner. Moreover, these studies also demonstrated a reduction in smoking urge or abstinence symptoms following e-cigarette use, even for products that deliver less nicotine than conventional tobacco cigarettes. This is quite consistent with a perspective that the substantial sensory and behavioral aspects of cigarette smoking that are mimicked by e-cigarettes may provide meaningful relief of the cigarette cravings commonly reported by abstinent smokers.</p><p>Surveys and clinical studies evaluating the impacts, tolerability and adverse events (AEs) associated with e-cigarette use suggest that they are generally well-tolerated following short-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Commonly reported AEs include symptoms such as mouth and throat irritation, light-headedness, dizziness and dry cough.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to examine the nicotine blood plasma levels and smoking urge impacts of various formulations of one brand of e-cigarette with that of a tobacco cigarette. The tested products contained different flavorings, aerosol forming excipients (i.e., propylene glycol, glycerin) and nicotine levels. The secondary objectives were to assess the tolerability and any adverse events associated with the study products following short-term use under intensive controlled use conditions, as well as under more natural <italic>ad-lib</italic> use conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study protocol and the informed consent forms were approved by Chesapeake IRB, Columbia, MD. A total of 107 potential subjects were recruited from the Lincoln, NE area using standard advertising methods (i.e., print and radio advertisements) and from a database of subjects who had previously participated a clinical research study or who had expressed interest in participating in a study. All potential subjects were provided details regarding the study and written informed consent was obtained prior to completion of any study procedures. Sixty-one subjects were excluded for not meeting the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, while five subjects declined to participate prior to enrollment and three subjects were excluded because the study had reached the recruitment target of 38 eligible subjects. The 38 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria participated in a 7-day at-home lead-in period during which they used and became familiar with two of e-cigarette study products (non-menthol and menthol, 2.4&#x000a0;% nicotine with glycerin). All subjects who participated in the at-home lead-in period were allowed to check in at the start of clinical conduct. Two subjects chose not to participate further after the lead-in period and one subject failed further screening requirements at check-in. A final study population of 24 subjects were enrolled into the study and randomized into one of six product usage sequences with four subjects per sequence. One subject withdrew consent after completion of the first product use on Day 1 of the trial due to a personal reason (family emergency). All subjects participating in the study from the time of the lead-in period were paid for their participation.</p><p>The main criteria for inclusion were as follows: healthy adult male and female smokers, 21 to 65&#x000a0;years of age, inclusive; smoker for at least 12&#x000a0;months and currently smoked an average of 10 or more manufactured cigarettes per day (no restriction on brand-style); positive urine cotinine at screening (&#x02265;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;ng/mL); and exhaled carbon monoxide CO&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;ppm at screening. Exclusion criteria included: history or presence of clinically significant mental or physical health conditions; females who were pregnant or breastfeeding; high blood pressure; body mass index&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; acute illnesses (e.g., upper respiratory infection, viral infection) requiring treatment within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to check-in; use of prescription smoking cessation treatments, anti-diabetic or insulin drugs or medications known to interact with cytochrome P450 2A6; positive urine screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse; and self-reported puffers (i.e., smokers who draw smoke from the cigarette into the mouth and throat but do not inhale). Subjects who had used any tobacco- or nicotine-containing products other than manufactured cigarettes or e-cigarettes within 28&#x000a0;days of in-clinic product use were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Products tested</title><p>A rechargeable version of an e-cigarette that is currently sold in retail outlets throughout the United States was used in this study. The rechargeable e-cigarette consists of a battery segment and a cartomizer segment comprising the heating unit and a liquid reservoir which can be separated from the battery for recharging or replacement when the e-liquid is depleted. The battery operates at a voltage of 3.7 volts (nominal) and the resistance of the heating element is approximately 3 ohms. The maximum operating temperature is dependent on both the state of reservoir fluid fill and on the manner of use and was not recorded in this study.</p><p>Two commercial e-cigarette products that contained 16&#x000a0;mg/mL (1.6&#x000a0;%) USP grade nicotine were used in this study. As well, three non-commercial products that contained 24&#x000a0;mg/mL (2.4&#x000a0;%) USP grade nicotine were used in this study to evaluate various product characteristics considered important to further product development. In addition to nicotine, the e-cigarettes used in this study contained USP grade glycerin and/or propylene glycol (as described below), distilled water (&#x0003c;20&#x000a0;%), citric acid (&#x0003c;1.0&#x000a0;%) and natural or artificial flavors (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;%).

The subjects checked into the clinic on Day &#x02212;2 and abstained from using of nicotine-containing products until product use on Day 1. Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 were designated product use days while Days &#x02212;1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were designated wash-out days.

In order to allow study participants to become familiar with the e-cigarette devices, subjects were instructed on the appropriate use of the products and were required to demonstrate the appropriate use to clinic staff.

There were no serious adverse events reported and no subjects were discontinued due to AEs. Mild product-use-emergent AEs were reported by 18 of 38 subjects provided a study product (including the lead-in period). The number of subjects reporting AEs was similar among products, ranging from 3 to 10 subjects each, with slightly fewer subjects experiencing AEs following use of the menthol-flavored product. The most frequent AE was cough, reported 20 times by 11 subjects (more commonly with use of an e-cigarette product than the tobacco cigarette), followed by throat irritation (8 reports by 5 subjects) and headache (6 reports by 5 subjects), and dizziness (5 reports by 4 subjects). All AEs resolved without sequelae.</p><p>The observed acute effects of the study products on blood pressure, heart rate and CO levels were previously reported by the authors under a separate publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] where it was noted that heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly elevated after the use of the tobacco cigarette, but the elevation was less after use of most of the e-cigarettes. Furthermore, it was also observed that the use of the e-cigarettes produced no increase the exhaled CO levels, whereas the cigarette significantly increased the exhaled CO more than eight (8) times above the baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The key objectives of this study were to examine the nicotine blood plasma levels and smoking urge impacts of various formulations of one brand of e-cigarette for comparison to a conventional tobacco cigarette, and to assess the tolerability and adverse events associated with the study products following short-term use under intensive and naturalistic use conditions. The study design and results are not intended to support the potential for e-cigarettes as harm-reduction products.</p><p>While not all puffing parameters can be controlled across all subjects, a product use that includes the same number of puffs, puff duration, and puff interval as utilized in this study allows for standardization of nicotine intake to the extent possible in order to accurately characterize uptake and reduction in smoking urge. The small difference in pre-to-post use weight differences across the e-cigarette products supports this. When compared to a tobacco cigarette, the nicotine PK following a controlled, 50-puff use of the e-cigarettes was characterized by slower absorption than from a single tobacco cigarette, but comparable maximal and overall nicotine exposures for all but the 1.6&#x000a0;% nicotine product with glycerin. Analysis of the mean maximum plasma concentrations attained during the controlled use period showed that the non-menthol e-cigarettes containing 2.4&#x000a0;% nicotine exceeded that of the tobacco cigarette (15.8&#x000a0;ng/mL at approximately 5&#x000a0;min) with approximately 25&#x000a0;min of use (17.8 to 18.1&#x000a0;ng/mL). This observation is most likely attributable to the rather intensive e-cigarette puffing regimen (one puff every 30&#x000a0;s) imposed during the controlled use interval when compared to the single tobacco cigarette regimen (average 10.5 puffs total). However, it also suggests that under an intensive puffing scenario, e-cigarettes are capable of delivering similar amounts of nicotine as a tobacco cigarette.</p><p>The continuous rise in nicotine concentrations achieved with use of the e-cigarettes during the controlled use period appeared to be matched by a consistent decrease in smoking urge, though at the end of the 30-min controlled use period the urge reduction was comparable across those products. Smoking a single cigarette during the controlled use period produced a predictable nicotine concentration-time curve, with a rapid peak nicotine concentration followed by a gradual elimination. The rise and fall of nicotine concentration was matched by the smoking urge response, with a rapid decrease in urge followed by a gradual return toward baseline. While the time to maximum urge reductions was significantly shorter for the tobacco cigarette during the controlled use period compared to each of the e-cigarettes, there were no significant differences in the maximal or overall urge reduction achieved between the two types of products.</p><p><italic>Ad lib</italic> use of the study products can provide insight into use patterns and nicotine concentrations that will allow consumers to satisfy their smoking urge and provide an overall satisfying product use experience. As should be expected, individual use of the products as measured by puff counts varied widely and followed the amount of nicotine solution that was consumed during use as measured by pre-to-post use product weight difference. Use of the e-cigarettes during the <italic>ad lib</italic> use period resulted in a relatively small increase in nicotine concentration during the first 45&#x000a0;min, followed by a plateau during the last 15&#x000a0;min. In contrast, use of the cigarette during the <italic>ad lib</italic> use period resulted in a continuous increase in nicotine concentration and continued reduction in smoking urge through the final time point.</p><p>Following <italic>ad lib</italic> use of all products for 60&#x000a0;min, the tobacco cigarette yielded a significantly higher nicotine concentration (C<sub>90</sub>) compared to each of the e-cigarettes. The higher nicotine concentration coincided with a greater reduction in smoking urge at the end of the <italic>ad lib</italic> use period (E<sub>90</sub>) for the tobacco cigarette compared to all e-cigarettes, and significantly greater than all except the 2.4&#x000a0;% nicotine product containing glycerin and PG. However, there was no overall impact on urge as assessed by AUEC<sub>30&#x02013;90</sub>. This was likely due to the relatively short duration of the <italic>ad lib</italic> use. Indeed, as the smoking urge response appeared to have reached a plateau with the e-cigarettes and continued to increase with the cigarette following 60&#x000a0;min of <italic>ad lib</italic> use, a longer evaluation period may have resulted in a difference in the AUEC parameter as well.</p><p>Among the e-cigarettes, use of the e-cigarettes containing 1.6&#x000a0;% nicotine resulted in lower nicotine exposure compared to the e-cigarettes containing 2.4&#x000a0;% nicotine. However, this did not translate into significant differences in the smoking urge response. Further, while the suppression of urge to smoke appeared comparable between the 1.6&#x000a0;% and the 2.4&#x000a0;% test formulations in the present study, evaluation of the mean puff counts and the amount of solution consumed did not suggest that the subjects compensated by puffing on the lower-nicotine products consciously or subconsciously more so than the higher-nicotine products to achieve a similar level of satisfaction. In addition, higher nicotine content, the presence of PG in the vehicle, and the absence of menthol in the e-cigarettes were found to increase plasma nicotine levels during both controlled and <italic>ad lib</italic> use. Such factors, however, did not appear to significantly affect smoking urge. However, consistent with prior research documenting the prominent role of conditioned behavior and nicotine addiction, in addition to the concentration of nicotine, the respiratory tract sensory cues and manipulation of smoking materials that are associated with smoking, and mimicked by e-cigarettes, may have had a role in relieving smoking urges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, the present findings further suggest that some of the substantial sensory and behavioral aspects of smoking that are mirrored by e-cigarettes, may be essential elements in the reduction of craving or abstinence symptoms. To the extent that e-cigarettes may provide some measure of reduction in smoking urges, they may serve as cigarette substitutes for smokers who would otherwise seek to smoke a conventional tobacco cigarette.</p><p>Despite the aggressive puff regime employed in the controlled use period, there were no SAEs in this study and no subjects were discontinued due to AEs. The incidence of AEs was similar among products, with slightly fewer subjects experiencing AEs following use of the menthol-flavored product. The most frequently reported minor AEs were cough, followed by throat irritation, headache, and dizziness. These findings are consistent with other research studies of longer duration that have reported that use of e-cigarettes by adult smokers is well-tolerated as compared to tobacco cigarette use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>This study was not without limitations. It was performed at a single site with a small number of subjects, which might lead to the conclusion that the data is not generalizable to a broader population. However, many initial PK evaluations of tobacco and pharmaceutical products are performed using a similar approach. Further, the comparison to the e-cigarettes was made based on a single product use and a short-term <italic>ad lib</italic> product use to a single brand of tobacco cigarette. Indeed, the trend we noted at the end of the <italic>ad lib</italic> use period did show that nicotine concentrations appeared to be continuing to rise and smoking urge appeared to be continuing to decrease. Hence, a longer term comparison in future studies would be beneficial. Finally, while the product use data did not provide a clear indication that subjects compensated by using the products with less nicotine more intensively, use of topography measurements providing insight into puff volume and inhalation rate coupled with product evaluation questionnaires in future studies might lend additional information regarding product use behaviors leading to PK and smoking urge responses.</p><p>Overall, the findings of this study indicate that nicotine uptake from short-term use of e-cigarettes containing 1.6&#x000a0;% and 2.4&#x000a0;% nicotine are significant, but lower than those of tobacco cigarettes, yet the reduction in urge-to-smoke or craving symptoms are broadly comparable. Moreover, it was also found that the short-term use of e-cigarettes by adult smokers is well-tolerated as compared to tobacco cigarette use.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>ad lib</italic></term><def><p><italic>Ad lib</italic>itum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under the concentration-time curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUEC</term><def><p>Area under the effect curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CO</term><def><p>Carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRO</term><def><p>Contract Research Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>e-Cigarettes</term><def><p>Electronic cigarettes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FTCD</term><def><p>Fagerstr&#x000f6;m test for cigarette dependence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Kg</term><def><p>Kilogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC-MS/MS</term><def><p>Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mg</term><def><p>Milligram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mm</term><def><p>Millimeter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mL</term><def><p>Milliliter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ng</term><def><p>Nanogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>Pharmacodynamics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PK</term><def><p>Pharmacokinetic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PG</term><def><p>Propylene glycol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ppm</term><def><p>Parts per million</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USP</term><def><p>United States Pharmacopeia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>CDD is a full-time employee of ITG Brands, LLC, an affiliate of the study sponsor: Fontem U.S. Inc.
