Given its prevalence, the onus was on us, the treating urologists, to provide these patients with optimal treatment. However, even today, a century since the first reported case [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there are various versions in its definition, classification and treatment. Most worrying on the part of the patient is the absence of a standard, effective treatment without significant adverse effects. A range of treatment modalities has been described, varying from psychotherapy and oral medication to local applications, yet the so-called &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; treatment remains elusive.</p><p>Though dapoxetine 30 mg is being widely used as the treatment of premature ejaculation, there are patients who fail to comply with the treatment due to its adverse effects or inefficacy. We decided to evaluate the efficacy of &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; silodosin 4 mg in patients who were dissatisfied with dapoxetine, as there are recent reports suggesting the efficacy of silodosin in the treatment of premature ejaculation [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>Patients who self-reported premature ejaculation and expressed dissatisfaction with &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; treatment with dapoxetine 30 mg were included in the study. Those satisfied with &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; dapoxetine 30 mg were excluded. The study participants were asked to record the reason for their dissatisfaction with the treatment before their inclusion in the study. The study period was between 1 June 2014 and 31 October 2015. Approval for the proposed study was granted by the institutional ethical committee. Before inclusion in the study, written informed consent was obtained from each patient and his partner.</p><sec id="S20003"><title>Sample size calculation, randomization and statistical analysis</title><p>According to available literature, the prevalence of premature ejaculation in males is reported as 30% [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In order to ensure the power of the study in excess of 80%, at a significance level of 95%, we calculated the minimum sample size for each (the two) group(s). This sample size calculation was performed using the formula [N = 2 &#x000d7;{z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b1;</sub> + z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b2;</sub>/d&#x02212; &#x003b4;<sub>0</sub>}<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; p (1&#x02212;p)]. Here N corresponds to the number of subjects in each group, p corresponds to prevalence of premature ejaculation, Z<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> corresponds to the standard normal deviate for a one-sided test, d corresponds to expected difference and &#x003b4;<sub>0</sub> corresponds to the clinically accepted margin of error, which is taken as 0.05. Using computer-generated simple random numbers between one and 64, the total sample was divided into two groups, Group A and Group B respectively. Patients in Group A received silodosin 4 mg three hours prior to the proposed intercourse. Patients in Group B received a placebo three hours prior to proposed intercourse. During the study, only the patients were blinded (not the investigator). Intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), premature ejaculation profile (PEP) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the clinical global impression of change for premature ejaculation (CGIC) [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] were recorded in patients, prior to the initiation of the treatment and the very next day of the treatment with drug. Similarly, the premature ejaculation profile (PEP) was recorded in partners as well, as the format allows separate recording of responses from the partners. Any adverse effects reported by the patients were also recorded. Data analysis was done by applying Student&#x02019;s t-test, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) trial version 17. The level of significance was assessed at a p value less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0004"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the study period, we had a total of 143 patients subjected to treatment with &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; dapoxetine 30 mg for self-reported premature ejaculation. Of this, 64 patients had expressed their unhappiness with the treatment. Of these 64 patients, 24 reported no improvement of premature ejaculation with dapoxetine treatment, whereas the remaining 40 reported their dissatisfaction due to adverse events, mainly dizziness.

Though there are many treatments prescribed for premature ejaculation, none, thus far, has been able to provide most satisfactory treatment to the patient. At present, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), specifically dapoxetine, forms the mainstay of pharmacotherapy due to the delay it causes in ejaculation by inhibition of the ejaculatory reflex through inhibitory descending pathways from higher centres [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. But these are associated with significant adverse effects, including psychiatric and neurologic complications along with unwanted sexual side effects [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These effects are less prominent when &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; treatment is given; however, adverse effects such as dizziness, loss of libido and nausea still appear even on &#x02018;on demand&#x02019; treatment with dapoxetine, making it less than optimal drug for the patient [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We have had many such patients who desired pharmacotherapy with a drug other than dapoxetine, which prompted our search for a better, more tolerable drug.</p><p>Alpha blockers have long been established in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms. However, their use is associated with patient-reported sexual side effects, mainly retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation. The basis of these effects was reported to be their action on seminal vesicles, which have abundant alpha 1a adrenergic receptors [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Silodosin is a highly selective antagonist for this receptor and has been proved effective in the treatment of premature ejaculation at a dosage of 8 mg by Masciovecchio S et al. [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hence, we decided to study its effectiveness in those patients dissatisfied with dapoxetine treatment. The dose had to be halved in view of the high incidence of anejaculation at a dose of 8 mg, as reported by Masciovecchio S et al. [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sato Y et al. [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported reduced incidence of anejaculation at a 4 mg dose.</p><p>We found significant improvement in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), which is in line with the reports of Masciovecchio S et al. [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Sato Y et al. [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Both the patients and their partners reported better satisfaction with intercourse following silodosin treatment as compared to placebo. Control over ejaculation was also reported to be good in the silodosin group, with very little ejaculation-related distress. In our study, only four patients reported uncomfortably-delayed ejaculation, and reported minimally-worse to worse on the CGIC scale, following treatment with silodosin. Though other studies have reported an incidence of anejaculation in about 20&#x02013;25% of patients, none of our patients reported anejaculation [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Though Sato Y et al. have reported some discomfort while achieving orgasm in more than 80% of studied patients, none of our patients reported any discomfort during orgasm [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A separate study is required to evaluate the efficacy of a lower dose of silodosin in those patients who reported uncomfortably-delayed ejaculation.</p><p>The safety of alpha blockers in humans has been well-established for more than three decades by their use in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, using their major adverse event to our advantage was a novel idea floated by Masciovecchio S et al. and Sato Y et al. [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As there is a significant subset of patients who are dissatisfied with present standard pharmacotherapy with dapoxetine, mainly due to its adverse effects, the search continues for a safer and better alternative. We are the first to try silodosin in this group of patients, who have either failed therapy with dapoxetine or were unhappy due to its adverse effects.</p><p>Though premature ejaculation remains the most common sexual dysfunction in males, the number of patients seeking help from their treating physician for this complaint are considerably lower [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar was the case in our study, wherein the sample size became quite small as we had picked only that subset of patients self-reporting premature ejaculation who were dissatisfied with dapoxetine treatment. We acknowledge that this reduces the statistical power of the study for generalization of its findings. However, the use of silodosin as second-line treatment for premature ejaculation is a novel idea and our study supports such an approach. A larger, multicentre study, in this regard, is likely to provide stronger evidence in this aspect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0006"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Silodosin, a drug that has already been proved safe for human use by its safety profile in the treatment of LUTS, is a safe and better-tolerated alternative to dapoxetine in the management of premature ejaculation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Masciovecchio</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Saldutto</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Rosso</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The daily therapy with silodosin can have a role in the treatment of &#x02018;life long&#x02019; premature ejaculation</article-title><source>J Androl Sci.</source><year>2011</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>48</fpage><lpage>51</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Serefoglu</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Saitz</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>Trost</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hellstrom</surname><given-names>WJG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Premature ejaculation: do we have effective therapy?</article-title><source>Transl Androl Urol.</source><year>2013</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>45</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26816723</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanda</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Silodosin and its potential for treating premature ejaculation: A preliminary report</article-title><source>Int J Urol.</source><year>2012</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>268</fpage><lpage>272</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22188258</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akin</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Gulmez</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ates</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bozkurt</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nuhoglu</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of alpha blockers in the treatment of premature ejaculation: A pilot clinical trial</article-title><source>Iran Red Crescent Med.
