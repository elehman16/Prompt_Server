In each group, there were 15 pieces of bent wires and 15 straight ones. Prior to measurements of the wires, as individual experimental groups (group 1, 2, and 3), the wires were exposed to artificial saliva for 4&#x000a0;weeks at pH 5.6, 6.6, and 7.6, respectively. A control group of wires (group 4) remained in air for the same period of time before sent for measurements. Surface roughness (Ra-value) was measured by a profilometer. Young&#x02019;s modulus and maximum force were determined by a four-point flexural test apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the surface morphology of straight wire. Differences between groups were examined using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean surface roughness values, flexural Young&#x02019;s moduli, and maximum force values of bent wires are significantly different from those of the straight wires, which was the main effect of wire bending, ignoring the influence of pH. A significant effect was found between Ra-values regarding the main effect of pH, ignoring the influence of shape. There was a significant interaction effect of bending and pH on flexural Young&#x02019;s moduli of stainless steel archwires, while pH did not show much impact on the maximum force values of those stainless steel wires. Bigger surface irregularities were seen on SEM images of straight wires immersed in artificial saliva at pH 5.6 compared to artificial saliva at other pH values. Surface depth (Rz) was more sensitive than Ra in revealing surface roughness, both measured from 3D reconstructed SEM images. Ra showed a comparable result of surface roughness to Ra-value measured by the profilometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bending has a significant influence on surface roughness and mechanical properties of rectangular SS archwires. pH plays a synergistic effect on the change of mechanical properties of stainless steel (SS) wires along with wire bending.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stainless steel archwire</kwd><kwd>Surface roughness</kwd><kwd>Young&#x02019;s modulus</kwd><kwd>Maximum force</kwd><kwd>Salivary pH</kwd><kwd>Corrosion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Stainless steel (SS) has been introduced around 1930 as an alloy for the fabrication of orthodontic archwires and is still a broadly used appliance in orthodontic practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Stainless steel is a convenient material to act as a spring because it is, among other materials, a ductile material and it is able to maintain its shape after bending. This behaviour of a SS alloy can be explained by consideration of its mechanical properties. Examination of mechanical properties is the key to understand the clinical application of a material since mechanical properties determine the behaviour of the wire in generating forces and thus influence tooth movement.</p><p>An important parameter is the flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It represents the flexibility of an archwire and can be calculated as the slope of a force-deflection curve. Researchers have been reporting a flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus of ~120&#x02013;217&#x000a0;GPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] for as-received stainless steel archwires. Another important parameter is the maximum force. This is defined as the maximum amount of force the wire can withstand before it starts to fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Typical force-deflection curves of an elastic material. The flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus and maximum force value are indicated as <italic>brown circles</italic>. The flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus is calculated as the slope of the linear portion of the curve by taking into account the dimensions of the wire. The maximum force is the maximum amount of force a material can withstand before it starts to fail. Curve <italic>a</italic> represents a stiffer material than curve <italic>b</italic>
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40510_2015_109_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Mechanical properties of stainless steel orthodontic archwires can be influenced by a variety of causes, for example, corrosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Electrolytic corrosion of orthodontic appliances in the mouth regularly occurs due to the wet oral environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pH value of saliva in the oral environment has a significant effect on the corrosion rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The resting pH of human saliva ranges from 5.6 to 7.6, which can be caused by dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and internal stimuli like vomitingor by diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Corrosive damage to archwires can result in deterioration of its mechanical properties. Limited studies have been performed to investigate the influence of corrosion on mechanical properties of stainless steel archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The corrosion phenomenon may not only influence the mechanical properties of the orthodontic archwires but also affect surface properties, such as the surface roughness and surface texture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A variety of experiments have measured the surface roughness of as-received stainless steel archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], resulting in a description of the surface of SS archwires as smooth, compared to titanium archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Regarding corrosion resistance, literature describes that SS archwires corroded more than titanium archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Surface roughness and texture increase with the increase of incubation time in acid solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the decrease of pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Surface texture can be observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images of as-received SS archwires showed an inhomogeneous surface with different surface irregularities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], scratches, and pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. SEM images of in vitro corroded SS archwires show pitting corrosion, localized corrosion, and scratches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An increase in variety, type, and number of surface irregularities were observed due to wear and friction of archwires from in vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The corrosion phenomenon influences the mechanical properties and surface properties of stainless steel orthodontic archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such degradation processes can have serious clinical implications resulting in weakening the efficacy of the force delivering system. It also increases the potential for failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous experimental set-ups had been performed to investigate the influence of corrosion on the mechanical properties and surface properties of SS archwires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, those studies investigated straight archwire pieces only. In orthodontic clinic, archwire bending is an integral part of orthodontic treatment. Straight archwires are hardly used in a patient&#x02019;s mouth. Bending causes stress in the material, which alters the wire properties and its behaviour upon challenges, e.g., corrosion.</p><p>So, the aim of this study was to investigate the corrosive behaviour of bent SS archwires in a more clinically relevant manner comparing the bent with the as-received straight wires in a clinically relevant pH solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Wire preparation</title><p>Rectangular stainless steel orthodontic archwires, 0.43&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.64&#x000a0;mm (3M Unitek, USA), were cut into pieces with a distal-end cutter (Hu-Friedy, USA) for further sample preparation. A curved shape was bent following the Ovoid Arch Form OrthoForm&#x02122; III (3M Unitek, USA) with an Adams Plier (678-320-U5 Hu-Friedy, USA). The length of the pieces was measured with an electronic digital calliper to &#x000b1;0.1&#x000a0;mm accuracy. The total sample size of 120 pieces, 60 pieces per wire shape type, was determined by a multiple comparisons Power Analysis (Tukey-Kramer) test. These archwires were randomly divided into four groups, three experimental groups and one control group. Each group contained 30 pieces of wires, including 15 bent wires and 15 straight wires (24&#x000a0;mm). Additionally, one short straight wire (10&#x000a0;mm) was included for each group to study surface characteristics under a scanning electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Immersing experiment</title><p>A total of 1&#x000a0;L of artificial saliva was prepared (0.400&#x000a0;g/L NaCl, 0.400&#x000a0;g/L KCl, 0.795&#x000a0;g/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.010&#x000a0;g/L Na<sub>2</sub>S9H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.000&#x000a0;g/L CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, 0.789&#x000a0;g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and divided into three portions equally, which were calibrated to pH 5.6, 6.6, and 7.6, respectively.

The software of profilometer was set at a Gauss roughness filter type with a cut-off length of 0.25&#x000a0;mm and an assessment length of 0.75&#x000a0;mm.

Straight archwires are hardly used in a patient&#x02019;s mouth, and wire bending is an integral part of the orthodontic treatment. Even though the preformed SS archwires are popularly used nowadays, the chairside wire bending is inevitable due to the variations in the malocclusions of individual patient. In this research it is determined that bent SS wires have a highly significantly rougher surface than straight SS wires, ignoring pH. These divergences in surface roughness between bent and straight wires could be caused by the use of pliers when bending the wires, which could easily cause damages to the protective oxide layer.</p><p>In this research, Ra-values revealed that bent wires immersed in pH 5.6 and 7.6 solutions have a significantly rougher surface than bent wires at baseline. The increase of surface roughness by decreasing the pH is in agreement with results of other study. However, the surface of SS wires has also been roughened by artificial saliva at pH 7.6 according to our experiment. So far, no researchers had investigated the influence of basic saliva on SS archwires. This phenomenon of basic solution corroding SS wire was minute on straight wires and was amplified on bent wires, which has been echoed by images and measurements of SEM. Hence, it is recommendable that more research should be done regarding immersion in artificial saliva at basic pH because of its clinical relevance that the pH of resting saliva ranges from pH 5.6 to 7.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, pH 6.6 seemed to be an optimal pH for SS archwire to perform and thus this might be our goal to balance oral pH especially during orthodontic treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Mechanical properties</title><p>Mechanical properties of SS wires are key to understand the wire application clinically since it determines the force generated for tooth movement. It has been reported that a flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus of ~133&#x02013;184&#x000a0;GPa for as-received SS archwires was measured by a three-point flexural test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while 468&#x02013;526&#x000a0;GPa of Young&#x02019;s modulus on SS wires was measured in this study by a four-point bending test, which was about threefold of the former. The explanation for the differences could be the support span. A support span of 20&#x000a0;mm was used in this research (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), while other researchers used a lower support span of 14 and 9&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Alteration of the support span alters the load-deflection rate, even as alteration of the wire diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another explanation might be that smaller cross section increases the wire stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In other research, the wires were tested on their 0.64-mm side, whereas they were tested on their 0.43-mm side in this research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found that wire bending played an essential role on the mechanical properties of SS wires. It lowered Young&#x02019;s modulus, and this influence was enhanced by the increase of pH. A higher flexural Young&#x02019;s modulus indicates a stiffer wire with a greater resistance to deformation. Wire bending was originally introduced to elongate the length of a wire and thus to increase the flexibility and to lower Young&#x02019;s modulus in order to deliver a moderate and persistent optimal force for tooth movement. As our finding pointed out that bending discounts the flexibility and Young&#x02019;s modulus of the material, it might have been the effective elongation that guarantees a desired result on this bending of wires.</p><p>Regarding the influence of corrosion on mechanical properties of bent and straight SS archwires, it is revealed that bent wires became vulnerable to pH and the mechanical properties were altered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bending has a significant influence on surface roughness and mechanical properties of rectangular SS archwires. pH plays a synergistic effect on the change of mechanical properties of SS wires along with wire bending.</p><p>The clinical implications of this study are as follows: (1) salivary pH tests for patient with fixed orthodontic appliance should be recommended and (2) bending on SS archwires should be done carefully for patients with imbalanced salivary pH (especially for basic pH) due to the synergistic effect.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>QY and MGH conceived of the study; MGH and YH participated in its design; MGH, QY, JX, and RS helped to carry out the experiments in the laboratory; YH and HX were involved in the data analysis and further literature searching; and MGH, YH, and QY drafted the manuscript.
