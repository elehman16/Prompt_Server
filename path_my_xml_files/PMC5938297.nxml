Cysts occur in a spectrum from sporadic lesions to numerous cysts as part of polycystic liver disease (PLD). Due to continuous epithelial cell proliferation and fluid production, cysts grow over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Large hepatic cysts lead to invalidating symptoms as pain, nausea and dyspnoea due to mechanical compression of surrounding organs that ultimately compromise the patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Aspiration sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at reducing the volume of these fluid-filled lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Injecting ethanol (or other sclerosing agents) directly in the cyst cavity destroys the inner cyst-lining epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Lysis of these epithelial cells halts cell proliferation and cyst fluid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Aspiration sclerotherapy generally reaches favourable results in solitary cysts or dominant cysts in PLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, reported long-term efficacy of cyst reduction is mixed and ranges from complete regression to recurrence of the cyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An important predictor of cyst reduction is the extent of intracystic fluid reaccumulation after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Typically, cyst fluid reaccumulates in the first weeks after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is hypothesized that this transient fluid production may result from remnants of the cyst wall that are not eliminated by sclerotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This initial fluid relapse threatens long-term efficacy and may lead to recurrence of the cyst necessitating re-intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Somatostatin analogues inhibit cyst fluid production and cell proliferation by activating somatostatin receptors on the basolateral surface of the cyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previous studies showed that lanreotide and octreotide reduce cystic volume in patients with polycystic liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Pasireotide (SOM230) is a more potent somatostatin analogue due to a broader binding profile and higher affinity to somatostatin receptor subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Adjuvant treatment of pasireotide with aspiration sclerotherapy has the promise of curtailing fluid reaccumulation and reducing cholangiocyte proliferation. This strategy has precedence as surgeons have described the use of octreotide after surgical cyst fenestration in an observational study (n = 5) and observed minimized fluid production by exposed remnants of fenestrated cysts leading to apparent control of ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">We hypothesized that the combined approach of aspiration sclerotherapy and pasireotide would decrease fluid accumulation and improve long-term cyst reduction and clinical response. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test whether pasireotide could improve the efficacy of aspiration sclerotherapy of large symptomatic hepatic cysts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par13">This study was performed following approval by the Institutional Review Board (Medical Research Ethics Committee of the region Arnhem-Nijmegen) and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02048319). We previously reported a detailed protocol elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; a brief description is given below.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par14">This randomized, single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in the Radboud University Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands between April 2014 and April 2016. Trial duration was 26 weeks. Following written informed consent, we randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio to pasireotide or placebo. Randomization was concealed to patients and investigators.</p><p id="Par15">Patients aged between 18 and 70 years with a large (&#x0003e; 5 cm) symptomatic solitary or dominant hepatic cyst were eligible for participation. A dominant cyst was regarded as the largest cyst within PLD. Major exclusion criteria were: a complicated cyst (neoplastic or hydatid cyst), a prolonged corrected QT-interval (&#x0003e; 470 ms), symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1C &#x0003e; 64 mmol/mol) and surgical or radiological cyst interventions within 6 months prior to the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study procedures</title><p id="Par16">All patients received aspiration sclerotherapy. In brief, we performed a single-session sclerotherapy procedure. The procedure was performed using conscious sedation with propofol (propofol 10 mg/ml, Fresenius, Bad Homburg vor der H&#x000f6;he, Germany) and alfentanyl (rapifen, 5 mg/10 ml, Tilburg, The Netherlands). Guided by ultrasound, the interventional radiologist inserted a 5 French pigtail catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IL, USA) in the cyst and performed fluid drainage until collapse of the cyst. Cyst leakage was ruled out by instillation of contrast medium (Iomeron 300, Bracco Imaging, Konstanz, Germany, up to 20 ml) followed by 10-min sclerotherapy. We injected 100 % ethanol in a 10 % ratio of the aspirated cyst volume (up to 50 ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All patients were hospitalized for 24-h observation.</p><p id="Par17">The intervention arm received 60 mg pasireotide (SOM230, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) long-acting release (LAR). This formulation is injected intramuscularly and secures an extended-release depot suitable for monthly administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on its pharmacokinetic profile we administered pasireotide 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after aspiration sclerotherapy to reach optimal drug levels around the procedure. Controls received placebo injections of sodium chloride 0.9 % (Fresenius Kabi, Hesse, Germany) at equal time points: 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after aspiration sclerotherapy. Injections were omitted if safety laboratory margins (fasting blood sugar, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin and amylase) were exceeded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Injections were administered by unblinded healthcare professionals not involved in the design or analysis of this trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study endpoints</title><p id="Par18">The primary outcome was the mean proportional change (%) in cyst diameter of the treated hepatic cyst from baseline to week 6, as measured by ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes were change in cyst diameter at 14 and 26 weeks; cyst volume reduction at 6, 14 and 26 weeks; recurrence rate (&#x0003c; 20 % reduction) at 6 and 26 weeks; patient-reported outcomes (change in symptoms and health-related quality of life) at 6 and 26 weeks; and rate and severity of adverse events during trial participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ultrasonography measurement</title><p id="Par19">All ultrasound measurements were performed by the primary blinded operator (TW) using a 3.5 MHz convex transducer (Acuson X150<sup>TM</sup>, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). At baseline, the indicated cyst was visualized in two planes to measure the maximal orthogonal diameters, from which we calculated one mean diameter (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition, cyst volume was estimated by the ellipsoid volume formula (D1*D2*D3*0.523) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In case of a dominant cyst, the segmental location and surrounding structures (cysts and vessels) were closely documented to secure identification of the treated cyst at follow-up. Measurements were repeated at weeks 6, 14 and 26 to obtain the proportional (%) change. A second blinded independent operator (ML) repeated all measurements of all patients to assess interobserver variability. In addition, the primary operator repeated measurements in a subset of nine patients to evaluate intra-observer variability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient-reported outcomes</title><p id="Par20">To evaluate symptoms, patients completed the Polycystic Liver Disease-Questionnaire (PLD-Q), which assesses frequency and discomfort of 13 PLD-related symptoms over a timeframe of one month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Scores can be compiled to a total sumscore from 1 (asymptomatic) to 100 (severe symptomatic) points. To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) we used the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Scores were summarized to a norm-based physical (PCS) and mental component score (MCS), with a general population reference of 50 &#x000b1; 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

We hypothesized that this reduction at 4 weeks would be improved to 50 % by adjuvant treatment with pasireotide. In order to detect a statistical difference between groups, we needed a sample size of 34 participants (power: 80 %; &#x003b1;: 0.05; drop-out rate: 10 %). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed including all patients who received at least one dose of pasireotide. In addition, a parallel per-protocol analysis was conducted in patients who received both injections and aspiration sclerotherapy. Values were reported as median with interquartile range. For continuous endpoints, we calculated differences between arms using the Mann-Whitney U test. To correct for baseline diameter differences and underlying diagnosis (solitary cyst or PLD) between arms, we performed a sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare within-group differences. Cyst recurrence was compared between groups by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. In case of a missing variable, we carried the last available value forward. Summarizing scores of patient-reported outcomes (PLD-Q sumscore, PCS, MCS) were compared between groups after treatment. To assess safety, we compiled frequency tables for adverse events classified according to WHO adverse reaction terminology. Statistical analyses were performed prior to unblinding using SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Glucose levels in the pasireotide group rose from 5.3 mmol/L (IQR 5.1&#x02013;6.1 mmol/L) to 6.8 mmol/L (IQR 6.6&#x02013;7.7 mmol/L) at week 4 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and normalized at the end of follow-up.

In both arms, we found symptomatic relief and normalized HRQL, underlining the clinical benefit that can be achieved by aspiration sclerotherapy.</p><p id="Par33">We expected that a combined approach to target cysts, i.e. pasireotide and aspiration sclerotherapy, would enhance efficacy over mere aspiration sclerotherapy. This hypothesis was based upon the working mechanism of somatostatin analogues. Somatostatin analogues lower intracellular levels of 3&#x02019;-5&#x02019;-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by binding somatostatin receptors (SSTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This second messenger cAMP stimulates cyst fluid production by activating chloride (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CFTR) and water (aquaporin 1) channels on the apical side of the cyst epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, cAMP stimulates cell hyperproliferation leading to cyst growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, by lowering intracellular levels of cAMP, cyst fluid production is curtailed and epithelial cell proliferation suppressed, collectively leading to cyst regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Previous clinical studies showed how somatostatin analogues reduce polycystic liver volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We expected that these features would reduce post-intervention fluid reaccumulation and improve long-term cyst reduction.</p><p id="Par34">Nonetheless, we found no differences between groups. Our efficacy results were comparable with other studies that performed mere aspiration sclerotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Why was our hypothesis not recapitulated by the results of our study? First, while other somatostatin analogues such as lanreotide and octreotide decrease hepatic cyst volumes, it is possible that pasireotide does not inhibit hepatic cystogenesis in humans. Compared to conventional somatostatin analogues, pasireotide has a broader binding profile (octreotide SSTR <sub>2, 3,</sub> and SSTR<sub>5</sub>; pasireotide SSTR <sub>1,2,3,</sub> and SSTR<sub>5</sub>) and a higher affinity to SSTR <sub>1, 3</sub> and SSTR<sub>5</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on this pharmacological profile, it is reasonable to assume that pasireotide also reduces cyst progression in humans. However, no human studies have reported the effects of pasireotide on hepatic cysts. Currently, a randomized clinical trial is being conducted to investigate the efficacy of pasireotide in polycystic liver disease, which will provide better insight into the cyst-reducing properties of pasireotide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT01670110).</p><p id="Par35">In addition, we may have administrated pasireotide in an inadequate dosage or regimen to be effective. In order to optimize the efficacy/safety balance we targeted our patients with pasireotide in a limited period before and after the procedure. To reach optimal drug levels, we administered a dosage of 60 mg in a long-acting release formulation. This is the highest available dosage within the safety range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The mild hyperglycaemia that followed pasireotide injections suggests adequate exposure to the drug.</p><p id="Par36">Finally, the process of post-procedural cyst fluid reaccumulation leading to recurrence may not be affected by pasireotide. Alternatively, it is hypothesized that fluid reaccumulation results from an inflammatory response induced by cell lysis following sclerotherapy, rather than fluid production of remaining functional cyst epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An exploratory study repunctured treated cysts 2&#x02013;8 days following aspiration sclerotherapy and observed an increase in leukocytes compared to the primary aspirate, suggesting ongoing inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Traditionally, efficacy studies of aspiration sclerotherapy focused on the technical&#x000a0;(morphological) response of aspiration sclerotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As hepatic cysts are benign lesions, indication for treatment is driven upon the patient&#x02019;s symptomatology. This was the first study to assess patient-reported outcomes at standardized time points using validated instruments. At baseline, we found low physical SF-36 scores and increased PLD-Q scores indicating a restricted HRQL a symptomatic burden compared to general population references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study we demonstrated that aspiration sclerotherapy significantly reduces disease-specific symptoms and normalizes HRQL. These findings support the notion that aspiration sclerotherapy is an excellent first-line choice to treat patients with large symptomatic hepatic cysts.</p><p id="Par38">The strength of this study is that we combined an invasive and medical strategy to optimize cyst reduction in a clinical trial design. This study also has several limitations. Firstly, our primary endpoint was measured by ultrasonography, which introduces variability as it is operator-dependent. CT or MRI may reduce variability, but would have led to unnecessary exposure to radiation and/or costs as this study required multiple measurements within short intervals. To minimize bias, all measurements were performed by the same investigator following standardized operating procedures. As a result, we found excellent intraclass coefficients of intra- and interobserver variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Secondly, we powered our study assuming a large beneficial effect from pasireotide. Possible smaller differences between our groups cannot be ruled out. However, we believe that such small differences would not be relevant for clinical practice, given the costs of pasireotide. Finally, we included both sporadic hepatic cysts and dominant hepatic cysts within PLD. The genetic background of both congenital cyst types corresponds as somatic loss of PLD-type alleles from cyst epithelium is required to drive cyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Indeed, both cyst types have a thin wall lined by a single layer of aberrant cholangiocytes, which are targetable by somatostatin analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, it is unclear if germline mutations in PLD patients alter susceptibility to these agents. In our study, we found no differences in efficacy between patients with or without underlying PLD, as reflected in the previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">In summary, adjuvant pasireotide treatment to aspiration sclerotherapy in patients with large hepatic cysts is no more effective than aspiration sclerotherapy alone. Aspiration sclerotherapy normalizes HRQL-rates and decreases symptomatic disease, which proves aspiration sclerotherapy is an excellent choice of therapy for large hepatic cysts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
