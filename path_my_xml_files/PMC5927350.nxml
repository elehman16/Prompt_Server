Three hundred and seventy-five elderly patients were included and allocated to the Elderly Activity Performance Intervention (n=144) or usual practice (n=231). The intervention consisted of 1) assessment of the patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities, 2) referral to further rehabilitation, and 3) follow-up visit the day after discharge. Primary outcome was readmission (yes/no) within 26 weeks. The study was registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrial.gov">ClinicalTrial.gov</ext-link> (NCT02078466).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No between-group differences were found in readmission. Overall, 44% of the patients in the intervention group and 42% in the usual practice group were readmitted within 26 weeks (risk difference=0.02, 95% CI: [&#x02212;0.08; 0.12] and risk ratio=1.05, 95% CI: [0.83; 1.33]). No between-group differences were found in any of the secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Elderly Activity Performance Intervention showed no effectiveness in reducing the risk of readmission in elderly patients discharged from a short-stay unit at the emergency department.

Due to limited resources and time, it was possible to include and allocate up to two patients to the intervention group per day. If more patients were eligible, allocation was based on the date of birth (day of the month). The two patients born closest to the first day of a month (eg, March 1) would be allocated to the intervention group. Patients not included in the intervention group were treated according to usual practice and formed the control group. Likewise, patients admitted after 8:00 am and meeting the inclusion criteria, but were discharged out of hours (afternoons and evenings) were allocated to the usual practice group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Usual practice</title><p>Patients in both groups received relevant medical treatment and care. Referral to occupational therapy and physiotherapy took place only if the medical or nursing staff considered it necessary. If the occupational therapist was summoned to asses a patient, the occupational therapist performed a short interview and a non-standardized observation of the patient&#x02019;s performance of basic daily activities and the results were communicated to the municipality homecare staff. If necessary, nurses from the ED organized referral to nursing home care after discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>The EAP-intervention</title><p>The EAP-intervention was offered in addition to usual practice.

The rehabilitation plan included a description of the patient&#x02019;s previous and current performance of daily activities and specified the need for further rehabilitation. Primary care was informed about the discharge, and visitation of the patient to further rehabilitation interventions was carried out on the same day in order to start the rehabilitation immediately after discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Component 3</title><p>For patients with a prescribed rehabilitation plan, a home visit by an occupational therapist was performed the day after discharge. The home visit aimed to enhance the patient&#x02019;s performance of daily activities and to start rehabilitation. The occupational therapist screened the home for safety risks and factors that potently could limit the performance of daily activities. If limitations and/or safety risks were identified, the occupational therapist made relevant modifications of the home environment. To ensure standardized procedures at the follow-up visit, a checklist was developed.</p><p>None of the three components in the EAP-intervention were applied to patients in the usual practice group.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was all-cause readmission within 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were all-cause readmission within 30 days and all-cause mortality, number of contacts to general practitioners (GPs) and EDs (without admission) within 26 weeks, and time to first readmission. All data on outcome variables were obtained from the National Patient Register.</p><p>Data related to patient characteristics were extracted for both groups from the National Patient Register and included gender, age, civil status, admission diagnosis, comorbidity, and admission time. Comorbidity was measured with the Charlson&#x02019;s Comorbidity Index calculated from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision diagnosis retrieved from the National Patient Register, at the day of inclusion.<xref rid="b37-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b39-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Based on the literature, the intervention was expected to reduce the risk of readmission within 26 weeks with 16 percentage points, from 37% to 21%.<xref rid="b17-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A total of 152 patients in each group were needed to achieve 80% power with a two-sided type I error of 5%, assuming that 10% of the participants were lost to follow-up, for example, due to death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>A detailed statistical analysis plan was developed prospectively in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement, and data were reported according to the extended Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.<xref rid="b40-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Hypothesis tests were conducted at the 5% level of significance and were two-sided. All analyses were performed using the Stata 14.2 statistics program. Biostatistician was consulted in developing the analysis plan and when performing the analyses.</p><p>First, a descriptive analysis was performed summarizing baseline characteristics for both the intervention group and the usual practice group. Data were presented as mean and SD or numbers and percentages. The two groups were compared and tested for significant differences at baseline using chi-square test, the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for nonparametric variables. Risk of readmission within 26 weeks was estimated by cumulative incidence proportion using a pseudo-value method accounting for death as a competing risk.<xref rid="b42-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The two groups were compared by risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Due to the nonrandomized study design, similar analysis was performed by adjusting for factors that a priori were considered to be confounders: age, gender, and comorbidity. Thirty-day all-cause readmission and all-cause mortality within 26 weeks were estimated by RD and RR with 95% CI and secondly adjusted for potential confounding. Numbers of contacts to GPs and ED were described with median and range and differences were tested with nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Time to first readmission with unadjusted cumulative incidence proportions was illustrated in a graph. An explorative analysis was performed to compare the baseline differences for those patients in the control group admitted during the daytime and those admitted during afternoon and evenings, in order to include possible differences in the adjusted analyses. An exploratory analysis within the intervention group was performed to examine if the number of intervention components received was associated with the primary outcome, risk of readmission within 26 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval and registrations</title><p>The ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were followed.<xref rid="b44-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The Regional Ethics Committee responded that no approval was required as the study was classified as a quality assurance project (J. nr.1-10-72-108-14).

When exploring the effectiveness in relation to different subgroups such as gender, comorbidity, and age, no differences were found.</p><p>The intention with the EAP-intervention was to improve usual practice by enhancing the elderly patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities and ensure a coherent discharge, without changing the overall organization of the Danish health care system.</p><p>We hypothesized that the EAP-intervention was more efficient compared to usual practice, but our results did not corroborate this. The EAP-intervention was developed to enhance the elderly patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities and ensure a coherent discharge to home, assuming that this would reduce the risk of readmission. This assumption was based on evidence in the literature and the use of a logic model as recommended in the Intervention Mapping approach.<xref rid="b28-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The use of a logic model in the developing phase allowed us to focus directly on factors and their underlying determinants associated with risk of readmission. Although limitations in performing daily activities are a well-known risk factor for readmission in elderly patients, the EAP-intervention may not have been sufficiently intensive to address the complexity in the health needs of elderly patients as only two factors were specifically addressed: performance of daily activities and a coherent discharge.<xref rid="b7-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other risk factors for readmission, such as nutritional status and polypharmacy, were not specifically addressed in this intervention, although they are known to be important elements in geriatric interventions.<xref rid="b18-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Further studies should investigate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach in a multicomponent intervention addressing the ability to perform daily activities and other selected factors such as psychosocial, socioeconomic, nutritional, and medication.</p><p>Although the EAP-intervention was designed to address the patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities, the design of the study did not allow us to test its effectiveness on the patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities. This was due to the fact that the assessments of the patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities were one of the three components of the EAP-intervention. It would have been preferable to collect other measures on performance of daily activities for patients in both groups. However, this was not possible as solely register-based data were collected in the usual practice group. Measures on the performance of daily activities may have contributed with a deeper insight to whether the EAP-intervention resulted in enhancing the elderly patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities. A more comprehensive intervention, including task-specific training over a longer period, may potentially increase elderly patients&#x02019; performance of daily activities. Benefits from such interventions in elderly populations have been described broadly.<xref rid="b45-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b48-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> A systematic review of home- and community-based occupational therapy from 2017 concluded that there is strong evidence that occupational therapy improves the ability to perform daily activities in elderly.<xref rid="b45-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>Participants in our study were comparable with participants in similar studies with regard to age and comorbidity, but may have differed in other factors such as socioeconomic status or home care received before admission.<xref rid="b15-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b49-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Age at 65 or above was an inclusion criterion in our study, which is in accordance with other studies aimed at reducing the risk of readmission in elderly patients.<xref rid="b19-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b49-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> We did not select the participants due to their limitations in performing daily activities or other factors associated with the risk of readmission. If we had used a risk stratification instrument to screen and identify patients at high risk of readmission, it may have resulted in a different study population. Our results showed that 60% of patients in the intervention group had limitations in performing daily activities as identified with the performance-based assessment of performance of daily activities (component 1) and, thereby, the need for a rehabilitation plan and follow-up visits by an occupational therapist (components 2 and 3). If we had used a risk stratification instrument to select patients at high risk, we may have included a more homogenous population, which potentially could have benefitted from the EAP-intervention. Two systematic reviews highlight that studies using risk stratification instruments to identify high-risk patients most frequently show beneficial results.<xref rid="b14-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b50-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Further research is needed in order to examine if risk stratification before an occupational therapy discharge planning intervention would be beneficial in reducing the risk of readmission in elderly patients.</p><p>The exploratory analysis within the intervention group revealed that patients (60%) who were identified with decreased ability to perform daily activities in component 1 were at higher risk of readmission within 26 weeks than patients with no limitations in performing daily activities. This indicates that a large proportion of elderly patients discharged from short-stay units at EDs have limitations in performing daily activities and thereby need further rehabilitation.</p><sec><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>Due to the quasi-experimental design, we were able to include nearly all patients meeting the inclusion criteria, thus providing a representative result. The intervention was performed during routine clinical practice and not in selected cases, which enhances the clinical relevance. Furthermore, an important strength of the study is the use of register-based data, which ensured a complete follow-up (100%) on all outcomes measured.</p><p>The study did have some limitations. First, the nonrandomized allocation may have led to unequal distribution of unmeasured factors, for example, socioeconomic factors or physical functioning between the two groups. Although the patients in the two groups were similar in terms of gender, marital status, and comorbidity, patients in the intervention group were older and admitted longer than patients in the usual practice group. In the statistical analyses, we used a multiple regression model to control for those differences in baseline characteristics. However, there may be several unidentified or unmeasured confounding factors that possibly could have influenced the outcome.</p><p>Given the available resources and experiences from a previous pilot study, a randomized trial was not a viable option.<xref rid="b29-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In our previous pilot study, the randomization procedures were not feasible for the patients, which resulted in 67% of the patients refusing to participate. The quasi-experimental study design may be inferior to the randomized controlled trials on the study design hierarchy. However, the use of it may be beneficial in situations where randomization is not an option.<xref rid="b51-cia-13-737" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>Allocation of patients to the usual practice group may have introduced selection bias, as some of the patients were included in daytime and others in afternoons and evenings. The within-group analysis of the usual practice group revealed differences in the group in relation to marital status and admission time. This was handled by adjusting for the influence of these two factors in the analyses, and the subanalysis did not alter the overall findings of the study. Referral to further rehabilitation in the municipality was planned to be carried out immediately after discharge from the hospital. However, it was not possible to get data on the actual services delivered from the municipality, and we do not know whether rehabilitation in primary care was carried out as planned. This may have affected the impact of the intervention on the risk of readmission, and the lack of data is considered a limitation of the study.</p><p>Due to the nature of the study, we were not able to blind patients or staff at the short-stay unit as to who received the intervention. In order to reduce the possibility of contamination, the occupational therapists delivering the EAP-intervention were not allowed to treat patients in the usual practice group. None of the patients in the usual practice group received follow-up visits after discharge, though some of them may have, by self-referral, received some kind of rehabilitation and/or home care after discharge.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The EAP-intervention showed no effectiveness in reducing the risk of readmission in elderly patients discharged from a short-stay unit at the ED. The results highlight the importance of assessing elderly patients&#x02019; ability to perform daily activities before discharge in order to determine the need for further rehabilitation. Although the intervention was not effective in reducing the risk of readmission, it revealed that 60% of patients in the intervention group had decreased ability to perform daily activities and there was a need for further rehabilitation after discharge. Further studies are needed to examine if a more intensive occupational therapy intervention with task-specific training over a longer period will increase elderly patients&#x02019; ability to perform daily activities and, thereby, reduce their risk of readmission after discharge from a short-stay unit at the ED.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the participants and their relatives, the occupational therapists, physiotherapist, doctors, and nurses at the participating short-stay unit, and to therapists from primary care/the municipality who actively participated in this project.</p><p>The work was supported by the Tryg Foundation (grant number 107632), the Foundation of Public Health in the Middle (grant number 1-30-72-141-12), and Aase and Ejnar Danielsen&#x02019;s Foundation (grant number 10-001233).
