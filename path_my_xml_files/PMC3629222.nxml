A trial using a novel three stage nonstop design, incorporating Phases I-III, tested ceftriaxone in ALS. Stage 1 determined the cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in subjects with ALS. Stage 2 evaluated safety and tolerability for 20-weeks. Analysis of the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety was used to determine the ceftriaxone dosage for Stage 3 efficacy testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In Stage 1, 66 subjects at ten clinical sites were enrolled and randomized equally into three study groups receiving intravenous placebo, ceftriaxone 2 grams daily or ceftriaxone 4 grams daily divided BID. Participants provided serum and cerebrospinal fluid for pharmacokinetic analysis on study day 7. Participants continued their assigned treatment in Stage 2. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the data after the last participants completed 20 weeks on study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Stage 1 analysis revealed linear pharmacokinetics, and CSF trough levels for both dosage levels exceeding the pre-specified target trough level of 1 &#x000b5;M (0.55 &#x000b5;g/mL). Tolerability (Stages 1 and 2) results showed that ceftriaxone at dosages up to 4 grams/day was well tolerated at 20 weeks. Biliary adverse events were more common with ceftriaxone but not dose-dependent and improved with ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The goals of Stages 1 and 2 of the ceftriaxone trial were successfully achieved. Based on the pre-specified decision rules, the DSMB recommended the use of ceftriaxone 4 g/d (divided BID) for Stage 3, which recently closed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00349622?term=ceftriaxone+als&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00349622</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Support for this research was provided by a grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (U01 NS049640-05) and from the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences (UL1 TR000448).

A three-stage nonstop drug development program with intermediate analyses and no pauses between stages was designed to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) (Stage 1) and safety and tolerability (Stage 2) data, and apply this information to the development of an efficacy study (Stage 3). This design was chosen as a method to expedite drug development (Unpublished Data: Presented by Helms, Kesler, Monti, and Wallace at <italic>FDA -ASA BioPharm Section Workshop</italic>, 2002).

All coordination center staff, participants, investigators, site coordinators and site evaluators were blinded to treatment group assignment throughout the study. Screening for Stages 1 and 2 began in August, 2006 and completed in March 2008.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Stage 1</title><p>The aim of Stage 1 was to determine if either dose, or both doses, of ceftriaxone achieve a CSF trough concentration of &#x02265;1 &#x000b5;M in at least 80% of the participants. The PK of ceftriaxone in plasma and CSF were measured to allow estimation of CSF levels based on dosing and plasma level. The PK effect of a drug holiday was also modeled. Participants were randomized equally into treatment arms receiving placebo twice daily, low dose (2 grams per day in the morning and placebo in the afternoon) ceftriaxone (LD) or high dose (4 grams per day divided into 2 grams twice daily) ceftriaxone (HD) administered via indwelling central venous catheter. Placebo was pediatric multivitamin matching the study drug in appearance, taste, and odor.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Stage 2</title><p>The treatment blind was not broken after Stage 1; all subjects continued treatment in their previously assigned dosage group for Stage 2 to determine safety and tolerability after 20 weeks, inclusive of time on study drug in Stage 1. Subjects were regarded as treatment failures if they permanently discontinued study drug prior to completing 20 weeks of treatment for any reason. A dosage was considered tolerable if the proportion of treatment failures was less than 40% with 80% confidence. Safety was also assessed, as defined by the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs). Because the study design was non-stop continuous, all participants remained on study drug at the end of Stage 2.</p><p>By design, the DSMB performed an interim analysis and made a recommendation about dosage for Stage 3. Stage 2 participants continued to Stage 3 in a blinded fashion. Those on placebo continued on placebo, those on active treatment had their doses adjusted to match the selected Stage 3 dosage. New participants in Stage 3 were randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 2&#x02236;1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participant Selection Criteria</title><p>At screening, eligible participants had a diagnosis of probable lab-supported, probable, or definite ALS by El Escorial Criteria <xref rid="pone.0061177-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, a vital capacity (VC) &#x02265;60% of the predicted normal value for height, age and gender, symptom duration of less than 3 years, and were not on riluzole or were on a stable dose for &#x02265;30 days.

To each tube was added 0.1 uL of ammonium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5) containing cefazolin as internal standard. After addition of 0.5 mL acetonitrile, samples were vortex-mixed and centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a conical tube containing 0.5 mL of chloroform. After vortex mixing and centrifugation, the upper aqueous layer was transferred to an auto-sampling vial for HPLC analysis. The HPLC mobile phase was water:methanol:triethylamine (750&#x02236;250&#x02236;4), at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column was Waters micro-Bondapak C18, 3.9 mm &#x000d7; 30 cm. Detection was U.

Six SAEs were definitely or probably related to the central catheter, including four line infections, one fever, and one thrombotic event &#x02013; all resolved.

Stages 1 and 2 provided information about the long-term use of ceftriaxone, CSF PK in patients without inflamed meninges, and the dosage required to reach CSF levels of <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy (1 &#x000b5;M) <xref rid="pone.0061177-Vincent1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061177-Rothstein3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061177-Rothstein4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Stage 1 met its primary aim, demonstrating that both dosage levels of ceftriaxone (2 grams and 4 grams daily) achieved CSF concentrations of &#x02265;1 &#x000b5;M (0.55 &#x000b5;g/mL). Drug holidays of up to 3 days were possible while maintaining effective CSF drug concentrations &#x02265;1 &#x000b5;M in patients receiving high dose (4 gm/d) ceftriaxone. We confirmed ceftriaxone plasma and CSF kinetics and determined that approximately 50&#x02013;55% of the variability of between-subject CSF concentration of ceftriaxone was attributable to plasma concentration.</p><p>Both dosage levels of ceftriaxone met criteria for tolerability in Stages 1 and 2. As anticipated, the most common drug related AE was biliary sludge/cholelithiasis, which were well-managed with ursodiol and/or temporary drug suspension or reduction, and did not lead to study drug discontinuation in a dose-dependent manner. In Stage 3, all participants receiving ceftriaxone also received ursodiol for the prevention of biliary obstruction.</p><p>Other AEs did not occur more commonly with ceftriaxone treatment relative to placebo. The safety of home administration of study drug by trained caregivers was excellent and compared favorably to other studies employing at home catheter access (data not shown).</p><p>Based on the pre-established guidelines, the DSMB reviewed pharmacokinetic, and safety and tolerability data and recommended continuing to Stage 3 with the high dosage ceftriaxone (4 g/day divided twice daily). A steering committee subpanel also reviewed the data and came to the same conclusion. Stage 3 data collection is now complete and efficacy data is being analyzed and will be reported in a separate manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061177.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
