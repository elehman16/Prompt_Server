The current therapeutic options for the overweight and obese are limited as most lack efficacy or are associated with adverse side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Satiety plays an important role in the maintenance of body weight and prevention of obesity as it allows the regulation of food intake on a meal to meal basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Amongst the numerous interacting mechanisms contributing to the regulation of satiety, enteroendocrine signals originating from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are hypothesised to play an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>One hypothesis is focused on signals that may arise from the ileum, the most distal part of the small intestine (SI), or hind gut and there has been interest in dietary available CHO as a potential trigger for satiety signals arising from the ileum. There is a growing body of evidence from both animal and clinical studies that infusing glucose directly into the ileum can modify a range of GI activities, and that in turn this may put a brake on food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, achieving this effect with food is extremely challenging as the digestion and absorption of CHO occurs mainly in the stomach, duodenum and jejunum of the proximal SI, or fore gut, resulting in minimal delivery of monosaccharide glucose into the ileum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The initial step in the enzymatic digestion of starch involves cleavage of the glucose-glucose &#x003b1;-(1, 4) glycosidic bond by &#x003b1;-amylase to produce shorter dextrin chains and glucose-glucose disaccharides (such as maltose and isomaltose). These products are then further hydrolysed into individual glucose units by a set of brush border enzymes collectively called &#x003b1;-glucosidases. Only these monosaccharide forms of CHO are then taken up by gut epithelial cells using specific transporters, sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (sGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Polyphenols are a structural class of plant-origin compounds characterized by the presence of large multiples of phenol structural units. The number and characteristics of these phenol structures underlie the unique physical, chemical, and biological (metabolic, toxic, therapeutic) properties of particular members of the class. The health benefits of polyphenols have been extensively studied and implicated as protective agents in a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, a variety of polyphenols have been shown to exert biological effects in CHO metabolism by inhibiting the activity of &#x003b1;-amylase and &#x003b1;-glucosidase, two key enzymes required for starch digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. On this basis, it is plausible that plants rich in polyphenols, when given with a high starch-based meal, may be able to induce CHO (glucose) malabsorption in the fore gut. This mechanism may allow transit of available CHO further down the GI tract, possibly as far as the hind gut, which in turn may result in the activation of satiety responses. A similar mechanism is utilized by the pharmaceutical industry in diabetic therapies such as acarbose or miglitol, which block CHO uptake in the fore gut to ameliorate glycaemia, and where in turn there is some evidence of appetite suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Grapes contain high concentrations of bioactive polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Notably, recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown polyphenolic grape extracts (PGE), including grape seed extract (GSE), to be associated with significant inhibition of activity of &#x003b1;-amylase and &#x003b1;-glucosidase with the potential to prevent the breakdown of starch into its glucose components, blocking a step that is required for the absorption of dietary available CHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The objective of the present study was to test whether PGE, hypothesised to induce post-meal CHO malabsorption in the fore gut when consumed with a starch-rich food, would enhance satiety and reduce food intake at a later meal. Specifically, it aimed to compare the effects of low-dose (500&#x000a0;mg) and high-dose (1500&#x000a0;mg) PGE protected from gastric acid by delivery within a capsule and consumed with a standardised high-starch breakfast meal, on postprandial appetite and food intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy men (BMI 18&#x02013;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) aged between 18 and 60&#x000a0;years were recruited in Auckland, New Zealand&#x000a0;during January and February 2014, through poster and electronic advertisement. Participants were non-smokers, had no history of CVD, diabetes, or any other significant metabolic, endocrine or GI disease, and were not taking any medications that may have had any effect on appetite or weight regulation throughout the trial period. Other exclusion criteria included participation in an active diet program or loss/gain of &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;kg body weight within the last 6&#x000a0;months. Hypersensitivities or allergies to any foods or ingredients included in the study, as well as dislike and/or unwillingness to consume items listed as study foods (breakfast and lunch meals), unwilling/unable to comply with study protocol, or current participation in another clinical intervention trial were also exclusions. Participants were ascertained healthy by self-report during a screening visit. Human ethics consent was obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (HDEC, Reference Number: 13/NTA/225). The trial was registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), clinical trial registration number ACTRN12614000041651, and conducted at the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU), University of Auckland, New Zealand. Prior to registration for the trial, all participants provided written informed consent and were instructed that they were able to withdraw from the trial at any time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design, supplements, and protocol</title><p>This was a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, three condition, cross-over study.

A commercial source of PGE was used in this trial (New Zealand Extracts Ltd, Marlborough, New Zealand) which was an extract from red and white grape seeds and skins extracted using a proprietary water-based method. Total polyphenolic content was measured using HPLC according to Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) 15<sup>th</sup> Edition, 952.03 methods standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Each capsule contained 353&#x000a0;mg polyphenolics per 500&#x000a0;mg PGE, hence total polyphenol content was ~70&#x000a0;% by weight. The predominant phenolic components in the extract identified by HPLC were oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC, which were &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;% of total phenolics), epicatechin and epicatechin gallate. NZ Extracts Ltd also undertook blinding of the capsules, correct allocation of which was subsequently confirmed by the research team upon completion of the trial using capsules taken from the original source. The intervention arms were: standardised breakfast plus low dose PGE (PGE<sub>500</sub>: 1 PGE capsule plus 2 placebo capsules); standardised breakfast plus high dose PGE (PGE<sub>1500</sub>: 3 PGEcapsules); and standardised breakfast plus placebo (Placebo: 3 placebo capsules); hence 3 capsules were administered on each occasion to ensure the blind was maintained. The trial was not unblinded until completion of both the intervention and statistical analyses.

Consumption of the breakfast plus PGE or placebo capsules significantly decreased hunger and increased fullness scores on all 3 arms compared with baseline scores (all, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The VAS-rated changes in satisfaction and TOF were similar and consistent with those of hunger and fullness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, all, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The plots show consistent and predictable changes in line with known physiological effects. However, there was no significant difference between PGE supplements and inactive placebo in any of the VAS assessments either over the 180&#x000a0;min period between breakfast and lunch or throughout the full study day (time*supplement, all, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05), confirming that there was no effect of either PGE<sub>500</sub> or PGE<sub>1500</sub> on subjective measures of appetite compared with the inactive placebo.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mean (SEM) VAS-rated hunger, fullness, thoughts of food (TOF) and satisfaction throughout the day in response to 3 breakfast treatments: placebo; low-dose PGE (PGE500, 500 mg); high-dose PGE (PGE1500, 1500 mg).

Evidence from naso-ileal tube studies that delivery of nutrients directly to the distal SI may impose a brake on appetite has generated considerable interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and lead to speculation that it may be possible to induce the ileal brake following a meal. The hypothesis that orally delivered monosaccharide glucose may avoid absorption in the duodenum and hence transit through to the distal SI and thereby enhance satiety was originally proposed following studies where pharmaceutical &#x003b1;-glucosidases were administered with a CHO-rich meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Prescribed as oral therapeutics to promote better regulation of blood glucose and prevent significant postprandial glucose excursions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes (T2D), the &#x003b1;-glucosidases or&#x02019; starch blockers&#x02019; act to decrease the rate of starch digestion through reversible inhibition of pancreatic &#x003b1;-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal &#x003b1;-glucosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. They include acarbose, voglibose and miglitol which essentially induce malabsorption by preventing or slowing the breakdown of complex CHO to glucose in the proximal SI, moving the absorption site of CHO to the distal portion of the intestine. In clinical studies where these starch blockers have been given with a high CHO-meal, the rate of gastric emptying has decreased and sustained enhancement of peptides associated with satiety has been reported, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) which is secreted predominantly from the ileal epithelial endocrine L-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These trials have also demonstrated suppression of appetite, albeit with mild to moderate GI adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], attributed to malabsorption of CHO within the proximal SI and increasing concentration of glucose within the distal SI including the ileum. Therefore, it is conceivable that dietary sources of naturally occurring &#x003b1;-glucosidase and &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitors, such as those of plant-origin including grapes, may also suppress proximal SI glucose digestion allowing delivery of glucose distally.</p><p>PGE, amongst a number of other naturally occurring plant extracts rich in bioactive polyphenols, has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> to be a potent inhibitor of the &#x003b1;-glucosidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], but whether it could modulate appetite and EI had not previously been investigated. Interestingly, there are some prior animal studies which have reported a link between PGE and decreased food intake and body weight, although with no direct evidence that the effects were driven by change in appetite regulation. In an early study in rats, 12-week supplementation of grape seed extract (GSE) decreased food intake and prevented weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Notably, the authors attributed the results in part to a binding affinity of the polyphenols for specific proteins within the ingested food, forming aggregates in the GI tract and leading to delayed digestibility and absorption of the nutrients. In a more recent study rodents with obesity induced by a high fat diet were supplemented with GSE over 5&#x000a0;weeks, and reported prevention of further weight gain and improvement in obesity-related serum biochemistry such as circulating lipid profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Neither study attributed the effects on body weight to changes in appetite regulation, despite the changes in food intake. Our study was the first to assess the efficacy of PGE delivered within a capsule at the same time as a high starch breakfast meal and found that whilst PGE at doses of 500 and 1500&#x000a0;mg was safe and well tolerated, it did not significantly modulate appetite or EI when compared to a matched placebo.</p><p>There are several important methodological issues to be noted from our study. Grape extracts are widely consumed as a nutritional supplement worldwide, are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and in our present study we were able to confirm the tolerability of PGE doses ranging from 500 to 1500&#x000a0;mg in healthy males. Notably, suppression of food intake was observed in the rodent trials at a dose of between 70 and 100&#x000a0;mg/kg GSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Body surface area (BSA) normalisation algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], albeit a simple approach to dose conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], show this to be to a human equivalent dose (HED) of ~350&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;mg in a 60&#x000a0;kg adult (HED, mg/kg&#x02009;=&#x02009;rodent dose, mg/kg &#x000d7; [rodent K<sub>m</sub>/human K<sub>m</sub>], where mouse K<sub>m</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, rat K<sub>m</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, human K<sub>m</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37), and indicate that sufficient dose may have been administered in our current trial. Secondly, a lack of information on the absorption and bioavailability of PGE-derived polyphenols in humans raised a challenge in our current study, where the intent was to orally deliver sufficient concentration of polyphenols into the proximal SI in order to delay CHO absorption. We did not assess this outcome in this trial. Thirdly, partially blocking starch breakdown may not have been sufficient to enable distal transit of dietary glucose which may also require inhibition of glucose uptake as it passed through the proximal SI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our present clinical study, whilst we were able to confirm the tolerability of PGE doses ranging from 500 to 1500&#x000a0;mg in a group of healthy males, there was no evidence that supplementation with PGE altered postprandial appetite response to a starch-rich breakfast meal nor <italic>ad lib</italic> energy or macronutrient intake at a later lunch meal, relative to a matched placebo. It is not known whether PGE can delay digestion and absorption of available CHO and enhance delivery of glucose to the ileum in a clinical setting. Whether PGE administered at different time intervals (pre or post CHO meal), at higher or repeated doses over a longer time period, or synergistically with glucose uptake blockers, can alter satiety is not known and may be of interest for investigation in future trials.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSA</term><def><p>Body surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHO</term><def><p>Carbohydrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EI</term><def><p>Energy intake</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GI</term><def><p>Gastrointestinal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP-1</term><def><p>Glucagon like peptide-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLUT2</term><def><p>Glucose transporter 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSE</term><def><p>Grape seed extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDEC</term><def><p>Health and Disability Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HNU</term><def><p>Human nutrition unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGT</term><def><p>Impaired glucose tolerance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGE</term><def><p>Polyphenolic grape extract</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>Standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SI</term><def><p>Small intestine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sGLT1</term><def><p>Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2D</term><def><p>Type 2 diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TOF</term><def><p>Thoughts of food</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
