The effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of SIBO syndrome has not been well studied. This pilot study was aimed to assess the efficacy of a probiotic consisting of lactobacilli in the treatment of SIBO.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this study, 30 cases suffering from chronic abdominal pain or diarrhoea and with a positive hydrogen breath test were randomized in a double-blind manner into two groups: probiotic drug user and control group. After an initial 3-week aggressive therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics, a 15-day maintenance antibiotic therapy with lactol was administered for the study group and the same regimen without lactol for the control group. After six months the HBT result and the GI symptoms were analyzed and compared between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The result of hydrogen breath test and the clinical symptoms in patients receiving the maintenance regimen with lactol probiotic showed a better response. The hydrogen breath test turned negative in 93.3 per cent of those receiving lactol compared to 66.7 per cent of the controls. In all the cases receiving lactol, the abdominal pain disappeared completely (<italic>P</italic>=0.002).

Bacterial overgrowth can be the result of a change in the clinical condition which has altered the <italic>p</italic>H and the bowel movements. In addition, immune deficiency and malnutrition are the other risk factors accompanying this disorder<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) leads to steatorrhoea, vitamin B12 absorptive impairment and also injury to the small intestinal microvilli which itself causes malabsorption. On the other hand, this SIBO can lead to coma, neurological deficit and acidosis- induced shock<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. SIBO has also been proposed to be a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.

Hydrogen breath test (HBT) was performed after obtaining informed written consent. The study protocol was approved by the Research Council Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. The consumption of all types of antibiotics, proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), Bismuth or other digestive drugs was ceased since one month before the test; it was performed following 12 h of fasting and three hours after using a mouth wash solution. The amount of released respiratory hydrogen following each deep breath in and breath out was recorded. The production of 20 ppm of hydrogen at each time point was defined as its consumption by the bacteria and, therefore, was considered as a positive test result<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>Thirty consecutive cases with a positive HBT result were included in the study. Their GI symptoms were recorded. They were randomized in a double-blind, manner into two groups: probiotic drug user and control group. Following three week of aggressive therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics, a monthly maintenance therapeutic regimen including 15 days of antibiotic therapy with minocycline, 100 mg twice a day, and 15 days with lactol probiotic (Bioplus Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., India) (<italic>Bacillus coagulan</italic> spores and Fructo-oligosaccharides), twice a day after meals, was administered for the study group. The control group received 15 days of antibiotic therapy with minocycline, 100mg twice a day, during first half of each month and received no other drug during the rest of the month. After the treatment period (6 months), the HBT was performed once again and GI symptoms were recorded again, the HBT test result and also rate of GI symptoms improvement were compared between the two groups.</p><p>Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test were used for data analysis (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as significant).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results &#x00026; Discussion</title><p>The patients&#x02019; demographic data and GI symptoms at the initiation and termination points of the study are presented in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">II</xref>. Of the 30 cases, 15 (50%) were females. The age ranged from 21 to 80 yr. The mean age of the study group which received Lactol probiotic was 34.60 &#x000b1; 10.68 yr whereas the control group for which a non-probiotic therapeutic regimen was administered had a mean age of 42.86 &#x000b1; 16.61 yr. No significant difference was detected between the two groups regarding age and sex. At the end of the treatment course, pain had completely disappeared in the probiotic group whereas it was resolved in only seven of the 15 cases (46.7%) of the control group; the difference was significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.002). The number of patients with complaints of bloating, belching and diarrhoea was remarkably less in the patients receiving lactol probiotic in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table II</xref>). In this study the presence of nausea, vomiting, constipation and feeling loss of appetite was similar in both groups. The post-treatment HBT results were negative in 93.3 per cent patients of the study group in comparison to 66.7 per cent of the controls.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics of subjects at baseline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-140-604-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table II</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics data of subjects after six months of treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-140-604-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The main goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a maintenance therapy with lactol probiotic in the treatment of patients suffering from SIBO who had a positive HBT.

The symptoms of diarrhoea, flatulence and belching improved significantly in the lactol group in comparison to the controls.</p><p>In spite of the aggressive and maintenance treatments administered for all the cases, 93.3 per cent patients showed negative result of the HBT at the end of treatment in the study group compared to 66.7 per cent in the control group, showing the effectiveness of the probiotic treatment. These results need to be confirmed in a study with a larger sample size.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this pilot study show that adding a probiotic drug such as lactol to the maintenance regimen may improve the GI symptoms and prevent the probable complications in patients with SIBO.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Fauci</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasper</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Longo</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Braunwald</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jameson</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Disorders of Absorption</article-title><source>Harrison's principles of internal medicine</source><year>2012</year><edition>18th ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>McGraw Hill</publisher-name><fpage>2460</fpage><lpage>76</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kleigman</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Behrman</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenson</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanton</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nelson textbook of pediatrics</article-title><year>2011</year><edition>19th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia: PA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Saunders</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Quigley</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bacteria: a new player in gastrointestinal motility disorders - infections, bacterial overgrowth, and probiotics</article-title><source>Gastroenterol Clin North Am</source><year>2007</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>735</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17950446</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O&#x02019;Mahony</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Shanhan</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Brandt</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Enteric microbiota and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</article-title><source>Sleisenger &#x00026;
