Conducting CHMI trials is also important in building the capacity of African research institutions to become involved in the earlier stages of vaccine or drug development. However, to date, CHMI trials have rarely been conducted in malaria-endemic regions, primarily because of the lack of access to the appropriate parasite culture and insectary facilities necessary for mosquito-bite CHMI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The development of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites (SPZ) for injection (Sanaria&#x000ae; PfSPZ Challenge) has helped overcome this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

At these multidisciplinary meetings, ethical, logistical, funding, and scientific issues were discussed. All parties supported the establishment of a CHMI centre in Kenya as a key objective in line with national and regional research priorities. A decision was made for Nairobi to be the preferred site for the first CHMI study, given the ease of access to tertiary medical centres, the relative lack of natural malaria transmission and large concentration of educated individuals best placed to provide informed consent. Initial discussions focused on developing an insectary capable of supporting mosquitoes imported from abroad for mosquito-bite CHMI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Following review by the KEMRI Kilifi Centre Scientific Committee (CSC) and the KEMRI Centre for Clinical Research CSC, the study was reviewed by the national KEMRI Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and then later approved by the KEMRI Ethics Review Committee (ERC). The ERC requested additional information regarding access to intensive care facilities, the rationale for the proposed amount of monetary compensation (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Consent</xref>) and a clear description of how the target population of educated adults would be approached. Final ethical approval to conduct the study was received six months after initial submission to the CSC.</p><p>The University of Oxford requires ethical approval from the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC) for all clinical trials it sponsors overseas. Prior to approval, OXTREC requested justification for the proposed amount of monetary compensation, clarification on consent processes for long-term storage of samples and subsequent assays on these samples and assurances regarding the sensitivity of PfSPZ Challenge to the proposed anti-malarial therapy. Ethics approval from OXTREC took two months from initial submission.</p><p>Prior to regulatory approval, the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board requested assurances as to how PfSPZ Challenge would be transported and stored at -140&#x000b0;C. Regulatory approval took three weeks from initial submission. An import permit was granted for PfSPZ Challenge and the two required diluents for injection (25% human albumin solution and phosphate buffered saline), which were imported from the USA. A test shipment labelled as PfSPZ Challenge and diluents passed through Customs with no delays. PfSPZ Challenge is subject to an Investigational New Drug Application filed with the FDA and sponsored by its manufacturer, Sanaria Inc. In this capacity the FDA reviewed and approved the study.</p><p>Just prior to the start of screening, the international CHMI community was made aware of a second cardiac serious AE occurring in a mosquito-bite CHMI study assessing a malaria vaccine at Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The study protocol and consent form was updated to reflect this new information and add an electrocardiogram (ECG) to the investigations performed on all individuals undergoing screening. Approval was sought for these amendments from the relevant ethical and regulatory authorities. All approvals were obtained within 37 days of the applications, allowing the study to go ahead according to the original timelines.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All bodies were supportive of the study and recognized its importance. The initial multistage approval process did take a considerable time but ensured the study was rigorously reviewed. Given that the dates of the CHMI aspect of study were required to be set well in advance (see <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Study design</xref>), the swift approval of the substantial amendment was extremely important as it allowed the study to proceed on schedule with appropriate updated information for volunteers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Community sensitization</title><p>All community sensitization occurred following approval of the study and at a local, rather than national level. Therefore, feedback gained from the community will be used to inform the design of future CHMI studies. Given the novel and complex study nature of the study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] community sensitization focused on local medical schools as it was felt this population were most likely to have some existing understanding of the concept of research. Letters were sent to the heads of the three main medical schools in Nairobi, requesting permission to present the study to staff and students. This occurred at three meetings which took place approximately six weeks before the start of screening, and took the form of a formal presentation by the Principal Investigator on the background and purpose of CHMI studies, followed by details of the planned study. Approximately 200 individuals in total attended these meetings. The list of questions raised at the meetings and the reasons attendees gave to participate or not in the study are shown below. About half of individuals at the meetings said they would consider participating in the study. Posters advertising the trial were placed at the medical schools and interested individuals were asked to contact the study team to attend an individual information meeting and receive the volunteer information sheet (VIS; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Prior to obtaining written consent, all volunteers were required to undertake a written questionnaire to assess their understanding of the study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Volunteers were required to answer all questions correctly before being allowed to consent to the study and were only allowed to attempt the questionnaire a maximum of three times. After each attempt, the participant was allowed to ask for clarification of any points from the study investigator. Of the 146 screened volunteers, 100% required at least two attempts and 55% required three attempts to correctly answer all questions on the questionnaire.

Key concerns volunteers were anticipated to raise were similar to those discussed in screening appointments, namely: concern that the trial was &#x02018;high risk&#x02019;, the volume of blood taken and the need for an extended in-patient stay (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

Data were collected at screening regarding volunteers&#x02019; place of birth, location of schooling and higher education and time spent in Nairobi directly prior to screening.

Firstly, in the target, educated population, most had attended boarding schools and higher education institutions at multiple locations, considerable distances from their place of birth, making it extremely difficult to quantify time spent in malaria-endemic regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3 and S4). Secondly, using CDC data on malaria endemicity (&#x0201c;<italic>P. falciparum</italic>&#x02026; present in all areas (including game parks) (of Kenya) at altitudes below 2,500 m (8,202ft) with none in the highly urbanized, central part of the city of Nairobi&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], nearly all volunteers had spent significant time in a malaria-endemic region (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3 and S4). Although information on volunteers&#x02019; reported history of episodes of blood smear-confirmed malaria infections was collected, it was impossible to validate these reports, since many individuals had taken anti-malarial medications for presumed malaria infection unconfirmed by blood smear and it was difficult to access medical records retrospectively.</p><p>On review, it was felt serological data were the most objective measure to assess prior exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Given that anti-schizont OD results reflect reactogenicity to multiple antigens in parallel, it was decided to use this assay as the primary serological endpoint. Individuals were, therefore, redefined into those with evidence of minimal prior exposure (MinExp: Groups 1, 3 and 5) and those with definite evidence of prior exposure (DefExp: Groups 2, 4 and 6) on the basis of serological data alone (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

Administration of a course of curative anti-malarials to all enrolled volunteers prior to CHMI was considered, however, there were concerns that even a medication with a reported short half-life could impact on PfSPZ Challenge infectivity or PGD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Instead, all volunteers qPCR-positive for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at screening were excluded (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Seven volunteers (5%) were excluded using this criterion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

These seven volunteers were treated with a course of anti-malarial therapy according to national guidelines and excluded from the study. Whilst it is unclear when these individuals were infected with malaria, they may have been semi-immune volunteers capable of controlling parasitaemia; indeed 4/7 (57%) met the criteria for DefExp.

Grouping volunteers according to prior exposure to malaria, and therefore NAI was extremely difficult given the lack of a validated assay and recognized methods to grade malaria exposure on the basis of geographical data. This was compounded by the highly migratory nature of the screened population and high degree of undiagnosed co-morbidities. If future Kenyan CHMI studies seek to enrol &#x02018;hyperimmune&#x02019; adults, it will be important to either screen a considerably larger sample of individuals, do more targeted screening or move the study site to an endemic region. Whilst prescreening of volunteers to create a database of appropriate individuals in advance of a CHMI study could be useful logistically, given the unknown dynamics of the loss of NAI, such volunteers would require rescreening ahead of enrolment to ensure accurate, timely data immediately prior to CHMI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study design</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Dose of PfSPZ challenge</title><p>Limited evidence existed at the time of study design to guide the choice of dose and route of administration of PfSPZ Challenge for this study.

Published clinical data at the time of the study design showed IM administration of PfSPZ Challenge to be the only route proven to infect 100% of volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the maximum dose used in this study (25,000 PfSPZ) resulted in a notably lower liver-to-blood-inoculum (LBI) than that seen in traditional mosquito-bite CHMI studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In order to ensure infection and detectable parasitaemia post-CHMI, a higher dose of 125,000 PfSPZ IM was chosen for the main study cohort (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). Since this would be the largest dose of PfSPZ Challenge administered IM to humans at the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], two additional, small, lead-in cohorts receiving lower doses of 25,000 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and 75,000 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) PfSPZ IM were included in the study design.</p><p>Reassuringly, a similar safety profile to that reported in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve subjects who underwent CHMI was seen, with the exception that Kenyan participants experienced AEs of a notably longer duration than malaria-na&#x000ef;ve volunteers, the reason for which is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Schedule of enrolment</title><p>In order to minimize vials of PfSPZ Challenge used and ensure standardization with other PFSPZ Challenge studies, staff from Sanaria Inc USA prepared and dispensed syringes of PfSPZ Challenge, which were required to be administered within 30 minutes of thawing of PfSPZ Challenge. For logistical reasons it was decided all volunteers would undergo CHMI in the same week. Given a safety review by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) was required prior to each dose escalation of PfSPZ Challenge, safety data had to be compiled in real-time and SMC members briefed in advance to allow a strict schedule of reviews prior to approval of each dose escalation to be met (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).

Given the need to prioritize volunteer safety in this pilot study, the fact that considerable traffic congestion in Nairobi could seriously impede volunteers&#x02019; ability to attend the medical centre in a timely fashion and the lack of ease of access to public health care, it was decided that volunteers would be managed as in-patients from the day before injection of PfSPZ Challenge until completion of anti-malarial therapy. The need for in-patient care was emphasized to participants at screening and again prior to enrolment. Clear protocols were established and explained to both staff and participants regarding the actions to be taken if a participant were to go missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants were encouraged to voice any concerns they had about their living conditions, treatment or change in personal circumstances early so that issues could be addressed quickly and anti-malarial treatment initiated in a timely fashion if a volunteer wished to withdraw from the study and leave the in-patient clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Duration of follow-up post CHMI</title><p>As the first pilot study in Kenya, a follow-up schedule similar to European centres was adopted, with all undiagnosed participants treated at C+21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One participant (110) who had an anti-schizont ELISA OD at screening similar to hyperimmune individuals was qPCR-positive but blood film-negative (and therefore undiagnosed) on C+21 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It would be extremely interesting to examine the PGD of this, and other hyperimmune individuals if a longer window of follow-up prior to treatment of undiagnosed participants were adopted. One benefit could be the ability to track the development of gametocytaemia. In this study, no qPCR specific for gametocytes was performed, and so it is possible that the rise in qPCR seen in participant 110 from C+19 onwards reflected gametocytaemia rather than loss of control of the blood stage of infection. In future studies, if qPCR specific for gametocytes were performed and a phenotype of individuals identified that were able to control blood-stage infection, remain asymptomatic but develop gametocytes, this could allow for the development of a much needed clinical model to assess the efficacy of novel transmission-blocking vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>qPCR results post-challenge for Volunteer 110, Group 2.

It was particularly important in this study to emphasize to the microscopists, who were used to working in a clinical, field setting, the importance of avoiding false positive results.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Support from established CHMI centres and detailed advanced training was essential for the first Kenyan CHMI study to take place safely and efficiently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Feedback</title><p>On discharge, all participants were asked to complete an exit questionnaire providing feedback on their experience participating in the study. Nineteen of 28 (68%) participants returned the anonymized questionnaire. Results were positive (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8) with participants reporting good understanding of the study and discharge procedures.</p><p>A written final report will be submitted to the ethical and regulatory bodies that approved the study and the results of the study presented to university managers, local students and interested study participants when all analyses of study related data is completed.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whilst this first pilot study in Kenya, it is the start of an iterative process, which will be informed by these experiences and feedback from volunteers, ethics and regulatory bodies and collaborators. In particular, the VIS will be revised to include more detailed information regarding the issues raised by volunteers. It will also be crucial to feedback findings of the study to the key stakeholders in order to help maintain a working relationship for future CHMI studies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is a current need to increase the international capacity for efficacy testing of candidate malaria vaccines and allow earlier assessment of novel vaccines and drugs in the target African populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The establishment of the CHMI model in African centres is one key strategy that could help address these aims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study has shown that sporozoite CHMI studies using PfSPZ Challenge can be safely performed in Kenya in individuals with varying degrees of prior exposure to malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, performing CHMI studies in an African setting presents unique but surmountable challenges. As the first pilot study performed in Kenya, there were many learning points, most unique to the African setting and this paper provides key feedback to aid other African sites wishing to establish the CHMI model. In addition, there remain key scientific questions about PfSPZ Challenge, such as whether protection as assessed by DVI is comparable to or correlated with protection assessed by mosquito bite CHMI or natural transmission, both of which lead to deposition of a portion of the parasites in the skin. Given the CHMI model has been shown to be safe and feasible in Kenya, there is hope the international CHMI and malaria vaccine community will continue to support the Kenyan site and others to allow on-going collaborative frameworks to help address these questions, and to accelerate the development of candidate malaria vaccines in malaria-endemic populations.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2015_671_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
