Being the largest cause of bilateral blindness, second only to cataract; glaucoma is a major public health problem.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Prevalence of blindness in India, according to National Survey on Blindness 2001&#x02013;2002, is 1.1%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Leading cause of blindness in India is cataract accounting for 62.6%, whereas glaucoma accounts for 5.8%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Worldwide, it is estimated that about 66 million people have visual impairment from glaucoma, with 6.7 million suffering from blindness due to it.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] From 2010 to 2020, the most detectable change in glaucoma worldwide would be, its increase in India. The largest absolute number of glaucoma cases have been reported in China, followed by Europe and India.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a subset of the glaucomas defined by raised intraocular pressure (IOP) consistently above 21 mm Hg in at least one eye with typical glaucomatous visual field and/or optic nerve head damage and an open, normal appearing anterior chamber angle with no other underlying disease.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ocular hypertensives are defined as a subset of patients with open angles, raised IOP but neither optic nerve head nor visual field changes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Studies provide strong evidence that high IOP plays an important role in the neuropathy of POAG. It has been demonstrated that the reduction in the level of IOP lessens the risk of visual field progression in open-angle glaucoma.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Treatment strategies of glaucoma aim at lowering IOP, which helps to prevent optic nerve damage and glaucoma-related blindness. An even a single unit lowering of IOP has been associated with significant clinical improvements.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Pharmacotherapy is usually the first line of treatment for elevated IOP and open-angle glaucoma. Major drug classes for medical treatment of POAG include alpha-agonists (brimonidine), beta-blockers (timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol), topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide, brinzolamide), oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide), miotic agents (pilocarpine), prostaglandin (PG) analogs (travoprost, latanoprost), prostamides (bimatoprost), and sympathomimetic drugs (epinephrine, dipivefrine). PG analogs lower IOP by increasing the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] They are effective in reducing IOP and have the additional advantage of requiring only once a day administration. Bimatoprost, a synthetic prostamide analog, used as a 0.03% topical preparation once daily is efficacious in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension (OHT) and other forms of glaucoma.</p><p>Brimonidine, a selective alpha-2-agonist, available as 0.2% ophthalmic solution to be administered twice daily, causes a suppressed aqueous humor production. With IOP lowering efficacy comparable to &#x003b2;-blockers, brimonidine confers neuroprotection in glaucoma by stimulating an ongoing neuronal survival pathway.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It is used as one of the first-line therapies in patients who have contraindications to &#x003b2;-blockers.</p><p>The ophthalmologists have a wide range of choices for management of glaucoma, in terms of cost, efficacy, and adverse effects. There is an increased demand from society and health care payers that clinical medicine in particular when aimed at treatment of chronic life-long disease should justify its cost. Taking into consideration, the broadening gap between therapeutic possibilities and resources available, the choices have to be made by prioritizing (rationing) all treatment strategies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Economic evaluation of glaucoma therapy needs to be targeted at assessment of efficiency, that is, health effects weighed against the sacrifices or costs incurred for attaining them.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Therapeutic decisions for glaucoma therapy should be taken with due consideration of cost of drug along with efficacy and safety. It is no longer enough that an intervention is clinically effective; it needs to be cost-effective as well if we are to make the most of our finite resources. Contemplating the importance of cost-effectiveness, the idea of our study is to update the ophthalmologists&#x02019; knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness along with daily and yearly cost of treating glaucoma with bimatoprost, an effective prostamide and brimonidine, an alpha-2-agonist.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this open, randomized, cross-over, comparative study, 40 subjects of POAG or OHT attending the outpatient Department of Ophthalmology, were included after obtaining written informed consent.

The yearly costs for the drugs per eye were Rs. 1467.46 &#x000b1; 20.74 and 1147.75 &#x000b1; 11.15 for bimatoprost and brimonidine, respectively.

The ICER was calculated as 10.43 which means extra Rs. 10.43 were required for each additional mm Hg IOP reduction given by bimatoprost for 4 weeks as compared with brimonidine. Selecting brimonidine, the less costly alternative, implies a willingness to pay Rs. 13.96/mm Hg (CER of brimonidine). An additional IOP reduction obtained with bimatoprost costs Rs. 10.43, which is below willingness to pay the amount for brimonidine. Therefore, on the basis of its incremental CER, bimatoprost could be considered a cost-effective strategy as compared with brimonidine.</p><p>The adverse drug reactions reported by the patients were as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.

Hypotensive lipids (PG analogues/prostamides) have high efficacy, a favorable safety profile, ease of once daily regimen and are often reasonable on a cost per day basis. They have thus fast become a favorite among both physicians and patients despite their higher costs. Bimatoprost has been shown to be most cost-effective among PG analogues.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Alpha-agonists like brimonidine are available at lower maximum retail price (MRP's) than PG analogs and are being studied for additional advantages of neuroprotection.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Bimatoprost and brimonidine, both are commonly prescribed drugs in glaucoma, each with its own advantages. As the treatment is life-long, studies have been done to compare the efficacy and cost of various anti-glaucoma drugs previously. In our study, the efficacy of drugs as shown by IOP lowering of 8.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 (34.10%) and 6.55 &#x000b1; 1.26 (25.19%), respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine was comparable to studies by Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., 2003 and Whitcup <italic>et al</italic>., 2003 which showed IOP lowering 8 (32.4%) and 6 &#x000b1; 3.3 (21%) for bimatoprost and brimonidine, respectively.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Several ways have been to devised by the drug manufacturers to minimize the wastage of eye drops, like overfilling of the bottles, bottle design, medication dispensing mechanisms and administration techniques. Hence, a lot of preparations may be cheaper, but due to large drop size, they may end up being less cost-effective. The dispensing angles, and viscosity of the medication are the other factors that may influence drop size.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The MRP of an anti-glaucoma agent is just one of the multitudes of factors to consider when choosing a medication for a patient. The products with higher actual volume, smaller drop size; hence, the larger number of drops/ml may in reality cost less. In the present study, the average number of drops/ml was 33.43 &#x000b1; 0.52 for bimatoprost (Lumigan) and 25.49 &#x000b1; 0.26 for brimonidine (Alphagan) whereas, in study by Rylander an Vold, 2008 these were, respectively, 32.27 &#x000b1; 0.45 and 24.83 &#x000b1; 1.57.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The daily costs in the present study, Rs. 4.02 &#x000b1; 0.06 and Rs. 3.14 &#x000b1; 0.03, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine were comparable with the cost analysis studies by Fiscella <italic>et al</italic>., 1999 and Fiscella <italic>et al</italic>., 2003; which showed daily costs to be $0.95 and $0.90 for bimatoprost and brimonidine, respectively.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Thus, bimatoprost showed higher daily costs in all these studies. But, cost analysis alone is not a complete economic analysis as the treatment with higher costs may be more efficacious too. On the other hand, a comparatively cheaper therapy may have the disadvantage of lower efficacy and higher adverse effects.</p><p>The CER for both drugs in the present study was calculated for the study period of 4 weeks and cost/mm Hg lowering found to be Rs. 13.10 &#x000b1; 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 &#x000b1; 2.86/mm Hg for bimatoprost and brimonidine, respectively. Thus in the present study, bimatoprost, in spite of being costlier had a more favorable CER. Another study showing comparison of cost-effectiveness of bimatoprost and brimonidine by Galindo-Ferreiro <italic>et al</italic>. too shows similar results placing bimatoprost at a superior position to brimonidine with respect to CER, with CER being 9.1 for bimatoprost and 9.6 for brimonidine.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The gross difference in numerical values of CER in both of above studies is due to variability in monetary units, MRP's and cost of patient visits in different countries.</p><p>In the present study, ICER of bimatoprost was Rs. 10.43/mm Hg which is lower than cost/mm Hg reduction incurred by using brimonidine Rs. 13.96 &#x000b1; 2.86/mm Hg). Selecting brimonidine, the less costly alternative, implies &#x0201c;willingness to pay&#x0201d; Rs. 13.96 &#x000b1; 2.86/mm Hg lowering of IOP. An additional reduction in IOP obtained with bimatoprost costs Rs. 10.43/mm Hg which is less than the &#x0201c;willingness to pay&#x0201d; amount for brimonidine. Therefore, on the basis of ICER, using bimatoprast over the brimonidine would be considered a cost-effective strategy.</p><p>We have compared cost-effectiveness of bimatoprost 0.03% (Lumigan, Allergan) and brimonidine 0.2% (Alphagan, Allergan). The findings of the study thus may not be generalized to other brands and concentrations of these drugs. Similar studies could be carried out to prioritize the anti-glaucoma therapy based on cost-effectiveness analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bimatoprost and brimonidine are efficacious drugs in the treatment of POAG/OHT, but in spite of daily costs being higher, bimatoprost is a better choice than brimonidine because of:</p><p>

</p><p>Physicians consider many factors when prescribing patients with glaucoma.

The deciding criterion should be cost-effectiveness of treatment strategy rather than efficacy or cost alone.
