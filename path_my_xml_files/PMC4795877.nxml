A search of the literature found no study that compared human milk with chlorhexidine solution. We decided to compare the impact of two regimens of cord care, topical use of human milk and chlorhexidine solution on the cord separation time in newborns of hospitals of Kashan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In a clinical trial, 174 neonates (87 neonates in each group) well-babies were enrolled from hospitals affiliated to Kashan University of Medical Sciences in Kashan city, Central Iran that is located in Isfahan Province. Inclusion criteria for the study were: Newborns with gestational age 42-37 weeks; Apgar score higher than 7 at minute 1and 5; rupture of membranes for no longer than 12 hour. criteria for exclusion were: Infants with perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress, metabolic disease, and any other problems that requiring immediate refer to neonatal Intensive Care Unit immediate; Infants with immediate need of evaluation and treatment; Newborns with any congenital disorder or disease; Infants of mothers with postpartum fever, mastitis, Urogenital infection; If the mother does not live in the city of Kashan [live in Rural). The umbilical cord of all the newborns was cut in sterile condition in the delivery room and no antiseptic agent was used on the stump. All the neonates were born in baby-friendly hospitals with rooming-in in one hundred percent of the cases and all the mothers had complete vaccination against tetanus.</p><p>The infants were randomly assigned into two groups of cord care regimens: Group 1 received topical application of human milk to the umbilical stump from three hours after birth every 12 hours (2 times a day) to 2 days after the umbilical cord separation. Group 2 receive chlorhexidine solution, by a sterile gauze or swab, to the umbilical stump from three hours after birth and continued every 12 hours until two days after umbilical cord separation. All infants born from 12:00 AM Saturday to 11:59 PM Friday of the first week were randomly selected to the chlorhexidine group, then the next week&#x02019;s group to breast milk. The weekly selection was based on avoiding connection among mothers, because there is no possibility of separating the mothers to place restrictions in two groups.</p><p>All mothers received information on the importance of umbilical cord care and signs of its infection during a session for three hours after birth. In this research we used chlorhexidine solution 4% (Hydrex, Ecolab Co, Germany). In order to make sure of the presence of the microorganisms, cultures of the cord stump were collected using sterile swabs within the first three hours after birth. Samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis by the microbiologist. Mothers in two group received forms to record the exact time of mothers&#x02019; milk or chlorhexidine application during the day. Moreover, the mothers in both groups were asked to daily record infection signs of the cord stump in special forms. signs of local infection Including: discharge, redness, inflammation, and swelling of the umbilical cord. All mothers were asked to continue completing the forms until two days after the cord separation. Follow-up on mothers by telephone calls and during visit at home was done. In order to make sure the presence of the infection, researchers visited umbilical cord within the first three hours after birth at hospital and days 3, 7 and 2 days after umbilical cord separation at home and in cases of delay in cord separation or any cord related adverse events such as blood leakage, mucoid discharge or granuloma formation, the newborn was immediately visited by neonatologist.</p><p>SPSS software (version11.5) was employed to analyze the data. Differences in means were analyzed using independent sample t-test. Chi-square test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was also applied to nominal variables. P-value of less than 0.05 was regarded to be significant.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the local research council in Kashan University of Medical Sciences. All women were free to participate and they were assured of confidentiality of their personal information, also this study was approved by the research ethic committee in Kashan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Initially, 174 neonates were studied during 2010-2012. After follow up, 5 neonates in the chlorhexidin group and 7 neonates in the mother&#x02019;s milk group were excluded due to several reasons such as respiratory distress, using other agents on the cord stump and non-compliance of the families, and finally the data from 162 newborns was analyzed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref> shows the loss of samples.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Flow Chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PJMS-32-239-g001"/></fig><p>Demographic and perinatal characteristics of the neonates in the two groups of mother&#x02019;s milk and topical chlorhexidine solution are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table-I</xref>. These characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups except for the duration of membrane rupture.

Since the main consequence of prolonged rupture of membrane is infection, and the first culture of the cord stump taken within the first three hours after birth showed no significant difference between the groups, it seems unlikely that this factor has a significant effect on the study results.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table-I</label><caption><p>Absolute and relative frequency distribution of demographic and perinatal characteristics in Chlorhexidine and mother&#x02019;s milk groups.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic and Perinatal characteristics</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chlorhexidine group N=82 No. (Percentage)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mother&#x02019;s milk group N=80 No. (Percentage)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Maternal age, y</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15-24</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27(32.9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19(23.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P=0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25-29</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29(35.4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31(38.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30-34</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16(19.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17(21.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35&#x0003e;-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10(12.2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13(16.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1;

In addition, the longest time of cord separation was 53 days in chlorhexidine group and 14 days in mother&#x02019;s milk group. So far there have been no studies on the effect of topical application of human milk and chlorhexidin on umbilical cord stump separation time. Mullany et al (2005) investigated the effect of topical chlorhexidine treatment on cord separation in neonates of south Nepal and found that mean time to cord separation is significantly longer in chlorhexidine use (5.35 days) in comparison to dry cord care (4.24 days) and the possibility of cord separation after day 7 was 3.6 times higher in the chlorhexidine group.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Study of Ahmadpoor, et al. showed the mean cord separation time in the human milk group was significantly shorter than alcohol, silver sulfadiazine, and dry cord care groups (P=0.001).<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Study of Gulsen Vural and Sezer Kisa showed babies in the topical human milk group had shorter cord separation times(7.0&#x000b1;2.0day) than those in the povidone-iodine, cord separation occurred at a mean of 9.9&#x000b1;3.3 days.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, Azza A, in his study reported that, Umbilical cord separation time occurred early for neonates in the breast milk group Vs neonates in the distilled water group (5.60 + 1.04 &#x00026; 7.92 + 1.08 days, respectively). (P&#x0003c; 0.001).<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Moreover, Zupan et al concluded that caring the umbilical cord with antiseptics can lead to delayed cord separation and natural dry care is as effective and safe as application of antibiotics and antiseptics.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It seems that using antiseptics is associated with longer cord separation time.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In addition, a significant correlation was not found between signs of infection (discharge, redness and swelling) in both groups. No cases of granuloma formation and sepsis were found in the present study and none of the neonates needed to be hospitalized. In other words, mother milk can be effective as chlorhexidine (broad-spectrum antibiotics) in reducing signs of infection of cord. This result is matched with study by Ahmadpour-Kacho et al.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Use of topical application of human milk on umbilical cord care was associated with shorter cord stump separation time than in topical chlorhexidin. Breast milk also reduced incidence of of infection, as much as topical chlorhexidin. Generally human milk is always available and it can be used as an easy, cheap and non invasive way for the cord care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We would like to thank the Research Deputy of Kashan University of Medical Sciences for their cooperation as well as all participants who made this study possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold><italic>IRCT ID:</italic></bold> IRCT201010285038N1.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold><italic>Declaration of interest:</italic></bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="sec1-6"><title/><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contribution</title><p><bold>FA,</bold> designed the study, statistical analysis, supervised the stud, collected the data and manuscript writing.</p><p><bold>ZH</bold> was involved in study design, and data collection.</p><p><bold>MJ,</bold> participated in treatment the newborn.
