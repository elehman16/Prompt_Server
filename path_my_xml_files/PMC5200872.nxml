Their data support our findings that the efficacy of RPZ to improve QOL was higher in the twice-daily 10 mg PPI than that in once-daily 20 mg PPI dosage, although actual efficacy on refractory GERD symptoms was not different between the 2 groups. Approximately half of patients achieved symptom relief, defined as a GOS scale score of 1 (no problem) or 2 (minimal problem); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. In addition, the changes in sGOS scores in double-dose PPI treatment for 8 weeks were similar between the 2 groups. In both groups, the symptoms as measured by sGOS score after 1 week of double-dose treatment were significantly decreased. Fujiwara et al<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> reported that more than half of all Japanese patients with GERD experience sleep disturbances for which PPI treatment was effective. This study demonstrates that many patients with PPI-refractory GERD experience sleep disturbances. The same researchers reported a significant positive correlation between frequency scale for symptoms of GERD and PSQI scores<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>; however, the present study showed no correlation between GOS scores and PSQI scores. Another scale; for example, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, would be needed to evaluate the sleep disturbances in patients with PPI-refractory GERD in future studies.</p><p>Assessment of QOL facilitates the translation and interpretation of clinical improvements into outcomes that are important and meaningful to patients and physicians. For the purpose of monitoring QOL during treatment as well as in the context of comparing the effectiveness of different therapies, health outcomes, and QOL represent useful tools for evaluating the efficacy of the care provided.</p><p>Hongo et al<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> reported that QOL in Japanese patients with GERD is significantly decreased, compared with those of healthy individuals in Western countries. In the study, patients with GERD showed low PCS and MCS scores of 44.6 and 46.8, respectively.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In the present study, mean (SD) PCS scores in patients with refractory GERD were worse than their MCS scores (42.9 [7.8] vs 45.5 [8.1]), but the difference was not statistically significant. These data suggest that patients with PPI-refractory GERD were more distressed than patients with GERD. After 8 weeks of treatment with double-dose RPZ, symptom relief was observed in approximately 50% of patients, but SF-8 scores were not improved to the level of the general Japanese population (ie, &#x0003e;50). Only PCS scores among patients in the 10 mg BID group were significantly increased compared with baseline. Consequently, we concluded that 10 mg RPZ taken twice daily might be more effective for the improvement of QOL in patients with PPI-refractory GERD.</p><p>We also investigated whether double-dose RPZ for 8 weeks can prevent recurrence of severe acid reflux symptoms. In the present study, the recurrence rate was 14 out of 30 (46.7%). Approximately half of patients with PPI-refractory GERD experienced recurrent symptoms after treatment. Although double-dose PPI was effective against symptoms of PPI-refractory GERD, the treatment could not prevent any recurrences. For patients who experience recurrent symptoms, we might have to continue double-dose PPI or stronger acid-suppressive agents for better symptom control. Hsu et al<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> reported that 8 weeks of PPI therapy decreases the relapse of symptoms, compared with 8 weeks of therapy, among patients with Los Angeles grade A or B erosive esophagitis. The cumulative 12-week incidence of symptom relapse was higher for the 4-week group than for the 8-week group (62.5% vs 47.8%).</p><p>Several limitations to the present study warrant mention. A definitive conclusion could not be drawn because of the limited number of patients. In addition, we did not perform a pH-monitoring study or endoscopy to confirm healing of reflux esophagitis. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first randomized controlled trial to comprehensively evaluate the acid reflux symptoms, sleep disturbances, and general distress of Japanese patients with PPI-refractory GERD.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with refractory GERD, there was no significant difference in GOS scale score, PSQI, or recurrence rate between 10 mg RPZ twice-daily and 20 mg RPZ once-daily groups.
