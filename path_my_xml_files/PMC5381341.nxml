Studies in mice have suggested beneficial effects of selenium (Se) supplementation on immunity to flu but similar evidence is lacking in humans. A dietary intervention study was therefore designed to test the effects of Se-supplementation on a variety of parameters of anti-flu immunity in healthy subjects aged 50&#x02013;64 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 12-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT00279812" id="intref0015">NCT00279812</ext-link>) was undertaken in six groups of individuals with plasma Se levels &#x0003c;110&#x000a0;ng/mL. Four groups were given daily capsules of yeast enriched with 0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/day (SeY-0/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20), 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d (SeY-50/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18), 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d (SeY-100/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) or 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d (SeY-200/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23). Two groups were given onion-containing meals with either &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d (SeO-0/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) or 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d (SeO-50/d; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18). Flu vaccine was administrated at week 10 and immune parameters were assessed until week 12.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Primary study endpoints were changes in cellular and humoral immune responses. Supplementation with SeY and SeO affected different aspects of cellular immunity. SeY increased Tctx-ADCC cell counts in blood (214%, SeY-100/d) before flu vaccination and a dose-dependent increase in T cell proliferation (500%, SeY-50/100/200/d), IL-8 (169%, SeY-100/d) and IL-10 (317%, SeY-200/d) secretion after <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> flu challenge. Positive effects were contrasted by lower granzyme B content of&#x000a0;CD8 cells (55%, SeY-200/d). SeO (Se 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/d) also enhanced T cell proliferation after vaccination (650%), IFN-&#x003b3; (289%), and IL-8 secretion (139%), granzyme (209%) and perforin (190%) content of&#x000a0;CD8 cells but inhibited TNF-&#x003b1; synthesis (42%). Onion on its own reduced the number of NKT cells&#x000a0;in blood (38%). These effects were determined by comparison to group-specific baseline yeast&#x000a0;or onion control groups. Mucosal flu-specific antibody responses were unaffected by Se-supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Se-supplementation in healthy human adults with marginal Se status resulted in both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity to flu that was affected by the form of Se, supplemental dose and delivery matrix. These observations call for a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits associated with Se-supplementation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Selenium</kwd><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Food supplements</kwd><kwd>Cellular immunity</kwd><kwd>Humoral immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>APC, allophycocyanin</kwd><kwd>ECD, energy coupled dye</kwd><kwd>flu, influenza</kwd><kwd>IFN-&#x003b3;, interferon gamma</kwd><kwd>Ig, immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>IL, interleukin</kwd><kwd>LAK, lymphokine activated killer</kwd><kwd>LGL, large granular lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>MNC, mononuclear cells</kwd><kwd>NK, natural killer</kwd><kwd>Se, selenium</kwd><kwd>SeMet, selenomethionine</kwd><kwd>SeMSC, &#x003b3;-glutamyl-methylselenocysteine</kwd><kwd>SeY, selenium-yeast</kwd><kwd>SeO, selenium-onion</kwd><kwd>TNF-&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor alpha</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Selenium status is known to influence ability of the immune system to respond to infections <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Evidence for the importance of adequate Se intakes is provided by the impact that Se deficiency has on the immune system, reportedly reducing proliferation of T cells <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, lymphocyte-mediated toxicity and NK cell activity <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, all of which are important for antiviral immunity. While the mechanisms by which Se exerts its antiviral effects are unknown, Se/selenoproteins regulate cellular redox balance and it is known that the establishment and progression of viral infections are influenced by the redox state of the host cell <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Dietary Se is mainly present in organic complexes, such as selenomethionine (SeMet) found in meat, cereals and plant foods, and Se-methylselenocysteine (SeMSC) in Se-accumulator plants such as onions and brassica vegetables, with smaller quantities of inorganic Se derived from dietary supplements. One of the proposed consequences of marginal Se status is impaired immune function. With regard to anti-viral response the benefits of higher Se intake have been demonstrated solely in the recall responses to polio virus vaccination of healthy volunteers with marginal selenium status <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This prompted us to evaluate the effects of Se supplementation on a set of immunological parameters that pertain to both cellular and humoral immunity to a different type of virus, such as the influenza (flu) virus. The reason for this investigation is twofold. First, the polio virus is an enteric pathogen and does not undergo the rapid antigenic drifts seen in flu virus; as such, the benefits in recall responses to attenuated polio vaccination cannot therefore be extrapolated to flu virus infections. Secondly, flu infection has very high socio-economic cost worldwide <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and to identify food supplements with the ability to potentiate immunity in at risk populations, such as the elderly and chronically ill may have an important impact on overstretched healthcare systems worldwide. Indeed, in annual flu epidemics 5&#x02013;15% of the population is affected with upper respiratory tract infections that result in three to five million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths every year around the world <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The aims of this study were to measure both cellular and humoral immune responses to flu vaccine in healthy older (50&#x02013;64 years) individuals with marginal Se status after Se supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in adults aged 50&#x02013;64 years with suboptimal Se status (plasma Se&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;110&#x000a0;ng/mL), to determine the effects of Se supplementation on immune responses to flu vaccine. The study was approved by the Norfolk Research Ethics Committee (ref 05/Q0101/32) and registered as a clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0020">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>

Volunteers were excluded if they had abnormal hematology, blood chemistry, blood pressure measurements, or BMI &#x0003c;18.5 or &#x0003e;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. They had to be non-smokers, not on prescription medication for a chronic ailment or taking any immunosuppressive drugs, antacids or laxatives. Any dietary or herbal supplements being used had to be forfeited from at least one month prior to the start of the study and for its duration. People that had donated blood within 16 weeks of the first study sample and/or were due to do so less than 16 weeks after the last study sample were excluded. Neither immunizations during the study period nor antibiotic use from within four weeks prior to starting the study until the study end were permitted. Concurrent participation in another research project was discouraged. Anyone who needed more than 2 weeks' absence from the study were also excluded. Allergy to eggs or egg products, chicken protein, the antibiotic gentamicin or history of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome were also exclusion criteria.

This was done by the study statistician. Yeast supplements were supplied in coded form as either A, B, C, or D. The supplements were taken with a meal on a daily basis. Onions for the study meals were grown at the University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington, Leicestershire, UK. Their Se content was analyzed by inductively coupled mass spectroscopy. Study meals were also blinded in that the onions supplied by the University of Nottingham were labeled simply as white or yellow onions. Meals made with the yellow onions were designated group E and those made with white onion as group F. Meals were prepared to contain the right weight of onions to achieve 117&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/meal and three meals were consumed per week by each participant in group E or F as an average of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Se/d.

However, under similar culture conditions, both yeast and onion Se-supplemented groups had significantly higher T cell proliferation following flu vaccination with peak proliferation occurring at week 11 (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In order to visualize any Se dose effects on T cell proliferation above those induced by flu vaccination, linear or polynomial trend lines were constructed for data derived from the SeY groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). It was not possible to construct similar curves for the SeO groups as only one dose of Se was used. These clearly show a trend towards higher proliferation within the SeY-100 group at week 11 than that of SeY-50 or SeY-200 groups. These data demonstrate that the ability of Se to enhance T cell recall responses to flu is influenced by the supplemental dose.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Se supplementation and delivery matrix affect blood cytolytic cells</title><p>Initially we monitored the effects of Se intake on whole blood absolute counts of a variety of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) subsets (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Numbers of NKT cells at baseline did not differ between yeast and onion study groups, but at week 10 the SeO-0/d unsupplemented onion group had significantly fewer NKT cells/&#x003bc;L blood than at baseline (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). Immunization with flu vaccine had no influence on this matrix effect. At the same time period, before flu vaccination there were higher numbers of Tctx-ADCC cells/&#x003bc;L blood in the SeY-100/d group. Supplementation with Se, irrespective of its form and supplemental dose, did not have any effect on the number of any of the additional cytotoxic cell subsets included in our investigation.

This effect can be considered to be due to Se-supplemental dose since it was observed before flu vaccination and apparent only at a supplemental dose of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day.

In contrast, CD8 cells from the SeO-50/d group had significantly more granzyme B at week 12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A) and more perforin at week 11 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B) than the control group. Taken together, these data suggest that beneficial or detrimental effects on the production of cytolytic enzymes, which are important effector molecules involved in anti-viral defense, depends on dosage and form of Se intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>The dose and form of Se intake affect cytokine secretion <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic></title><p>Cytokine secretion patterns are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>.

Their baseline plasma Se levels between 92 and 98&#x000a0;ng/mL were deemed to reflect marginal Se status despite being within stated normal range because plasma Se concentration is subject to large effects of dietary Se species. Therefore, it cannot be considered a direct marker of the functional Se body pool. Instead, the level of selenoprotein P is more informative as it is responsive to different forms of Se intake <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and the point at which it reaches a plateau in response to increasing doses of Se is considered indicative of an adequate supply of Se to all tissues <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Selenoprotein P levels reach saturation in plasma at a Se concentration of 120&#x000a0;ng/mL <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> which is higher than the plasma Se levels of any volunteer recruited onto our study. Details of the dose&#x02013;response relations for different forms of selenium with regard to plasma Se levels, platelet glutathione peroxidase activity and selenoprotein P status are described elsewhere <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The main findings of this work are that Se-supplementation may have both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity and that these effects are largely dependent on the form of Se and the supplemental dose. As Se up-regulates the expression of many cell cycle-related genes to promote cell proliferation <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, we tested proliferative responses to <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> challenge with flu antigens. While we examined total T cell proliferation, it is known that proliferative responses to flu vaccine are generally higher within CD4 than CD8 T cell subsets <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. At the pre-vaccination 10-week period Se supplementation did not enhance T cell proliferation above that seen in cultures stimulated at baseline. However, these responses were boosted through flu vaccination, with significantly higher T cell proliferation in the Se-Y/100/d group. As a possible explanation for the increase in cell proliferation at this particular dose of Se-yeast, in hepatocytes it has been shown that at this dose Se induces a greater amount of protein per cell and an increase in cellular GSSG-Rd (glutathione reductase) activity than 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/d Se-yeast. Se affects all &#x0201c;synthetic&#x0201d; stages of the cell cycle and elevated GSSG or the GSSG:GSH (oxidized:reduced glutathione) ratio may explain the anti-proliferative effects of higher doses of Se on cells <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These data nevertheless show that at certain supplemental doses, Se-yeast can enhance T cell proliferative responses to viral challenge.</p><p>The importance of using an appropriate Se dose was further highlighted by analysis of cytolytic enzymes. Following supplementation with Se-yeast at 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day, fewer granzyme<sup>+</sup> CD8 cells were noted only within this group suggesting that a higher supplemental dose may not be beneficial. Meanwhile, at a dose of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day Se-onion increased both granzyme and perforin content of CD8 cells. So, both dose and form of Se used in supplementation can have different effects. Since cytotoxic granule-mediated killing by CTL occurs within hours of target cell recognition <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and perforin up-regulation occurs within hours of activation <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, it is unlikely that this was an immediate consequence of loss or gain through cytolytic activity.</p><p>There is no doubt that Se plays an important role in nutritional sufficiency and immunological integrity and it has been found that although plasma Se levels remained relatively unchanged following a daily intake of Se-onion in meals <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, supplementation with Se-onion up-regulated the expression of several selenoprotein genes, including selenoprotein S <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> that is involved in several aspects of immune responses <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Importantly, the latter observation lent support for the relationship between Se status and immune function <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, our study signals caution when attributing changes in expression of selenoprotein genes with Se supplementation alone. Through adverse effects of onions alone on NKT cell numbers, it is possible that the matrix used for delivery of Se can somehow interfere with its immunoregulatory properties, either to enhance or otherwise. For example, the presence of phytochemicals in onions should be considered. These include organosulfur compounds, flavonoids and pigments that are believed to mediate effects through different modes of action <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Overall, onions have anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the proinflammatory cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, alongside inhibition of eicosanoid (e.g. prostaglandins) biosynthesis <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> thus affecting various immunological parameters. Inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; secretion by Se-onion could be a combined anti-inflammatory effect of onion plus Se. The flavonoids in onions also inhibit both cytosolic and membrane tyrosine kinases that are involved in a variety of functions including signal transduction <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While these effects of onions may give them their anti-cancer properties, they may have some unwanted effects on immune cells. With regard to yeast as a matrix for Se delivery, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the Pharma Nord products used in our study is a potential source of beta 1,3/1,6 glucans, which can prime the innate immune system. Our data do suggest that the matrix used for delivery of Se should be carefully selected. Furthermore, a lack of data on the effects of Se on Ab responses to flu virus in humans prompted us to assess both mucosal and systemic Ab response following Se supplementation. In agreement with previous animal study that showed no changes in levels of flu-specific Abs between Se-deficient and -adequate mice <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, we did not observe any Se-associated increase in flu-specific Ab response. This would confirm that Se affects cell-mediated immunity to a greater extent than humoral anti-influenza responses.</p><p>Overall, our study demonstrated that the effect of Se supplementation is context dependent. For example, a dose of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day Se-yeast both enhanced IL-10 secretion and reduced the numbers of granzyme+ CD8 cells in blood; thus it is possible that these two effects act together to inhibit anti-viral responses. Similarly, Se-onion both increased the numbers of granzyme+ and perforin+ CD8 cells but reduced the numbers of NKT-cells in blood. Thus, our evidence does not support the simple assumption that a Se concentration that is beneficial for one immune parameter will be beneficial for all. It also showed that two important effector functions of anti-viral immunity, that is antigen-specific T cell proliferation and T cell content of cytotoxic granules, are differentially regulated by Se-supplementation. The findings that when used as a supplement, Se has a narrow effective range and might even be detrimental raises questions about dietary recommendation. While Se deficiency is known to have consequences on the health status, our study shows that higher levels of se supplementation may also have a negative impact on health. That is not to undermine the importance of host Se status; indeed in mice lower baseline levels of Se have been shown to contribute to the emergence of new flu strains through avirulence to virulence transformation <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We do not know what role the immune response plays in these changes or how adequate Se status would have affected the immune parameters examined in our study. In countries like the United Kingdom, the generally low selenium status has been used as an argument to promote supplementation practice; however, our study suggests that it may be prudent to thoroughly evaluate the risks and benefits associated with Se supplementation especially in segments of the population particularly vulnerable to influenza infection, such as the elderly and chronically ill.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Statement of authorship</title><p>Claudio Nicoletti and Kamal Ivory designed the study; Kamal Ivory, Elena Prieto, Andrew J Goldson, Caroline Spinks and Charlotte N Armah conducted the research and analyzed data; Kamal Ivory and Claudio Nicoletti wrote the paper.
