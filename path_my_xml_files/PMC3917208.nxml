However, esthetics represents an inseparable part of today's periodontal therapy and several procedures have been proposed to preserve or enhance patient esthetics. New technologies, materials, instruments and surgical techniques are therefore necessary to help the clinician ensure the best results and satisfy patient's expectations.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] One of the most frequent indications of &#x0201c;periodontal plastic surgery,&#x0201d; first suggested by Miller in 1988, is the treatment of gingival recession in the esthetic zone.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Gingival recession can be defined as a shift of the gingival margin to a position apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) with the exposure of root surface.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Plaque induced periodontal inflammation, tooth brushing trauma,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] tooth malposition, alveolar bone dehiscence, high frenum attachment, iatrogenic factors related to restorative and periodontal procedures, as well as orthodontic tooth movement have been associated with the development of gingival recession.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Esthetics, dentin hypersensitivity, root caries and cervical abrasions are the indications for root coverage.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Treatment modalities to obtain root coverage can be classified as pedicle grafts, free soft-tissue grafts or a combination of the two. Among the soft-tissue grafts, the subepithelial connective tissue graft combined with or without a coronally advanced flap, is the most widely used and predictable technique in the esthetic treatment of gingival recession. The main disadvantage of these procedures is the requirement of a second surgical site for procuring the connective tissue, thereby increasing post-operative patient discomfort and morbidity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>To overcome the disadvantage of these procedures and improving patient's compliance, the free rotated papilla autograft procedure was described by Tinti and Parma-Benfenati.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The main indication of this procedure is the coverage of localized or multiple gingival recessions with perfectly preserved mesial and distal inter-proximal osseous crests and with a papillary dimension not inferior to the defect, which needs to be treated. This procedure has the added advantage of (i) a single surgical site thereby avoiding patient discomfort in the palatal region (ii) good color harmony with adjacent tissues and (iii) healing by primary intention.</p><p>Microsurgery refers to a surgical procedure performed under a microscope.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The surgical operating microscope is an invaluable tool in periodontal microsurgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The surgical operating microscope provides a microsurgical triad of illumination, magnification and an environment in which surgical skills can be refined.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Since only a few studies are available in the literature comparing the macro-surgical and microsurgical techniques in periodontal plastic surgery, the present study was undertaken (1) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of free rotated papilla autograft procedure combined with coronally advanced flap using the microsurgical technique in root coverage procedures and (2) compare the efficacy of conventional macro-surgery and microsurgical techniques using free rotated papilla autograft combined with coronally advanced flap in treatment of localized gingival recession.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Ten systemically healthy patients were selected from the Out-patient Department of Periodontics, Bapuji Dental College and Hospital, Davangere, Karnataka. Inclusion criteria were: Patients in the age range of 20-45 years, having at least two sites of Miller's class I or class II gingival recession labially in different quadrants with thick and wide interproximal papilla not smaller than the recession defect. Severe cervical abrasion/root caries that would require restoration, abnormal frenal attachments, interdental bone loss with tooth mobility and patients with contraindications for periodontal surgery were the exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>After the completion of the pre-surgical phase of treatment. A total of 20 bilateral sites from 10 patients were selected for the study. The selected sites were randomly divided into experimental site A and experimental site B by using the spilt mouth design. The following clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively:</p><p>

</p><p>The clinical measurements were made with UNC 15 periodontal probe and occlusal stent with guiding grooves. Prior to commencement, the study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board and ethical clearance was taken from Institutional Ethical Committee. The nature, type and duration of treatment were discussed with all the participating patients and informed consent was obtained from each of them. All the selected patients underwent routine blood investigations and intra-oral periapical radiographs of the area of interest. On completion of the above procedures, the selected gingival recession sites were randomly assigned as either experimental site A or experimental-site B for surgical treatment.</p><p>After an extra-oral scrubbing with betadine antiseptic solution and a pre-procedural rinse of 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate, the operative site was anaesthetized with 2% lignocaine HCl with adrenaline (1:80,000), using block and infiltration techniques.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical procedure (experimental site A)</title><p>After obtaining adequate anesthesia, a vertical beveled sharp incision was made in the vestibule distal to the recession defect with Bard-Parker blade 15, continuing horizontally at the CEJ and in the gingival sulcus and finally ending in another vertical beveled releasing incision mesial to the recession defect. Initially, a full thickness trapezoidal flap continuing into a partial-thickness flap was raised, taking care to preserve the adjacent papillae. Then the buccal side of the larger papilla (donor site) and the recipient area was de-epithelized. The buccal papillary tissue of the de-epithelialized papilla was excised, rotated 180&#x000b0; to place its base at the CEJ and stabilized at the recipient site by a horizontal absorbable suture (Vicryl 5-0). The partial thickness flap was now coronally positioned, taking care to avoid any tension of the gingival tissue. Vertical mattress sutures for the papillae and interrupted through-and-through sutures for the vertical releasing incisions (prolene 5-0) were used to obtain stable and complete coverage of the grafted tissue. Digital pressure was then applied for 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedure (experimental site B)</title><p>All of the above mentioned steps were performed with a surgical operating microscope (Serwell Company, Chennai) under &#x000d7;10 magnification.

The presence of mucogingival problems and gingival recession around the teeth in the esthetic zone exemplifies a situation in which a treatment modality that addresses both biological and esthetic demands is required from the periodontist.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A variety of surgical techniques, classified as pedicle soft-tissue grafts, free soft-tissue grafts or combination of the two have been suggested to obtain root coverage in areas of soft-tissue recession. A newer technique introduced by Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] describes the combined use of the free rotated papilla autograft, originally described by Tinti and Parma-Benfenati[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for the coverage of multiple shallow gingival recessions and a coronally advanced flap. The main objective of this approach was to minimize the post-surgical course and patient discomfort in the treatment of localized recession with the main advantage being the involvement of a single surgical site unlike in the connective tissue grafting.</p><p>The application of magnification in periodontics promises to further enhance its clinical significance in providing specialist periodontal surgical care. Microsurgery implies an extension of surgical principles by which gentle handling of tissue and exceedingly accurate approximation of the wound edges is of paramount importance.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore the present study was undertaken to compare the conventional macro-surgical and microsurgical approach and evaluate the effectiveness of the surgical procedure described by Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the present study, the split mouth design was selected because it excludes the influence of patient's specific characteristics and facilitates the interpretation of trials by minimizing the effects of inter-patient variability.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The occlusal stent with guiding grooves was used as it maintains the constant position, direction and angulation of periodontal probe while recording clinical parameters.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, there was significant reduction in RD in both the treatment groups when baseline reading was compared with 3 and 6 month data. This finding is consistent with the observations made by other group of researchers.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This finding can be attributed to the cumulative effectiveness of the surgical procedure and the maintenance of good oral hygiene by patient during the post-operative follow-up period. Comparison of mean reduction in RD between the two groups at baseline to 3 and 6 months showed clinical improvement similar to those by Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] though it was contradictory to the finding of other studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This observation in our study may be attributed to the comparable effectiveness of both the procedures in treating such problems. Similarly, the post-operative mean reduction in RW in both groups was clinically significant. This finding also supports the comparable effectiveness of both macro- and microsurgeries in treating such recession defects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The mean CAL values at site A at 3 and 6 were not in accordance with the findings of many authors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] At site B, the mean CAL values at 3 and 6 months were also not in accordance with the findings of many authors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The reason for the contradictory findings at both the sites may be that in the present study, the use of pressure sensitive probe probably would have influenced the present results to some extent. Comparison of the mean reduction in CAL between the two groups at baseline to 3 and 6 months revealed findings, which are consistent with the observations made by Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The mean WKT at site A at 3 and 6 months corroborated with Andrade <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In site B, the mean increase in WKT at 3 and 6 months was consistent with the studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This finding further demonstrates the comparable effectiveness of both conventional (macro) and surgery under magnification (microsurgeries) in the treatment of gingival recession. Comparison of the mean gain in WKT at 3 and 6 months revealed observations similar to Francetti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the advantages offered by magnification in periodontal plastic surgery in terms of both the periodontal condition and esthetic result. Most of patients who participated in the study were satisfied with the esthetic result of the treatment. The efficacy of the free rotated papilla autograft technique was well-established in this study. It is noteworthy to mention that the technique should be only applied in cases of Miller's class I and shallow class II defects as the adjacent papillary dimension becomes a limiting factor in this technique. There was no significant reduction of the donor papillary height or formation of a black triangle at both the sites. Both the marginal gingiva and papillae showed a good esthetic appearance till the end of the study. Furthermore, most of the patients who participated in the study reported less post-operative discomfort and pain at the microsurgical site. This may be attributed to the advantages of the microsurgical approach in atraumatic and accurate handling of soft-tissues. Furthermore, the coronal advancement of the flaps, which was easier and tension free with the operating microscope, could have led to favorable response from patients.</p><p>Hence, the importance of magnification in periodontal surgery cannot be underestimated because the magnification under the powerful illumination provided by the microscope definitely enhancing the visualization of the surgical site and the use of smaller micro-knives permitting an extremely fine and accurate incision. Furthermore, after flap reflection, better debridement of the recipient site was accomplished, soft-tissue edges could be better approximated and finer sutures could be used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitation of the study, it can be concluded that both the treatment groups were effective in the treatment of localized gingival recession by employing the free rotated papilla autograft technique combined with the coronally advanced flap. However, on comparison, the mean difference in clinical parameters between the conventional (macro-surgery) and surgery under magnification (microsurgery) group showed no statistical significance. The smaller sample size and shorter follow-up period may be considered as the main limitations of the present study. Hence, a long term clinical trial with a larger sample size is needed to compare the clinical outcomes of the free rotated papilla autograft technique by conventional macro- and microsurgery utilizing the surgical operating microscope.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors are thankful to the Director, Institute for Data Computing and Training, Lucknow for providing valuable assistance in data analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Francetti</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Fabbro</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Calace</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Testori</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Microsurgical treatment of gingival recession: A controlled clinical study</article-title><source>Int J Periodontics Restorative Dent</source><year>2005</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>181</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15839595</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roccuzzo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bunino</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Needleman</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal plastic surgery for treatment of localized gingival recessions: A systematic review</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2002</year><volume>29</volume><issue>Suppl 3</issue><fpage>178</fpage><lpage>94</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12787218</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zucchelli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Amore</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sforza</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name><name><surname>Montebugnoli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>De Sanctis</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bilaminar techniques for the treatment of recession-type defects.
