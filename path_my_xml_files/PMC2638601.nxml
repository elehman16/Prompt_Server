In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, 125 patients were allocated to receive either tocilizumab 8&#x000a0;mg/kg every 4&#x000a0;weeks plus MTX placebo (tocilizumab group) or tocilizumab placebo plus MTX 8&#x000a0;mg/week (control group) for 24&#x000a0;weeks. The clinical responses were measured using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were also monitored. At week 24, 25.0% in the control group and 80.3% in the tocilizumab group achieved ACR20 response. The tocilizumab group showed superior ACR response criteria over control at all time points. Additionally, serum VEGF levels were significantly decreased by tocilizumab treatment. The overall incidences of adverse events (AEs) were 72 and 92% (serious AEs: 4.7 and 6.6%; serious infections: 1.6 and 3.3%) in the control and the tocilizumab groups, respectively. All serious adverse events improved by adequate treatment.

The affected joints exhibit hyperplasia of inflamed synovium infiltrated with a range of immunocompetent cells, which forms pannus tissue and invade cartilage and bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Angiogenesis is a characteristic histological feature of rheumatoid synovium for which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, patients with RA show systemic inflammatory manifestations such as fever, fatigue, anemia, and laboratory findings, including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyper-&#x003b3;-globulinemia and emergence of various types of autoantibodies. These abnormalities can be explained, at least partly, by deregulated overproduction of interleukin (IL)-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, although the etiological causes are not fully understood.</p><p>Recently biologics targeting T cells, B cells, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, IL-1, have been successfully used in the treatment of RA. However, these therapies are not always effective. In addition, adverse reactions are also the problem for those treatments. Therefore, we need further new therapeutic agents that have a new mechanism of action and higher efficacy.</p><p>Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 binding to IL-6R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This antibody was humanized by grafting the complementarity-determining regions from a murine anti-IL-6R antibody into human IgG1, thereby creating a functioning antigen-binding site in a reshaped human antibody and reducing the antigenicity of the antibody in human. We have demonstrated that treatment with tocilizumab improves the signs and symptoms and prevents joint damage of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The objective of this clinical trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy in active RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX, an anchor drug for RA treatment, at a dose of 8&#x000a0;mg/week, which is approved for adult RA patients in Japan. In addition, tocilizumab effect on serum VEGF levels was also examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were between 20 and 75&#x000a0;years old, fulfilled the American college of Rheumatology (ACR; formerly, the American Rheumatism Association) 1987 revised criteria for the classification of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with disease duration of more than 6&#x000a0;months. All candidates were treated with MTX 8&#x000a0;mg/week for at least 8&#x000a0;weeks until enrolment. They all had &#x02265;6 tender joints (of 49 evaluated), &#x02265;6 swollen joints (of 46 evaluated), ESR of &#x02265;30&#x000a0;mm/h or CRP of &#x02265;10&#x000a0;mg/l at enrolment. An inadequate response to MTX was defined as the presence of active disease, as described above. Patients were not allowed to have received prior anti-TNF agents or leflunomide (within 12&#x000a0;weeks prior to the first dose), plasma exchange therapy or surgical treatments (within 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the first dose), DMARDs other than MTX or immunosuppressants (within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to the first dose). Oral corticosteroids (prednisolone, &#x02264;10&#x000a0;mg/day) were allowed if the dosage had not been changed within 2&#x000a0;weeks.

Patients were excluded if they had functional class IV using Steinbrocker&#x02019;s criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and serum creatinine &#x02265;1.5-fold the upper limit of normal, were HBs antigen and/or HCV antibody positive, had pulmonary fibrosis or active pulmonary disease, a history of serious adverse drug reaction to MTX, concomitant pleural effusion, ascites, varicella infection, or were excessive users of alcohol on a regular basis. Patients were also excluded if they had significant cardiac, blood, respiratory system, neurologic, endocrine, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease, or had an active infection requiring medication within 4&#x000a0;weeks before the first dose or medical history of a serious allergic reaction.

The randomization was done by registering the patients to the patient registration center utilizing a centralized allocation method. The dosage of tocilizumab used in this study was chosen according to a previous dose finding study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The dose of MTX was the maximum dose allowed in Japan (see <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>). Oral corticosteroids less than 10&#x000a0;mg prednisolone per day were allowed, and the dose could not be increased during the study. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroid (only one joint at one treatment) and hyaluronate preparations were allowed. Use of one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including switching to another NSAID, was allowed. DMARDs, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids, plasmapheresis and surgical treatment were not allowed. Patients who received three or more doses of tocilizumab or tocilizumab placebo were able to join an open-label extension study of tocilizumab.</p><p>The clinical responses were measured using the ACR criteria as well as the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria based on DAS28.

No tuberculosis screening or prophylactic use of any anti-tuberculosis drugs was done for this study.</p><p>Drug-related infusion reactions were reported for eight events in seven patients (11.5%) of the tocilizumab group: two with pruritus, and one each with headache, flushing, rash, arthralgia, abnormal feeling and increased blood pressure. The severity of arthralgia was moderate while all other infusion reactions were mild, and all patients continued the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Laboratory findings</title><p>Laboratory test abnormalities were reported in 23 and 56% of patients in the control and the tocilizumab groups, respectively. In the tocilizumab group, lipid metabolism-related changes such as an increase in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) were common. Increases in TC, TG, and LDLC under non-fasting were reported in 36, 20, and 28% of the patients, respectively. Most of them were grade 1 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC). Values increased until week 4 and thereafter remained constant. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) values were also raised in the tocilizumab group. Therefore, the atherogenic index, calculated by (TC-HDLC)/HDLC, did not change at all throughout the study period of 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Increases in AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were reported in 8, 11, and 0% of the patients in the control group, and 3, 5, and 2% in the tocilizumab group, respectively. These values did not continue to be increased, but became stable at week 16 in the tocilizumab group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). All the patients with these abnormalities in the tocilizumab group were NCI-CTC grade 1 except for 1 patient with grade 2 increase in total bilirubin. There was no patient who withdrew from this study for the reason of liver functional abnormality.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Change from baseline in serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin (T-BIL).

The results of this study confirmed the excellent efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy for signs and symptoms as shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since MTX is an anchor drug in RA treatment, it is noteworthy that tocilizumab treatment is a very efficacious treatment for the patients with an inadequate response to MTX. In addition, switching MTX therapy to tocilizumab monotherapy was safe and effective.</p><p>The dose of MTX prior to enrollment was 10&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg/week in CHARISMA study, which was conducted in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while all patients in this study were treated with MTX 8&#x000a0;mg/week. The dosage 8&#x000a0;mg of MTX/week in this trial is the maximum dosage approved in Japan. The Japanese government recommends 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;mg/week of MTX based on the evidence from the Japanese clinical trials of MTX for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The MTX dosage used in Japan is lower than that used in Western populations treated in the EU or US. The average body weight of the patients in this study was 54&#x000a0;kg, and much lower than those of EU and US patients. Additionally, all patients were given folic acid in the CHARISMA study, in contrast to only 51% of the patients in this study. Considering these factors, the differences in the clinical efficacy of MTX between the CHARISMA study and this study might not be so large as expected when looking at the difference in the MTX dose.</p><p>Maini et al. demonstrated in the CHARISMA study, that adding MTX to tocilizumab increased the efficacy in terms of ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, although there was no difference in ACR20 response rates between the tocilizumab 8&#x000a0;mg/kg monotherapy and the tocilizumab 8&#x000a0;mg/kg plus MTX. Thus, the combination with MTX may be a therapeutic option, if the toxicity is not increased. In this study, however, even monotherapy with tocilizumab 8&#x000a0;mg/kg induced DAS28 remission at 6&#x000a0;months in about 40% of patients. Furthermore, since anti-tocilizumab antibodies are not detected without use of MTX, the combination with MTX is not required to suppress the emergence of anti-tocilizumab antibodies as long as 8&#x000a0;mg/kg of tocilizumab is used. Therefore, tocilizumab will be useful for the patients who do not tolerate MTX.</p><p>This double-blind study of tocilizumab also confirms the previous finding that IL-6 receptor inhibition improves serum VEGF levels of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Serum VEGF levels markedly decreased during tocilizumab therapy compared to the treatment with MTX. VEGF is produced by macrophages, fibroblasts surrounding microvessels, vascular smooth muscle cells, synovial lining cells in synovium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], neutrophils in synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] from patients with RA. VEGF is a potent angiogenic factor and thought to be responsible for the angiogenesis necessary to oxygenate the hypertrophic synovial tissues of the affected joints of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. VEGF also induces vascular permeability and mediates inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the decrease in VEGF may be an important part of the mechanism how IL-6 receptor inhibition with tocilizumab exerts its therapeutic efficacy in RA. Since serum VEGF levels correlate with disease activity scores and radiographic progression in RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the dramatic decrease in VEGF also underlines the efficacy of tocilizumab. The normalization of VEGF by blockade of IL-6 function alone indicates that IL-6 is essential for the VEGF production in this disease.</p><p>Tocilizumab monotherapy was generally well tolerated. There was no specific type of infection related to tocilizumab therapy. There is no indication for an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis, which is often a problem in anti-TNF therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study patients did not receive prophylactic medication nor were they screened for latent or active tuberculosis at the time of screening.</p><p>The increase in TC observed is in concordance with observations in previous studies of tocilizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This may be secondary to the improvement in inflammation. Furthermore, there was no cardiovascular adverse event related to the increase in TC. However, further investigation will be required to evaluate whether or not tocilizumab might increase the risk for developing ischemic heart diseases.</p><p>The mean value elevations of liver functional tests (AST, ALT and total bilirubin) were seen in the tocilizumab group as well as in the control group, but they were within normal range. Liver functional tests abnormalities were more frequently observed in the control group than in the tocilizumab group. Moreover, most of them were grade 1 according to the NCI-CTC. These abnormalities were clinically not significant and no hepatitis was observed. Therefore, tocilizumab monotherapy appears to be as tolerable as MTX in terms of liver function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that tocilizumab monotherapy in patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to low dose MTX treatment in Japan has an excellent efficacy with a positive benefit-risk ratio.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the SATORI investigators for the treatment and Takahiro Kakehi, B&#x000b7;Sc., Yuji Kimura, M.Sc., Kenichi Yamada, B&#x000b7;Sc. and Karsten Kissel, MD for their valuable assistance with the design and analysis of the study and preparation of this manuscript.
