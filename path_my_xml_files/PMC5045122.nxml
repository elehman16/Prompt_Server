This commentary highlights key aspects of the recently published phase 3 A Efficacy and Safety Study of Two Doses of Intra-Articular Injection of Ampion&#x02122; in Adults With Pain Due to Osteoarthritis of the Knee (SPRING) study. SPRING (NCT01839331) was a multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of the low-molecular-weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF-5A) for treatment of pain, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) pain scale, in patients with symptomatic OAK (N=329). Patients in this study reflected many characteristics of &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; individuals with OAK, with a broad range of disease severity and disability. The most important finding from this study was that treatment with a single intra-articular injection of LMWF-5A led to significant pain reduction in the patients with objective radiographic evidence of severe disease and joint deterioration (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3; <italic>P</italic>=0.04 and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4; <italic>P</italic>=0.02). The magnitude of pain reduction in the entire cohort treated with LMWF-5A was 42% from baseline and the treatment effect compared with vehicle control (estimated difference in WOMAC pain, &#x02212;0.25; <italic>P</italic>=0.004) was also notable, especially relative to a previously reported study of hyaluronic acid, in which only a marginally significant treatment effect was observed (mean difference in WOMAC pain compared with control, &#x02212;0.15; <italic>P</italic>=0.047). Significant improvement in physical function observed with LMWF-5A (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) was also noted and suggests that LMWF-5A may provide therapeutic benefit for those who are limited in the activities of daily living. Intra-articular injection of LMWF-5A was well tolerated, and the adverse event profile was similar to that of control. These results demonstrate significant benefit of LMWF-5A for patients with greatest disability (Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3 and 4) and highest therapeutic need who have limited pharmacologic options for relief of pain associated with OAK.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>human serum albumin</kwd><kwd>knee</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>Kellgren-Lawrence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and affects &#x0223c;27 million people in the United States.<xref rid="b1-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK) occurs in &#x0223c;12% of individuals older than 60 years,<xref rid="b1-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and &#x0223c;60% of these patients may have moderate-to-severe OAK, which is associated with limitations in daily activities and loss of productivity.<xref rid="b3-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Osteoarthritis is usually a progressive disease that develops from failed repair of joint damage resulting from stresses that may originate from an abnormality in any of the synovial joint tissues.<xref rid="b4-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Pathological changes leading to the breakdown of cartilage and bone eventually result in substantial pain and disability.<xref rid="b3-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It has been proposed that osteoarthritis is not a single disease but a heterogeneous collection of subtypes, which can be characterized by joint inflammation.<xref rid="b4-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Current therapies for pain reduction in OAK include physical activity, weight loss, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, intra-articular steroids, and hyaluronic acid (HA).<xref rid="b5-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients with pain uncontrolled by these treatments may eventually be eligible for knee surgery or replacement.<xref rid="b6-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Treatments such as intra-articular steroids can provide short-term pain reduction but may lose effectiveness over time and may not lead to improvements in physical function or stiffness.<xref rid="b5-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines could not recommend use of intra-articular steroids or HA,<xref rid="b7-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there is a need for an agent that would halt or reverse disease progression and provide antiinflammatory and analgesic benefits, especially for treatment of OAK in aging or obese patients.<xref rid="b8-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Burden of disease is especially high in the latter population, as it is estimated that OAK is associated with 1.86 quality-adjusted life-years lost for nonobese patients aged 50 to 84 years versus 3.50 for obese patients.<xref rid="b9-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Human serum albumin has been approved for treatment of burns and shock for more than 30 years, with favorable safety and tolerability.<xref rid="b8-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The low-molecular-weight fraction (&#x0003c;5,000 Da) of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF-5A) contains aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine, which may have antiinflammatory or immunomodulatory effects.<xref rid="b8-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b11-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Primary results from the SPRING study of LMWF-5A for pain reduction in OAK were recently published.<xref rid="b8-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This commentary highlights the unique aspects of this study of LMWF-5A in a heterogeneous &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; cohort of patients with moderate to severe OAK.</p></sec><sec><title>Commentary main text</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and methods</title><p>A Efficacy and Safety Study of Two Doses of Intra-Articular Injection of Ampion&#x02122; in Adults With Pain Due to Osteoarthritis of the Knee (SPRING) study (NCT01839331) was a multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LMWF-5A for treatment of pain in symptomatic OAK.<xref rid="b8-oarrr-7-019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Patients (N=329) were randomized to receive a 4 or 10 mL intra-articular injection of LMWF-5A or vehicle control (saline).

In addition, as efficacy measures could be affected by pain in the nontreated knee, bilateral disease was not evaluated in SPRING. Therefore, it was not possible to determine whether the treatment effect differed between patients with unilateral versus bilateral OAK. A planned phase 3 study with a longer observation period may assess the maximum treatment effect of LMWF-5A in OAK.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from the SPRING study exceeded expectations, given that a majority of patients enrolled had moderate to severe symptomatic OAK. There was a significant benefit of LMWF-5A for patients with objective radiographic evidence of OAK who have limited pharmacologic treatment options for pain associated with this disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
