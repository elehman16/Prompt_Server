Althof et&#x000a0;al reported that the IELT progressively increased for each category of improvement on the CGIC: 1.63, 4.03, and 7.15 minutes for slightly better, better, and much better, respectively. Similarly, higher CGIC ratings were correlated with greater improvement in control (r&#x000a0;= 0.73), satisfaction (r&#x000a0;= 0.62), greater decrease in distress (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.52), and interpersonal difficulty (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.39). Total variance accounted for 57.4%: control (48.7%), satisfaction (4.5%), IELT (2.8%), and distress (1.15%). Althof et&#x000a0;al concluded that the CGIC provides clinicians in practice with a valid and brief outcome assessment of their patient's response to intervention.</p><p>In this study, the use of a flexible dosing regimen of dapoxetine (30 and 60 mg) appeared effective in the treatment of Asia-Pacific men with PE. Using the CGIC, 85.3% of subjects described their PE as at least slightly better at study end.

The proportion of subjects who CGIC rated their PE as at least slightly better was 84.1% among subjects with a baseline estimated IELT no longer than 1 minute and 86.4% of those with a baseline estimated IELT of at least 1 minute. The difference among the three dosages was not significant. In addition, 55.0% of subjects described their PE as at least better using CGIC at visit 5 (final visit).</p><p>These results were comparable to, if not slightly better than, previous global and regional Asia-Pacific phase 3 trials and an integrated analysis of pooled data from five phase 3 trials.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the integrated analysis of pooled data from five phase 3 trials, a CGIC rating of at least slightly better was reported at study end by 62.1% and 71.7% of subjects using dapoxetine 30 and 60 mg, respectively.

Reported AEs were generally mild or moderate and there were no unexpected or important new findings regarding the AE profile of dapoxetine or new safety concerns identified. The overall and individual incidences of AEs were similar for dosages 1 and 2 and failed to replicate the dose-related incidence seen in earlier phase 3 studies. The reason for this is unclear but probably reflects the observation that AEs often attenuate and resolve with continued drug usage. The incidence of AEs was higher with dosage 3, which could reflect the option of the subject to decrease the dapoxetine dose from 60 to 30 mg owing to intolerable AEs.</p><p>This study is limited by the lack of a blinded placebo or active comparator arm. Some degree of subject and/or investigator bias could have influenced the results. The lack of validation of the PEDT, PEP, and CGIC in non-English Asia-Pacific languages before the commencement of study is regarded by the authors as a potential but minor limitation of this study. In addition, the lack of IELT data after dapoxetine treatment might be considered another potential limitation when comparing data from this study to those of the dapoxetine phase 3 registration program. The sample size could limit the detection of infrequent AEs.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Consistent with results from previous phase 3 studies, dapoxetine 30 and 60 mg as needed significantly improved the CGIC rating of PE, the composite responder end point of at least a two-category improvement in control over ejaculation, and at least a one-category decrease in distress related to ejaculation and the individual PRO end points of ejaculatory control, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, personal distress, and interpersonal distress. Clinical efficacy was comparable between subgroups for disease type (lifelong vs acquired PE) and IELT categories (&#x02264;1 vs &#x02265;1 minute).
