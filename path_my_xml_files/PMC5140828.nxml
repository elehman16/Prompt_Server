therapy (HILT) on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. [Subjects and
Methods] In this study, an experiment was conducted on 20 subjects who were divided into
the control group (n=10), which would receive conservative physical therapy (CPT), and the
experimental group (n=10), which would receive effects of high intensity laser therapy
after conservative physical therapy. All patients received their respective therapies
three times each week over a four-week period. In terms of the intensity of the high
intensity laser therapy, it was applied to each patient in the tibia and femoral
epicondyle for five minutes while the patient&#x02019;s knee joint was bent at around 30&#x000b0; and the
separation distance between the handpiece and the skin was maintained at around 1&#x02005;cm. The
visual analogue scale was used to measure pain, and the Korean Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index was used for functional evaluations. [Results]
The comparison of differences in the measurements taken before and after the experiment
within each group showed a statistically significant decline in both the VAS and the
K-WOMAC. The comparison of the two groups showed that the high intensity laser therapy
group had statistically significant lower scores in both the visual analogue scale and the
Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index than the
conservative physical therapy group. [Conclusion] High intensity laser therapy is
considered an effective non-surgical intervention for reducing pain in patients with knee
osteoarthritis and helping them to perform daily activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Knee joint</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>High intensity laser therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In developed countries, the rapid aging of populations has resulted in rapid increases in
musculoskeletal diseases that are caused by degenerative changes in the bones and joints.
Among the many degenerative diseases, osteoarthritis, along with some other musculoskeletal
diseases, is reported as one of the most common to result from aging<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with knee osteoarthritis exhibit various symptoms,
including pain, muscular atrophy, stiffness, and limited range of motion (ROM)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Indeed, pain is a major symptom of
osteoarthritis; it is related to the excessive use of joints and is relieved by resting<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatments that could completely cure knee
osteoarthritis have not yet been developed. Therefore, the goal of clinical treatments is to
relieve pain, maintain or improve the function of joints<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reduce the stiffening or deformation of joints. Treatments for
knee osteoarthritis can be divided into surgical and non-surgical therapies. Among the
various non-surgical therapies, high intensity laser therapy (HILT), which is non-invasive,
has recently become popular. HILT delivers a high energy output into the tissues, and its
optical energy forms dynamic vibrations in the tissues. This then generates photochemistry
effects, such as increasing the oxidation of mitochondria and facilitating the formation of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and eventually leads to the fast absorption of edemas and the
removal of exudations through increased metabolism and blood circulation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, laser treatments on
musculoskeletal diseases have generally involved low level laser therapy (LLLT), and studies
on HILT remain inadequate. Therefore, in this study, we have conducted an experiment to
prove the effects of HILT on patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 20 patients, aged from 55 to 75, whose attending doctors
had diagnosed them with knee osteoarthritis based on clinical findings and images taken
using X-ray equipment. These subjects were selected from among the patients who had either
been hospitalized at S Orthopedic Hospital, in Daegu, or who had visited the hospital as
outpatients. This experiment was conducted after fully explaining the purpose of the study
and the entire process of the experiment to the subjects and obtaining their consent. The
study also included a signed consent form, according to the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Institutional
Review Board of Youngdong University.</p><p>The selected patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly divided into two groups. The
conservative physical therapy group (CPTG, n=10), which was the control group, was treated
with conservative physical therapy (CPT), and the high intensity laser therapy group (HILTG,
n=10), the experimental group, received both CPT and HILT. All subjects were treated three
times each week for a four-week period. The CPTG was, on average, 65.5 &#x000b1; 4.0&#x02005;years of age,
159.9 &#x000b1; 8.2&#x02005;cm in height, and 61.6 &#x000b1; 10.4&#x02005;kg in weight. The HILTG was, on average, 65.3 &#x000b1;
4.2&#x02005;years of age, 159.3 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;cm in height, and 62.0 &#x000b1; 11.0&#x02005;kg in weight. The CPT performed
on the control group consisted of hot pack treatment for 20 minutes, interferential current
therapy for 15 minutes, and deep heat diathermy using ultrasonic waves for five minutes. For
the experimental group, HILT was performed after the same CPT had been applied. With the
patient&#x02019;s knee joint bent at around 30&#x000b0;, a high intensity laser was applied in the tibia and
femoral epicondyle for five minutes, using a HILT device (HEALTRON, United Technology Inc.,
Israel). A separation distance of around 1&#x02005;cm between the handpiece and the skin was also
maintained throughout the treatment. The intensity of the HILT was level 2, the frequency
was 11 Hz, and the total amount of delivered energy was 1,500&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used in the study to identify the degree of pain, and
the Korean-Western Ontario and Macmaster University Osteoarthritis Index (K-WOMAC), which
had been developed to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis in the lower limbs, was used for
functional evaluations. The VAS and K-WOMAC measurements were taken for both the control and
the experimental group, using the same methods before the experiment and four weeks after
the experiment. For the statistical analysis of this study, the paired t-test was performed
to examine changes within each group, and the independent sample t-test was performed to
compare the two groups. In this study, SPSS/PC Ver. 13.0 was used for statistical
processing, and the statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The comparison of the changes within each group showed a statistically significant decline
in both the VAS and the K-WOMAC. In addition, the comparison of the two groups showed that
the CPTG had statistically significant higher scores in the VAS and K-WOMAC than the HILTG

declines in their ability to use their joints, which results in a weakening of muscle
strength. Since this destabilizes the joints and physical function is reduced, the motion
that is required for the patients&#x02019; daily activities becomes limited<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the effects
of HILT on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>Santamato et al. conducted a comparative study on the effects of HILT and ultrasound
therapy on 70 patients with shoulder impingement syndrome and reported that HILT showed
greater effects on pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present
study has shown a similar result. When the patients with knee osteoarthritis who had been
placed in the experimental group were treated with HILT for four weeks, they exhibited
statistically significant effects in terms of the VAS. The mechanism behind this result may
be as follows: as the optical energy of the high intensity laser penetrated the affected
area and spread into the tissues, photochemistry effects were generated, including the
oxidation of mitochondria and the facilitation of the formation of ATP. This then increased
metabolism and facilitated blood circulation following the expansion of blood vessels and
lymphatic vessels. Eventually, unnecessary liquids that had accumulated in the body were
reabsorbed and exudations were quickly removed<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the function of patients with knee osteoarthritis was measured using the
K-WOMAC, and there was a statistically significant difference between the measurements of
those in the HILTG and the CPTG. A study conducted by Kheshie et al. compared the effects of
HILT and LLLT on 53 female patients with knee osteoarthritis and reported that HILT was more
effective in relieving pain and improving function. This result supports the result of the
present study<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, our study has
some limitations. It had a small number of subjects because it targeted only those patients
who had visited our hospital over a four-week period. It also did not have full control over
the daily activities of the subjects. In addition, the long-term results of these treatments
have not been identified. Therefore, a variety of future studies should be conducted to
compensate for these limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Manetta</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Franz</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Comparison of hip and knee muscle moments in subjects with
