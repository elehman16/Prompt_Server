It has been shown that solid foods have a stronger satiating effect than their liquid equivalent. However, whether a subtle change in viscosity of a semi-solid food would have a similar effect on appetite is unknown. Fifteen healthy males participated in the randomized cross-over study. Each participant consumed a 1690 kJ portion of a standard viscosity (SV) and a high viscosity (HV) semi-solid meal with 1000 mg acetaminophen in two separate sessions. At regular intervals during the three hours following the meal, subjective appetite ratings were measured and blood samples collected. The plasma samples were assayed for insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucose and acetaminophen. After three hours, the participants were provided with an <italic>ad libitum</italic> pasta meal. Compared with the SV meal, HV was consumed at a slower eating rate (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.020), with postprandial hunger and desire to eat being lower (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.019 and P&#x0003c;0.001 respectively) while fullness was higher (P&#x0003c;0.001). In addition, consuming the HV resulted in lower plasma concentration of GIP (P&#x0003c;0.001), higher plasma concentration of glucose (P&#x0003c;0.001) and delayed gastric emptying as revealed by the acetaminophen absorption test (P&#x0003c;0.001). However, there was no effect of food viscosity on insulin or food intake at the subsequent meal. In conclusion, increasing the viscosity of a semi-solid food modulates glycemic response and suppresses postprandial satiety, although the effect may be short-lived. A slower eating rate and a delayed gastric emptying rate can partly explain for the stronger satiating properties of high viscous semi-solid foods.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by Iowa State University.

While being important to consumer acceptance of food, a growing body of evidence indicates that the rheological properties of food, such as physical form, contribute to altered appetite and modulate glycemic response. For example, several studies have reported that fluid calories, such as beverages, are less satiating than their solid equivalents <xref rid="pone.0067482-Leidy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mattes1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Stull1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mourao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and induce a larger rebound fall in postprandial glucose concentrations <xref rid="pone.0067482-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These effects on appetite and glycemic response could further modify the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity <xref rid="pone.0067482-DiMeglio1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and diabetes <xref rid="pone.0067482-Brynes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, less is known about whether more subtle differences in food rheological properties, for example, differences in the viscosity of a semi-solid food, would have a similar effect on appetite and glycemic response. Increasing current knowledge on this topic may aid the development of new or reformulated functional food products for health promotion <xref rid="pone.0067482-Lundin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Lundin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies using foods in different forms have found that increasing the viscosity of a food reduces food intake <xref rid="pone.0067482-deWijk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or suppresses appetite <xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nonetheless, comparing different food forms, such as a beverage vs a semi-solid or solid food, may not give a true indication of the effect of viscosity on appetite due to cognitive differences in how participants view the test products (e.g., liquid beverages quench thirst whereas semi-solid or solid foods sate hunger) <xref rid="pone.0067482-Cassady1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, the physiological mechanisms that explain these observations have received little attention. Recently, it was reported that standardizing eating rate of a liquid meal and a semi-solid meal resulted in no difference in <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake; however, the intake was significantly different if eating rate was not controlled <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While accumulating evidences suggest the association of eating rate and appetite <xref rid="pone.0067482-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Kokkinos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the effect of food viscosity on eating rate warrants further investigation. Increasing food viscosity may also delay gastric emptying rate <xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although conflicting results have also been reported <xref rid="pone.0067482-Shimoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The delayed gastric emptying may prolong satiety, as gastric distention is a key influence on feelings of fullness <xref rid="pone.0067482-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to an effect on appetite, food viscosity may also modulate postprandial glycemic and insulin response, as the delay in the gastro-intestinal transition of viscous meals would likely slow the rate of digestion and absorption. Nonetheless, current studies provide inconsistent results related to the effect of meal viscosity on postprandial glucose and insulin response <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Shimoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Flammang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and further research is warranted to clarify this matter. In addition, little is currently known about the effect of food viscosity on the response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), a hormone secreted in response to digestion in the small intestine to facilitate disposal of ingested nutrients and stimulate insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0067482-Baggio1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of viscosity of a semi-solid food on eating rate, subjective appetite, glycemic response, hormones related to glucose metabolism, as well as gastric emptying rate. Our hypothesis was that increasing food viscosity would reduce subjective appetite, due to a slower eating rate and delayed gastric emptying rate. We also hypothesized a viscous meal would result in a lower GIP and insulin response, together with a blunted post-prandial glycemic response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited for this study using an email sent to faculty, staff and students at Iowa State University and flyers posted in the local community.

Participants attended two test sessions that were separated by a 7-day washout period. Participants were instructed to avoid alcohol consumption and strenuous physical activity for the 48 hours before each test session. On each test day, they were required to report to the laboratory at 7&#x02236;30 am following an overnight fast of at least 12 hours. After reporting to the laboratory, an indwelling catheter was inserted into their non-dominant arm. Following a thirty-minute acclimatization period, a baseline blood sample was taken and a baseline appetite questionnaire completed. The appetite questionnaire posed four questions: how hungry do you feel right now? How full do you feel right now? How preoccupied with food are you right now? What is your desire to eat right now? Responses were captured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS was anchored with diametrically opposed statements (e.g. not at all hungry, as hungry as I have ever felt). Immediately following the baseline measurement the participant was presented with the relevant test food (SV or HV) and asked to consume the meal in its entirety. The time taken to eat the meal was measured to assess the eating rate using a stopwatch. The participant was not aware that eating rate was being measured until after the study was completed. Immediately after finishing the meal another blood sample was taken (t0). Further blood draws were made at t0+15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes. At each time point participants also completed a fresh appetite questionnaire. Throughout the test session, participants were required to remain seated in a quiet room that was free from food cues. After the final blood draw, the indwelling catheter was removed and participants were allowed to rest for five minutes before being presented with the pasta meal. Participants were instructed to eat until comfortably full and they were informed that an extra portion was available if they needed. Each bowl of food was weighed before and after serving out of sight of participants. During the study period, participants were isolated from each other using screens. In addition, water was not allowed to be consumed as it could confound our measurements on appetite and gastric emptying rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Gastric Emptying Rate Measurement</title><p>Gastric emptying rate was assessed using the acetaminophen absorption test <xref rid="pone.0067482-Heading1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

However, there was no effect on plasma concentration of insulin or food intake at a subsequent meal.</p><p>Results from the present study suggest that increasing the viscosity of a semi-solid food has a similar appetite-suppressing effect as reported by those studies using foods in different physical forms <xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In agreement with studies that measured food intake at the subsequent meal <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the appetite-suppressing effect was not sufficiently strong to reduce food intake at a meal eaten 3 hours later. The length of time between the test meal and lunch in this present study may have been too long for a relatively small preload to influence energy intake at the lunch meal <xref rid="pone.0067482-Rolls1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Indeed, the one study that found that consuming a viscous meal reduced food intake at the next meal used a shorter duration (90 minutes) between the preload and the test meal <xref rid="pone.0067482-Vuksan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Consequently, it may be interesting to determine if the consumption of a viscous snack between meals is able to reduce food intake at the subsequent meal or aid weight management in people who habitually consume snack foods. For individuals who do not consume snacks, it is unlikely that they would accrue any benefit for weight management by adding a snack to the diet and increasing eating frequency <xref rid="pone.0067482-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-McCrory1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. It is interesting to note that participants were less hungry, had a lower desire to eat and a higher fullness immediately prior to the lunch meal yet this had no effect on food intake. It is possible that the observed differences in appetite were not sufficiently large to influence food intake and were overwhelmed by other drivers of food intake. For example, we provided an excess of free food which may have stimulated food intake for reasons other than satisfying appetite <xref rid="pone.0067482-Wansink1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Another potential explanation is that appetite and food intake are not tightly coupled in the short-term <xref rid="pone.0067482-McKiernan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and repeated exposures to a food may be required before a consistent appetitive response is observed. Further studies that examine the influence of food viscosity on appetite and food intake over a longer term are required to identify the link.</p><p>It has been suggested that a slower eating rate may contribute to suppressed appetite <xref rid="pone.0067482-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Kokkinos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Kissileff1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. While results for our study shows HV resulted in a slower eating rate and reduced appetite, the difference in meal duration we observed was substantially shorter (less than four minutes) than those eating rate studies where the difference was up to 25 minutes <xref rid="pone.0067482-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Kokkinos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Kissileff1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It seems unlikely that such a small difference in meal duration could influence satiety over several hours. Nonetheless, as sensory exposure depends on the exposure duration and the intensity of the stimulus, a slower eating rate would prolong the oral exposure time, which can increase the overall exposure to sensory stimulation in oral and retro-nasal cavity, resulting in suppressed appetite or reduced food intake <xref rid="pone.0067482-Ruijschop1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Ruijschop2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Bolhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The present study found that increasing in food viscosity slows gastric emptying which is consistent with results from most studies that have investigate the impact of viscosity on gastric emptying <xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This reduction in gastric emptying rate may contribute to satiety by prolonging gastric distention <xref rid="pone.0067482-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, it should be noted that the degree to which food viscosity influences gastric emptying might be markedly reduced by rapid dilution by gastric juice or increased motor function <xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Prove1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This is illustrated by a study by Marciani <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067482-Marciani2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> who reported that when participants consumed meals that varied 1000-fold in viscosity, gastric emptying rate only differed by a factor of 1.3. Further research is required to determine how food characteristics influence food breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>While there was no effect of food viscosity on insulin, we found that consuming the HV meal resulted in a significantly lower GIP response with a higher postprandial plasma glucose concentration with a later occurrence of the glucose peak. There is still not a consistent picture regarding the role of food viscosity on the glycemic response with studies suggesting that higher viscosity meals result in a lower glycemia response <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Flammang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> no difference <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> or a higher glycemia response <xref rid="pone.0067482-Shimoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These discrepant results may be due to differences in the methods used to increase the viscosity of the food or differences in the characteristics of participants (e.g., diabeteic or non-diabetic). With regards to guar gum, the dose added to the food may also alter the glycemic response. Torsdottir <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067482-Torsdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> have shown that while low or medium amounts of guar gum reduced plasma concentrations of glucose, a higher amount resulted in higher plasma glucose concentrations <xref rid="pone.0067482-Torsdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we did not measure appetite-related hormones, which is a limitation. A similar investigation was conducted and it was found that the viscosity of a meal does not influence plasma concentrations of hormones related to appetite in healthy participants <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As suggested by Zijlstra et al. <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, this could be because nutrients that entered the gastro-intestinal tract were the same in different test sessions, leading to the same appetite hormone responses <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Other studies have found that increasing the viscosity of a meal does affect plasma concentrations of hormones related to appetite <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067482-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Several factors may explain these discrepant results. First, these studies used different products to test the effect of viscosity on appetite (e.g., beverages and semi-solid foods) and there may be an interaction between viscosity and the delivery medium. Second, various thickening agents, such as starch <xref rid="pone.0067482-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, oat-bran <xref rid="pone.0067482-Juvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and beta-glucan <xref rid="pone.0067482-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> were used. As there may be substantial differences in how these different ingredients behave in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., ability to gel in an acid environment, digestion by enzymes), it is possible that the effect of viscosity on appetite hormones may be due, in part, to the characteristics of the thickening agent. In this study a fixed preload for all participants rather than a meal designed to meet a certain percentage of energy need for each participant was provided. This could potentially be a confounding factor. To investigate this issue, a post-hoc calculation was performed. Using the equations for estimating basal metabolic rate <xref rid="pone.0067482-Schofield1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, with a physical activity level of 1.5, we estimated the energy requirement for each participant. Results suggest the test meal provided 14.5&#x000b1;0.3% (range 13.1&#x02013;16.1%) of their energy needs. This minor variation is because the study involved only lean and overweight participants. Consequently, the conclusions from this present study cannot be extended to other populations, such as obese people. The effect of food viscosity on appetite in the obese population warrants further studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this present study suggests that the viscosity of a semi-solid food modulates glycemic response and influences postprandial satiety, by altering eating rate and gastric emptying rate. Future work should be conducted to fully elucidate how rheological properties of food affect postprandial metabolism and nutrients&#x02019; bioavailability, and how does long-term modification of rheological properties of diet influence the risk of chronic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Visha Arumugam for her technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0067482-Leidy1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
