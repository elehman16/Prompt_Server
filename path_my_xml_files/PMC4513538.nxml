Abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habit affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current treatment relies on a positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies, but many people suffer ongoing symptoms. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and self-management can be helpful, but availability is limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>To determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of therapist delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (TCBT) and web-based CBT self-management (WBCBT) in IBS, 495 participants with refractory IBS will be randomised to TCBT plus treatment as usual (TAU); WBCBT plus TAU; or TAU alone. The two CBT programmes have similar content. However, TCBT consists of six, 60&#x02005;min telephone CBT sessions with a therapist over 9&#x02005;weeks, at home, and two &#x02018;booster&#x02019; 1&#x02005;hour follow-up phone calls at 4 and 8&#x02005;months (8&#x02005;h therapist contact time). WBCBT consists of access to a previously developed and piloted WBCBT management programme (Regul8) and three 30&#x02005;min therapist telephone sessions over 9&#x02005;weeks, at home, and two &#x02018;booster&#x02019; 30&#x02005;min follow-up phone calls at 4 and 8&#x02005;months (2&#x000bd;&#x02005;h therapist contact time). Clinical effectiveness will be assessed by examining the difference between arms in the IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS SSS) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WASAS) at 12&#x02005;months from randomisation. Cost-effectiveness will combine measures of resource use with the IBS SSS at 12&#x02005;months and quality-adjusted life years.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has full ethical approval.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Treatment commonly relies on a positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies. However, the evidence base for commonly used medications such as bulking agents and antispasmodics is limited,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and many patients suffer ongoing symptoms.</p><p>Face to face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be helpful for IBS, reducing IBS symptom severity and improving QOL measures,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> and it has the potential to have long-term benefits, whereas medications are aimed at symptom relief. However, CBT is not currently routinely offered to patients with IBS due to poor availability. Additionally, face to face CBT in this setting was not shown to be cost effective in a Cochrane review<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and there are problems with limited concordance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with face to face therapy. For instance, in the Kennedy trial,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> fewer than half of the participants were considered to have completed therapy by the end of the intervention and 41% were recorded as declining therapy or dropping out, often due to time issues such as work and child care commitments. Nevertheless, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> recommends CBT for patients with refractory IBS symptoms (ie, ongoing symptoms after 12&#x02005;months despite being offered appropriate medications and lifestyle advice).</p><p>A potential approach is to consider web-based CBT for IBS. Web-based CBT has been shown to be helpful for a number of long-term conditions, for example, depression,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> tinnitus<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and fatigue in multiple sclerosis,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and is recommended in Guidelines for the management of depression.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It could be a cost-effective way of providing help to those with IBS. Recent small pilot trials show promise for web-based CBT in IBS,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> but indicate that some therapist input is needed. Web-based delivery has the advantage that it can be accessed at a time and place convenient to the participant, can be undertaken at a pace that suits each individual&#x02019;s circumstances, and does not require extra travel time and costs. The increasing availability of the Internet makes this a good medium to provide easily accessible patient information and self-management programmes. The majority of households in the UK now have web access. This is, therefore, an ideal time to assess and disseminate new web-based interventions. Members of this team have already developed a CBT website to support patients with IBS (Regul8) and trialled it among 135 patients with more than 90% follow-up in the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)-funded MIBS study.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Even with this (underpowered) sample, and very minimal nurse input, Subjects Global Assessment of Relief (SGA) scores (ie, relief from IBS symptoms) and their Enablement Scores (sense of control over their IBS) were significantly improved in the Regul8 groups compared to the non-website group at 3-month follow-up.</p><p>This trial comparing the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist delivered CBT (TCBT) and a lower intensity therapist supported web-based self-management programme will provide evidence to enable clinicians, patients and health service planners to make informed decisions regarding the management of IBS with CBT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Main Research Question</title><p>What is the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TCBT and web-based CBT (WBCBT) for patients with refractory irritable bowel syndrome?</p></sec><sec id="s2a"><title>Research objectives</title><p><italic>Primary objectives</italic>

Refractory IBS is defined for this study as fulfilling the ROME III criteria for IBS<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and reporting ongoing clinically significant symptoms determined by a IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) of 75 or more. Patients need to have been offered first-line therapies (eg, antispasmodics, antidepressants or fibre based medications) and have continuing IBS symptoms for 12&#x02005;months or more. Potential participants aged over 60&#x02005;years will only be included if they have had a consultant review in the previous 2&#x02005;years to confirm that their symptoms are related to IBS and that other serious bowel conditions have been excluded. This is because there is an increased risk of bowel cancer in the over 60&#x02005;years&#x02019; age group and clinical guidance suggests further investigations should be undertaken in this group.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p><italic>Exclusion criteria</italic>: Unexplained rectal bleeding or weight loss, diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, peptic ulcer disease or colorectal carcinoma. People unable to participate in CBT due to speech or language difficulties or those with no access to an internet computer to be able to undertake the WBCBT or who have received CBT for IBS in the past 2&#x02005;years, and those who have had previous access to the Regul8 website or who are currently participating in an IBS/intervention trial.</p><p><italic>Withdrawal criteria</italic>: Participants will be withdrawn from the trial if there are any concerns regarding informed consent. Participants can also withdraw if they choose, without giving a reason. If a participant withdraws consent for research follow-up during the trial, the trial team will be informed. Information will be collected in the Drop-out Report Form and, where possible, reason for drop out will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Planned interventions</title><p>Two methods of delivering CBT are being assessed in this study: TCBT and a lower intensity WBCBT&#x02014;the Regul8 website with some therapist support.</p><p>There are three key differences between the therapy trial arms
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The use of a CBT self-management patient manual in the TCBT arm versus access to Regul8, an interactive, tailored CBT self-management website<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> for the WBCBT arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The amount of therapist contact time/intensity of the intervention&#x02014;TCBT participants will receive a total of 8&#x02005;h of telephone therapy contact time compared to 2.5&#x02005;h in WBCBT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The TCBT telephone sessions will be formulation driven and, although based on the content of the sessions/chapters of the patient manual detailed below, order and extent to which these are covered will be individualised. For WBCBT, patients are encouraged to work sequentially through the Regul8 sessions, although the therapist may suggest they focus more on some sessions than on others.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The CBT content of the two treatments is the same and is based on an empirical cognitive behavioural model of IBS.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The model specifies that factors such as stress and/or gastric infection trigger the symptoms of IBS, which are then maintained by patients&#x02019; cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses to the symptoms. For instance, if a patient becomes anxious (emotion) about the symptoms, believes he/she has no control over them (cognitions) and responds by avoiding social situations (behaviour), this can increase anxiety and maintain symptoms through the link between a heightened autonomic nervous system and the enteric nervous system. This model was used to structure the content of the therapy sessions in our Regul8 website for the MIBS pilot study,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which, in turn, drew from two efficacious IBS RCTs conducted by members of our research team, a nurse-delivered CBT trial<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and a trial of a more minimal CBT based self-management programme.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The therapy consists of education, behavioural and cognitive techniques, aimed at improving bowel habits, developing stable, healthy eating patterns, addressing unhelpful thoughts, managing stress, reducing symptom focusing and preventing relapse.

The IBS CBT treatment model is presented alongside explanations of how the bowel works and how this relates to functional disturbances such as changes in motility and sensitivity in the gut in IBS. Therapists are taught to include predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors in their assessment and to use these in a shared conceptualisation with the patient. Obstacles to engagement and strategies for dealing with these are discussed. The specifics of each of the sessions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008622TB1">table 1</xref> are then covered. Finally, therapists receive an overview of trial protocol including recording the timing and length of sessions, any deviations from protocol including sessions missed or drop out, and confidential storage of audiorecordings.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Therapy supervision</title><p>Post-training, therapists will receive monthly 1.5&#x02005;h group supervision with TC, who covers the TCBT, and RMM, who covers the WBCBT. TC and RMM listen to one audiorecording from each therapist, and rate these recordings using the therapist rating scale, prior to supervision.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These sessions will be discussed with the group in supervision. Therapists will also have the opportunity to discuss any problem areas or challenging patients. Regular supervision will ensure that the therapists adhere to the protocols in each arm and that the quality of the therapy is maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>All telephone therapy sessions will be audiorecorded for the purpose of assessing treatment fidelity. These recordings will be used for supervision during the study and to check fidelity throughout the trial. Supervisers will listen to one TCBT and one WBCBT tape per therapist per month. A subset of the audiorecordings will be analysed by two independent clinicians once the trial has ended. At least two sessions for every therapist (when available) and for therapy type will be rated in terms of adherence to the manual or web-based approach (5 item, 7-point Likert scale). The therapeutic alliance between therapist and participant will also be rated on a seven-point Likert scale used in a previous large RCT of treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Treatment as usual</title><p>Patients in all three arms will receive TAU, with the control arm being TAU alone. TAU is defined as continuation of current medications, and usual general practitioner (GP) or consultant follow-up with no psychological therapy for IBS. All GPs or consultants involved in the study will receive a copy of the NICE Guidance for IBS at the start of the study, to ensure all clinicians have standard best practice information on IBS management. They will also receive a Desktop prompt to remind them of the guidelines and inclusion criteria. All participants will receive a standard information sheet on Lifestyle and Diet in IBS, based on the NICE guidance. Information will be collected on any changes in IBS treatments/management during the study, and numbers of GP and consultant consultations will be recorded for all three arms.</p><p>The TAU-alone participants will have access to the WBCBT website at the end of the trial follow-up period, but without the therapist support.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients will be recruited from secondary and primary care.</p><p>We plan to recruit 495 participants over 22&#x02005;months (23 randomised/month) from GP surgeries in two regions (Southampton and London) and Secondary Care Gastroenterology Clinics in two regions (Southampton and London (GSTT, King's College Hospital)).</p><p>Primary care patients will be identified by searching GPs&#x02019; lists for those with a diagnosis of IBS and by opportunistic recruitment of patients presenting with symptoms consistent with IBS. We will utilise the Clinical Research Network (CRN) to aid recruitment and retention of GP practices. We will include practices with urban and rural settings, and with a range of sociodemographic characteristics. GP practices willing to participate in the study will search their list for adult patients aged 18&#x02005;years and above with a diagnosis of IBS. Potential participants will be contacted by letter (sent by the GP surgery) informing them about the trial and inviting them to take part. The GPs will check the lists of patients to be contacted prior to the invite letters being sent out to ensure that it is appropriate to contact them. The mailing will include the Assessing Cognitive behavioural Therapy in Irritable Bowel (ACTIB) patient information sheet. Participants who are interested in participating in the study will return a reply slip with their contact details in a prepaid response envelope to the research team. GPs will also be able to opportunistically provide information about the trial to potential recruits during their GP surgeries. Thus, if a patient with IBS attends a GP consultation, GPs will give them the patient information sheet regarding the trial, and the reply slip and envelope. Invite letters will be sent out from the identified GP practices in a stepwise manner over time, and response rates will be monitored to ensure adequate recruitment levels and a steady workload for the therapists.</p><p>Secondary care patients will be identified from gastroenterology (GI) clinics. Where available, clinic lists will be searched for patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Potential participants will be contacted by letter (sent from the clinic) informing them about the trial and inviting them to take part. The Consultants will check the lists of patients to be contacted prior to the invite letters being sent out to ensure that it is appropriate to contact them. The mailing will be as for the primary care patients. The consultants will also be able to opportunistically provide information about the trial to potential recruits during their clinics.</p><p>Adverts will also be placed in relevant GP and GI clinics and on NHS websites. Clinics and GP practices will have information packs to hand out to potential participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Information is also in the Consort diagram (<xref

If it has not been completed within 1&#x02005;week of the reminder, a further two reminders will be sent. One week after that, if no data have been entered, the research team will ring the participant to ask if they can collect the data by hard copy or over the telephone. 90% follow-up was achieved (at 12&#x02005;weeks) by this method in the MIBS trial, which collected very similar baseline and outcome measures to those proposed for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Primary outcomes: IBS-SSS and WASAS</title><p>IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS SSS)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> is widely used in IBS studies.

The objectives of this study are: to identify factors that facilitate or impede adherence to web-delivered and therapist-delivered CBT; to provide insight into the quantitative results; and to explore social and psychological processes of change. Semistructured interviews will be conducted at 3 and 12&#x02005;months, with approximately 17&#x02013;20 participants per arm (ie, 10&#x02013;12%, sampled purposively to encompass a mix of gender and ages, and a range of baseline symptom severity scores). Interviewers will use topic guides comprising open-ended questions and prompts designed to elicit participants&#x02019; accounts of their experiences of IBS in relation to the trial. Interviewing participants from each active arm will enable us to identify factors related to adherence and change processes; including participants from the TAU arm will provide insight into the quantitative results. Interviewing the same participants at 3 and 12&#x02005;months will allow us greater depth to explore change processes over time and provide the potential to understand better any differences in the quantitative results between 3 and 12&#x02005;months. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Analysis will begin on completion of the first few interviews and will proceed iteratively, thus allowing early insights to be explored more fully in later interviews and topic guides to be modified if necessary. Inductive thematic analysis,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> employing supplementary techniques from grounded theory,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> will be used to code the data and to identify themes that capture key concepts and processes. To enhance quality: multiple researchers will contribute, to avoid producing idiosyncratic interpretations; a &#x02018;member check&#x02019; will be conducted whereby interviewees will be invited to comment on summaries of their interviews; and an audit trail (coding manual and notes) and interviewers&#x02019; field notes will be produced. The qualitative results will thus provide insights into the relative merits of each type of CBT and identify delivery issues to attend to in any future widespread implementation.</p></sec><sec id="s2w"><title>Proposed sample size</title><p>Sample size was based on the two primary outcomes, IBS-Symptom severity score (IBS-SSS)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and WASAS.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>A 35 point difference between therapy groups and TAU on IBS SSS at 12&#x02005;months is regarded as clinically significant (assuming a 15 point placebo response in the TAU arm in the trial).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Assuming a within-group IBS SSS standard deviation (SD) of 76 points (taken from MIBS pilot study<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), this equates to an effect size of 0.46. To achieve 90% power to detect such an effect or larger using a two-sided independent samples t test at the 2.5% significance level (adjusting for 2 primary outcomes), would require 119 subjects per group. Based on each of 10 therapists delivering therapy to 17 patients within WBCBT and TCBT groups, and an intraclass correlation of 0.02, taken from Baldwin,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> this sample size needs to be increased by an inflation factor of 1.32, to take account of therapist effects. We will measure IBS SSS at baseline and assume that baseline values are predictive of post-treatment values (correlation 0.4). Accounting for this in our statistical analysis model allows us to decrease the sample size by a deflation factor of 0.84. Finally, assuming that attrition will be less than 20%, we apply a further inflation factor (factor 1.25) to allow for this. The final sample size requirement is 165 patients per group, or 495 patients in total.</p><p>In terms of our second primary outcome (WASAS), this sample size would be sufficient to detect a clinically important difference between the WBCBT (or TCBT) and TAU groups in the WASAS. Specifically, we can assume inflation factors of 1.32 for correlation of outcomes within therapists, and of 1.25 for attrition and a deflation factor of 0.84, for correlation between baseline and follow-up measures. Therefore, a moderate effect size of 0.46 could be found with 90% power at the 2.5% significance level, given 119 participants per group. Assuming a SD of 8.0 (as estimated in a study of CBT for IBS<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), this would equate to a clinically meaningful treatment difference of 3.7 points on this scale. This is less than the difference of 5.4 points in change of means that was found in a trial of a CBT-based self-management intervention for IBS.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2x"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Statistical analysis plan has been approved by the trial steering committee. The aim is to evaluate effectiveness, and all analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Group differences on the primary IBS-SSS outcome will be assessed using a mixed linear regression model for repeated measurements. In this model, IBS-SSS at post-treatment time points (3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months) will feature as the dependent variable. Explanatory variables will be baseline IBS-SSS, treatment group, IBS symptoms type, stratifier (centre) and time and time by treatment interaction terms to allow for different group differences at the various assessment time points. (The assessment time point of primary interest is 12&#x02005;months. The modelling provides the treatment effect estimates at the 12&#x02005;month time point as well as for further post-treatment secondary time points). Correlation between repeated measures of the same participant or between participants, or due to sharing the same therapist, will be allowed for by including subject-varying random intercepts as well as therapist-varying random intercepts for TCBT and WBCBT groups in the mixed models. Mixed models account for missing outcome data under the missing at random assumption. The effect of departures from this assumption will be checked using sensitivity analyses.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> WASAS scores will be analysed using mixed models in a manner similar to the analysis of IBS-SSS. Secondary outcomes, including Subjects&#x02019; Global assessment of relief (SGA), EQ-5D, Enablement, HADS, Brief Illness perception Questionnaire (IPQ), Cognitive Scale for Functional Bowel disorders, The Belief about Emotions Scale (BES), The &#x0201c;Impoverished Emotional Experience (IEE)&#x0201d; factor of the Emotional Processing Scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), adverse events (AEs) and healthcare utilisation, are important to measure the wider IBS effects and will be analysed similarly (as appropriate for continuous or dichotomous outcomes). A complier average causal treatment effect will be estimated using instrumental variable methods to assess efficacy if there is appreciable lack of compliance.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2y"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will measure costs and assess cost-effectiveness from both a health service and a societal perspective. To calculate the cost of TCBT, the number of sessions with therapists will be recorded and combined with the unit cost of therapist time. The latter will be calculated using information on the salary band of therapists, with additional costs representing capital, overheads, training and qualifications.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> We will ask therapists to estimate how much time during a typical working week is spent in telephone contact with patients, and combine this with the total cost and total hours worked per week, in order to produce a cost per hour of direct patient contact time. For WBCBT, the number of times therapist support is provided will be recorded and costed in a similar way. The WBCBT development costs will be estimated and apportioned over those using the intervention. Other service use will be measured with a service receipt schedule at baseline (going back 6&#x02005;months) and at each follow-up (with measurement covering the whole period since the prior interview). The schedule will be based on other questionnaires used in similar research.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Services will include primary and secondary healthcare, and medication. Service costs will be generated by combining these data with appropriate unit cost information (eg, NHS Reference Costs,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and the British National Formulary) and these costs added to the intervention costs in order to generate total health costs per person.</p><p>Societal costs will be calculated by including family care costs and lost production. Family care costs will be recorded by asking patients to state how much time per week family members (and friends) spent providing support in specific areas <italic>because of the IBS</italic>. This time will be combined with average wage rates. Lost days and hours from work will be recorded on the schedule and combined with average wage rates to generate lost production costs. Cost comparisons between the three groups will be made at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months, and over the entire follow-up period, in both cases, controlling for baseline costs. Cost data are usually skewed and cost comparisons will use a bootstrapped regression model to generate appropriate 95% CIs around the cost differences.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness will be assessed (from health and societal perspectives) by combining the cost data with the change score on the IBS-SSS, WASAS and QALYs. The latter will be generated from the EQ-5D combined with UK-specific tariffs. Area under the curve methods, controlling for baseline utility, will be used to calculate the number of QALYs accrued over the follow-up period. If outcomes are better for one group compared to another and costs are lower, then it will be defined as being &#x02018;dominant&#x02019;. If outcomes are better and costs are higher, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be generated to indicate the extra cost incurred to achieve an extra point reduction in symptoms or extra QALY. Cost-effectiveness planes will be produced, using 1000 cost and outcome differences (from bootstrapped regression models) for each 2-way comparison, to explore the uncertainty around the results. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will also be produced using bootstrapped regression models with net benefit values as the dependent variables. The net benefit approach requires an assumption about the value placed on a unit improvement in outcome. For QALYs, a range from &#x000a3;0 to &#x000a3;60&#x02005;000 will be used, thus including the threshold thought to influence NICE decisions. For the IBS-SSS and WASAS, there are no accepted thresholds, so a range will be chosen such that the points at which one intervention has a 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% likelihood of being the most cost-effective option can be identified.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by changing the intervention costs upwards and downwards by 50%, using minimum wages to value lost production, family care and travel time, and by also using the replacement cost approach to value family care with the cost of a homecare worker used a shadow price.</p><p>Modelling beyond the trial period and making comparisons with other interventions is not in the scope of this project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The trial will be conducted in full accordance with current guidelines for ethical research conduct.

This may lead to societal benefits such as a reduction in work days lost and reduced use of NHS resources. The risks of undertaking CBT are minimal; undertaking the sessions will require a time commitment on behalf of the participants, and focusing on their IBS symptoms could temporarily worsen the symptoms in the short term.

This study has significant strengths: to date, ACTIB, when completed, will be the largest trial worldwide to address the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CBT for IBS and has the advantage of comparing a low intensity web-based CBT (WBCBT) with a higher intensity telephone delivered CBT (TCBT). Additionally, ACTIB will recruit from both primary and secondary care, inviting a broad range of patients with refractory IBS from specialist as well as community settings. This will aid generalisability of the findings.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that due to the online nature of the Low intensity CBT arm, patients without internet access will be unable to participate. However, internet access in the UK is currently over 75% and those without home access can use public computers (eg, local library). Also, participants aged over 60&#x02005;years are required to have undergone a consultant review to exclude other serious causes of their bowel symptoms in the past 2&#x02005;years, because colorectal cancer is more common in the those aged over 60&#x02005;years, and guidelines recommend that changes in bowel habit in this group require hospital tests beyond the scope of this trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The ACTIB trial team: Alice Sibelli; Sula Wingassen; Stephanie Hughes.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors were involved in the design of the study and were co-applicants for funding (except GO&#x02014;trial manager).
