To assess the presence of <italic>Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus</italic> (LCR35) in the vagina after an oral administration, an open randomised pilot study was conducted on 20 healthy women of child-bearing age. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. 2 groups of 10 women were given a 28-day oral course, that is, at least 108&#x02009;CFU/day (group 1) or 2 &#x000d7; 108&#x02009;CFU/day (group 2) of LCR35. Nugent score and vaginal screening for LCR35 were undertaken before and after 28 days of treatment. <italic>Results</italic>. The mean Nugent score decreased in group 1 (&#x02212;0,2) as well as in group 2 (&#x02212;0,3). 10% of women in group 1 versus 40% of women in group 2 were carrying LCR35 at the end of the trial. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. LCR35, at the minimal dose of 2 &#x000d7; 108&#x02009;CFU/day, can return the Nugent score to normal in healthy women of child-bearing age, by means of a well-tolerated vaginal temporary presence. Phase III clinical trials will specify the preventive or curative impact of this orally administered strain on a range of vaginal disorders such as bacterial vaginosis or vulvovaginal candidiasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lactobacilli play a fundamental role in the ecological balance of the vagina. Many vaginal infections result from the disappearance or the quantitative or qualitative decrease in lactobacilli naturally present in the vagina. This is particularly true with bacterial vaginosis (BV), one of the most common vaginal infections estimated to have a prevalence between 15% and 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Over the last few years, studies have been conducted to assess the usefulness of probiotics to treat or prevent vaginal infections such as BV or vaginal candidiasis. The clinical results differ widely because of the range of probiotics used, the routes of administration of probiotics (oral or vaginal), the duration of treatment and the cohorts studied. Among the points requiring clarification are the type of lactobacilli used in the probiotic preparations and the route of administration (oral or vaginal).</p><p>
<italic>Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus LCR35</italic> (<italic>LCR35</italic>) has shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that it has the required characteristics for vaginal colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>proven fast adherence (one hour) to the vaginal wall, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>prevention of growth of potential pathogens such as <italic>Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis,</italic> and<italic> Candida albicans</italic> from the 4th hour after incubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>About the route of administration, an oral preparation seems to be interesting since studies have shown that the rectum was the natural reservoir for commensal vaginal lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>An open pilot study was conducted in healthy women to assess the efficacy and safety of this route of administration for <italic>LCR35</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><p>An open randomised trial was conducted on 20 healthy women to assess the vaginal impact of the daily oral administration of two different doses of <italic>LCR35</italic> for 28 days.</p><p>The protocol was submitted to the Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise de S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; Sanitaire des Produits de Sant&#x000e9; (AFSSaPS) and the Ethics Committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes, CPP Ile de France VII) who, respectively, issued an authorisation and a favourable opinion. </p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Cohort and Trial Design</title><p>This single-centre trial (Institute Alfred Fournier, Paris) included 20 healthy women who were randomized into two groups of ten women each.</p><p>At the screening visit, inclusion criteria were women between 18 and 45 years old, premenopausal, nonpregnant, using effective contraception (i.e., all kind of contraception (hormonal, IUD, chemical, condoms) except &#x0201c;natural contraception&#x0201d; like co&#x000ef;tus interrompus), not taking any anti-infectious treatment and not immunodeficient.</p><p>All patients were asked for genital symptoms of infections (abnormal discharge, pruritus, burning, or dyspareunia etc.). Symptomatic patients were excluded.</p><p>The simple practical technique of self-sampling was chosen because studies demonstrated that self-collected samples had the same microbiological diversity as physician-collected samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All the women took a sample from their own vagina at the inclusion visit using two sterile cotton swabs mounted on a wooden handle (Deltalab) and introduced over a distance of 2 to 3 cms into the vagina. One swab was used to determine the Nugent score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The other swab was placed in a survival medium (FT-MRS) and frozen for <italic>LCR35</italic> screening.</p><p>During the screening visit, all the women received an information leaflet on the study and all signed an informed consent form.</p><p>Three to seven days later, women were included, randomised in two groups, and given the treatment.</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Group 1 (10 women): 1 gel capsule of <italic>LCR35 per os</italic> per day (i.e., a minimum of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU) for 28 days.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 2 (10 women): 2 gel capsules of <italic>LCR35 per os </italic>per day (i.e., a minimum of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU) for 28 days.</p></list-item></list><p>The period of 28 days for the control visit has been chosen to sample vaginal secretions at the same time of the menstrual cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Microbiological Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.1"><title>2.2.1. Nugent Score</title><p>After spreading the vaginal secretions on a slide and colouring with the Gram technique, the score was used to classify the vaginal microbiota in three categories: normal (0 to 3), intermediate (4 to 6), and bacterial vaginosis (7 to 10).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.2.2"><title>2.2.2. LCR35 Identification</title><p> At days D7 and D30, immediately after sampling, vaginal swabs were homogenised in FT-MRS, then the solution was divided into 6 cryotubes (containing 33% final glycerol). The divided fractions were then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C before analysis [(1) to (3)].</p><p>
<statement id="head1"><title>(1) Culture</title><p>After thawing at 37&#x000b0;C, a fraction was used to establish a diluted series at 1/10th (up to a dilution of &#x02212;7). Cultures were done on MRS, Rogosa and DP media. The Rogosa, and DP media were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 72&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C and the MRS medium was incubated in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 72&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C.

Discussion</title><p>One of the exclusion criteria was postmenopausal women, which led to an age group between 18 and 45&#x02009;years old. After menopause, the lack of oestrogen causes a change in the vaginal ecosystem, with a significant decrease in the number of lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The inclusion of postmenopausal women would therefore have introduced bias into the trial.</p><p>The exclusion of women with clinical signs of vaginal infection is justified for ethical reasons. It would have been controversial not to start specific treatment of the infection and this, again, would have introduced a bias into the trial.</p><p>On the other hand, the patient with asymptomatic BV was not excluded because there was no risk of complications (as this patient was not pregnant). Treatment of the infection could therefore be postponed, especially in the absence of any clinical symptoms.</p><p>The two bacteriological samples were taken at an interval of four weeks to ensure that the women were at the same point in their cycle or in the taking of contraception, that is, under the same conditions of hormonal impregnation as studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated slight changes in lactobacillus microbiota during the menstrual cycle.</p><p>The Nugent score has been used for this trial because, even if it is an imperfect test, it stays the benchmark score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] used to evaluate the quality of the vaginal microbiota and the load of lactobacilli in a semiquantitative manner. It is based on a direct examination after colouring of the vaginal secretions. The examination has been standardised but remains observer-dependent. During this trial, all the Nugent tests were conducted in the same microbiology laboratory (Institute Fournier, Paris) by the same observer.</p><p>At the end of treatment, <italic>LCR35</italic> was identified, by REP-PCR, four times more often (resp,. 40% versus 10% of women) among women in group 2 (at least 2 capsules dosed at 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>LCR35</italic>/day) than among the women in group 1 (at least 1 capsule dosed at 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>LCR35</italic>/day). The daily dose of <italic>LCR35</italic> therefore played a significant role in the vaginal uptake of the probiotic.</p><p>19 of the 20 treated women had a normal Nugent score at the end of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>); one woman had an intermediate score. Note that the patient with asymptomatic BV at inclusion (Nugent score &#x02265; 7) returned to a normal Nugent score at the end of the study. Thus overall, the treatment improved the Nugent scores, particularly at the dose of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>LCR35</italic>/day.</p><p>Few studies have been conducted on the vaginal uptake of lactobacilli following an oral dose of probiotics. Reid et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] randomised 42 healthy women (mean age 31 years) into 3 groups: 8.10<sup>8</sup> or 6.10<sup>9</sup> or 2 &#x000d7; 8.10<sup>8</sup> of a combination of <italic>L. rhamnosus GR-1</italic> + <italic>L. fermentum RC-14</italic> for 28 days. A change to normal vaginal microbiota (appreciated semiquantitatively by the Nugent score) was significant only at a dose of 1.6&#x000b7;10<sup>9</sup> GR-1/RC-14, showing the potential ability of oral probiotics to restore or maintain a normal vaginal ecosystem. </p><p>The same author published in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] an other study about 64 healthy women who received either an oral dose of <italic>L. rhamnosus + L. reuteri</italic> or an oral dose of placebo for 60 days. A microbiological examination showed a significant rise in the level of vaginal lactobacilli at D28 and D60 in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. However, in that study, there was no PCR identification of the strains of vaginal lactobacilli before or after treatment.</p><p>Morelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] administrated <italic>L. rhamnosus GR-I</italic> + <italic>L.fermentum RC-14</italic> for 14 days <italic>per os</italic> to a group of 10 women. A vaginal colonisation was identified by REP-PCR between 0% and 60% depending on the observation period after the oral administration.</p><p>The results of our study of <italic>LCR35</italic> therefore agree with the results of other studies using other strains of lactobacilli.</p><p>Finally, the literature on probiotics reports an improvement in general immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] when taking probiotics, mainly resulting from indirect effects:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>increased migration of immune cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, etc.);</p></list-item><list-item><p>increased phagocytosis;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Production of proinflammatory cytokines, and so forth.</p></list-item></list><p>The same type of result was shown in children with <italic>LCR35</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This randomised trial is the first formal demonstration of the positive impact of the oral administration of <italic>LCR35</italic> on vaginal microbiota. Treatment with a daily dose of 2 gel capsules <italic>LCR35 per os</italic> produced an overall decrease in the Nugent score in healthy women and, therefore, the maintenance of the quality of their vaginal microbiota. A return to normal was even observed in one case of asymptomatic BV. Our work also demonstrated, by using REP-PCR, <italic>LCR35</italic>'s ability to be temporarily present in the vagina after 28 days oral treatment without generating any adverse events. This means that the probiotic is able to survive through the gastric tract before being temporarily present in the vaginal area. Note that the vaginal impact of <italic>LCR35</italic> appears to be dose-dependent since, after treatment, we observed that 40% of women who received at least 2 capsules dosed at 10<sup>8</sup>CFU/day of <italic>LCR35</italic> were carrying <italic>LCR35</italic>, compared to only 10% of women in the group that received at least one capsule dosed at 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;CFU/day.</p><p>This shows that, at a dose of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;CFU/day, <italic>LCR35</italic> is able to restore or maintain a normal vaginal microbiota in healthy premenopausal women, with a high level of safety and compliance with treatment.</p><p>New clinical trials are now required to specify the preventive or curative impact of this strain, administered orally, in the treatment of various vaginal diseases such as BV or vulvovaginal candidiasis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
