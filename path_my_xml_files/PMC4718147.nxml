The study drug was administered orally every 8 h throughout a 5 day period. Rescue medication, metamizole 500 mg, was available during the treatment period. The evaluation of efficacy was based on patient assessments of pain intensity and pain relief. The primary end point was the mean sum of the pain intensity difference values throughout the first 8 h (SPID<sub>8</sub>).</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> Overall, 641 patients, mean age 62 (range 29&#x02013;80) yr, were analysed; mean (<sc>sd</sc>) values of SPID<sub>8</sub> were 247 (157) for dexketoprofen/tramadol, 209 (155) for dexketoprofen, 205 (146) for tramadol, and 151 (159) for placebo. The primary analysis confirmed the superiority of the combination over dexketoprofen 25 mg (<italic>P</italic>=0.019; 95% confidence interval 6.4&#x02013;73) and tramadol 100 mg (<italic>P</italic>=0.012; 95% confidence interval 9.5&#x02013;76).

Medications whose concomitant use with the study drugs or RM were not advisable or might confound the study results were restricted during pre-specified time frames (related to drug characteristics such as half-life). Restricted medications included monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, antibacterial sulphonamides, and ondansetron. Anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents were also restricted, with the exception of standard perioperative thromboprophylaxis and cardioprophylactic use of low doses of aspirin (&#x02264;325 mg). Patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, severe hepatic or severe cardiac dysfunction, history of gastrointestinal disorders, bleeding disorders, severe asthma, and epilepsy were excluded from participation in the study (according to the investigator's judgement after assessment of the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and laboratory safety tests at screening).

It was deemed that evaluations of efficacy beyond this point would not provide the same degree of assay sensitivity because of the inherent increased variability and because postoperative pain usually decreases with time owing to the normal course of healing, and pain control may become less distinguishable.<sup><xref rid="AEV457C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="AEV457C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The surgical technique and anaesthetic regimen were not standardized in the study because local standards for surgical technique and anaesthesia represent the best patient management available at each site. Potential surgical confounders were reduced by selecting only patients undergoing primary (first time) unilateral total hip arthroplasty because of primary osteoarthritis. Other important factors, such as the postoperative analgesic care, were standardized, and only those patients experiencing a certain level of pain intensity on the day after surgery were included in the study.</p><p>Given that early mobilization is crucial after hip arthroplasty, pain on movement was assessed on days 2 and 3 by means of the &#x02018;worst pain whilst moving experienced during the previous 24 h&#x02019;. The limited value of these results is acknowledged but, owing to the study characteristics, pain on movement could not have been measured on day 1 (patients could have received different treatments during this period). Moreover, other procedures to measure pain on movement, such as pain evoked by a standardized manoeuvre, might be more precise because a recall effect is avoided, but they are hardly feasible in such a well-sampled study considering the variability in strategies for early mobilization after total hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The results of the present study confirmed that dexketoprofen/tramadol 25 mg/75 mg oral fixed-dose combination was able to provide analgesic efficacy greater than was achieved with each component in monotherapy, one of them administered at a higher dose than in the combination (tramadol 100 mg). The efficacy results were consistent after single- and multiple-dose administration, thus supporting the selection of the doses and the posology (dosing) proposed according to the previous phase II dose-finding study.<sup><xref rid="AEV457C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The fact that the sensitivity analysis of the primary end point including all patients without major protocol violations did not reach statistical significance was possibly related to the reduction in the overall number of patients.</p><p>Regarding safety, results showed no increase of ADRs with the fixed-dose combination over the single agents. Most of the serious ADRs reported in the dexketoprofen/tramadol-treated patients are already described in dexketoprofen Summary of Product Characteristics [and also associated with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)] with a low frequency, as follows: laryngeal oedema (rare=0.01&#x02013;0.1%) and face and periorbital oedema (angioedema, facial oedema; very rare/isolated reports &#x02264;0.01%). Angioneurotic oedema is also associated with tramadol (rare=0.01&#x02013;0.1%). The serious ADR haematuria could plausibly be attributed to other concomitant treatments (rivaroxaban) received by the patient.</p><p>Nevertheless, safety results should be considered cautiously because the study, being primarily intended to assess the short-term analgesic efficacy of dexketoprofen/tramadol, lacks the power fully to assess specific risks, for instance those associated with the use of NSAIDs, such as cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, the study population was selected according to the current restrictions for the single components because all precautions for use applicable for the single agents remain applicable to the combination. In particular, non-selective NSAIDs should be used with caution in the postoperative setting because the antiplatelet effect may result in an increase of perioperative blood loss.<sup><xref rid="AEV457C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="AEV457C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Likewise, clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of some NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombotic events.<sup><xref rid="AEV457C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Consequently, patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebrovascular disease) should be treated with NSAIDs only after careful consideration.</p><p>In conclusion, the study results provided robust evidence of the efficacy of dexketoprofen/tramadol fixed-dose combination in the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain, with a safety profile fully in line with that previously known for the single agents in monotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Study design: H.J.M., R.A.M., M.B., B.P.V., S.C., M.P.C., A.N.</p><p>Patient recruitment and data collection: A.B., O.G., B.F., N.P., S.P., M.M., L.B., L.S., V.Z., M.L.A.</p><p>Data analysis: H.J.M., R.A.M., M.B., B.P.V., S.C., A.N.</p><p>Preparation of the manuscript: H.J.M., R.A.M., B.P.V., S.C.</p><p>All authors contributed to the development of interim and final drafts, and read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/bja/aev457/-/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>British Journal of Anaesthesia</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The study sponsor (Menarini Group) contributed to the study design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.
