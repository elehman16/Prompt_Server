Numerous studies suggest that providing informal (unpaid) care during a prolonged period of time results in a morbidity-generating burden. Caregivers constitute a high-risk group that experiences elevated stress levels, which reduce their quality of life.</p><p>Different strategies have been proposed to improve management of this phenomenon in order to minimize its impact, but definitive conclusions regarding their effectiveness are lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A community clinical trial is proposed, with a 1-year follow-up period, that is multicentric, controlled, parallel, and with randomized allocation of clusters in 20 health care centers within the Community of Madrid. The study's objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a standard care intervention in primary health care (intervention CuidaCare) to improve the quality of life of the caregivers, measured at 0, 6, and 12 months after the intervention.</p><p>One hundred and forty two subjects (71 from each group) &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, identified by the nurse as the main caregivers, and who provide consent to participate in the study will be included.</p><p>The main outcome variable will be perceived quality of life as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). The secondary outcome variables will be EQ-5D Dimensions, EQ-5D Index, nursing diagnosis, and Zarit's test. Prognostic variables will be recorded for the dependent patient and the caregiver.</p><p>The principle analysis will be done by comparing the average change in EQ-5D VAS value before and after intervention between the two groups. All statistical tests will be performed as intention-to-treat. Prognostic factors' estimates will be adjusted by mixed-effects regression models. Possible confounding or effect-modifying factors will be taken into account.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Assistance for the caregiver should be integrated into primary care services. In order to do so, incorporating standard, effective interventions with relevant outcome variables such as quality of life is necessary.

The <italic>World Population Ageing (2009)</italic> report published by the United Nations in January 2010 shows that we are facing a general and unprecedented problem. According to their data and estimations, 11% of the population was &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years old in 2009, and this figure is estimated to increase up to 22% in 2050. The report highlights that one of the fastest growing segments of the population will be the &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;year old, which will constitute 20% of the &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;year old group by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The situation in Spain shows similar figures. The current aging index is 17%, 4% of people are &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years old, and it is forecasted that 37% of the total population will be &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years by 2049 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>This demographic phenomenon poses important economic and social health-related challenges. In the social realm, population aging influences migration tendencies as well as family composition and individual roles within it. In the health setting, morbidity related to the aging process and increases in the prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases entails the emergence of dependency and a growing need for health care and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The European Council defines dependency as the state in which people, due to causes linked to the lack or loss of physical, psychological, or intellectual autonomy, are in need of assistance and/or significant help to carry out common activities of daily life, and particularly those related to personal care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In Spain it is estimated that 9% of the total population present some handicap or limitation, of which one third shows severe dependency requiring help from someone to perform basic activities of daily living (BADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The percentages of people &#x0003e;65 and &#x0003e;85&#x000a0;years old with any handicap are 32.2% and 63.3%, respectively. According to the <italic>Encuesta Nacional de Salud 2011/2012</italic>, 34.2% of the population &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years in Spain state being in need of help for carrying out any BADL related to personal care, 37.5% for performing house work, and 36.2% do not consider themselves able to perform those related to mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Care of the dependent person</title><p>In situations of dependency, two care alternatives are usually present, formal and informal. Formal care has been defined as those services that are offered by a professional in a specialized manner and go further than the capabilities that people have to take care of themselves or others. It is usually provided by public institutions or hired from private companies by the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Informal care is that which stems from the family environment or social network of the dependent person. Its main features are its unpaid character, being carried out in the private realm, having a highly marked domestic content, and a mainly female profile. The person who assumes responsibility for the support and daily care of the dependent person is called the main caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is interdependency between the formal and informal care sectors. In Spain, our model of home assistance for dependent people is based on the family as the care-giving unit, and health care is mainly provided by primary care. It is estimated that the family bears 88% of the total care time consumed by the dependent person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The typical profile of the main caregiver is female (83%), of low educational level, who invests an average of 4 hours a day, without rest breaks, and receiving scarce institutional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. According to the <italic>Encuesta Nacional de Salud 2011/2012 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], 16.6% of men and 49.4% of women who live with handicapped people are responsible for providing care to them all by themselves.</p></sec><sec><title>The main caregivers as a vulnerable group</title><p>Providing informal care is considered as an important stress source, even resulting in higher stress levels for caregivers than for the patients themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the last years, numerous articles have concluded that providing informal care constitutes an under-diagnosed, morbidity-generating circumstance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The outcome of a prospective cohort study with a 4.5-year follow-up period indicated that married caregivers between 66 and 96 years old who took care of their couples had a 63% higher probability of dying from any cause within a follow-up period of 4 years compared to a control group of non-caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Studies of qualitative outcomes, such as the one by Teschendorf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], identify 4 categories of concerns and requests of cancer patients' caregivers: health care, strategies about how to deal with the role of a caregiver, emotional support, and social recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions and strategies that take care of the main caregiver</title><p>In the last years, there is remarkable interest in evaluating the effect that interventions for the caregiver have on their health condition and quality of life, and published relevant systematic reviews are plentiful.</p><p>In a systematic review including 112 clinical trials whose objective was to evaluate the effect of different interventions on the burden of the main caregiver of demented patients, Goy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] conclude that complex interventions reduce the burden and increase the capacity to deal with it, especially when they are personalized, provided in the home, and oriented towards the specific needs of the caregiver-patient pair. The effect of personal assessment and support groups may vary depending on the trainer&#x02019;s degree of skill, environment, frequency and duration of the contact, and employed teaching materials.</p><p>In another systematic review published by Parker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to evaluate the effectiveness of psycho-educational interventions for caregivers of non-institutionalized patients with dementia, 12 of the 13 reviewed studies observed a significant association between such interventions and caregivers&#x02019; depression and overload. These authors conclude that interventions are more effective if there is a personalized program, active participation of the caregiver, and specific information is given. Those interventions that only provide mutual support, group work, and self-help materials do not seem to affect the burden.</p><p>In 2011, The Cochrane Collaboration published 2 systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that evaluated the effectiveness of support interventions on the health of main caregivers of dependent people suffering from different pathologies.</p><p>Candy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] included 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,836 caregivers of terminal stage patients who received support interventions for the caring of the dependent person, emotional support, and/or tools to deal with it. The results suggest that emotional support interventions may help reduce the psychological unrest of the caregivers.</p><p>Legg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] included 8 clinical trials with a total of 1,007 caregivers of dependent patients suffering from stroke sequelae. They evaluated the effect of non-pharmacological interventions versus standard care. They classified the interventions into support and information, teaching of procedures, and psycho-educational. The results suggest that psycho-educational interventions before discharge of the patient have greater impact on the caregiver's burden.</p><p>However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effect that the interventions directed at the main caregiver have on their health and quality of life. The main limitations described in these reviews are related to the large number of different interventions evaluated, their complexity, and the difficulty of reproducing them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Among the recommendations for future research, it is suggested that studies evaluate interventions in various contexts, implement methods to avoid losses to follow-up of the studied subjects, and evaluate different implementation strategies to determine the interventions&#x02019; acceptability, viability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Review studies show that quality of life, anxiety and depression levels, stress, and overload of the main caregiver are the outcome measurements used most frequently as main or secondary variables to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at the caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Several studies from our setting use EuroQol (EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The number of clusters is sufficient for the randomization to balance potentially confounding factors among themselves and we consider modelization techniques which take into account the intracluster correlation.</p><p>Given the nature of the intervention, it cannot be masked. However, we have designed a blind evaluation of the outcome.</p><p>Subjects will be recruited for the study by their own nurses.

We are aware that a bias is introduced, but they are motivated and engaged professionals who will facilitate the development of innovative interventions such as CuidaCare.</p><p>Despite loses to follow-up in primary care being minimal as a result of the user's proximity to the system and the possibilities the health professional has to contact relatives and friends, we have estimated a high percentage in the trial due to the high morbidity-mortality of dependent patients, which will force the caregiver to abandon the trial due to the patient's hospitalization or death.</p><p>The design of the trial is pragmatic, which will allow evaluating not only its effectiveness, but also its applicability in the context of primary care.</p><p>We consider that a structured, standardized intervention can improve the quality of life of older caregivers. Detailed information about the intervention, informal care, and dependency degree of the relative receiving care can contribute to understanding what types of strategies result in improvements to the quality of life of the caregiver, and to pay attention to relevant factors which allow for designing more specific and homogeneous care plans for this population.</p><p>Currently, studies on the effectiveness of nursing interventions are very limited in this field. This project can contribute to opening new research lines on nursing approaches to care problems of informal caregivers in primary care, help compare the effectiveness among different nursing interventions, and their associated cost-effectiveness analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BADL: Basic activities of daily living; CI: Confidence interval; EQ-5D: EuroQol-5D; HRQL: Health-related quality of life; PHCC: Primary health care center; NANDA-I: North American Nursing Diagnosis Association-International; NIC: Nursing interventions classification; NOC: Nursing outcomes classification; VAS: Visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MRB, EEM, and CFA conceived the study.
