The study used a double-blind, randomized, 2&#x000d7;2 crossover-design principle. Calculated pharmacokinetic parameters for both formulations were consistent with previous reports. According to the observation of vital signs and laboratory measurement, no subjects had any adverse reactions. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of the test drug/reference drug for tramadol were 100.2% (95.3%&#x02013;103.4%) for the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last measurable concentration, 99.6% (94.2%&#x02013;102.7%) for the AUC from administration to infinite time, and 100.8% (93.1%&#x02013;106.4%) for maximum concentration. For the 90% confidence intervals of the test/reference AUC ratio and maximum concentration ratio of tramadol, both were in the acceptance range for bioequivalence. According to the two preparations by pharmacokinetic parameter statistics, the half-life, mean residence time, and clearance values showed no significant statistical differences. Therefore, the conclusion of this study was that the two tramadol formulations (tablets and capsules) were bioequivalent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>tramadol hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>in vitro release</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetic</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>fluorescence detector</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tramadol hydrochloride is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic opioid drug, similar to codeine and morphine in its structure. It works through the inhibition of neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline by weak opioid-receptor agonists, and increases the concentration of serotonin, influencing pain transmission and producing an analgesic effect. In some acute pain conditions, it has proven efficacy and safety, including trauma, renal or biliary colic, and childbirth pains. Chronic pain of malignant or benign origin, in particular neuropathic pain, is a common indication for tramadol.<xref rid="b1-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Tramadol&#x02019;s intensity is only an eighth to a tenth that of morphine, with no inhibition of respiration and little dependence. Tramadol is available in various dosage forms for oral administration, such as tablets, capsules, and sustained-release formulations. It is mostly eliminated via biotransformation in the liver in two main pathways: <italic>O</italic>-demethylation to <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol (M1) (the pharmacologically active metabolite) by isoenzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), and <italic>N</italic>-demethylation to <italic>N</italic>-desmethyltramadol (M2) by cytochromes (CYP2B6 and CYP3A4).<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among these metabolites, only <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol (M1 metabolite) is pharmacologically active.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Approximately 10%&#x02013;30% of the parent drug is excreted unmetabolized in the urine.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The mean absolute bioavailability of tramadol with all oral formulations is approximately 70%. With plasma protein binding of about 20%. Tramadol has linear pharmacokinetic significance in the therapeutic dose range. It is dose-dependent for the relationship between serum concentrations and the analgesic effect, and it varies greatly from individual to individual. The literature has shown that serum concentrations at 100&#x02013;300 ng/mL were usually an effective concentration.<xref rid="b5-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The maximum daily recommended dose for clinical use is 400 mg/day.<xref rid="b6-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Several bioanalytical methods have been reported to determine tramadol alone or in combination with its metabolites in a variety of biological matrices. Methods for estimating tramadol alone have been described, employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet light,<xref rid="b7-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> fluorescence,<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> diode-array detection,<xref rid="b10-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection,<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and mass-spectrometry detection.<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In recent years, because of lower prices, generic drugs have been getting more popular among patients. Therefore, bioequivalence study is a commonly accepted method to prove the similar efficacy of two formulations.<xref rid="b15-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the People&#x02019;s Republic of China (PRC), Tramal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Gr&#x000fc;nenthal, Germany) is currently a commercially available tramadol capsule, and some generic versions of tramadol tablets have already been developed with lower cost and applied for clinical use. Although the generic and the innovator formulation contain the same active ingredients, they have a different production process and use different accessories. Those factors may affect the release speed and absorption degree in vivo. Therefore, the main purpose of bioequivalence testing is to verify whether the two formulations in humans have the same effect. The aim of this study was to assess bioequivalence for the same dose (100 mg) of the two tramadol formulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty healthy male volunteers were recruited from the Department of Pharmacology of our hospital. The criteria for the male subjects were as follows: age 18&#x02013;35 years, body weight within the normal range (body mass index between 19.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 24.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), systolic blood pressure of 110&#x02013;120 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 70&#x02013;80 mmHg. In addition, the criteria also included current nonsmoking and normal routine clinical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and laboratory test items (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis). Participants needed to have human immunodeficiency virus-, hepatitis B-, and hepatitis C-negative test results. All qualified participants signed an informed consent form (institutional review board, protocol number 93025410).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Drugs and materials</title><p>The test formulation of tramadol tablets (50 mg) was produced by CSPC Pharm, Shijiazhuang, PRC. The batch number was 080121. The reference formulation of tramadol capsules (50 mg) was obtained from the local hospital. The batch number was J20110065.</p><p>Tramadol and <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol (purity 99.3% and 99.1%, respectively) were provided by the National Institute for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, PRC). The internal standard, fluconazole (purity 98.7%), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Acetonitrile and ethyl acetate were of analytical grade, and provided by Shanghai Chemical Reagents Company, PRC. Purified water from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, USA) was used throughout the experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>In vitro dissolution study</title><p>Before performing the in vivo bioequivalence study, the researchers prepared two formulations in a head-to-head in vitro dissolution experiment. The results for in vitro dissolution data were acceptable as per the regulatory guidelines for conducting bioequivalence studies.<xref rid="b16-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Based on the principles of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia rotating basket method, dissolution testing required that each formulation have six parallel tests, and the results are expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation. Dissolution conditions were an HCl 0.1 M solution of 900 mL as dissolution medium maintained at a basket rotation speed of 50 rotations per minute. The dissolution medium was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C. At 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minutes, the samples were drawn. Each sample was analyzed by HPLC to determine the dissolution rate. By using standard mathematical equations on average dissolution value at each interval time point, the dissimilarity factor (f<sub>1</sub>) and similarity factor (f<sub>2</sub>) of the two preparations were calculated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design was a randomized, open-label 2&#x000d7;2 crossover.

A table of random numbers was used to assign subjects in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 100 mg dose (two capsules or two tablets given with 150 mL of water) of the test or reference formulation of tramadol. Prior to treatment, each subject underwent an overnight fast for at least 10 hours and during each treatment; a standard meal was served 4 hours after dosing. A 2-week washout period followed administration of the initial formulation, after which the alternate formulation was administered.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes prior to drug-administration zero time, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Blood samples (5 mL) were centrifuged (3,000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes), and the plasma collected was stored at &#x02212;18&#x000b0;C until analysis. To a 500 &#x003bc;L aliquot of plasma sample in a 10 mL clean glass tube, 20 &#x003bc;L of the internal standard fluconazole (500 &#x003bc;g/mL), and 250 &#x003bc;L of NaOH (0.2 mol/L) were added. The samples were vortexed for 1 minute, and 4 mL ethyl acetate was added. The mixture was vortex-mixed for 5 minutes. After centrifugation (3,000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes), the upper organic layer was transferred into a clean glass tube and evaporated to dryness at 40&#x000b0;C under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in a 100 &#x003bc;L mobile phase, and transferred to an autosampler vial. An aliquot of 20 &#x003bc;L was injected into the HPLC system for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytical method</title><p>Tramadol concentrations were determined using HPLC fluorescence detection based on the method of De Leo et al.<xref rid="b18-dddt-9-1225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> An Agilent G1321 fluorescence detector was operated at an excitation wavelength of 275 nm and an emission wavelength of 302 nm. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Gemini C18 column (150&#x000d7;2.0 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m; Phenomenex, USA) with a Security Guard C18 guard column. A mixture of acetonitrile and 0.04 mol/L NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> (pH 4.0) =25:75 (v/v) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature of the column and autosampler was maintained at 35&#x000b0;C and 4&#x000b0;C, respectively. The chromatographic run time of each sample was 12 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Method validation</title><sec><title>Precision and accuracy</title><p>The precision and accuracy of the assay were obtained by comparing the predicted concentration (obtained from the calibration curve), with the actual concentration of tramadol and <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol spiked in blank plasma. Intraday precision was determined by repeated analysis of each quality-control sample on day 1 (n=5), and interday precision was determined by repeated analysis on 5 consecutive days (n=1 series per day). Precision is expressed as the interday and intraday coefficients of variation ([standard deviation/mean of the recoveries] &#x000d7;100%). Accuracy was defined as the relative deviation in the computed value (E) of a standard from that of its true value (T), expressed as a percentage (RE%). It was calculated using the formula RE% = (E &#x02212; T)/T &#x000d7;100. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was considered as the concentration of tramadol and <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol that produced a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10.</p></sec><sec><title>Selectivity and specificity</title><p>Tests for selectivity were carried out in six different lots of blank plasma (with heparin sodium as anticoagulant).

These samples were frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 7 days, and then thawed at room temperature. After being allowed to completely thaw, the samples were refrozen for 24 hours under the same conditions. This freeze&#x02013;thaw cycle was repeated three times before these samples were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Recovery determination</title><p>The absolute recovery of tramadol and <italic>O</italic>-desmethyltramadol was determined by direct comparison of peak areas from extracts versus spiked postextraction samples at 10, 100, and 800 ng/mL and 5, 50, and 500 ng/mL.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tolerability</title><p>Tolerability assessment was primarily completed by monitoring the subject&#x02019;s vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate). Time points were measured at baseline (predose) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after administration. At baseline and after completion of the study, laboratory tests (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis) were performed. Subjects were fully informed of adverse events that may occur during the test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic study</title><p>The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods: maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and time to C<sub>max</sub> were obtained directly from the experimental data. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from administration to infinite time (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) was calculated using the trapezoidal method: trapezoidal area from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>), extrapolated to infinite time, by addition of the area obtained from the last measurable concentration divided by the terminal elimination rate constant (&#x003b2;); &#x003b2; was estimated from the linear least-squared regression of the terminal phase of the log concentration&#x02013;time profile. The apparent biological half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) was calculated as 0.693/&#x003b2;. The formula of AUMC/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> was applied to determine the mean residence time values.
