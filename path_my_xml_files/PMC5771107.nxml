These results partially comply with the study done by Bhardwaj <italic>et al</italic>. in which both techniques were used over 7 patients at 20 sites in anterior maxillary and mandibular gingiva. After 6 months of follow up, repigmentation was found in one of the knife-treated sites, but no reoccurrence was found in diode laser-treated sites.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, repigmentation after 6 months was also found to be completely absent in some studies.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>At the end of 9-month study period, the repigmentation was observed in all the cases in Group I, but in Group II, two cases did not show any repigmentation. These results show that although the pigmentation did reappear at the end of 9 months, it was still significantly less than the preoperative observations in both the groups. It was seen as very small spots, dots, or streaks of very mild intensity as compared to dark continuous bands of heavy or moderate intensity preoperatively. These results are in accordance with the study done by Kaur <italic>et al</italic>. on twenty patients treated for gingival hyperpigmentation (surgical removal). After 9 months of follow-up period, repigmentation was observed in 75% of the cases. About 5 cases showed no repigmentation in any of the segments.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Gupta <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the effect of surgical scraping and electrosurgery in 15 patients for reoccurrence of pigmentation of gingiva. After 9-month follow-up period, repigmentation was observed in 7 cases. The reoccurrence of gingival pigmentation was more on surgically treated sites.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, these results are in contradiction with the studies who reported the absence of repigmentation even after 9 months of follow-up.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, some authors have reported pigmentation to remain absent for longer than 9 months, for instance, Perlmutter and Tal reported the case of one patient in whom gingival repigmentation occurred 7 years after removal of gingival tissues.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>There may be various reasons for the repigmentation in the present study. The most important may be the migration and activity of melanocytic cells from the surrounding areas. Active melanocytes from adjacent pigmented tissues migrate to the treated areas, causing reoccurrence of pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Melanocytes have a reproductive self-maintaining system of cells.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another reason may be the melanocytes which are left during surgery. These may become activated and start synthesizing melanin. Ginwalla <italic>et al</italic>. also attributed the repigmentation to the left out melanocytes.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>When the two groups were compared, the mean repigmentation score was less in the diode laser group at all time intervals although the difference was statistically significant at 3 months only (<italic>P</italic> = 0.040) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>]. These findings show that the repigmentation was lesser in cases treated with laser as compared to knife-treated sites up to 3 months of interval, but at 6 and 9 months, the results were statistically comparable. These results are in accordance with the studies who also reported the reoccurrence of pigmentation with both the treatment modalities.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] On an average, the epithelium of vestibular gingiva is 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.07 mm thick, and the required depth of epithelial dissection for treating gingival pigmentation must be more than 0.31 mm deep.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, as per the results of our study, the use of Kirkland knife for gingival depigmentation might not have been able to completely eliminate cells from the basal cell layer that contribute to melanin reappearance, while laser, which has been seen to penetrate up to 0.50 mm, may have penetrated to the required depth for better removal of melanin pigmentation in comparison to surgical method.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, at 6 and 9 months, the two treatment modalities showed comparable results with respect to reappearance of pigmentation which indicates that the melanocytes may have repopulated the treated sites from adjacent tissues. Soliman <italic>et al</italic>. discussed the use of soft-tissue diode laser in the treatment of oral hyperpigmentation and found that some underlying melanocytes were not sufficiently affected by the heat to be destroyed which causes repopulation of melanocytes at treated areas causing repigmentation of gingiva.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Furthermore, Azzeh <italic>et al</italic>. stated that because of the presence of rete pegs in oral epithelium, ablation of the epithelium at the same level may not remove all melanocytes which repopulate the treated area and cause repigmentation.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Gingival hyperpigmentation is seen as a genetic trait in some populations and is more appropriately termed physiologic or racial gingival pigmentation. It has also been suggested that although pigmentation under normal conditions is genetically determined, its particular distribution in the mouth may be the result of secondary influences and perhaps environmental factors. High levels of oral melanin pigmentation are normally observed in individuals of African, East-Asian, or Hispanic ethnicity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the present study, most of the patient's facial complexion was dark or wheatish or brown. Various authors have stated that the color of the gingiva is comparable to the facial complexion, due to the activity of melanocytes present.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Physiologic pigmentation is probably genetically determined, but, as suggested by Dummett, the degree of pigmentation is partially related to mechanical, chemical, and physical stimulation.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Kaur <italic>et al</italic>. observed that all (100%) the 3 patients with dark complexion had repigmentation, whereas 12 (85.71%) out of 14 wheatish- or brown-complexioned patients had repigmentation after surgery except 3 fair-complexioned patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Ponnaiyan <italic>et al</italic>. observed that dark-skinned individuals had heavy gingival pigmentation whereas fair-skinned individuals had mild pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] These statements may be employed to the above findings even for repigmentation cases with different facial complexions and the possible reason may be the rate of melanogenesis, which is genetically maintained and higher in dark-complexioned patients as compared to light-complexioned cases.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] This relationship of duration and intensity of repigmentation with the complexion of person or race must be taken into consideration while comparing the results of various studies done in different races. Although the results of this study are encouraging even with small sample size and short-term study period, further research with longer period of clinical observations, along with histological studies to observe the causes of repigmentation are needed. Furthermore, research should focus on finding a solution for preventing recurrence that necessitates repeated depigmentation to eliminate the unsightly pigmented gingiva.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The repigmentation was found to be less in diode laser-treated sites (up to 3 months) as compared to Kirkland knife-treated sites. Both the procedures did not result in any postoperative complication and the gingiva healed uneventfully. Surgical method is recommended in consideration of being simple, easy to perform, and laser ablation for gingival depigmentation has been recognized as one of the most effective, pleasant and reliable techniques that offers bloodless, painless, and sterile field with better patient compliance and satisfaction.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was
