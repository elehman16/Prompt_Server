The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of nutraceutical combinations (NC) has not been investigated in patients with low-grade systemic inflammation and normal-borderline cholesterol levels. This is a 3-month prospective randomized open-label interventional study in patients with elevated plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (&#x0003e;2&#x02009;mg/L) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 100&#x02013;160&#x02009;mg/dL. The effect of either an oral cholesterol-lowering nutraceutical combination (NC) or no active treatment (noNC) was tested on LDL cholesterol, hsCRP and endothelial microparticle (EMPs) levels. Patients taking the NC had a significant reduction of total (&#x02212;12%) and LDL cholesterol (&#x02212;23%) compared to those who received noNC (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for both). Also, hsCRP and EMPs were significantly reduced by the NC (&#x02212;41% and &#x02212;16%, respectively). LDL cholesterol change was positively associated with hsCRP (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) and EMP changes (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), hsCRP and EMP changes being associated with each other (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005). Patients experiencing both LDL cholesterol and hsCRP reduction were those having the greatest EMP decrease. In conclusion, among patients with low-grade systemic inflammation, an oral NC significantly improved cholesterol profile and attenuated the degree of systemic inflammation and endothelial injury.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

The &#x0201c;Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study&#x0201d; (AFCAPS/TexCAPS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and the &#x0201c;Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin&#x0201d; (JUPITER)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, have demonstrated that statin therapy can reduce cholesterol and hsCRP levels, these reductions being associated with a significant improvement of cardiovascular risk. Interestingly, patients with high hsCRP levels obtained a relevant prognostic benefit from statin therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Hence, it is believed that attenuation of inflammation by cholesterol-lowering may have a positive influence on vascular injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and cardiovascular prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Despite this evidence, there are several issues limiting an adequate control of combined lipid disorders and the connected low-grade systemic inflammation: these include lack of combination therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, statin intolerance leading to limited adherence and compliance and consequent drug discontinuation with poor control of plasma lipid levels in specific populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. With this backgound, novel and safe tools to facilitate the control of lipid abnormalities and of low-grade systemic inflammation are desirable.</p><p>Some nutraceuticals have become an attractive tool for cardiovascular prevention because they have been successfully used to treat patients with high cholesterol levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Red yeast rice, the product of fermentation of rice by the yeast Monascus purpureus, contains monacolins and other substances with cholesterol-lowering efficacy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Particularly, by inhibiting hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase (HMGCoAr), monacolin K reduces cholesterol synthesis with a statin-like mechanism of action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Berberine is an herbal extract which is claimed to have significant lipid-lowering properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Policosanol is a mixture of long-chain aliphatic alcohols, whose cholesterol-lowering properties are still controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Interestingly, red yeast rice, berberine and policosanol showed anti-inflammatory and/or anti-oxidative effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> other than cholesterol-lowering effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Also, astaxanthin, a lipophilic, pinkish-orange carotenoid, demonstrated both anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>The combination of the latter nutraceuticals with folic acid and coenzyme Q10 reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and improved endothelial function and aortic stiffness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. However, there is evidence that cholesterol-lowering is directly related to pre-treatment cholesterol levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>; also, inflammation reduced the degree of cholesterol-lowering by inducing HMGCoAr resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Finally, the ability of this nutraceutical combinations (NC) to reduce hsCRP and EMP levels in patients with low-grade systemic inflammation has not been tested so far. Hence, whether this NC holds its cholesterol-lowering efficacy and reduces systemic inflammation and endothelial fragmentation in patients with elevated hsCRP levels and normal-borderline cholesterol levels need to be clariifed.</p><p>We investigated in a 3-month prospective randomized open-label intervention with blinded end-point evaluation the effect of an oral NC containing red yeast rice, berberine, policosanol, astaxanthin, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 on lipid profile, hsCRP and EMP levels in patients with sub-clinical systemic inflammation and normal-borderline cholesterol levels.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study consisted of a 3-month prospective randomized open-label intervention with blinded end-point evaluation in 100 patients who had been referred to our Lipid Clinic for cardiovascular risk assessment (University of Perugia, Italy), since january 1<sup>st</sup> 2015 to march 30<sup>th</sup> 2015. Participants recruitment was planned to be extended after the sample size had been reached until march 30<sup>th</sup> 2015.

Independent-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to compare the study variables between patients assigned to either the NC or the noNC arm. Correlation analyses were performed using either Pearson&#x02019;s or Spearman&#x02019;s coefficients of correlations. Base 10 logarithmic (log) transformation was performed for skewed variables and the log-values were used. Linear regression analysis was used to predict baseline log-hsCRP levels by including the following independent variables: age, gender, waist circumference and baseline LDL cholesterol levels. Additional regression models with log-EMP levels as dependent variable were carried out by including or not log-hsCRP levels as independent variable; nested model comparisons using the R<sup>2</sup> change F-test was used to compare models including or not plasma log-hsCRP levels. Paired two-tailed t-tests were performed to assess the influence of either NC or noNC therapies on the study variables. Two-ways analysis of variance for repeated measures (General Linear Model, GLM) was used to compare the response of the study variables to the NC or noNC treatments. Changes of the study variables after the 3-month therapy (Primary outcome measure: LDL cholesterol. Secondary outcome measures: hsCRP and EMPs) was calculated as the difference between baseline values and those at the end of the study intervention. Linear regression analysis was carried out to predict LDL cholesterol variation by including the following independent variables: age, gender, baseline LDL cholesterol levels, log-hsCRP levels and treatment group.

Accordingly, in those studies where pre-treatment LDL cholesterol levels ranged from 150&#x02009;mg/dL to 175&#x02009;mg/dL, the NC reduced LDL cholesterol from 15% up to 23%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The same NC reduced LDL cholesterol by 32% in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia who had a mean baseline LDL cholesterol level above 200&#x02009;mg/dL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, thus suggesting a possible direct association between baseline cholesterol levels and the degree of cholesterol reduction obtained after the NC treatment.</p><p>On the basis of these premises, a possible loss of cholesterol-lowering efficacy of an oral NC might be hypotesized in patients with normal-borderline cholesterol levels. Moreover, evidence showing that inflammatory stress mitigated the cholesterol-lowering obtained from HMGCoAr inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> might suggest the hypotesis of an additional loss of cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the aforementioned NC.</p><p>Despite this background, we found for the first time that a 3-month NC treatment in patients with increased hsCRP levels and normal-borderline cholesterol levels reduced LDL cholesterol by 23% compared to noNC. This result is in line with previous observations by our and other groups in patients with mild cholesterol elevations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Interestingly, in the present study, the multivariate regression analysis showed that neither baseline LDL cholesterol nor pre-treatment hsCRP levels interfered with the known cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the NC; moreover, subgroup analyses in patients with either baseline hsCRP above 3&#x02009;mg/L or LDL cholesterol levels below 130&#x02009;mg/dL showed that the NC still reduced significantly LDL cholesterol (results not shown). Hence, we suggest a stable cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the studied NC in patients with normal-borderline cholesterol levels and hsCRP levels above 2&#x02009;mg/L.</p><p>There are possible explanations of the retained LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the studied NC. First, Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> found that pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced statin resistance by disrupting HMGCoAr feedback regulation; in the present study, the presence of a low-grade systemic inflammation instead of a high-grade inflammation induced by LPS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> might have been unable to induce a significant HMGCoAr resistance. Second, additional cholesterol-lowering mechanisms other than HMGCoAr inhibition have been proposed for the components of this NC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition by berberine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and increased sterol excretion by red yeast rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Third, the presence in this NC of compounds with a possible anti-inflammatory action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> might have mitigated HMGCoAr resistance, thus promoting an effective cholesterol-lowering. These explanations are all speculative because they were not proved in the present study.</p><p>Another finding emerging from the present study is the NC-mediated reduction of hsCRP levels. We found that hsCRP reduction was achieved in 72% of patients randomized to receive the NC, thus supporting a significant anti-inflammatory effect of this NC. Available literature on the effect of this NC on inflammation is limited to one 8-week randomized, double-blind crossover study by Ruscica <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The Authors found that this NC administred in patients with the metabolic syndrome reduced LDL cholesterol by 21%, but they failed to find any influence of the NC on hsCRP levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. However, higher baseline hsCRP-levels, longer duration of the active treatment, lower prevalence of smokers and lower HDL cholesterol levels in the present study might explain the different results.</p><p>We found a statistically significant bivariate association between LDL cholesterol and hsCRP variations; also, the regression analysis including hsCRP variation as dependent variable, showed that the association between LDL cholesterol and hsCRP variations was lost when the analysis was adjusted for treatment group, which instead was strongly associated with hsCRP variation. Overall, these results suggest a role of NC-mediated cholesterol-lowering in the attenuation of the low-grade systemic inflammation. This observation is in line with previous finding of a consistent association between LDL cholesterol and hsCRP reductions obtained with statin therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However, our results suggest also that this NC might exert some anti-inflammatory effects which are independent from cholesterol reduction. Accordingly, this NC contains compound like astaxanthin and coenzyme Q10 without significant cholesterol-lowering properties but with some anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p><p>Beyond the use as an effective tool for cardiovascular risk prediction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, hsCRP levels have been used to identify patients who will benefit most from cholesterol-lowering with statins, even when LDL cholesterol levels are not in a pathological range of values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Investigators in the AFCAPS/TexCAPS study reported that subjects with low LDL cholesterol levels and elevated hsCRP levels at baseline benefited markedly from statin treatment, whereas those with low levels of both LDL cholesterol and hsCRP did not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Moreover, a consistent number of trials demonstrated that statins reduced hsCRP levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Finally, the JUPITER study demonstrated a tremendous clinical benefit from cholesterol- and hsCRP-lowering in patients with normal cholesterol and elevated baseline hsCRP levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Hence, in low risk patients with normal-borderline cholesterol levels and increased hsCRP concentration, the use of this NC might be a safe option for reaching a mild but significant cholesterol and hsCRP reduction. It remains to be defined whether these findings translate into a significant clinical benefit and which inflammatory marker better reflects the state of low-grade systemic inflammation and the response to a nutraceutical intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p><p>In this study we explored also the degree of mechanical endothelial injury, by measuring circulating EMPs. EMPs are complex submicron membrane-shed vesicles released into the circulation following endothelium cell activation or apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Increasing evidence suggests that EMPs play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease either acting as a marker of endothelial injury or exacerbating disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>With respect to EMPs, interesting findings emerged from this study.</p><p>First, baseline LDL cholesterol and hsCRP levels contributed significantly to increase EMP levels; accordingly, adding hsCRP as covariate in the linear regression model that included baseline LDL cholesterol levels improved significantly our ability to predict an increased endothelial injury. This result have several implications. First of all, the presence of elevated hsCRP levels in patients with normal-borderline LDL cholesterol might indicate the presence of an endothelial injury, irrespective of other cardiovascular risk factors. This hypothesis is supported by those studies showing that inflammation might promote EMP formation; accordingly, an increased number of circulating EMPs has been observed in different inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, polymyalgia rheumatica<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and psoriasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and suppression of inflammation is associated with a reduction in circulating EMPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CRP and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 enhance the release of EMPs from endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. On the other hand, it has been proposed that EMPs might play an active role in inducing and maintaining an inflammatory state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p><p>Another implication derived from this result is that even normal-borderline LDL cholesterol levels might contribute to endothelial fragmentation irrespective of systemic low-grade inflammation and additional confounders. Accordingly, we found a significant association between LDL cholesterol in the range of 100&#x02013;160&#x02009;mg/dL and EMPs. Thus, attention should be paid also to LDL cholesterol levels that we do not consider frankly pathological, expecially when these levels are associated with hsCRP elevations.</p><p>Second, patients experiencing both significant LDL cholesterol and hsCRP reductions after the NC treatment were those obtaining the greatest reduction in circulating EMP levels.</p><p>Hence, we migh speculate that targeting both normal-borderline LDL cholesterol levels and low-grade systemic inflammation might have beneficial effects on the endothelial integrity. In this regard, it has already been observed that lipid lowering drugs, such as statins, can reduce LDL cholesterol, hsCRP and the number of circulating EMPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Hence, to have available a new tool, safe and effective, to control the set of the mentioned risk variables (i.e. cholesterol, hsCRP and EMPs), can represent a valid aid to the management of patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, the open-label design is a possible source of bias. Second, mechanistic explanations of the retained LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy of the studied NC in the presence of low-grade systemic inflammation have not been provided. Also, the use of a combined therapy with multiple compounds does not allow to draw conclusions on whether the beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol levels, hsCRP and circulating EMPs might be ascribed to some of the nutraceuticals or to their combination. The use of single agent preparations should be tested to evaluate their respective efficacy on lowering cholesterol levels and reducing hsCRP and circulating EMPs. Measurement of EMP levels might be improved by additional methods to identify an early endothelial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Finally, the suggested anti-inflammatory effect of the NC need to be corroborated by additional <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> tests exploring deeply the systemic inflammation cascade.</p><p>Our results may have a potential clinical relevance. Patients with normal-borderline elevations of plasma cholesterol and with evidence of low-grade systemic inflammation are numerous and at increased cardiovascular risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The studied NC might represent a novel and safe tool to improve lipid and low-grade inflammation control in those patients in which statin treatment is either not recommended or is not tolerated.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with increased hsCRP and normal-borderline cholesterol levels, treatment with a low-dose nutraceutical combination retains a significant cholesterol-lowering activity and reduces low-grade systemic inflammation. Treatment with the nutraceutical combination was paralleled by a significant improvement of endothelial injury that is dependent on both cholesterol and hsCRP reductions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Pirro, M. <italic>et al</italic>.
