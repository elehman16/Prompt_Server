The primary endpoint was the correlation between immediate response of forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) post-inhalation of salbutamol (400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) at study entry and the change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 1&#x000a0;month of indacaterol.

At study entry, mean FEV<sub>1</sub> values before and after salbutamol inhalation were 1.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.50&#x000a0;L and 1.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.53&#x000a0;L, respectively. Based on the magnitude of an immediate response of FEV<sub>1</sub> after salbutamol inhalation at study entry, patients were classified into reversible (Rv, &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x000a0;mL from pre-salbutamol value; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;106) and non-reversible (NRv, &#x0003c;12% or &#x0003c;200&#x000a0;mL from pre-salbutamol value; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;431) groups. After 1&#x000a0;month of indacaterol treatment, mean absolute and relative difference in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> were 100&#x000a0;mL and 9%, respectively. No significant correlation was found between the immediate FEV<sub>1</sub> response to salbutamol at study entry and change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 1&#x000a0;month of indacaterol treatment (correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.056 [95% CI;&#x02212;0.032, 0.144] for absolute response and 0.028 [95% CI;&#x02212;0.06, 0.116] for relative response).

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) strategy recommends long-acting bronchodilators for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, as they have been shown to improve lung function, dyspnoea, quality of life and exacerbation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among inhaled long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs), salmeterol and formoterol are administered twice-daily and provide bronchodilation for approximately 12&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while indacaterol (Onbrez&#x000ae; Breezhaler&#x000ae;), an ultra-LABA, is administered once daily and provides 24&#x000a0;h of sustained bronchodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Bronchodilator reversibility testing, despite not being mentioned in the current treatment recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], is commonly used in daily clinical practice to predict the usefulness of a bronchodilator treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the test is simple, it is difficult to interpret or rely on because the response may vary depending on the day and time of testing, severity of baseline lung-function impairment, and the number of drugs given to perform the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Published data further suggests that acute reversibility in response to bronchodilators in patients with COPD does not predict clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The present study evaluated the correlation between the immediate forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) response with a short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, salbutamol 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (via a metered-dose inhaler), and the clinical and lung function responses to treatment with indacaterol 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily (via the Breezhaler&#x000ae; device) after 1&#x02013;5 months in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This was a phase IV, multicentre, open-label study conducted at 177 centres in France between December 2010 and May 2012.

Patients were excluded if they had a COPD exacerbation within 6&#x000a0;weeks before entering the study, long-term oxygen therapy, asthma, or any concomitant pulmonary disease. Enrolled patients were evaluated at five study visits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At Visit 1 (study entry), any long-acting bronchodilator treatments were discontinued. Patients who were using inhaled corticosteroids at study entry were allowed to continue using it throughout the study without modifying the drug dose or regimen. The salbutamol reversibility test was performed during which FEV<sub>1</sub> was measured 30&#x000a0;min after inhalation of four puffs of salbutamol (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g each). Patients were then classified into the reversible (Rv) group, defined by a post-bronchodilator increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12% and &#x02265;200&#x000a0;mL from pre-salbutamol value, or non-reversible (NRv) group, as defined by a post-bronchodilator change in FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;12% or &#x0003c;200&#x000a0;mL from pre-salbutamol value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Salbutamol was the only bronchodilator allowed for use during the 2-week washout period. From Visit 2 (baseline) to Visit 5 (at 5&#x000a0;months), indacaterol 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was administered once daily, preferably in the morning and spirometry was performed before inhalation of indacaterol (for measuring trough FEV<sub>1</sub>) at each visit. There was one protocol amendment. During the trial, the committee recommended that 1 month of treatment (till Visit 3) was too short for optimum evaluation of health-related quality of life. The protocol was therefore amended to extend the study duration by 4&#x000a0;months consisting of Visit 4 and Visit 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart.

Compared to the NRv group, patients in the Rv group experienced cough more frequently (9.4% vs 4.6%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) and a trend towards more frequent dyspnoea (8.5% vs 4.6%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). The incidence of SAEs were low and comparable between the Rv and NRv groups: Rv, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 (5.7%) vs NRv, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27 (6.3%). Overall, four deaths were reported in the study. Two of these deaths (one death after a COPD exacerbation and one sudden death) were assessed by an investigator as suspected to be related to study treatment. The other two deaths (one sudden death because of an unknown cause, and one suicide) were determined as not related to study treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study showed no correlation between the immediate FEV<sub>1</sub> response with the short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist salbutamol and the change in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 1-month of treatment with indacaterol 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. When patients were subdivided into the Rv and NRv groups (based on response to salbutamol at study entry), there was no significant difference in the improvement in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 1&#x000a0;month of treatment with indacaterol. Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed between the Rv and NRv groups over the 5&#x000a0;months of this study. Although numerical improvements in mMRC and CCQ scores from baseline occurred in both groups, no clinically significant difference was observed between the Rv and NRv groups at any visit. These results suggest that salbutamol responsiveness does not predict the long-term lung function or clinical responses to indacaterol.</p><p>These findings are consistent with a previous study with another LABA (formoterol) that also reported no significant correlation between reversibility with salbutamol and clinical efficacy after 1&#x000a0;month of treatment in patients with stable COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar results were reported after treatment with a long-acting antimuscarinic agent in the Understanding Potential Long-term Improvements in Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) trial, which demonstrated that acute bronchodilator responsiveness at baseline did not predict long-term clinical response to tiotropium after 4&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Tashkin et al. showed that irrespective of the presence of short term response to tiotropium on day 1, treatment with tiotropium over a 1-year period resulted in significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> compared to baseline in both the responsive and poorly responsive groups, with significant but low correlation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43) at the end of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our data corroborates the previous findings by showing the absence of a relationship between acute effects of salbutamol and long term effects of indacaterol, confirming that acute bronchodilator responsiveness should not be used to predict the effects of long-acting bronchodilators.</p><p>Results from the present study concur with the GOLD strategy and the other discussed studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], acknowledging that the magnitude of reversibility of airflow limitation following inhaled short-acting bronchodilators does not predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Non-reversibility of airflow limitation has been used as an inclusion criterion in many COPD studies until recently, however analyses of results from several large studies have concluded that reversibility in COPD patients is a continuous variable. Further, results of reversibility testing vary between tests, time of test, and baseline values and thus should not be used to select patients in a clinical trial or for determining the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has been also been shown that bronchodilator reversibility is not reproducible over time and does not predict disease progression or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, the current thresholds for spirometric measurements for reversibility are also debatable. Some authors argue that these tests may produce false positive results when the baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> value is low, and that FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements are not always repeatable due to noise effects that can be &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, others have suggested a lower threshold than the fixed 12% and 200&#x000a0;mL European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria, particularly in patients with low baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Pellegrino et al. suggested that any threshold for reversibility testing will have pros and cons, since most proposed thresholds are within the natural variability of FEV<sub>1</sub> and may not be applicable to all disease conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although, the present findings are not in favour of recommending spirometry use for predicting clinical response, there is an ongoing debate around the use of spirometry to assess bronchodilator response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Till date, only short-acting bronchodilators (e.g. salbutamol) are used for immediate reversibility testing, and we cannot exclude a significant relationship between FEV<sub>1</sub> change at first dose of indacaterol, due to its rapid onset of action, and long term response, as demonstrated with tiotropium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, indacaterol was well tolerated with only 6.1% of patients reporting at least one SAE. The safety profile was consistent with previous indacaterol studies with approximately 5% of patients experiencing cough. Interestingly, cough was more prevalent in patients in the Rv group compared with the non-Rv group. Although these findings require confirmation, they suggest that bronchial responsiveness may favour cough induced by indacaterol. Of the four deaths reported in the study, two (one death of unknown cause and one following COPD exacerbation) were suspected to be related to the study drug. Sudden deaths are not rare in patients with COPD, and severe COPD exacerbations may be fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The strengths of the present study are that the response to indacaterol was studied by measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> and validated tools (mMRC scale and CCQ questionnaire) for measuring patient-related outcomes under real-life conditions. We also recognise some limitations to this approach. Although the mMRC scale is easy to use and is widely recommended for evaluating dyspnoea in COPD patients in daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it has the major disadvantage of being poorly responsive to therapeutic interventions, including bronchodilators and rehabilitation. This was also the case in the present study, despite a significant proportion of responders, when assessed by using the CCQ and MCID. CCQ appears more responsive than the mMRC scale in this real-life study. A comprehensive symptom assessment is also recommended in addition to measuring breathlessness, using either the COPD assessment test (CAT) or CCQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but the knowledge regarding responsiveness of these short questionnaires to pharmacotherapy remains limited. Interestingly, the percentage of responders for HRQoL in the present real-life study was close to those in the active treatment arms of placebo-controlled studies using the reference St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], confirming the validity of these findings in this non-placebo-controlled trial. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of indacaterol in daily practice in symptomatic patients with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.70, the diagnostic criteria for COPD according to the GOLD document. Because FEV1/FVC ratio usually declines with age, some subjects with FEV1/FVC &#x0003c;0.7 have a FEV1/FVC above the lower limit of the age-related predicted value (also called lower limit of normal, LLN) and may not be affected by COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Specifically-designed studies with sufficient statistical power will be necessary to examine the effect of bronchodilators on symptoms in these latter patients. Finally, there were high rates of study discontinuation, mostly due to violation of inclusion criteria and withdrawal of patient consent. Such findings are usual in phase IV studies and are unlikely to affect our conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with COPD treated with indacaterol for 5&#x000a0;months, immediate FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility with salbutamol at baseline did not predict the sustained response to indacaterol in terms of lung function, health-related quality of life or dyspnoea.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p>COPD assessment test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCQ</term><def><p>Clinical COPD questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV<sub>1</sub></term><def><p>Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p>Forced vital capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOLD</term><def><p>Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABAs</term><def><p>Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p>Minimal clinically important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mMRC</term><def><p>Modified medical research council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRv</term><def><p>Non-reversible</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Rv</term><def><p>Reversible</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGRQ</term><def><p>Saint George respiratory questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UPLIFT</term><def><p>Understanding potential long-term improvements in function with Tiotropium</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the patients who participated and the staff at the participating clinical centres.
