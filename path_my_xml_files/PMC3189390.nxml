There is a trend towards minimizing the number of incisions such as natural transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC). Many retrospective case series propose excellent cosmesis and reduced pain in SPLC.

The hypothesis and primary objective is that patients undergoing SPLC will have a better outcome in cosmesis and body image 12 weeks after surgery. This primary endpoint is assessed using a validated 8-item multiple choice type questionnaire on cosmesis and body image. The secondary endpoint has three entities: the quality of life 12 weeks after surgery assessed by the validated Short-Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire, postoperative pain assessed by a visual analogue scale and the use of analgesics. Operative time, surgeon's experience with SPLC and 4PLC, use of additional ports, conversion to 4PLC or open cholecystectomy, length of stay, costs, time of work as well as intra- and postoperative complications are further aspects of the secondary endpoint. Patients are randomly assigned either to SPLC or to 4PLC. Patients as well as treating physicians, nurses and assessors are blinded until the 7th postoperative day. Sample size calculation performed by estimating a difference of cosmesis of 20% (alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.90, drop out rate of 10%) resulted in a number of 55 randomized patients per arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The SPOCC-trial is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled study to assess cosmesis and body image after SPLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>(clinicaltrial.gov): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01278472">NCT 01278472</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1985, the laparoscopic approach has emerged as the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Advantages of laparoscopic compared with open surgery include improved cosmesis, pain control, shorter convalescence and the absence of the formation of intra-abdominal adhesions.</p><p>Traditionally laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed with four ports. In an attempt to further reduce operative trauma and improve cosmetic results following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there has been a trend toward minimizing the number of incisions and ports required. These new operative techniques are called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and were developed in order to improve cosmesis and further reduce the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A MEDLINE (Pubmed Central database) search (May 14, 2011) using the keywords 'cholecystectomy' and 'single port', 'single incision', 'single site' or 'single provided 334 articles.

These included a low number of patients and focused on postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Current data show that SPLC is feasible with a low rate of conversion to 4-Port conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (4PLC) ranging from 2 to 9.3%. The main reason for conversion was the presence of acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Systemic reviews showed an incidence of biliary tract injury between 0.09 and 0.7%. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, high evidence regarding safety of SPLC is missing.</p><p>SPLC is regarded to provide excellent results in cosmesis with almost no visible scar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Yet, the importance of the cosmesis has been challenged as patients also seem to be quite satisfied after 4PLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since the available devices for SPLC have been designed to enable an almost scarless procedure the hypothesis of cosmesis improvement has to be proven. No previously published RCT on this topic was designed with the focus on cosmesis. We therefore designed a double-blinded randomized controlled trial on SPLC versus 4PLC (SPOCC-trial) evaluating cosmesis and body image as a primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The SPOCC trial is a prospective, multi-center, double blinded, randomized controlled study comparing Single-Port laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 4-port conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy in elective surgery for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

The peritoneum is opened and a SILS&#x02122; PT12 Port (Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA) is introduced. This port obtains four openings: one for gas insufflation and three that can accommodate trocars ranging from sizes 5 to 12 mm. The compressibility of the elastic polymer allows for the access ports to expand and form fit the space in which it resides as well enabling the ports to pass through the working channels. The pneumoperitoneum is maintained at 10-12 mmHg. A 5-mm 45&#x000b0; long scope (HD EndoEye&#x02122;, Olympus Europa Holding GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is introduced through one of the openings in the SILS&#x02122; Port. The patient is then placed in an anti-Trendelenburg position. The fundus of the gallbladder is grasped and the EndoGrab&#x02122; (Virtual Ports Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) internally anchored retraction system is introduced and placed at the fundus and the peritoneum parietal. The infundibulum is laterally retracted using a bending grasper (Endograsp roticulator&#x02122;, Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA). Subsequently good exposure of the triangle of Callot is achieved. The dissection is done using a monopolar dissection hook. The cystic artery and duct are first dissected and then separately clipped with a standard 5 mm clip applicator (Covidien, Norwalk, California, USA). The gallbladder is pushed upright and dissected free from the liver by means of the monopolar hook. Once the gallbladder is free from the adjacent tissues, the 5 mm trocar is exchanged for a 10 mm trocar which is inserted through the SILS&#x02122; access device. An Endocatch bag (Endocatch Gold, 10 mm; Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA) is inserted and the gallbladder is extracted. The umbilical fascia is closed using absorbable Vicryl suture, and the natural scar of the umbilicus is restored using intracutaneous stitches and finally covered by dermal glue (Dermabond&#x02122;; Ethicon Endosurgery Inc., Smithfield, RI, USA).
