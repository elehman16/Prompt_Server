The Achilles&#x02019; heel of warfarin use is, nevertheless, the drug&#x02019;s wide inter-individual variability in dose requirements. This makes it difficult to identify optimal loading/maintenance doses and leads to hemorrhagic events particularly during the initial treatment period [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several methods have been proposed to safely initiate warfarin, and researchers&#x02019; efforts were intensified when specific gene polymorphisms, affecting warfarin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, were identified [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A number of genetic-based algorithms have been developed and proposed to guide clinicians in predicting optimal warfarin maintenance doses in their patients [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two of these, which were validated by large population studies [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], are freely available on-line and some even calculate a loading dose to quickly attain stable warfarin plasma levels [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].<sup>-</sup> Only a few prospective controlled trials have, nevertheless, been carried out to assess if these personalized approaches are superior&#x02014;in terms of international normalized ratio (INR) control and prevention of major bleedings or thromboembolic events&#x02014;to traditional/standard &#x0201c;trial-and-error&#x0201d; dosing methods [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Peripheral blood samples were collected, consecutively numbered and sent to the Laboratory for the baseline INR measurement (ACL Top 500 Instrumentation Laboratory, with RecombiPlasTin 2G Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano Italy) and DNA extraction. Laboratory personnel involved in the study allocated patients on the basis of the randomization sequence generated by statistician using Stata version 12 (StataCorp, TX, USA) for Windows.

Patients were prescribed enoxaparin (4000 IU q.d. subcutaneously) from day of enrolment un till warfarin initiation (Thursday, day 1 of treatment). INR was checked on days 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19 of treatment and subsequently according to the attending physician for a minimum follow up period of 30 days.</p><p>In the control arm warfarin 5mg was administered daily for the first 4 days (day 1 &#x02013;day 4); day 5 and day 6 dosing were derived from the pharmacodynamic prediction model based on day 5 INR result as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and further presented in <xref rid="pone.0145318.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>. In the pharmacogenetic arm the personalized loading dose administered on day 1 and the subsequent maintenance dose (from day 2 to day 6) were calculated using the pharmacogenetic algorithm previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and further detailed in <xref rid="pone.0145318.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>. The maximum loading dose was set at 10mg as a safety precaution. Starting on day 7, warfarin dosing was determined in both study arms by the attending physician with the assistance of PARMA v5.7 software [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary study outcome measures, evaluated over the first 19 days of warfarin treatment, were the number of out-of-range INRs (INR&#x0003c;2.0 or &#x0003e;3.0), and the percentage of time spent in the therapeutic range (TTR). The secondary study outcomes were the mean INR variation over time, the number of warfarin dose changes needed, the difference between the predicted and the actual warfarin maintenance dose (the actual maintenance dose was defined as the stable warfarin dose associated with INR values within the therapeutic range on three consecutive measurements at least one week apart) evaluated along an extended follow-up of patients. Thromboembolic and bleeding complications were assessed during the first 30 days of treatment according to previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and further detailed in <xref rid="pone.0145318.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 File</xref>. Since most extreme values of INR are associated with increased risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events, the incidence of INRs below 1.5 or above 4.0 were also recorded. Moreover, time to stable anticoagulation (defined as the first INR in a series of three INR within the therapeutic range) was also recorded over the 19 days observational period.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data on patients initiating warfarin in the local Thrombosis Centre [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] served to calculate the percentage of INR measures outside the therapeutic range during the study period in the control arm. This figure was set at 50%. To identify a difference of 10% between arms in the percentage of INR out of range with a 80% power and an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and assuming a standard deviation of 23% and a drop-out rate of 15%, 100 patients per group are needed to be enrolled.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are reported as appropriate; categorical data are expressed as frequencies (percentage) with their exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs); continuous data are reported as mean and SD, or medians and ranges. Data were compared using the Fisher exact test or the Wilcoxon-rank sum test. The primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed adjusting for the possible confounding effects of age and BSA (Body Surface Area, DuBois &#x00026; DuBois equation [Weight (kg) 0.425 x height (cm) 0.725 / 139.2]) categorized according to quartiles. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the primary outcomes differences between the two arms by alternative inclusion/exclusion of age and BSA in the statistical Poisson models. The number of out of range INRs was evaluated using a multivariate Poisson model. The TTR, calculated using the Rosendaal &#x0201c;step&#x0201d; method [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], was used as a dependent variable in the Poisson regression model. The same steps were taken to analyze the number of patients experiencing INR below 1.5 or above 4.0 and the time spent at INR below 1.5 or above 4.0.</p><p>The mean INR variation over time was assessed by Repeated Measured Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA). The number of dose changes were considered as count data and therefore evaluated by a multivariate Poisson model. Absolute error in warfarin weekly dose prediction was assessed by ANOVA. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.

Recent observational studies suggest that anticoagulation control may be successfully improved by genotype-guided warfarin dosing [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that a pharmacogenetic algorithm, based on <italic>VKORC1</italic>, <italic>CYP2C9</italic> and <italic>CYP4F2</italic> gene variants, was more accurate than others among Italian Caucasian patients [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This result prompted us to design and conduct this randomized prospective study aimed to test the benefit of genotype- versus pharmacodynamic-based warfarin dosing. The choice of primary outcomes was based on the knowledge that low or high INR values during warfarin initiation period are the major factors associated to inappropriate dose changes exposing patients at a higher risk of adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The percentage of total INRs out of range in the pharmacogenetic arm (45%) was close to that in the control arm (44%). Accordingly, mean TTR in pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing (52%) was similar to that in the control arm (53%). These results do not support the superiority of genotype-guided warfarin dosing. Possible explanations are related to the fact that our pharmacodynamic-based nomogram model is highly accurate and that the advantage of the pharmacogenetic approach may be limited to the first 6 days as dose adaptations were carried out following the same standard procedures in both study arms from day 7 onwards. On the other hand, the pharmacogenetic algorithm accounts for ~50% of warfarin dose variability meaning that other relevant environmental factors interfere with the control of anticoagulation.</p><p>These considerations might also explain the different results in our trial with respect to EU-PACT and COAG studies. At day 19 of treatment, mean TTR in the present and the EU-PACT (constructed out from EUPACT <xref rid="pone.0145318.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) trials were similar in the pharmacogenetic arms (52% and 50% respectively), but quite different in the control arms (53% and 40%, respectively). Since timing of patients&#x02019; INR measurements and clinical visit were comparable in both trials, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the pharmacodynamic warfarin dosing scheme in the present study was more accurate than the standard warfarin dosing in the EU-PACT control arm. This might be related to the higher loading-dose regimen (10mg/die vs 5mg/die) leading to excessive anticoagulation in EU-PACT trial [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The TTR mean difference between arms (genotype-guided arm minus control arm) after 19 days was confirmed extending the observational period to 28 days being mean TTR in the present trial 60% both in genotype-guided and control arm while in the EU-PACT study they were 55% and 46% respectively. This is not unexpected and in agreement with findings of trials evaluating genotype-guided warfarin initiation dosing [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our algorithm was designed to start warfarin dosing and therefore it is likely to display its effects in the very early phases of treatment.</p><p>A direct comparison of TTR at day 28 was also possible for COAG trial and mean TTR was higher in our than in COAG study both for genotype-guided (60% vs 45%) and control group (60% vs 45%). This finding may arise from differences in the quality of genotype-guided algorithm and in the prescription skills of trained physician of a single centre thereafter. It may also depend on indication for anticoagulation treatment, study design and population ethnic background [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Upon considering the control of over- and under-anticoagulation, no significant difference was evidenced in the rate of patients with INR &#x0003c; 1.5, but the time they spent at INR&#x0003e;4.0 was significantly lower in the pharmacogenetic arm suggesting a better accuracy of a pharmacogenetic algorithm for estimating the appropriate initial and maintenance dose particularly in patients requiring very low warfarin dosages.</p><p>The reported results suggest that genotype-guided warfarin dosing, when compared to accurate clinical standard of care, has a marginal clinical utility. The possible clinical utility of pharmacogenetic based dosing is worth being evaluated in less carefully managed standard of cares settings [<xref rid="pone.0145318.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The secondary endpoints of our study showed a comparability of the anticoagulation schemes adopted. The overall INR variations over time, the number of warfarin dose changes, the time to stable anticoagulation and the difference between the predicted and the actual warfarin maintenance dose were in fact not significantly different in the two arms of the trial. Importantly, no thromboembolic or major/minor bleeding events were recorded in either arm; however, the present trial was not adequately powered to detect possible differences for this outcome, a limitation shared with previous trials. With respect to COAG and EU-PACT trials we randomized a lower number of patients and this might be a limitation. However our study is strengthened by the fact that: 1) the first dose of warfarin was informed by genotyping in all patients allocated to the pharmacogenetic arm and 2) genotype-guided dosing was compared with the local standard of care. Generalisabilty to subjects of Caucasian ethnicity is possible since the studied patients were Italian Caucasian.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that a pharmacogenetic algorithm is not superior to an accurate clinically-adopted pharmacodynamic based nomogram in terms of the number of INRs outside the therapeutic range. The former allow a slightly better control of over-anticoagulation, which is particularly relevant in specific subsets of patients such as those requiring very low warfarin doses. It remains to be defined whether the benefits of the translation of these findings into clinical practice are cost-effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Genotyping procedure.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Pharmacodynamic nomogram.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s005"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s006"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Definition of adverse events.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145318.s007"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0145318.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the patients who participated in the study.
