Each person was asked to perform one set of 15 repetitions of each of nine exercises. The nine exercises included dynamic squat, sumo squat, right and left lunge, push up (hands on platform, feet off), push press, bent over row, bicep curl, and triceps extension. A rest period of 30 seconds was allotted between exercises. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) on a scale of 6&#x02013;20 was assessed after each exercise.

In addition, a participants subjective RPE for the nine vibration exercises averaged one unit higher than that for RE.</p><p id="p0160">EPOC has two components: the rapid and slow phases. The rapid EPOC component is well understood to be due to replenishment of O<sub>2</sub> stores in blood and muscle, resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate, lactate removal, and increased body temperature, circulation, and ventilation.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the current study, VO<sub>2</sub> was significantly increased at 15 minutes postexercise. This immediate effect was most likely caused by the rapid EPOC mechanisms listed above.</p><p id="p0165">The slow phase of EPOC typically reflects the postexercise metabolic costs that support increased cardiorespiratory function, elevated body temperature, systemic hormone, and catecholamine increases, as well as the gradual conversion of lactate and pyruvate to replenish glucose stores. EPOC increases in a curvilinear fashion with exercise duration and in a linear fashion with exercise intensity.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, the slow phase of EPOC is reflective of the overall exercise intensity and duration. In this study, after 30 minutes following exercise, neither exercise condition (RE or WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE) elicited a significant EPOC effect. The exercise bout in this study was only 15-minutes long, and on average, the exercise represented only about 30% of a participant's VO<sub>2</sub> peak (WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33% and RE&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27%). The absence of sustained EPOC after low-intensity exercise of a short duration is consistent with a prior research.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Intensities above 50&#x02013;60% VO<sub>2</sub> max are typically required to induce EPOC that lasts several hours.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> With RE, EPOC increases linearly with load.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In the current study, load was set at only 10% of the participants' body weight. In sum, the exercise bouts in this study were too low an intensity and were of too short a duration to elicit significant EPOC. It is likely that if longer and/or more intense WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE were used, EPOC would be increased proportionally. However, a unique feature of this study was that the WBV was combined with an RE routine that followed standardized guidelines recommended for public health.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Thus, the findings here can be generalized to what might be considered for a typical RE prescription in untrained individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Respiratory exchange ratio</title><p id="p0170">It was hypothesized that RER during WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE recovery would be lower than that during the RE alone condition. This hypothesis was based on the assumption that the vibration exercise would provoke an additive increase in muscle contractions,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> requiring greater amount of overall carbohydrate as a fuel during exercise as compared with RE alone. Previous studies indicate that vibration exercise evokes high reliance on glucose as a fuel.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Depending on the intensity of the exercise, glycogen depletion in the contracted muscle may result in a shift in substrate utilization to favor fat during the exercise recovery period. Although both exercise conditions resulted in lower RERs following exercise compared with CON, there were no differences in RER between the two exercise conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Blood pressure</title><p id="p0175">When assessing within-group BP differences, WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE was clearly superior to RE alone or CON. Interestingly, the BP reductions observed following WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE in this study are comparable with previous findings examining RE alone.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Cardinale et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> showed that three sets of 12 repetitions of RE at an intensity of 30% of one rep max provoked a significant SBP reduction of 6&#x000a0;mmHg from baseline BP. Our study, however, showed that a single set of nine exercises was all that was needed to elicit a significant PEH response. Previous evidence has shown that WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE transiently increases muscle perfusion to the lower extremity<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and decreases peripheral arterial stiffness.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> These vascular changes would reduce peripheral resistance without any increases in cardiac output, thereby reducing BP. No previous studies of WBV reported significant BP reductions following exercise.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, differences in the length of measurement following exercise may account for the conflicting results. In previous studies, BP measurements ranged from 4 minutes<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> to 30 minutes<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> postexercise. In the current study, peak BP reduction did not occur until approximately 45 minutes following exercise cessation. It must be noted that PEH is defined as the <italic>sustained</italic> BP reduction that occurs following exercise. BP reduction that typically occurs immediately following exercise is due to the acute increased muscle perfusion in the worked musculature.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Sustained reductions in BP are a result of a complex of metabolic and hormonal physiological changes that evoke systemic vasodilation.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The PEH from the WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE bout in the current study was likely a result of both increased perfusion to the lower extremity and decreased arterial stiffness. However, these mechanisms were not measured in this study. Future studies need to be conducted to explore the mechanism of PEH following vibration exercise.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0180">Our study has certain limitations. First, although prehypertensive, our population was relatively young, healthy, and active. Divergent outcomes might have resulted had older, diseased, or deconditioned individuals participated. For example, the mechanisms for the PEH response of older adults may be different from that of younger individuals.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> The mean age of the participants of this study was 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9 years. Although age could seriously confound the results, age was controlled both in our statistical analysis of BP and by our crossover and repeated-measures study design.</p><p id="p0185">Additionally, subjects were asked not to change their physical activity or exercise habits during the course of the study and they were asked to eat the same foods prior to each visit. Although a dietary recall given prior to each session indicated no significant differences in macronutrient intake between conditions, in fact neither physical activity nor food intake were objectively monitored between trials. Thus, it remains unknown if unmeasured differences in dietary intake or physical activity between conditions influenced either EPOC or PEH results. Lastly, the findings of this study are only applicable to an acute response. It is not known how repeated training with WBV exercise would affect BP. Finally, although our study was powered satisfactorily, our sample size was relatively small, and therefore, larger studies and prospective clinical trials should be conducted to further explore the effects of WBV training on BP. Moreover, a study design with a larger number of participants would allow for analyses to be separated by sex.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Strengths</title><p id="p0190">Our study has many strengths. First, the study population was prehypertensive, which is an important at-risk group for potential development of cardiovascular complications. In fact, it is likely that the PEH response would have been even greater in individuals with hypertension,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> suggesting that WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE may be a beneficial modality for those with hypertension. Second, the use of a repeated-measures crossover study design provides powerful intraparticipant control, thereby decreasing the bias or error of confounding variables. Third, all measurements were time matched across conditions to control for diurnal variations. Fourth, the WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE was compared with both a nonexercise CON group and an RE-alone condition so that differences in exercise mode could be explored. Finally, since PEH duration is prolonged with continued ambulatory activity,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> it is likely that we actually truncated the PEH effect by having our participants remain seated during the entire postexercise period. The PEH would have been greater had we measured ambulatory BP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0195">Recently, vibration exercise has gained popularity and has been publicized as a time-efficient way to lose weight and improve health. However, depending on the research design and the comparison group employed, the outcomes vary.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Findings from this well-controlled study provide significant evidence that WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE can increase energy expenditure slightly as compared with no exercise or RE alone. At 3 hours postexercise, WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE elicited a net increase of 50&#x000a0;kcal compared with RE and a net of 100&#x000a0;kcal more than CON. In theory, with all other factors being constant, a 15-minute bout of WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE performed regularly would provide enough stimulus to induce a negative energy balance.</p><p id="p0200">More importantly, although the BP reduction following WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE was small, its potential clinical significance may be great. In fact, because the relationship between resting BP and disease risk is actually linear even at low or normal levels,<sup>38</sup> there is no threshold value of BP that dramatically increases disease risk.<sup>39</sup> Thus, lower is better when it comes to blood pressure. Even a small reduction of just 5&#x000a0;mmHg of SBP in the population can result in a 14% overall reduction in mortality due to stroke, a 9% reduction in mortality due to coronary heart disease, and a 7% decrease in all-cause mortality.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Finally, because the exercise routine was of standardized intensity and followed recommended public health guidelines,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> the findings of this study would be applicable to a wide population unaccustomed to exercise.</p><p id="p0205">Compared with RE alone or CON, WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE increased VO<sub>2</sub> during exercise and resulted in significant EPOC at 15 minutes postexercise. In addition, 15 minutes of low-intensity WBV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RE was adequate to promote a significant postexercise hypotensive response in adults with prehypertension.</p></sec><sec
