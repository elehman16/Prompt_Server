Patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, coagulation abnormalities, spinal deformities, and patients allergic to amide type of local anesthetics were excluded from the study. Patients were divided randomly into two groups: Group Ropivacaine+Dexmedetomidine (RD) and Group Ropivacaine+Fentanyl (RF), comprising of 50 patients each. All patients were premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg and alprazolam 0.25 mg a night before and 2 hour before on the morning of surgery. Patients were thoroughly counseled during the pre-operative evaluation and were properly explained about the nature of study before taking the written consent.</p><p>In the operation theatre, a good venous access was secured with 18G cannula and all the patients were prehydrated with 10 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's solution. All the baseline parameters were observed and recorded which consisted of electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>Lumbar epidural anesthesia was induced using 18G Touhy needle with patients in the sitting position in L3-L4 interspace and location of epidural space was confirmed by loss of resistance technique. A test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline was administered into epidural space and thereafter epidural catheter was secured 3&#x02013;5 cm into the epidural space and patients were placed supine. The study solutions were prepared by an anesthesia technician who was given written instructions and was unaware of the study design.

Though both the adjuvants provided a smooth and prolonged post-operative analgesia but the effects of dexmedetomidine were more significant on statistical comparison as compared to fentanyl. The evidence was very much visible in the prolonged time to two segmental dermatomal regression (140.32&#x000b1;10.21 in RD vs 110.84&#x000b1;9.48 in RF) (<italic>P</italic>=0.004) as well as earlier return of motor power to Bromage I in the RF group (178.52&#x000b1;23.29) as compared to RD group patients (259.62&#x000b1;21.38) (<italic>P</italic>=0.009).

The synergism between epidural local anesthetics and opioids is well established but evidence regarding combination of LA with dexmedetomidine through epidural route is scarce in literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] This is the pioneer study which has directly compared the effects of epidurally administered dexmedetomidine and fentanyl.</p><p>The demographic profile in the present study was comparable to similar other studies and did not show any significant difference on statistical comparison. The time to reach peak sensory level was significantly (<italic>P</italic>=0.021) shorter in group RD (13.38&#x000b1;4.48) as compared to group RF (16.61&#x000b1;4.36) as equally was the strikingly significant difference between the two groups regarding onset of sensory analgesia at T10 dermatomal level. Throughout the surgery, patients were calm and compose in both the groups but sedation scores were better in a highly significant manner in the RD group as 38% and 42% of patients had grade II and III sedation scores during the peri operative period as compared to 16% and 2% of patients in the RF group. The sedative properties of dexmedetomidine are far superior to fentanyl as no patient required any other sedative during the peri-operative period. None of the patients in either of the group required any additional epidural top-up dose during the surgical period. The analgesia was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) and patients in both the groups showed 0 scores during the entire surgical period. In our study, remarkable synergistic properties of LA and dexmedetomidine have come to the fore. Not only we were able to decrease the dose of local anesthetic in both the groups but also the duration of post-operative analgesia was significantly prolonged in patients in whom dexmedetomidine was administered as adjuvant with LA.</p><p>Though none of the patients in either of the groups experienced any respiratory difficulty warranting active intervention but patients in group RD exhibited a significantly a lower PaCO<sub>2</sub> post operatively. The discrepancy can be explained on the basis that there have been no earlier studies which have established the dose equivalence of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine. Also, the dose of fentanyl used by us may be relatively lower than the equivalent dose of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Bromage scale 3 was achieved in all the patients before the initiation of surgical procedure. The return of complete motor recovery was significantly earlier in the RD group as compared to RF group. Post-operatively, the number of analgesic top-up doses of ropivacaine in group RD was significantly lower than the requirement for ropivacaine in group F.</p><p>Hemodynamic stability was one of the most remarkable features observed with addition of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl to epidural ropivacaine. Decrease in heart rate is a known clinical effect of opioids but in the present study similar negative chronotropic effect was exhibited by dexmedetomidine approximately 30&#x02013;35 minutes after the epidural injection of the drugs. [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] Thereafter, the heart rate remained stable in the range of 56&#x02013;70/min in both the groups. Similarly, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from the baseline in both the groups with a maximum decline of MAP at 30-50 minutes after the epidural injection but it never went below 65 mmHg [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Postoperatively, HR and MAP remained stable in both the groups. The decrease in HR caused by &#x003b1;-2 agonist can again be explained on the basis of their central action whereby they decrease sympathetic outflow and nor-epinephrine release.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The requirement of vasopressors for maintenance of stable hemodynamic parameters did not reveal any significant difference between both the groups on statistical comparison. The stable hemodynamics can possibly be explained on the basis of lower volume of local anesthetics used and a suitable selection of the dose of adjuvant.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The comparison of heart rate (HR) in the group RD and RF covering the pre-, intra-, and post-operative period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-5-365-g006"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The comparison of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the group RD and RF covering the pre-, intra-, and post-operative period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-5-365-g007"/></fig><p>The side effect profile of both the groups exhibited a strikingly significant picture. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 26% and 14% of the patients in group RF as compared to 14% and 4% in group RD. This higher incidence of nausea and vomiting was observed despite a low dose of fentanyl used epidurally. Dry mouth is a known side effect of &#x003b1;-2 agonists and the incidence in the present study was found among 14% of the patients in group RD, which is quite similar to the observations of other studies administering dexmedetomidine. Although urinary retention is a known side effect of opioids, surprisingly we observed a higher incidence of urinary retention in group RD (10%) as compared to (8%) group RF patients. This discrepancy could not be explained and most probably the lower incidence of urinary retention in RF group can be attributable to a lower dose of fentanyl used in the present study.</p><p>Similarly, the absence of respiratory depression in the present study can be explained on the basis that fentanyl is less likely to induce respiratory depression as compared to morphine and we also used fentanyl in a lower dosage. As far as &#x003b1;-2 agonists are concerned, the respiratory depression is not a known feature of this group of drugs. The background of the present study mainly revolved around the potential side effects of epidural opioids and the available literature for intravenous dexmedetomidine has established a significant dose sparing action of the latter on opioid requirement after general anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Avoidance of respiratory depression in the patients who were administered dexmedetomidine was one of the most remarkable observations and the evidence is similar to the earlier studies where researchers have found complete absence of clinically detectable respiratory depression in the previous multiple human studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] One big limitation of the present study involves the exact dose equivalence of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl when used in epidural anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Dexmedetomidine seems to be a better alternative to fentanyl as an epidural adjuvant as it provides comparable stable hemodynamics, early onset and establishment of sensory anesthesia, prolonged post-op analgesia, lower consumption of post-op LA for epidural analgesia, and much better sedation levels.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
