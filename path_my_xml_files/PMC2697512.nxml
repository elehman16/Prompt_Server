Modulation of proteasome function, however, is also a rational strategy for chemosensitization, and a variety of agents have shown synergistic activity with bortezomib pre-clinically, including anthracyclines. This formed the basis for evaluation of a regimen of bortezomib with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). PLD+B, in a phase I study, induced a predictable and manageable toxicity profile, and showed encouraging anti-MM activity. In a recent international, randomized phase III trial, PLD+B demonstrated a superior overall response rate and response quality compared to bortezomib alone, as well as a longer time to progression, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Sub-analyses revealed benefits in almost all clinically relevant subgroups, including several which would be considered to have high-risk disease. These findings have led to the establishment of the PLD+B regimen as one of the standards of care for patients with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma. Efforts are now underway to build on this combination further by adding other active anti-myeloma agents. In this review, we will discuss the role of PLD+B as an important addition to our therapeutic armamentarium for patients with MM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>relapsed/refractory</kwd><kwd>pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</kwd><kwd>bortezomib</kwd><kwd>Doxil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>Velcade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction to management strategies incorporating bortezomib and anthracyclines in multiple myeloma</title><p>In May 2003, bortezomib (B) (Velcade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Millenium Pharmaceuticals), a first in class proteasome inhibitor, received accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who had received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, and had progressive disease on the most recent therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-5-0151">1</xref> In March 2005, this approval was amended to allow the use of bortezomib for patients with MM after 1 or more prior lines of therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-5-0151">2</xref> In the relapsed or primary refractory setting, single-agent bortezomib has provided response rates of 27% to 43%, with median times to progression of 6.2 to 7.0 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-5-0151">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-5-0151">5</xref> To improve these outcomes, combinations of bortezomib with other agents active in MM have been explored.

In an effort to maintain the efficacy of doxorubicin, while improving its tolerability, a pegylated, liposomal form of doxorubicin (PLD, Doxil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Johnson and Johnson) was developed. With a half-life of approximately 79 hours, a single 60- to 90-minute administration of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is comparable in efficacy to continuous infusion doxorubicin, but has a lower incidence of neutropenia, alopecia and cardiac toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-5-0151">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-5-0151">13</xref></p><p>The pre-clinical synergy observed between proteasome inhibitors and anthracyclines led to the development of clinical trials investigating the use of these drug classes in combination.

The formation of oxygen free radicals and the peroxidation of lipids also contribute to the cardiac toxicity that is characteristic of non-liposomal anthracyclines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-5-0151">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-5-0151">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Bortezomib</title><p>Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid analog which targets the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) by inhibiting the function of the 26S proteasome complex. Inhibition of the UPP blocks protein and transcription factor degradation, leading to accumulation of misfolded/damaged proteins, and inducing heat shock stress responses within the cell.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-5-0151">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-5-0151">22</xref> Bortezomib mediates its cytotoxic effects via alterations in multiple pathways including inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling. In the quiescent cell, NF-&#x003ba;B is bound to the inhibitory protein I&#x003ba;B, rendering it inactive. However, with phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of I&#x003ba;B by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, NF-&#x003ba;B is released from the bound state and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Activated NF-&#x003ba;B initiates an immune/inflammatory response via increased gene transcription of multiple cytokines, and also contributes to cellular resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance. Bortezomib inhibits I&#x003ba;B degradation, thereby suppressing NF-&#x003ba;B activity and contributing to apoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-5-0151">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-5-0151">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-5-0151">26</xref> Bortezomib&#x02019;s anti-tumor activity is also mediated by a number of pro-apoptotic pathways including accumulation of p53, p21 and p27, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), inhibition of the interleukin (IL)-6-induced Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and interference with the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-5-0151">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-tcrm-5-0151">32</xref> Additionally, preclinical studies with bortezomib have demonstrated a reduction in levels of cytokines (IL-6), angiogenesis factors (vascular endothelial growth factor), and growth factors (insulin-like growth factor-1), which among other effects inhibits adhesion of myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-5-0151">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-5-0151">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-5-0151">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-tcrm-5-0151">28</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Rationale for combination</title><p>One of the mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance is via up-regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-tcrm-5-0151">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-tcrm-5-0151">32</xref> As bortezomib suppresses the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B, chemo-resistance to PLD induced by this mechanism would be abrogated by using these drugs in combination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-tcrm-5-0151">29</xref> Bortezomib may also sensitize myeloma cells to DNA damage by down-regulating the transcription of DNA repair enzymes, as demonstrated in in vitro studies as well as by gene expression profiling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-tcrm-5-0151">30</xref> P-glycoprotein, encoded in the multi-drug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), functions as a cell membrane transporter responsible for the efflux of toxins including multiple chemotherapy agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-tcrm-5-0151">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-tcrm-5-0151">27</xref> Preliminary data suggest proteasome inhibition decreases expression of P-glycoprotein, and subsequently bypasses a well-defined mechanism of multi-drug resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-tcrm-5-0151">33</xref> Cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) also contributes to the development of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics, and in addition to suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B activity, bortezomib may overcome CAM-DR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-tcrm-5-0151">30</xref></p><p>Anthracyclines, in turn, may also overcome bortezomib resistance by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MPK-1) pathway. One of several mechanisms of proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis is via activation of JNK. However, bortezomib induces MPK-1, which can dephosphorylate and inactivate JNK. Anthracyclines have been shown to inhibit MPK-1 activity, potentially contributing to the synergy of doxorubicin and bortezomib.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-tcrm-5-0151">34</xref> Combination studies of bortezomib and anthracyclines in in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated improved inhibition of MPK-1, increased activation of JNK, and increased apoptosis.

Among 22 evaluable patients with MM, 36% achieved either complete remission (CR) or near CR, and another 36% achieved partial remission (PR). Prior to study enrollment, 13 patients had received anthracyclines to which their disease had either not responded, or initially responded but then derived no further benefit; among them, 38% achieved CR or near CR, and another 23% achieved PR. With extended follow-up, the median time to disease progression (TTP) among the 22 evaluable patients was 9.3 months, with a median time to re-treatment (TTRT) of 24.2 months, and median overall survival of 38.3 months.

Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles or until complete response, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity developed, though patients tolerating therapy were allowed to continue beyond 8 cycles if they showed continued disease response. The primary endpoint was TTP on an intent-to-treat population, while secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (complete response + partial response) as defined by the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group criteria, and safety profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-tcrm-5-0151">39</xref></p><p>Among patients treated with the combination of PLD+B, TTP was higher at 9.3 months, compared with 6.5 months among patients treated with bortezomib alone (p = 0.000004). Progression-free survival (PFS) was also longer in those treated on the combination arm than in those treated with bortezomib monotherapy (9.0 vs 6.5 months, p = 0.000026). An increase in the duration of response (DOR) from 7.0 to 10.2 months with combination therapy paralleled the improvements seen in TTP and PFS. Early follow-up of survival data also suggested an improvement in 15-month OS among those treated with PLD+B compared with those treated with bortezomib alone (76% vs 65%, p = 0.03). By intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate (ORR) was similar between monotherapy (41%) and combination therapy arms (44%) (p = 0.43); however, rates of CR + very good partial response (VGPR) were higher (19% vs 27%) with combination therapy (p = 0.0157). When only response-evaluable patients were included in the analysis, the overall response rate for bortezomib alone (n = 310) was 44% and that for PLD+B (n = 303) was 52% (p = 0.05).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-tcrm-5-0151">37</xref></p><p>Braccalenti et al have taken an alternative approach to evaluating the effect of adding PLD to the anti-tumor activity of B.

Combination therapy with PLD+B is an important therapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma that provides superior outcomes to single-agent bortezomib, including improved 15-month OS rates. As patients with relapsed or refractory MM have often previously received anthracyclines, thalidomide, and/or autologous stem cell transplant, it is significant that PLD+B improves patient outcomes irrespective of these prior exposures. The lack of further benefit seen with adding PLD to bortezomib in patients with low &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin and deletion of chromosome 13 suggest that bortezomib may be solely responsible for the responses seen in these subgroups of patients.</p><p>The tolerability profile of PLD+B is noteworthy. Treatment emergent peripheral neuropathy is a common clinical challenge in patients with MM. That PLD is able to improve patient outcomes without exacerbating symptoms of neuropathy adds to its usefulness. This steroid-sparing combination is also a valuable choice for patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and those who are otherwise steroid intolerant. It is equally important that in a disease with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years, this combination does not increase the risk of cardiotoxicity compared with bortezomib alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-tcrm-5-0151">54</xref> Finally, the lack of need for prophylactic anticoagulation, which is in contrast to immunomodulatory derivative (Imid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)-steroid combinations, is advantageous for patients at risk for falls, or with other bleeding tendencies. While these advantages are important, clinicians must be vigilant for the gastrointestinal toxicities, neutropenia, stomatitis, and hand-foot-syndrome that can be seen with PLD+B, so that these may be promptly addressed if they develop.</p><p>Ongoing phase II studies are currently evaluating the combination of PLD+B with such agents as dexamethasone, thalidomide, and melphalan in the relapsed/refractory setting. These trials have a limited number of patients and follow-up to date; however mature data may suggest additional treatment options in the future.</p><p>Because of its significant activity in the relapsed/ refractory setting, with manageable and non-overlapping toxicities, PLD+B is also being evaluated as induction therapy prior to ASCT. This Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALBG) study led by Orlowski et al enrolled 63 patients with symptomatic MM requiring therapy on the same B-PLD schema utilized in the phase 3 study. Preliminary response data on 29/63 patients demonstrated a CR/nCr rate of 28% and ORR of 79%. Stem cell collection, in a limited number of evaluable patients, was not compromised.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-tcrm-5-0151">55</xref> If longer follow-up confirms these promising results, this steroid-sparing combination may provide an effective option for patients with improved tolerability over other currently used regimens.</p><p>In future clinical trials of PLD+B, it will be useful to assess whether fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), conventional cytogenetics, and/or molecular profiling can be used to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from this regimen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support: RZO, a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Mansbach Foundation Scholar in Clinical Research, would like to acknowledge support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (6096-07), the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute (RO1 CA102278).</p><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors disclose no conflicts of interest.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-tcrm-5-0151"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bross</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Velcade: US FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma progressing on prior therapy</article-title><source>Oncologist</source><year>2003</year><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>508</fpage><lpage>513</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14657528</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b2-tcrm-5-0151"><label>2.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><name><surname>Sridhara</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>United States Food and Drug Administration approval summary: bortezomib for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma after one prior therapy</article-title><source>Clin Cancer Res</source><year>2006</year><volume>12</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>2955</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16707588</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b3-tcrm-5-0151"><label>3.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Barlogie</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Berenson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A phase 2 study of bortezomib in relapsed, refractory myeloma.
