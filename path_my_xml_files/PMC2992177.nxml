In critically ill patients, improved glycemic control reduces short- and long-term mortality, rates of multiorgan failure, systemic infections, and length of hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Likewise, in patients admitted to general medical and surgical areas hyperglycemia is associated with a prolonged hospital stay, infection, disability, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), suggesting that poor glycemic control is associated with poor clinical outcome.</p><p>Insulin is the most effective and the most preferred agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, inpatient insulin therapy is often complicated by variable meal delivery, unpredictable food consumption, and medical conditions, including liver and kidney disease, that predispose to hypoglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin analogs, which have been shown to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in the outpatient setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), may hence be a better choice than regular insulin for the treatment of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill hospitalized patients. The present study was therefore undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of the rapid-acting insulin analog glulisine and regular insulin in hyperglycemic hospitalized patients.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We enrolled 194 patients with type 2 diabetes who were admitted to a noncritical care medical or surgical unit at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ). All patients were expected to stay hospitalized &#x02265;3 days. Exclusion criteria included severe hypoglycemia within the past 6 months or hypoglycemia unawareness because of the known risk reduction of hypoglycemia using rapid-acting insulin analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), prolonged nothing by mouth status, continuous nutrition (total parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition), and mental health conditions rendering the patient unable to provide informed written consent. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients after the study had been approved by the local institutional review board.</p><p>All prior diabetes medications were discontinued if applicable, and all patients were started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen consisting of insulin glargine (Lantus; sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) and glulisine (Apidra; sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) or regular insulin (Novolin R, Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ). Patients were assigned to receive glulisine or regular insulin in a randomized double-blind fashion. For patients treated only with insulin before the hospitalization, the initial dose of insulin was equal to the total outpatient dose. For all other patients, the initial total daily dose of insulin was 0.4 IU/(kg &#x000b7; day)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> if BMI was &#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 0.5 IU/(kg &#x000b7; day)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> if BMI was 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 0.6 IU/(kg &#x000b7; day)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> if BMI was &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. One-half of the total daily insulin dose was given as glargine once daily at bedtime, and the other half was given as glulisine or regular insulin in equally divided doses before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All insulin doses were administered by nurses, who were not blinded to the study medications. Glulisine was administered immediately before meals, regular insulin was administered &#x0223c;30 min before meals. Glulisine and regular insulin were not given if a subject was unable to eat to avoid hypoglycemia. Fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) was tested daily before each meal, at bedtime, and whenever subjects reported symptoms of hypoglycemia; 2-h postprandial and 2:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> FSBG were tested every 3rd day starting on day 2 of study participation. All FSBG measurements were obtained using the Roche Accu-Chek Inform glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and downloaded to the VA Computerized Patient Record System. Insulin doses were adjusted daily by the investigators (who were blinded to the short-acting insulin) to target blood glucose concentrations of &#x0003c;130 mg/dl before meals and at bedtime while avoiding hypoglycemia using the following guidance: for fasting blood glucose concentrations of 130&#x02013;160, 161&#x02013;200, and &#x0003e;200 mg/dl, increase glargine by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively; for prelunch, predinner, and bedtime blood glucose concentrations of 130&#x02013;160, 161&#x02013;200, and &#x0003e;200 mg/dl, increase regular insulin or glulisine at the prior meal by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively. Supplemental glulisine or regular insulin was given in addition to the scheduled insulin dose before each meal for blood glucose concentrations &#x0003e;130 mg/dl according to a sliding scale protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Serum creatinine, white blood cell count, and A1C were measured on the 1st day of hospitalization. Fasting plasma C-peptide with the concurrent plasma glucose concentration was measured on day 1 of study participation. All measurements were performed by the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center central laboratory using standard assays.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Supplemental insulin sliding scale</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Blood glucose</th><th align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Insulin<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI &#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">131&#x02013;170 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">171&#x02013;210 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">211&#x02013;250 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">251&#x02013;290 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">291&#x02013;330 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">331&#x02013;370 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;371 mg/dl</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn fn-type="other"><p>Data are units of insulin.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Hypoglycemia was defined as a blood glucose concentration &#x0003c;60 mg/dl. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event that required assistance from another person for recovery. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as an event that occurred between the injection of glargine at bedtime and before the subject awoke in the morning. As an index of &#x003b2;-cell function, homeostasis model assessment of percent &#x003b2;-cell function (HOMA-%B) was calculated as [fasting plasma insulin [picomoles per liter] &#x000d7; 3.33/(fasting plasma glucose [millimoles per liter] &#x02013; 3.5)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The primary end points were glycemic control, measured by the mean daily blood glucose concentration, and the incidence of hypoglycemia. Length of stay was the secondary end point. Sample sizes were calculated for 80% power at an &#x003b1; of 0.05 for both primary end points. We assumed an average length of stay of 7 days, a within-group SD of 45 mg/dl in mean daily blood glucose concentrations, and a 30% incidence of subjects experiencing at least one episode of hypoglycemia as found in a previous similar study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Under these assumptions, power calculations indicated the need for 80 subjects to detect a 10 mg/dl difference in mean daily blood glucose concentrations and the need for 565 subjects to detect a 25% difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia. However, before reaching the latter sample size, at 194 subjects, the decision was made to terminate the study because of slower than expected enrollment. Baseline characteristics of subjects and outcome variables were compared using the Student <italic>t</italic> test or the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test as appropriate. Multiple comparisons of blood glucose concentrations over the course of the subjects' study participation were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The present trial is the first to compare the efficacy and safety of the rapid-acting insulin analog glulisine and regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. Using a randomized double-blind study design, we found that treatment with glulisine resulted in lower blood glucose concentrations than treatment with regular insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. When all blood glucose readings during the study are considered, the reduction in glycemia by glulisine was &#x0223c;8 mg/dl. This reduction was highly significant but arguably modest. However, if only data past day 4 of therapy are considered, glulisine resulted in &#x0223c;22 mg/dl reduced blood glucose concentrations, because both groups had similar levels during the first 4 days. Thereafter, the difference in glycemic control progressively increased such that after 7 days blood glucose concentrations were &#x0223c;31 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group.</p><p>It is of note that subjects participating for &#x0003e;4 days did not differ from those participating for &#x02264;4 days in demographic, physical, and medical characteristics and that glycemic control was similar in the glulisine and the regular insulin group during their first 4 days of study participation as we had found when we analyzed data for all subjects. Furthermore, the incidence of hypoglycemia was, if anything, slightly higher in the regular insulin group than in the glulisine group. These findings suggest that the improvement in glycemic control by glulisine after but not during the first 4 days of therapy was due to the length of time required for dose titration and not due to unique characteristics of subjects who were hospitalized for a longer period of time. Moreover, they denote that insulin was titrated at least equally aggressively in the regular insulin group as in the glulisine group by the blinded investigators, suggesting that development of hypoglycemia prevented further up-titration of regular insulin and achievement of glycemic control similar to that in the glulisine group and that, for a given aggressiveness in dose titration with similar frequency of hypoglycemia, glulisine may provide better glycemic control than regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The results of the present study are very much consistent with those of Dailey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) in that twice-daily glulisine in combination with NPH insulin improves glycemic control without increasing the frequency of hypoglycemia in outpatient type 2 diabetic patients. In contrast, our results disagree somewhat with those of Umpierrez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study, the insulin analogs detemir given once daily and aspart given before meals resulted in glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia similar to that with a split-mixed regimen with NPH and regular insulin despite use of a dose titration schedule similar to that in the present study. However, contrary to our study, subjects were younger and were excluded for clinically relevant liver and kidney disease, suggesting that differences in study populations, specifically the risk of hypoglycemia, may be an explanation for the differing results.</p><p>In the present study both groups of subjects were well matched for age, diabetes duration, prior diabetes treatment, prior glycemic control, &#x003b2;-cell function, renal function, and white blood cell count. Furthermore, the study personnel, making adjustments to the insulin doses, was blinded to the short-acting insulin. Only nurses, who administered the insulin, were unblinded to the types of short-acting insulin because of the different administration times in relation to meals. Therefore, differences in subjects' characteristics between the glulisine and regular insulin groups or bias of the investigators is an unlikely explanation of our results. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the following limitations of our study. First, it was performed in a single center in an elderly veteran population involving nearly exclusively males. Thus, whether the results can be generalized to other hospital settings and populations needs to be examined. Second, only individuals highly trained in insulin treatment made adjustments in insulin doses, and blood glucose levels were carefully reviewed at least once a day, exceeding the usual standard of care. Therefore, whether treatment with glulisine provides superior control compared with regular insulin in hospitalized patients in the hands of less well-trained providers and with less careful blood glucose monitoring may need to be tested. Third, it is possible that some of our study patients were not completely blinded regarding the type of mealtime insulin because of their knowledge of the different administration times of regular insulin and glulisine relative to meals. And fourth, we unfortunately did not achieve our estimated sample size needed for detecting differences in the incidence of hypoglycemia because of slower than expected patient recruitment.</p><p>In critically ill patients, hypoglycemia has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Although the causality of hypoglycemia leading to poor clinical outcome has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), hypoglycemia or the fear of it in health care providers and patients is undoubtedly the major barrier for the control of glycemia. In the present study, 30&#x02013;35% of patients experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia with an incidence of &#x0223c;0.1&#x02013;0.14 episode/day, comparable to the rates of hypoglycemia in the previous similar study by Umpierrez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This observation demonstrates the difficulty of achieving tight glycemic control and underscores the importance of improving our treatment modalities in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In summary, the present study provides evidence suggesting that treatment with glulisine can provide superior glycemic control compared with regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those who have a prolonged length of stay. Further studies are needed to examine whether these results can be generalized to other populations and hospital settings, and whether the benefits of glulisine persevere with the usual standard of care for glycemic control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
