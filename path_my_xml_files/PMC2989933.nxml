For radioiodine thyroid remnant ablation, 30 mCi of <sup>131</sup>I was applied in 86 patients, whereas 60 mCi in 128 and 100 mCi in 95 patients.

One aim of this therapy is to destroy thyroid remnant to remove their competition with cancer cells for secretion of thyroglobulin or <sup>131</sup>I uptake. Thus, the name of thyroid remnant ablation is used. The second aim is to treat putative cancer micrometastases. Only the adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I therapy enables the detection of functional micrometastases, which are visible during the post-therapeutic total body scan, but not on X-ray or CT images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore it is important to ensure, both for the healthy follicular cells and thyroid cancer cells to absorb appropriately high radiation doses. The absorbed dose depend, among others, on the ability of the cells to trap and cumulate <sup>131</sup>I. The capability of thyroid cancer cells is much lower than of the healthy ones so the <sup>131</sup>I activity sufficient for thyroid remnant ablation might not be sufficient to treat cancer micrometastases. That is why the evaluation of the effectiveness of the adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I therapy must include the assessment of thyroid remnant ablation effectiveness as well as of micrometastases treatment. The latter can be done only by the long-term disease follow-up.</p><p>Usually, most DTC recurrences are diagnosed within first 5 years postoperatively. Adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I treatment increases specificity of the further serum thyroglobulin follow-up, as in patients operated because of differentiated thyroid carcinoma but not treated by <sup>131</sup>I the source of Tg might be both healthy thyroid cells and cancer cells. After successful thyroid remnant ablation thyroglobulin may be secreted by only cancer cells. Also the adjuvant therapy improves the sensitivity and specificity of the further DTC <sup>131</sup>I-based diagnostic by abolishing the competition amongst healthy follicular cells and cancer cells to uptake the <sup>131</sup>I.</p><p>For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer various therapeutic activities are used to carry out the adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I treatment: from 30 to 200 mCi (1,1 - 7,4 GBq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The most favorable activity has not been established yet although a great deal of research has been performed. Early papers evaluating the efficiency of the adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I treatment mainly focused on its thyroid ablation role and were rather observational. They did not prove any relation between therapeutic activity and ablation effectiveness. In 1996, Bal et al. carried out a prospective randomized clinical trial in which they evaluated the effectiveness of some activities. Then divided the patients into four groups which were administered respectively: 25-34 mCi, 35-64 mCi, 65-119 mCi and finally 120-200 mCi. They concluded that 50 mCi was the most effective activity and that an increase in activity did not bring about any therapeutic benefits. Mazaferri compared retrospectively the outcome in 1,004 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, whose median follow-up time was on average 15 years, however, did not indicate the optimal dose of <sup>131</sup>I necessary to achieve the best therapeutic effect. The prospective randomized study published in 2008 by M&#x000e4;enp&#x000e4;&#x000e4; et al. evaluated the effectiveness of the thyroid remnant ablation and long-term results of adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I therapy and did not prove the treatment with 100 mCi being better than 30 mCi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, we decided to perform own prospective study. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of adjuvant <sup>131</sup>I therapy between three groups of DTC patients who were treated by total thyroidectomy and lymph neck dissection and evaluated postoperatively to be free from disease. They received respectively 30, 60 and 100 mCi of radioiodine for thyroid remnant ablation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The project was designed as a two-stage, prospective randomized clinical trial.</p><p>The first part of the study was an early evaluation of the effectiveness of thyroid remnant <sup>131</sup>I ablation treatment and was described in our previous papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In 1998-2001 210 low risk DTC patients, diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, were randomly allocated to receive either 1100 MBq (30 mCi), or 2200 MBq (60 mCi) activity of <sup>131</sup>I following total thyroidectomy and in most cases, central lymph node dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Only patients without lymph node metastases, staged pT<sub>1b</sub>-T<sub>3 </sub>or T<sub>x </sub>and N<sub>0 </sub>or N<sub>x </sub>were included. The condition to show stimulated Tg level &#x0003c;30 ng/ml was fulfilled for all of them.</p><p>From 2003 to 2005 as the completion of the range of <sup>131</sup>I activities analyzed, we compared the effectiveness of two <sup>131</sup>I activities, 60 mCi and 100 mCi. For this goal, 224 patients staged pT<sub>1b</sub>-T<sub>4 </sub>N<sub>0-1 </sub>were included, if they were diagnosed disease-free following total thyroidectomy and central/lateral lymph node dissection, when necessary.</p><p><sup>131</sup>I treatment was performed after thyroid hormone withdrawal. A successful thyroid remnant ablation was defined as the absence of thyroid bed uptake in <sup>131</sup>I neck scan and the stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) value &#x0003c; 10 ng/ml, as judged after 12 months post <sup>131</sup>I therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The second stage of the study, presented now, comprised the long-term assessment of the disease follow-up in the study groups. 309 DTC patients (285 women and 24 men) with no clinical signs of persistent disease were included. There were 267 subjects with papillary and 44 with follicular carcinoma. 86 patients were initially treated with 30 mCi (group A), 128 with 60 mCi (group B) and 95 with 100 mCi (group C) post thyroidectomy.</p><p>In group A there were only patients in pT<sub>1b</sub>-T<sub>3 </sub>N<sub>0 </sub>M<sub>0 </sub>stage, in other cohorts the wider range of patients in pT<sub>1b</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>0</sub>-N<sub>1 </sub>M<sub>0 </sub>were included.

In such cases the effectiveness of this method is undisputed. It has been proved that it decreases the risk of the recurrence and death due to DTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is more commonly used in Europe although it is still questionable if it is necessary with the patients in early disease stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, it is important to remember that it allows a better follow-up through the improvement of specificity of serum thyroglobulin measurement and sensitivity of the whole body scan. Thus, it is routinely used in many European countries and recommended by Polish guidelines in all DTC cases but papillary microcancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our clinical practice we use routinely 100 mCi <sup>131</sup>I for thyroid remnant ablation. However, being aware of the possibility to use lesser activities, we decided to perform a prospective randomized trial with long term outcome. We plan to extend our observation till 10 years follow up will be reached, however, an interim analysis has been planed after 5 years and this short communication present its result. In the previous, initial part of the study we found that the 30 mCi activity was less effective than 60 mCi as more patients needed second <sup>131</sup>I treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but 60 mCi was as good as 100 mCi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The later evaluation of the therapeutic effect, presented in this paper, did not show significant differences in the effectiveness of 30, 60 and 100 mCi activities. In our study the majority of patients were diagnosed with early stage of the disease, so the results are related to low risk DTC patients treated by radical surgery. However, one limitation is obvious: in the group treated initially by 30 mCi of <sup>131</sup>I 22% of patients required second course of <sup>131</sup>I for complete thyroid ablation. Thus, in fact, the cumulative <sup>131</sup>I activity administered was larger in 22% of patients and exceeded 100 mCi. The same occurred in 13,3% and 11,2% of patients treated with 60 and 100 mCi respectively. This will be considered at the final evaluation, however, already now we have to bear in mind that the apparent equality of various activities of <sup>131</sup>I has to be interpreted with caution. All for whom the initial treatment proved insufficient during the first assessment were treated again with a higher activity which might have influenced the good general outcome of radioiodine treatment in the group treated with lower activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the analyzed groups of patients no significant differences in 5 years efficacy of <sup>131</sup>I thyroid remnant ablation were observed. However, to reach this goal, 22% of patients treated with 30 mCi required second course of radioiodine, while this was necessary only in 13,3% and 11,2% of patients treated with 60 and 100 mCi respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AK and JK conceived
