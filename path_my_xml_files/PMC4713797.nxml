healthy subjects using pre-programmed or single-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation. [Subjects] Ninety healthy adult subjects were randomly assigned to
pre-programmed or single-frequency stimulation groups, each consisting of 45 participants.
[Methods] Sensory thresholds were measured in the participants&#x02019; forearms using von Frey
filaments before and after pre-programmed or single-frequency transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, and the result in values were analyzed. [Results] Significant increases
in sensory threshold after stimulation were observed in both groups. However, there were
no significant differences between the two groups in sensory thresholds after stimulation
or in the magnitude of threshold increases following stimulation. [Conclusion] Our results
show that there are no differences between sensory threshold increases induced by
pre-programmed and single-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pre-programmed TENS</kwd><kwd>Sensory threshold</kwd><kwd>Single-frequency TENS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Physical therapists routinely use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for
pain relief in patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. TENS promotes the transmission of afferent sensory impulses
from cutaneous receptors to the spinal cord, which closes the spinal pain gate and thereby
blocks transmission of pain signals<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain
relief using TENS relies on continuous excitation of sensory fibers to hold the pain gate in
a closed state. Therefore, sensory fiber accommodation must be prevented<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. As continuous single-frequency stimulation
often causes accommodation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, TENS commonly
incorporates frequency modulations<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most
commercially available TENS units are now equipped with a frequency-modulated preset
program; even those TENS units that do not allow the choice of single frequencies are
produced today. Many physical therapists prefer to use pre-programmed TENS (PPT) and
strongly believe that this modality is more effective than single-frequency TENS (SFT).
Previous studies examining the relationships between TENS and pain relief have addressed the
effects of SFT<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> or PPT<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, however,
studies comparing PPT and SFT are rare. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
examine differences in sensory thresholds among subjects using PPT or SFT using the von Frey
filament test and thereby provide a scientific basis for the selection of TENS
parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety healthy adults with no sensory problems were included in the study. In accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki, the study was respectively explained in detail to all
subjects and only those subjects who gave written informed consent were included. The study
was approved by the institutional review board of the Catholic University of Pusan
(CUPIRB-2015-030).</p><p>The 90 subjects were randomly assigned to a PPT or an SFT group, each consisting of 45
participants. Sensory thresholds were measured in all subjects, with eyes closed, before and
after TENS using von Frey filaments (Leica Biosystems, Wood Dale, USA) in the center of the
forearm, 1&#x02005;cm proximal to the radial styloid process. TENS was applied using a CWM602
stimulator (Chungwoo, Seoul, Korea). Biphasic symmetrical waveforms with a 150-&#x003bc;s pulse
width were used as pulse parameters. Two 3&#x02005;cm &#x000d7; 3&#x02005;cm square adhesive electrodes (3M, Seoul,
Korea) were attached to the edges of the radial and ulnar styloid processes on the dorsal
side of the forearm. The PPT group was subjected to stimulation with a 10-min 1&#x02013;140&#x02005;Hz
frequency modulation program consisting of repeated increases and decreases between 1 and
140&#x02005;Hz for 7&#x02005;min and then between 1 and 50&#x02005;Hz for 3&#x02005;min. The SFT group was subjected to
10&#x02005;min of 100-Hz single-frequency stimulation. Stimulation was applied at the maximum
intensity that could be endured by the subject, but within intensity levels at which no
motor response was observed. Dependent t-tests were used to compare sensory thresholds
within each group before and after TENS. Independent t-tests were used to compare post-TENS
threshold of the PPT group to those of the SFT group and to compare the magnitudes of
TENS-induced sensory threshold changes between the PPT and the SFT groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean sensory thresholds of the PPT group before and after TENS were 2.45 &#x000b1; 0.63 g and
3.32 &#x000b1; 0.63 g, respectively, those of the SFT group before and after TENS were 2.25 &#x000b1; 0.67 g
and 3.24 &#x000b1; 0.73 g, respectively. Thus, significant sensory threshold increases were induced
by TENS in both groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). However, no significant difference in sensory
thresholds after the application of TENS was observed between the groups (p &#x0003e; 0.05). The
magnitude of the sensory threshold increases induced by TENS were 0.98 &#x000b1; 0.44 g in the SFT
group and 0.86 &#x000b1; 0.38 g in the PPT group. This difference was not significant (p &#x0003e;
0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Frequency-modulated TENS is hypothesized to be more effective than single-frequency
TENS<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, because it can activate both low-
and high-frequency hypoalgesia mechanisms<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several previous studies support this hypothesis. For instance, in a
study of animal models of arthritis, TENS with frequencies modulated between 4 and 100&#x02005;Hz
showed sufficient analgesic effects<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the effectiveness of frequency-modulated TENS compared to that of conventional
single-frequency TENS has not been sufficiently studied.</p><p>Koo found no differences in cold pain thresholds between subjects using PPT and 80-Hz SFT.
However, this was a small-scale study and the frequency modulation program used was not
specified. A more recent study reported that TENS with frequencies fluctuating between 20
and 100&#x02005;Hz for 8 s periods had a similar hypoalgesic affect to that of 80-Hz SFT<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result is consistent with the results
of the present study. Both parameters used in our study resulted in significant increases in
sensory thresholds. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Hence, it
is unclear which TENS method is more effective. Consistent with our results, pain or sensory
thresholds are thought to show similar increases in response to different frequency
modulation program.</p><p>TENS is generally thought to block the transmission of pain signals to the central nervous
system by stimulating sensory nerves<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This mechanism is based on the pain gate
theory. And pain gate theory is important to accommodation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the pain gate theory is not the only basis for
electromedical pain management. TENS at specific frequencies can induce absolute refractory
periods and maintain nerve cells in a depolarized state<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using this mechanism, nerves that transmit sensory and nociceptive
signals can block additional sensory impulses depending on the intensity of stimulation. In
the present study, the significant increases in sensory thresholds following PPT and SFT are
likely attributable to the blocking of nerve fiber conduction.</p><p>Most commercially available TENS units are equipped with unique frequency modulation
programs. Units with these diverse stimulation patterns may be widely used based on the
unfounded theory that PPT is more effective. Further studies will be necessary to address
this question. Independent variables, such as the frequency of stimulation and the intensity
of stimulation, as well as dependent variables, such as the type, intensity, and duration of
pain being treated, should be included in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by research funds provided by the Catholic University of
