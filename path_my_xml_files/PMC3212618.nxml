One BPSP (Standard 2.0&#x02122;; Medela, Inc., McHenry, IL) has been developed based on extensive research of infant sucking patterns during established breastfeeding (e.g., after the completion of lactogenesis II).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This BPSP has two phases, based on sucking patterns used by breastfeeding infants during a single feeding.

We hypothesized that this early &#x0201c;initiation&#x0201d; sucking pattern does more than just &#x0201c;get the milk out&#x0201d;, and that its intense application to the mammary gland in the early days post-birth may play a role in programming the initiation and maintenance of an adequate milk volume.

Thus, the BPSPs that were compared in this study were developed based upon classic research in the physiology of lactation as well as the physiology of nonnutritive and nutritive infant sucking. This research demonstrates that the healthy human infant adapts the sucking rate, rhythm, and pressure to the milk flow rate<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Specifically, during nonnutritive sucking or when milk flows slowly, the infant sucks rapidly, because little or no milk is extracted. Thus, the swallow-induced airway closure is infrequent and breathing is minimally affected<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, as the milk flow rate increases, the infant must swallow the extracted milk and regulate the closure and re-opening of the airway to integrate swallowing and breathing<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> As a result, the sucking rate slows considerably.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, during established lactation, a breastfeeding infant sucks rapidly prior to milk ejection and more slowly after milk ejection because of the extra time required for swallowing and breathing once milk begins to flow regularly.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><sec id="S9"><title>The Standard BPSP</title><p id="P9">This two-phase BPSP (Standard 2.0&#x02122;; Medela, Inc., McHenry, IL) consists of an initial (2-minute) stimulation phase of rapid (120 per minute) suction events that correspond to sucking at the breast prior to milk ejection under low milk flow conditions. At the end of two minutes (or sooner if overridden by the breast pump user), this rate slows to approximately 60 events per minute to mimic nutritive sucking with regular milk flow.

However, the expression phase of this pattern incorporated a different suction curve in which the rate varied (35 to 54 cycles per minute) as a function of the amount of vacuum selected by the mother. The nadir of this vacuum curve was reached more quickly than with the STD BPSP, mimicking the sucking rate and rhythm of a &#x0201c;hungry&#x0201d; breastfeeding infant during conditions of rapid milk flow such as that which occurs immediately following milk ejection in mothers with an established milk supply.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> When the milk flow rate is rapid, infants exert less suction pressure and suck more slowly to swallow large boluses of milk and to reopen the airway to breathe.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These infant sucking characteristics were programmed into the expression phase of the experimental maintenance BPSP.</p><p id="P12">The experimental initiation and the new maintenance BPSPs were developed and field-tested over the course of 18 months by having breast pump-dependent mothers of premature infants systematically evaluate evolving versions of the BPSPs.

The study was explained and written informed consent was obtained. At the time of enrollment, mothers began breast pump use according to the randomization plan, and received standardized pumping instructions and guidance. All mothers were taught to use simultaneous (e.g., pumping both breasts at the same time) milk expression. Similarly, appropriate pumping pressures and correctly-fitted breast shields were individualized for each mother at this time. Mothers were instructed to use the breast pump 8 times daily for 15 minutes each pumping until the milk output was at least 20 mLs from the two breasts combined. Thereafter, they were instructed to pump until they no longer saw milk droplets for at least two consecutive minutes, ensuring the available milk had been removed as completely as possible. Mothers were taught to measure their pumped milk output volumetrically and were shown how to record these volumes in the milk output record. Mothers were given an initiation BPSP card to be used in the Symphony pump, according to their randomized group assignment. This card was used for all pumping sessions until the OOL-II.</p><p id="P24">Mothers completed the Time-1 questionnaire within 72 hours after enrollment. If mothers experienced the OOL-II prior to hospital discharge, they were given the maintenance card at that time.

This is the first study to compare the effectiveness, efficiency, comfort and convenience of combinations of BPSPs that mimic human infant sucking patterns during the immediate post-birth period as well as later in lactation. The findings of this study indicate that the combination of the EXP-STD BPSPs is superior to the other combinations of BPSPs for breast pump-dependent mothers with premature infants. We hypothesize that the new EXP initiation BPSP provides uniquely human sucking stimulation to the mammary gland during the critical post-birth period when lactation is initiated. This stimulatory effect is optimized when followed by the STD maintenance BPSP, which was developed and tested extensively for its effectiveness, efficiency, comfort and convenience after the OOL-II.</p><p id="P34">The complex transition from the initiation to the maintenance of lactation is a critical period and its successful completion has been linked to subsequent milk output and/or duration of lactation in human and animal studies.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The primary trigger for lactogenesis II for all mammals is the withdrawal of circulating progesterone following the birth of the placenta, because progesterone inhibits prolactin-regulated milk synthesis.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Thereafter, prolactin release by the anterior pituitary is suckling-induced, and prolactin concentrations are directly related to the intensity of the suckling stimulus.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P35">The mammary gland is extremely sensitive to the effects of prolactin in the early post-birth period.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> During this critical window, prolactin upregulates genes that promote rapid proliferation and differentiation of the secretory cells in the mammary gland, prevents apoptosis of secretory cells, and stimulates closure of the tight junctions in the mammary epithelium.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> While these processes are known to be essential for the transition from the initiation to the maintenance of lactation, recent evidence suggests that they also play a programming role with respect to long-term milk output.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Several studies in dairy cows have clearly demonstrated this programming mechanism by randomly assigning animals to either frequent (4 times daily) or control (2 times daily) milking during the first three weeks post-birth. After the three-week period, both groups of cows were milked twice daily. Results revealed that animals in the early frequent milking group produced significantly greater milk throughout lactation.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Laboratory findings demonstrated that frequent milking during this critical period resulted in higher concentrations of prolactin and greater secretory cell number and differentiation, optimizing milk yield throughout lactation. <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p id="P36">In our blinded, randomized clinical trial, the three groups of mothers and infants did not differ significantly on any of the characteristics that might potentially influence maternal milk output, such as parity, delivery mode, infant gestational age, previous breastfeeding experience or presence of maternal medical complications. Similarly, the three groups of mothers received identical pumping instructions, lactation care and access to nonpharmacologic interventions, such as skin-to-skin care, from the same set of clinicians. The findings also reveal that the three groups of women also pumped a similar number of times and minutes daily. Thus, common extraneous variables cannot explain the greater maternal milk output noted in the EXP-STD mothers.</p><p id="P37">We conclude that the mechanism for the greater effectiveness, efficiency, comfort and convenience in the EXP-STD mothers is the combination of the two BPSPs used by these women. Specifically, the EXP initiation BPSP provided an intensive rapid-rate stimulus and burst-pause pattern that is uniquely human, since other infant mammals do not demonstrate this rapid nonnutritive sucking pattern.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Additionally, the EXP initiation BPSP mimics sucking that occurs during early breastfeeding, but not bottle-feeding in healthy term infants.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Once the &#x0201c;milk comes in&#x0201d; infants change the sucking pattern to reflect the availability of milk. Specifically, they suck rapidly until milk ejection occurs, and then switch to a slower, more rhythmic suck in order to accommodate swallowing and breathing after milk ejection.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This biphasic pattern is replicated in the standard BPSP, and was used by EXP-STD mothers in our study after the OOL-II.</p><p id="P38">By 4-7 days post-birth, exclusively breastfed infants consume approximately 500-600 mL of milk daily.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In our study, EXP-STD mothers achieved a comparable mean daily milk output by day 6 and maintained it through day 14, whereas mean milk output for EXP-EXP and STD-STD mothers did not reach 500 mL per day during the entire 14-day study period. Additionally, the EXP-STD mothers achieved a mean daily milk output that was considerably higher than that previously reported for breast pump-dependent mothers of premature infants in early lactation.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P39">In summary, this research suggests that the use of BPSPs that mimic the sucking patterns of healthy term infants during the initiation and maintenance of lactation are more effective, efficient, comfortable and convenient in breast pump-dependent mothers with premature infants. Additionally, these findings add to the anatomical and biochemical evidence that the initial post-birth sucking patterns may serve a function beyond extracting milk, and appear to play a role in the programming of critical processes during the transition from the initiation to the maintenance of lactation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S30"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS287346-supplement-1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e642" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><p>Partially supported by Medela, Inc.
