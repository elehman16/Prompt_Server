Six trained men (age 34&#x000b1;6 yr) randomly performed either 5 sets of 10 repetitions (10REP), or 10 sets of 5 repetitions (5REP) of bilateral leg press exercise, with the same initial load and rest intervals between sets. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were taken before the first set, and after the first and the final sets. Compared with 5REP, 10REP resulted in a markedly greater decrease (P&#x0003c;0.05) of the power output, muscle PCr and ATP content, and markedly higher (P&#x0003c;0.05) levels of muscle lactate and IMP. Significant correlations (P&#x0003c;0.01) were observed between changes in muscle PCr and muscle lactate (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.46), between changes in muscle PCr and IMP (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.44) as well as between changes in power output and changes in muscle ATP (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.59) and lactate (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.64) levels. Reducing the number of repetitions per set by 50&#x00025; causes a lower disruption to the energy balance in the muscle. The correlations suggest that the changes in PCr and muscle lactate mainly occur simultaneously during exercise, whereas IMP only accumulates when PCr levels are low. The decrease in ATP stores may contribute to fatigue.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regular resistance exercise is an essential component of effective intervention programs designed to improve strength in athletes and adults with chronic diseases and disabilities <xref rid="pone.0040621-Colberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

The adaptive response to strength training may be different when training leads to failure is compared to when it does not lead to failure, as different degrees of fatigue and muscle metabolite accumulation are elicited by the training <xref rid="pone.0040621-Spriet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to investigate the influence of the number of repetitions per set (leading to failure or not) on changes in muscle and blood metabolites and power output during high-intensity bilateral leg press exercise performed with the same initial load (&#x0223c;83&#x00025; 1RM) in young trained men, while simultaneously examining the power output and fatigue developed throughout the exercise. These two exercise sessions are traditionally used for reaching specific training goals. Thus, the &#x0201c;leading to failure&#x0201d; exercise is characterized by a progressively decrease in load and power throughout the repeated sets and is primarily used for increasing muscular strength and hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0040621-Burd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Kraemer2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The &#x0201c;not leading to failure&#x0201d; exercise is characterized by the maintenance of load and average power throughout the sets and is used primarily for optimizing muscle power development <xref rid="pone.0040621-Izquierdo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To the author&#x02019;s knowledge, no study has analyzed the changes in muscle and blood metabolites during high-intensity dynamic exercise characterized by the maintenance of power output throughout the sets. Analyzing different conditions related to changes in power output may provide some clues to the understanding of the mechanisms by which the process of muscle contraction try to maintain an adequate function during dynamic resistance exercise <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A second purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between the metabolic status of muscle and changes in power output. This kind of examination may enhance the understanding of factors that limit fatigue during leg press exercise, and thus give an indication of the regulation of the metabolic pathways and of how the anaerobic mechanisms are interrelated during dynamic resistance exercise in man.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Six healthy male volunteers participated in the study. Their mean (&#x000b1;SD) age, height, body mass, body mass index, estimated maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) in cycle ergometer and maximal strength (1RM) during bilateral leg press exercise were 34&#x000b1;6 years, 179&#x000b1;5 cm, 74.5&#x000b1;7.2 kg, 23.3&#x000b1;1.7 Kg&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, 57.1&#x000b1;4.9 ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 199&#x000b1;43 kg, respectively. All were trained athletes, mainly in endurance events, but none trained for competition. The mean percentage of slow twitch (ST) fibers for these subjects was 65&#x000b1;12&#x00025;. The subjects were thoroughly informed of the purpose, nature, practical details and possible risks associated with the experiment, as well as the right to terminate participation at will, before they gave their voluntary written informed consent to participate. A medical examination was also completed by a physician. The present study is part of a project that has examined the metabolic, neural and training effects of leg press exercise and has been approved by the Institutional Review Committee of the Instituto Navarro del Deporte, according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental Protocol and Design</title><p>This study was designed to examine the influence of the number of repetitions per set (leading vs not leading to repetition failure) in changes in muscle metabolites and power output during high-intensity bilateral leg press exercise. To eliminate any possible effect of confounding factors, several variables such as initial load and total number of repetitions were controlled by equating their values between both exercise sessions. Each subject participated in two experiments on separate days, on which they performed 50 repetitions with the same initial load. This initial load (i.e., 154&#x000b1;31 Kg or 83&#x00025; 1RM, the heaviest load that could be correctly pressed only once using the correct technique) was the greatest weight which it was possible to complete 10 repetitions to failure (10RM) of leg press exercise. Failure was indicated by the inability to complete the next repetition. On one experimental day (&#x0201c;leading to failure protocol&#x0201d;) the subjects performed 5 sets of 10 repetitions to failure (10REP), separated by 2 min of rest between each set. On this experimental day the subjects were able to finish all 10 repetitions at the initial load during the first set. Sometimes, however, the subjects could not lift the initial load during the following sets due to fatigue. Whenever subjects could not lift the load it was decreased by 15 Kg, thus allowing them to complete the experiment (50 repetitions). On the other experimental day (&#x0201c;not leading to failure protocol&#x0201d;), the subjects performed 10 sets of 5 repetitions not to failure (5REP) with the same initial load as that of (10REP), separated by 2 min of rest between each set. Five repetitions per set were chosen during this non failure experimental day because this is the maximal number of repetitions at which maximal power production can be maintained or slightly (10&#x02013;15&#x00025;) decreased during a set of 10 repetitions to failure in leg extension exercise <xref rid="pone.0040621-Izquierdo2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In 5REP all subjects were able to finish the entire protocol with the initial load and to maintain the average power production throughout the repeated sets. In 10 REP, however, all subjects decreased the average power production throughout the sets.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention Period</title><p>All subjects participated in the two experiments in random order. Experiments were carried out at the same time of the day one to two months apart. No changes were observed in the subjects in maximal leg press strength (1RM) between the first (194&#x000b1;25 Kg) and the second (185&#x000b1;32 Kg) experimental day. To avoid disturbance of the subjects, they were instructed to record their normal diet for 48 hours prior the first experimental day and to repeat the same diet prior the second experimental day.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Preliminary Tests</title><p>Several pre-test sessions took place during the 3 weeks preceding the experiments. First, the subjects were familiarized with the experimental testing procedures about 2 weeks beforehand. Second, two weeks before the first experiment the subjects participated in a control testing day where resistance-load verifications for 1RM were determined in the leg press exercise machine. Then, after at least 10 min rest, the subjects performed a maximal repetitive set until failure with the load that theoretically should produce 10 repetitions to fatigue (&#x0223c;85&#x00025; of 1RM). If the number of repetitions until failure was equal to 10, the load was defined as a 10RM and used during the experimental main tests. If the number of repetitions until failure was different from 10, several trials of a maximal repetitive set until failure were performed on different days with lower or higher loads during subsequent test sessions, in order to determine the load leading to failure in exactly 10 repetitions. Third, the maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) of each subject was estimated <xref rid="pone.0040621-Storer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> on a separate day by using a continuous incremental test until exhaustion on a friction-loaded cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 818E, Varberg, Sweden). The first work load (60 W) was high enough to ensure that exhaustion would occur within 8&#x02013;14 min, the load being increased by 30 W at the end of every min. Heart rate was continuously monitored throughout the test (15 s) with a cardiotachometer (Sportester Polar, Kempele, Finland). Average power output at exhaustion was 347&#x000b1;27 W.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Main Tests</title><p>On the morning of the experiment, the subject arrived after a light breakfast and a 2 h fast period. On arrival at the laboratory subjects rested on a bed for 20 minutes so that small incisions could be made under local anesthesia (2 ml, 1&#x00025; lidocaine) in the skin and fascia over the vastus lateralis muscle of one leg. The subjects then completed a warm-up period consisting of a set of 5 repetitions at 50&#x00025;, three to four repetitions at 75&#x00025; and 1 repetition at 90&#x00025; of maximal bilateral leg press strength (1RM). Three to four subsequent attempts were made to determine the 1RM. The resting period between maximal attempts was always 2 min. After 10 min rest, a muscle biopsy (initial biopsy) was taken from the middle region of the muscle vastus lateralis (15 cm above the patella and approximately 3 cm below entry through the fascia) and after an arterialized blood sample was drawn from the earlobe, previously hyperemized with Finalgon&#x000ae; (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). Then they performed either 5 sets of 10 repetitions to failure (10REP) or 10 set of 5 repetitions not to failure (5REP) with the maximum load possible to achieve 10 repetitions during the first set (10RM). Subjects were instructed to always try to displace the weight as fast as possible. The duration of each repetition decomposed in its concentric and eccentric components was recorded. Repetitions were interspaced by &#x0223c;1-s pauses to prevent stretch-shortening cycle enhancement of performance. The power output of each repetition was monitored continuously and measured during the concentric phase of leg press action. Immediately (within 5&#x02013;10 s) after the last repetition of the first set and immediately after the last repetition of the last set muscle biopsies were taken in all subjects. Additional arterialized blood samples were drawn after 16 and 45 min of recovery to determine the post-exercise uric acid blood concentration. All participants were highly motivated and strong verbal encouragement was given to all subjects to motivate them to perform each repetition maximally and as rapidly as possible. Subjects remained fasted throughout the tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Equipment</title><p>The study was performed on a horizontal bilateral leg extension variable resistance machine (i.e. leg press action in a sitting position; Technogym, Gambettola, Italy). The sitting position was individually adjusted to minimize displacement between the lower back and backrest during muscular force exertion and, therefore, to avoid posture changes. Subjects were instructed to put their feet in the same position on the force platform. The exercise machine incorporated four force transducers on a foot platform located below the subject&#x02019;s feet. The strain gauges recorded the applied force (N) to an accuracy of 1 Newton at 1000 Hz. The force platform and leg press plate all remained stationary throughout the lift, while the body moved away from the feet. In addition, a rotational encoder (Computer Optical Products Inc, California, USA) was attached to the weight plates to record the position and direction of the displacement to an accuracy of 0.2 mm at 1000 Hz. Customized software was used to calculate power (immediate product of displacement velocity and applied force) per repetition. After the end of the exercise, results were integrated over 1-ms intervals. The maximum 10-ms integral of applied force and displacement velocity during each repetition is referred to as &#x0201c;peak power output&#x0201d;. The average 10-ms integral of applied force and displacement velocity over the total concentric contraction time of each repetition is referred to as &#x0201c;mean power output&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Muscle Samples</title><p>Muscle biopsies were taken as described by Bergstrom <xref rid="pone.0040621-Bergstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> from the right leg on each occasion.

Student&#x02019;s paired t-test was used for comparisons of analytic values during the two different experimental conditions in this study, whereas one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to examine the differences in performance indexes and metabolite concentrations over time. When a significant F-value was achieved (P&#x0003c;0.05), the means were compared using a LSD post-hoc test. For the purposes of comparison the power output for the second 5 repetitions of each set was compared with that of the first 5 repetitions. Coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was used to determine associations among variables taking both exercise conditions as a whole. Linear or non linear regressions were determined using either a linear or a second-degree polynomial form. A second-degree polynomial form was accepted if it resulted in a significant reduction in error variance as compared with the linear solution.

At the end of the 10REP exercise PCr stores were almost depleted (85&#x00025; fall, P&#x0003c;0.05), whilst ATP (21&#x00025;), energy charge (4&#x00025;), and the total amount of adenine nucleotides pool (ATP &#x0002b; ADP &#x0002b; AMP) (20&#x00025;) where reduced (P&#x0003c;0.05). Concomitantly, IMP and lactate where increased. In contrast to 10REP, 5REP resulted in markedly lower decrease of the muscle PCr (&#x0223c;15&#x00025; fall, P&#x0003c;0.05) and unchanged muscle ATP, IMP, energy charge and the total amount of adenine nucleotide pool concentrations, whereas muscle lactate was only slightly elevated above the initial levels.

The use of this model of 10REP caused a state of energy deficiency and a decline in the phosphate potential resulting in a near-complete depletion of PCr stores, a significant reduction in ATP (21&#x00025;) and the size of muscle total adenine nucleotide pool (TAN), and in marked increases in lactate and IMP accumulation in the muscle as well as high levels of uric acid in the blood. The elevated levels of muscle lactate indicate that anaerobic glycolysis is extensively activated during this type of exercise.

These changes have been also associated with large reductions in muscle glycogen <xref rid="pone.0040621-Saltin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and ATP <xref rid="pone.0040621-Saltin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, particularly in Type II fibers <xref rid="pone.0040621-Casey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, with the most pronounced changes being located in type IIx fibers <xref rid="pone.0040621-Koopman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, whereas blood and muscle pH can reach values as low as 7.1 <xref rid="pone.0040621-McCartney1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and 6.6 <xref rid="pone.0040621-Bogdanis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> respectively. However, the experimental protocol in previous studies was not the same as in the present study in which repetitive isoinertial contractions using leg press actions were used. Thus, it appears that 10REP causes a marked disruption to the energy balance in the muscle.</p><p>In contrast to 10 repetitions with a 10RM load (10REP), the energy balance was maintained during 5 repetitions with a 10RM load (5REP), despite the accumulation of sets. Thus, compared with 10REP, 5REP resulted in a markedly lower decrease in muscle PCr content (&#x0223c;15&#x00025; vs 80&#x00025; fall) with only modest increases in muscle lactate and no measurable changes in muscle levels of ATP and IMP and in blood levels of uric acid. These minor metabolite changes observed in 5REP, despite a high ATP turnover rate, suggest that ATP synthesis matched ATP utilization and that cellular homeostasis was maintained, thereby demonstrating that the rate of AMP deamination was low <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Consequently, peak power output was maintained only during the 5REP exercise. The absence of blood uric acid increase during 5REP is in line with the finding of unchanged ATP levels. These results indicate that reducing the number of repetitions per set by 50&#x00025; maintains power output and energy balance in the muscle throughout sets.</p><p>The changes in the ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios during the contraction process have been widely studied because the relative levels of the adenine nucleotides are more important metabolic regulators for maintenance of adequate cellular functions than the absolute concentration of ATP <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. At the end of 5REP the calculated ATP/ADP ratio was decreased by 9&#x00025; compared with initial values, and was coincidental with no changes in the calculated energy charge, AMP, ATP/AMP and ATP/IMP ratios, with a 7&#x02013;20&#x00025; decrease in the average peak power between the second and the fifth repetition of each set, and with moderate decreases (30&#x00025;) in PCr levels. The dichotomy between changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and changes in the ATP/AMP ratio during exercise is not without precedent. Thus, increases in the estimated muscle-free ADP content, without any changes in estimated free AMP, have been observed during 15 s sprint isokinetic cycling exercise <xref rid="pone.0040621-Parolin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or after 10 minutes of cycling at 65&#x00025; of maximal oxygen uptake <xref rid="pone.0040621-Howlett1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, indicating that an slight initial increase in ADP availability does not displace the adenylaye kinase favouring the formation of AMP (ADP &#x0002b; ADP &#x02194; AMP &#x0002b; ATP), when the decrease in power production and the changes in muscle PCr or P<sub>i</sub> levels are moderate. The activity of adenylate kinase was still low after 5REP, probably because the dephosphorylation of ADP to AMP is buffered by PCr <xref rid="pone.0040621-Casey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this situation the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be only slightly activated by the increased ADP availability <xref rid="pone.0040621-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. At the end of 10REP, however, a further decrease (30&#x00025;) in the ATP/ADP ratio, higher to that seen after 5 REP, was accompanied by decreases in the ATP/AMP and ATP/IMP ratios, in parallel with further decreases (33&#x00025;) in power production and with almost depleted PCr levels. The decreased ATP/AMP and ATP/IMP ratios indicate that, as opposed to 5REP, during 10REP the adenylate kinase and the AMP deaminase were significantly activated. The very low levels of PCr and the activation of adenylate kinase could amplify the activation of AMPK, that acts as a fuel-sensing enzyme monitoring cellular energy levels to prevent the catastrophic consequences of larger decreases in energy state <xref rid="pone.0040621-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040621-Tullson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This dual mechanism (initial decreases in ATP/ADP ratio followed by later decreases in ATP/AMP and ATP/IMP ratio) would allow AMPK to sense energy deficit progressively over a wide range of energy availability <xref rid="pone.0040621-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The described repetition-related differences in acute metabolic response to repeated sets of leg press exercise should reflect two different stimuli for training-induced adaptations occurring after heavy-resistance training. Thus, some studies have shown that high-intensity resistance training not to failure of the knee extensor muscles enables a favorable environment for achieving greater enhancements in maximal strength and power output compared with training to failure <xref rid="pone.0040621-Izquierdo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Kraemer3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sanborn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Taken together, the results of these studies and the present one suggest that a program of dynamic knee extension resistance exercise characterized by low metabolite accumulation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis and energy balance may be a more effective, efficient and safe option compared with training to failure designed to maximize fatigue/metabolite accumulation. Under this assumption, it would be time to replace the classical &#x0201c;no pain, no gain&#x0201d; training philosophy to a more rational and ecologically based &#x0201c;no pain, more gain&#x0201d; one.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Relationships between Muscle Metabolites</title><p>Previous studies have shown that during fatiguing and not fatiguing isometric knee extension and cycling exercise average absolute PCr content changed curvilinearly and negatively with respect to the absolute muscle lactate content <xref rid="pone.0040621-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the present study a significant curvilinear negative relationship was observed throughout the exercises between the percent decrease of muscle PCr and the corresponding muscle lactate content. This agrees with the findings of Karlsson and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0040621-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> during maximal and submaximal cycling exercise and with the close relationship between the logarithm of mass-action ratio of the creatine kinase reaction and muscle pH reported in men after isometric knee extension exercise <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sahlin2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, it indicates that the changes between the PCr and lactate mainly occur simultaneously during exercise, supporting the observations of others that the anaerobic glycolysis is initiated in the muscle at the onset of heavy exercise <xref rid="pone.0040621-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In agreement with our results, accumulation of IMP matched quantitatively by a decline in intramuscular ATP has been reported during submaximal and maximal cycling exercise when PCr levels drop below 40&#x00025; of the resting levels <xref rid="pone.0040621-Sahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Hultman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Spriet2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>What Causes Fatigue during Consecutive Sets of Leg Press Exercise?</title><p>Several authors have suggested that the capacity to regenerate ATP at the required rates and thus decrease force and power production during short duration maximal exercise may by related to an inability to maintain the required rate of anaerobic ATP production from PCr and glycogen degradation, mainly in type II fibers <xref rid="pone.0040621-Hultman2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040621-Karatzaferi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, a corresponding increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) and its diprotonated form, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sup>4&#x02212;</sup>, increases in [H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>], alterations in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transport <xref rid="pone.0040621-Nakamaru1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> efflux from the muscle <xref rid="pone.0040621-Juel1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> or impaired neuromuscular transmission or failure of membrane excitation <xref rid="pone.0040621-Edwards2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the present study the fall in power production during both exercises as a whole was strongly correlated to the fall in ATP stores and to the lactate levels in mixed muscle homogenates. The association between changes in power output and changes in muscle lactate accumulation are in agreement with the above mentioned studies. The association observed between the loss of ATP stores and the relative decline in power output supports the idea that ATP depletion in a small percentage of fibers may lead to their failure to power production <xref rid="pone.0040621-Karatzaferi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This idea is in agreement with some studies reporting post-exercise ATP levels in individual fibers as low as 1 to 2.4 mmol&#x000b7;Kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> wet muscle following maximal knee extension <xref rid="pone.0040621-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, or isokinetic cycling <xref rid="pone.0040621-Karatzaferi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> exercise. Hence, it is not unreasonable to suggest that some biochemical changes, such as a decrease in ATP stores and increases in lactate and by-products of ATP (H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, P<sub>i</sub>, ADP) of individual muscle fibers may contribute to fatigue during successive sets of leg press exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>This study had some limitations. First, it was characterized by a low number of experimental subjects. However, the strong statistically significant differences observed in muscle metabolites and power between the two exercises indicates that it is unlikely these differences occurred by chance. Future longitudinal biopsy studies should seek to recruit larger numbers of experimental subjects in order to reduce the potential risk of type II errors. Second, it may also be argued that the experimental setup could have been strengthened by matching the same load throughout sets and the total rest period between protocols (e.g. 1-min rest between sets in 5REP and 2-min rest between sets in 10REP). This would enable comparisons between two types of equivolumic exercise. It is obvious that, in this case, the magnitude of the differences between exercises would be lower than that observed in the present study. However, it has to be emphasized that the main goal was to compare metabolic and power changes during two types of resistance exercises traditionally used for reaching specific training outcomes (&#x0201c;hypertrophy&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;optimal strength improvement&#x0201d;), but not to compare two equivolumic exercises. Finally, this study was performed in endurance trained men with a high proportion (65&#x00025;) of type I fibers. Care should be taken when generalizing the results of this study to other populations (e.g. power athletes with high proportion of type II fibers). Despite these limitations, the findings do provide important and new information about the metabolic characteristics of two of the most popular high-intensity resistance exercises designed to increase muscular strength, power and hypertrophy in athletes and adults with chronic diseases and disabilities.</p><p>In summary, the main results of this study were, first, that reducing the number of repetitions during sets from ten to five while maintaining the same initial load and recovery periods in between induced markedly smaller demands on the high-energy phosphates system and on glycolytic energy supply, allowed ATP synthesis to match ATP utilization, to maintain power output and energy balance along the sets and to experience much less fatigue and discomfort during bilateral leg press exercise. Second, in mixed muscle homogenates the changes in muscle PCr during both exercises were correlated with muscle lactate and IMP content. These correlations suggest that the changes between the PCr and muscle lactate mainly occur simultaneously during exercise whereas IMP only accumulates when PCr levels are low. Finally, the fall in power production was strongly correlated to the fall in ATP stores and to the muscle lactate levels. This suggest that a decrease in ATP stores and increases in lactate and by-products of ATP (H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, P<sub>i</sub>, ADP) of individual muscle fibers may contribute to fatigue during successive sets of leg press exercise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education (National Plan of R&#x00026;D&#x0002b;I 2004&#x02013;2007, Key action &#x0201c;Sport and Physical Activity&#x0201d; DEP2006-56076).
