device (SSD) on pain and hamstring extensibility in patients with non-specific low back
pain (NSLBP). [Subjects and Methods] 20 patients with NSLBP were recruited and randomly
assigned to either the SSD group or the control group. In the SSD group, SSD was applied;
in the control group, bed rest in supine position was performed. Both groups underwent
treatment 20&#x02005;min/day, 3 times a week, for a duration of 4 weeks. To assess the hamstring
extensibility, sit and reach test (SRT) was performed. To assess pain pressure threshold
(PPT) of the sacroiliac joint, a pressure algometer was used. Visual analog scale (VAS)
was used to quantify pain. [Results] The SSD group showed a significant improvement in
sacroiliac joint pain with increased VAS, and the control group showed a significantly
increased VAS after intervention. In the SSD group, VAS was significantly increased, but
SRT was not changed compared with the control group. [Conclusion] These results
demonstrated that an application of SSD effectively attenuates low back pain. Therefore,
SSD may be a suitable intervention for pain control in patients with NSLBP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hamstring</kwd><kwd>Nonspecific low back pain</kwd><kwd>Spinal support device</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a common health problem worldwide, and most people of
all ages may suffer from NSLBP<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. NSLBP is
associated with decreased range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and flexibility of the
lumbar and hip joints<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, which can result
in tension soreness and stiffness of the lumbar and hip joints. These changes by NSLBP may
lead to a functional limitation in daily-living activities and a decrease in social
activity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is commonly well established that people with NSLBP experience decreased hamstring
extensibility<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased hamstring
extensibility increases posterior tilting of the pelvis, decreasing lumbar lordosis, which
may result in a flat back posture. Flat back posture has been known to be highly correlated
with low back pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hagen et al. has reported that bed rest with an appropriate position can alleviate back
pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nachemson et al. has also shown
that appropriate position in supine decreased intradiscal pressures in patients with
NSLBP<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few previous studies
investigated the effects of lumbar curvature using orthosis on non-specific low back
pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, more studies on the effect of orthosis, which corrects lumbar
curvature on pain and hamstring extensibility in patients with non-specific low back pain
are necessary.</p><p>Spinal support device (SSD) was developed to correct abnormal spinal curvatures. However,
the effect of orthosis on NSLBP has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to demonstrate the effect of SSD on pain and hamstring extensibility in patients with
NSLBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>20 people with NSLBP were recruited. The inclusion criteria were as follows: having NSLBP
for at least 1 month prior to participation, fingertip-to-floor distance &#x02265;0&#x02005;cm, passive
straight leg raise of &#x02265;70 degrees, visual analog scale of &#x02265;3, and touching of knee joint and
chest in passive hip-flexion test. The exclusion criteria were as follows: cardiovascular
disease, neurologic disease, or having specific disease process such as infection, tumor, or
injury to a specific anatomic structure. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Gachon University.</p><p>To measure the hamstring extensibility, the sit and reach test (SRT) was performed using a
sitting trunk flexion meter (Sitting Trunk Flexion Meter, TAKEI, Japan). Subjects were
seated on the floor with the soles of their feet against the box and with their hips flexed
about 90&#x000b0;, and then the flexed hip joints and trunk to reach forward as far as possible with
maintaining their knees, arms, and fingers fully extended for approximately 5 s<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The score was determined as the mean
values of 3 consecutive measurements.</p><p>To measure pain pressure threshold (PPT), a pressure algometer (NeuroDyneMedicaco Corp.,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was used. PPT was measured 5&#x02005;cm laterally to the L5 spinous process of
the side with more pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The threshold
was determined as the mean values out of 3 consecutive measurements, with a pause of 10&#x02005;s
between the measurements. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was also used to assess pain levels of
subjects<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, 20 subjects were randomly allocated to the SSD group (n=10) and the
control group (n=10) using a random allocation software. Two groups performed the
intervention for 20&#x02005;min a day, 3 times a week for a total period of 4 weeks (12 sessions).
In the SSD group, bed rest using SSD (Chiropractic nap, Balancecord, Korea) was performed.
SSD had 0.5&#x02005;cm and 1&#x02005;cm processes on the paraspianl muscles for muscle relaxation. The
lowest point of SSD was to touch the coccyx in supine position on a hard mat. For SSD
application, subjects were maintained in supine position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Spinal support device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1301-g001"/></fig>). The control group performed bed rest only. To confirm whether the subjects
performed the intervention in each group, an examiner called each subject once every three
days to check the status. For all subjects, SRT, PPT, and VAS were assessed before and after
the intervention by the assessor who was blinded to the group assignment.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0. The ratio variables were expressed
as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Mann-Whitney U test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were
performed to analyze the general characteristics between the two groups. Wilcoxon
signed-ranks test was used to compare the changes before and after the intervention.
Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the changes between the two groups. A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of participants in the two groups are presented in the <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="33.8843%" span="1"/><col width="33.0579%" span="1"/><col width="33.0579%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSD group (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (Frmale/Male)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.8 &#x000b1; 4.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.9 &#x000b1; 6.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.3 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.0 &#x000b1; 7.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.9 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.0 &#x000b1; 8.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Values are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

with NSLBP by correcting lumbar lordosis in supine position. PPT and VAS was significantly
increased in the SSD group. The control group showed a significant improvement in VAS only.
The SSD group showed a greater significant improvement of VAS compared with the control
group. Thus, we suggest that SSD may be effective for managing NSLBP.</p><p>NSLBP is associated with hamstring extensibility and flat back posture. Previous study has
reported that back pain is associated with decreased hamstring extensibility<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, we showed that application of
SSD for a duration of 4 weeks did not show an increase in hamstring extensibility for
patients with NSLBP, both before and after the intervention. SSD is an orthosis that can
correct abnormal flat back posture; however, bed-rest with SSD failed to significantly
improve hamstring extensibility. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that using SSD increases
hamstring extensibility in NSLBP patients.</p><p>In this study, the SSD group significantly increased PPT of SIJ for pre-post interventions
and significantly increased VAS compared with the control group. This may suggest that
best-rest with SSD may be more effective than bed-rest only for patients with NSLBP. The SSD
group also showed a significant increase of VAS and PPT compared with the control group. The
gate control theory may explain this phenomenon<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Small diameter afferent fibers (A-delta and C fibers) carry pain
signals and large diameter afferent fibers (A-alpha and A-beta fibers) carry sensory
information (non-painful signal) to the spinal cord, such as vibration and tactile
sensation. Gate control theory proposes that a stimulation of large diameter afferent fibers
inhibits the neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, preventing pain signals to be transferred by
small diameter fibers, whereby a stimulation by non-noxious input can suppress pain
signal<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, SSD interventions for 4
weeks may decrease pain via the activation of large nerve fibers stimulated by the SSD
process. In addition, considering that NSLBP may result in secondary hyperalgesia, which
occurs because of central sensitization in patients with NSLBP, as well as primary
hyperalgesia<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, SSD interventions for 4 weeks may induce changes of the central
nervous system, inducing a recovery of central sensitization<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that SSD may be effective for pain in patients with NSLBP,
suggesting that SSD may be a good therapeutic intervention for NSLBP. However, considering
that our study represented data from a small sample size and subjects with mild pain with a
short-term intervention of 4 weeks, further studies are necessary to better generalize the
effects of SSD for NSLBP patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Maher</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Underwood</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchbinder</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Non-specific low back pain</article-title>.
