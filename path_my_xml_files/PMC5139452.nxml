The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is estimated to be approximately 387 million people around the world.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] As a result of pandemic level, macro- and micro-vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus may emerge, which can be a major threat to general public health throughout the world with huge economic and social costs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recent evidences suggested the possible role of low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus are usually characterized by an increase in oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] As a result, most therapies have been primarily focused on potential antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this context, natural dietary components offer simple, yet effective alternative therapeutic strategy.</p><p>Among various natural dietary components, pomegranate juice has recently received much attention as a functional anti-inflammatory agent.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The high content of polyphenols in pomegranate juice could explain its anti-inflammatory effect. Over the years, numerous studies have been dedicated to pomegranate extract and its potential anti-inflammatory effects. However, pomegranate seed oil (PSO) can also offer an anti-inflammatory effects and few studies have examined its potentials.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>PSO consists of a high content of conjugated linolenic acid (9-cis, 11-trans, 13-cis) octadecatrienoic acid or punicic acid (main bioactive ingredient).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Findings of different <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies regarding the effectiveness of PSO are controversial. Current investigations suggest that PSO may improve Type 2 diabetes by ameliorating insulin resistance and obesity in rats with high fat content diet.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, punicic acid improved fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lipid profiles.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Our goal in this study is to present a thorough investigation of PSO and its potentials as a possible natural dietary component for improving insulin resistance, plasma glucose, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty patients (28 men and 52 women), aging 52 &#x000b1; 6.8 years, with Type 2 diabetes were enrolled by convenience sampling from the medical records of the patients in Isfahan Endocrine and Metabolism research center; all of the patients received oral hypoglycemic agents. Inclusion criteria were as follows: Willingness to entrance to the study; Type 2 diabetes mellitus (for 5&#x02013;10 years); age between 35 and 65 years; body mass index between 20 and 30. Exclusion criteria were as follows: Smoking, pregnancy, any other chronic disease, taking estrogen, progesterone, and corticosteroid or antioxidant supplements or insulin as diabetes medication, any weight loss diets in the past month; patients with severe hyperglycemia (FPG &#x0003e;250); renal failure; heart disease; and liver failure.</p><p>Considering the suggested formula, given the Type 1 error of 5%, the study power of 80% and based on previous publications, we needed 33 people in each group. As we might have some missing, we added the number of each group to 40 people. At baseline, the participants were stratified by sex and randomly allocated in two: Intervention (PSO, <italic>n</italic> = 40) and control (placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 40) groups, using sequentially numbered containers. An assistant performed the randomization. Both the investigator and participants were blinded about the randomization.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each of the selected patients.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial which evaluated the outcomes of PSO consumption in diabetic patients. The previous studies have shown PSO effects in animal models.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study conducted on mice, Miranda <italic>et al</italic>. have shown PA did not decrease the fat accumulation in liver and other organs of rats fed an obesogenic diet and did not lead to improve glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Nekooeian <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the impact of PSO Type 2 diabetic rats. They indicated that plasma insulin level increased without any reduction in plasma glucose level. The mechanism of this is unknown but it might be related to the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g) genes.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed punicic acid ameliorate tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) induced protein dysfunction therefore glucose uptake and insulin resistance may improve after administration of the punicic acid.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In another study, PSO consumption resulted in reduction of plasma TNF-&#x003b1; levels in mice. However, PSO treatment in dyslipidemic patients had no effect on the serum TNF-&#x003b1; in one study.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have documented that punicic acid is an agonist for PPARs, the molecular target for thiazolidinediones, antidiabetic agents. However, the natural agonists of PPARs are punicic acid. PA may increases gene expression of PPARs and thus improves glucose homeostasis and inflammation-related insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>They also showed that PSO may reduce oxidative stress, but did not have an effect on serum lipid profile. The previous studies have documented &#x02018;n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid are hypolipidemic agent.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Results of recent studies on the effect of PSO on lipid profiles are controversial. In the present study, there was no significant difference in the serum total cholesterol, LDL, HDL-C levels, and TAG in two groups of diabetic patients. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> study on obese, hyperlipidemic rats, it was demonstrated that the diet supplemented with PSO did not have an effect on abdominal white adipose tissue and serum lipid profile but reduces hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation similar to the control group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A probable mechanism confirmed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, that in HepG2 cells 9-cis, 11-trans, 13-cis CLN suppressed the synthesis of TAG.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Mirmiran <italic>et al</italic>. found that the consumption of 800 mg PSO did not change cholesterol and LDL-C but decreased TAG and TAG: HDL-C ratio during 4-week of study in hyperlipidemic subjects.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>It should be noted that there is no previous experience with PSO in diabetic patients, which limited us to administrate increase doses of PSO.</p><p>Limitations of this trial are small sample size of studied population and not evaluation of serum PSO level.</p><p>Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of PSO supplementation in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In the present study, we found that consumption of 2000 mg PSO/day for 8 weeks had no effect on fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and lipid profile in diabetic patients. It may be concerned to small sample size of our study. We need to investigate the effect of PSO in larger groups of people or we should increase the duration of the study. As we have shown the safety of 2000 mg/day of PSO, future studies can increase the dose of it.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"
