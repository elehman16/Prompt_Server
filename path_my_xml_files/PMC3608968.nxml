The piezosurgery medical device allows the efficient cutting of mineralized tissues with minimal trauma to soft tissues. Piezoelectric osteotome has found its role in surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME), a procedure well established to correct transverse maxillary discrepancies. The advantages include minimal risk to critical anatomic structures. The purpose of this clinical comparative study (CIS 2007-237-M) was to present the advantages of the piezoelectric cut as a minimally invasive device in surgically assisted, rapid maxillary expansion by protecting the maxillary sinus mucosal lining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty patients (18 females and 12 males) at the age of 18 to 54 underwent a surgically assisted palatal expansion of the maxilla with a combined orthodontic and surgical approach. The patients were randomly divided into two separate treatment groups. While Group 1 received conventional surgery using an oscillating saw, Group 2 was treated with piezosurgery. The following parameters were examined: blood pressure, blood values, required medication, bleeding level in the maxillary sinus, duration of inpatient stay, duration of surgery and height of body temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results displayed no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding laboratory blood values and inpatient stay. The duration of surgery revealed a significant discrepancy. Deploying piezosurgery took the surgeon an average of 10&#x000a0;minutes longer than working with a conventional-saw technique. However, the observation of the bleeding level in the paranasal sinus presented a major and statistically significant advantage of piezosurgery: on average the bleeding level was one category above the one of the remaining patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This method of piezoelectric surgery with all its advantages is going to replace many conventional operating procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>CIS 2007-237-M</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Maxillary expansion</kwd><kwd>Piezosurgery</kwd><kwd>Saw</kwd><kwd>Neurologic</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Transverse expansion of the maxilla was first done in 1860 by means of an orthodontic appliance. In the following decennia, the orthodontic treatment evolved. The theory of distraction was first published in 1905 by Codivilla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The combined surgical and orthodontic treatment for maxillary expansion was introduced in 1938 for skeletally matured patients. The first successful use of distraction on the femur of a significant group of patients was published in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In 1999, the first bone-borne distractor was introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Once skeletal maturity has been reached, orthodontic treatment alone cannot provide a stable widening of the constricted maxilla in cases of deficiencies of more than 5&#x000a0;mm. In general, an orthodontist can camouflage transverse discrepancies less than 5&#x000a0;mm with orthopedic forces alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tooth extractions for alignment of dental arches are often unnecessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As mentioned before, surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME) is a form of distraction that was applied before its biological healing principles were known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Physicians have to decide between two methods of expansion: SME (slow maxillary expansion) and RME (rapid maxillary expansion). Applying SME, the maxilla is broadened by 0.5 to 1&#x000a0;mm per week; meanwhile, using RME demands an expansion of 0.6 to 0.8&#x000a0;mm three times a day. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion is a method which, using combined orthodontic-oral surgical treatment, leads to a distinctive extension of the midline palatal suture. Thereby, it is possible to avoid extractions, widen the nasal floor and support the change from oral to nasal breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>SARME is considered a procedure with little risk of serious complications; however, several complications are mentioned in the literature, varying from life threatening epistaxis to a cerebrovascular accident, skull base fracture with reversible oculomotor nerve pareses and orbital compartment syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Less serious complications reported are postoperative hemorrhage, pain, sinusitis, palatal tissue irritation/ulceration, asymmetrical expansion, nasal septum deviation, periodontal problems and relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In 1976 Bell and Epker, as well as Neubert in 1989, described the surgically assisted maxillary expansion, all using an oscillating saw that injured the mucous membrane of the maxillary sinus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, only a little information exists on how to preserve this mucous sinus membrane during the intervention. However, in 2001 Vercelotti described a new technique in osseous surgery which overcame the limits of traditional instrumentation in oral bone surgery by modifying and improving conventional ultrasound technology. Therefore, Vercelotti is known as the inventor of piezosurgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a technique that allows the soft tissue to rest and a tendency for less bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It transmits a special modular ultrasonic vibration frequency on the scalpel. Not only is this technique clinically effective, but histological and histomorphometric evidence of wound healing and bone formation in experimental animal models has shown that tissue response is more favorable in piezosurgery than it is in conventional bone-cutting techniques, such as with diamond or carbide rotary instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Voltage applied to a polarized piezoceramic causes it to expand in the direction of and contract perpendicular to polarity. A frequency of 25 to 29&#x000a0;kHz is used because the micromovements that are created at this frequency (ranging between 60 and 210&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) cut only mineralized tissue; neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue is cut at frequencies higher than 50&#x000a0;kHz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Piezoelectric devices are an innovative ultrasonic technique for safe and effective osteotomy or osteoplasty compared with traditional hard and soft tissue methods that use rotating instruments because of the absence of macrovibrations, ease of use and control, and safer cutting, particularly in complex anatomical areas. Its physical and mechanical properties have several clinical advantages: precise cutting, sparing of vital neurovascular bundles and better visualization of the surgical field. Piezoelectric bone surgery seems to be more efficient in the first phases of bony healing; it induces an earlier increase in bone morphogenetic proteins, controls the inflammatory process better, and stimulates remodeling of bone as early as 56&#x000a0;days after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>SARME is reported to be performed under either general or local anesthesia, but with differences in surgical technique. Pterygo-maxillary separation is not recommended by those who have performed SARME under local anesthesia, as it is performed blindly and can produce profuse bleeding from the descending palatine bundle that is not easily controlled without a maxillary down-fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Separation of the pterygoid junction is thus particularly useful if greater posterior expansion is desired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The use of ultrasonic vibrations for fracture of the pterygoid plates during orthognathic surgery has been recently reported by Ueki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In other words, the scope of the study is to answer the question of whether a surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion using Piezosurgery&#x000ae; (Mectron, Carasco, Italy) without using saws and chisels is as effective as one applying conventional procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Approval for the study was obtained from the relevant ethics committee at the University of Muenster, Germany (CIS 2007-237-M).

The division into two groups occurred randomly. To reduce bleeding in the maxillary sinus, patients of the first group were treated conventionally with an oscillating saw, while patients of the second group were treated with a piezoelectrical saw. Exclusion criteria were syndromes like cleft or craniofacial deformities. Patients with systemic disorders, cardiac diseases, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, infectious diseases, coagulative disorders, pregnancy and patients receiving any regular drug therapy (for example, antiphlogistic), except oral contraceptives, were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>Since patients were diagnosed with skeletal and dental malocclusion, all patients underwent preoperative orthodontics. All surgical interventions were conducted under general anesthesia with oral intubation and, in three cases, with nasal intubation to obtain better photographic documentation. The surgical procedure was standardized as Le-Fort 1 maxillary without the down-fracture technique as described by Epker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The surgery was performed by one single surgeon. Drug therapy in both groups included 1,000&#x000a0;mg paracetamol (Perfalgan&#x000ae;) intravenously and 100&#x000a0;mg diclofenac (Voltaren&#x000ae;, Novartis, Munich, Germany) per day for two days from the second post-operative day as anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapy. Antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of Rocephin (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) 2,000&#x000a0;mg per day for two days. Perioperatively, only a single dose of 50&#x000a0;mg steroids (Solu Decortin&#x000ae; (Merck Pharma GmbH , Darmstadt, Germany) was administered to every patient (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Demonstrates the distraction device connected with the postoperative visible diastema.</bold> (<bold>B</bold>) Intraoral upper occlusion view shows the successful expansion of the maxilla postoperative.

The device consists of a platform with a powerful piezoelectric hand piece and uses a functional frequency between 25 and 29&#x000a0;kHz with the possibility of digital modulation (boosted) up to 30&#x000a0;kHz. The device is also fitted with a cooling irrigation system with a 0 to 60 &#x003bc;L/min of variable sterile solution flow. Specific inserts and scalpels act in a linear vibration pattern, with the spatial range included between 60 and 210&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, moved by ultrasonic power that exceeds 5&#x000a0;W, reaching also 16&#x000a0;W (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Piezosurgery&#x000ae; medical, multipurpose device uses micrometric ultrasonic piezoelectric vibrations, variable in frequency and in cutting energy.</bold> There is a therapeutic potential and benefit of the piezoelectric-assisted surgical saw in dentoalveolar surgery. Piezosurgery&#x000ae; enables more precise and nontraumatic cutting of bone in comparison to conventional methods (micrometic cut). The instrument vibrates with a modulated ultrasonic frequency. Because the vibration frequency of Piezosurgery&#x000ae; is optimal for mineralized tissue, it does not cut soft tissue. Therefore, an osteotomy with this device to remove a bony mass of the mandible prevents anatomic soft tissue injuries, such as to the dentoalveolar nerve (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-49-2"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Le-fort I osteotomy using Piezosurgery&#x000ae; medical device with the OT 7A insert.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-49-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Consort flow diagram</title><p>At the time of presentation, 48 patients were assessed for eligibility to be included in the study.

When having a closer look at the corresponding literature one sees that no exact indications of how to accomplish a maxillary expansion are defined. The success of a maxillary expansion has been known for centuries, but its efficacy for early treatment cannot yet be rated. As a rule, orthodontists urge an early start of therapy because at that time the growing activity of the bones can be utilized. Nevertheless, there are serious limits, such as orthognathic deseases beyond which an orthodontist should contact a maxillofacial surgeon. In reality, this happens rarely. A similar issue arises when orthodontists do not recommend a maxillary expansion because it requires surgery and, therefore, contains some risk, but instead prefer the extraction of healthy premolars.</p><p>The applied surgical method resembles, except for some smaller modifications, the method used by Bell and Epker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The control of the laboratory blood values was conducted by the author himself, as well as the interventions applying piezosurgery. The conventional and piezoelectrical surgeries were accomplished by another surgeon. Therefore, a short learning curve was necessary to get used to the new cutting device. Since piezosurgery needs some time of familiarization, the first five piezosurgery patients were not included in this study.</p><p>Due to the exact incision and accurate osteotomy, no arterial vessels were injured and, consequently, no major bleeding occurred. Both patient groups lost approximately the same amount of blood, but since piezosurgery took an average of 10&#x000a0;minutes longer, for Group 2 the loss of blood per unit of time was less than for Group 1. For the author and his team the post-operative condition of the patients that were operated on with the piezo-saw was unambiguous. Some of them were physically more active after a much shorter period of time than Group 1 patients and could, therefore, leave the hospital earlier. However, some patients of Group 2 required a higher degree of pain medication and had to stay another day. A better method for patient selection would have been selecting according to age and gender. This way it would have been easier to distinguish between objective and subjective pain of the different age and gender groups. Due to the random assignment, Group 2 included more females and a larger number of young people. Presumably this is the reason why Group 2 displayed more pain and more circulatory problems. This assumption can be affirmed by the fact that within Group 1 the younger and female patients exhibited more pain and circulatory problems as well. Nevertheless, this study worked with people of all ages to guarantee that different anatomical bone structures with diverse bone qualities had to undergo osteotomy.</p><p>The spectrum of maxillofacial procedures has broadened significantly during the last centuries and the interventions have become more and more complex and invasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This is why it became and still is more important to develop operating techniques that are more precise and gentle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Piezoelectric surgery could represent one of those techniques. The results of many piezoelectric osteotomies according to Vercelotti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], Borman <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], Robiony <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and many more encourage the author to apply the piezoelectric osteotomy device for even more indications. It is histologically provable that in the long run wound healing is better with this procedure than after surgery with an oscillating saw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Piezosurgery is not a method for fast surgeries, but it is suitable for sensitive and non-traumatic operation procedures.</p><p>Neither the laboratory values nor the duration of inpatient stay differed significantly between the two groups. Looking at the height of the blood level in the paranasal sinus piezosurgery showed a statistically significant difference. In conclusion, the question that was posed at the beginning of this paper can be given a positive answer. It is possible to conduct a surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion with the help of an ultrasonic-saw, piezosurgery, which preserves the mucous membrane of the maxilla and is at least as effective and good as the conventional method. The high performance in terms of frequency and power of the piezosurgical device allow it to be used without the aid of any other osteotome, and with the same atraumatic effect on critical vascular structures. The very low amount of bleeding observed during surgery, lack of damage to the main vessels and reduction of postoperative consequences (hematomas, swelling) for patients were striking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is possible to do a surgically assisted palatal expansion of the maxilla by using an ultrasonic bone-cutting device and thus protect the mucous membranes of the maxilla.
