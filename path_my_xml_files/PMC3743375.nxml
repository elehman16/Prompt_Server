A total of 958 adult patients with T2DM on OADs, with uncontrolled fasting (FBG) or postprandial blood glucose (PPG), were enrolled. Pioglitazone (7.5/15/30 mg) was added to existing therapy as a combination treatment with other OAD. Body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), FBG and postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at the beginning (week 0) and at every follow-up treatment visit, i.e., 6 months (week 24), 1 year (week 48) and 2 years (week 96). Changes from baseline to each visit were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. All patients also went through a urinalysis at baseline, and after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years of treatment, to assess for any abnormalities in the urine (pH, pus or protein), suggestive of bladder abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The combined analysis was carried out on 958 completed patients in this study who were treated with pioglitazone 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablet and other OADs. The difference in mean value of FBG showed a highly significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) from baseline to end of treatment, i.e., from 167.0, (59.16) 172.6 (58.51) and 171.0 (39.47) to 140.2, (26.46) 143.8 (22.04) and 138.5 (27.82) mg/dL. Similarly, PPG showed a significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, 0.002 and 0.008) decrease from baseline to end of the treatment, i.e., from 256.0, (61.79) 222.9 (67.88) and 223.6 (69.11) to 195.9, (46.92) 204.0 (48.03) and 187.6 (53.36) mg/dL, and there was a highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) decrease in HbA1c levels, i.e., from 8.46, 8.34 and 8.42% to 7.781, 7.78 and 7.73%, respectively. However, gain in mean BW was also observed from baseline to end of the treatment, i.e., from 69.90, (9.44) 68.29 (8.62) and 67.64 (7.75) kg to 71.69, (8.35) 70.08 (7.96) and 69.70 (7.99) kg, respectively, and BMI increased from 26.74 (14.18-53.04) kg/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline to 27.45 (12.87-53.73) kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the end of the treatment, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). No significant changes were found in urine in patients even after 2 years of treatment with pioglitazone. There was little variation in pH or presence of pus and proteins in the urine, indicating no increased risk of bladder-related abnormalities across all treated age groups even after 2 years of treatment with pioglitazone.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Pioglitazone in combination with other OADs in Indian patients was an effective treatment protocol in glycemic control, reduction in FBG, PPPG and HbA1c and also helps in controlling weight gain in patients with T2DM. In this patient population, there was no increased risk of bladder-related abnormalities. Pioglitazone was therefore found to be a safe and efficacious addition to treatment in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pioglitazone</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>oral antidiabetics</kwd><kwd>Indian patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have poorly controlled disease, even with intensive therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] New agents with the capability of improving glycemic control when used in addition to, or instead of, existing drugs would be useful, particularly if they also have beneficial effects in lowering the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.</p><p>The thiazolidinediones are a recently developed class of oral glucose-lowering drugs used in the treatment of T2DM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] They are thought to work through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma thus reducing insulin resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The US food and drug administration (FDA) has approved 2 thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone; a third, troglitazone, was withdrawn because of reports of severe and unpredictable hepatotoxicity.

With pioglitazone monotherapy, HbAlc decreased by up to 2.6% compared with placebo in a dose-response fashion. The effect was sustained for up to 26 weeks. With pioglitazone combination therapy, HbAlc decreased up to 1.58% compared with placebo, again in a dose-response fashion. In light of evidence from PNFP-014,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] that the combination of pioglitazone with insulin is effective in reducing hyperglycemia, the reasons for the differences in the US and European indications for the drug are unclear. Triglyceride levels decreased ~30-70 mg/dL with pioglitazone combination therapy and High-density lipoprotein - Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels increased by ~4-5 mg/dL. The evidence of an effect on triglyceride levels was less consistent for pioglitazone monotherapy.</p><p>An increase in BW was associated with pioglitazone treatment in all studies. Although this increase was greater in the US studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] than in the Japanese studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] given the differences in baseline weights, the proportional increase was not dissimilar. A review of the safety and tolerability of pioglitazone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] includes a figure combining data from the studies of monotherapy and combination therapy and showing weight changes up to 60 weeks (European and Japanese studies) and 96 weeks (US studies). Weight continued to increase for as long as data were recorded (60 weeks) in the European and Japanese studies and up to 84 weeks in the US studies. Whether the weight gain associated with pioglitazone therapy reaches a plateau cannot be determined without studies of a longer duration.</p><p>However, despite a consistent and significant increase in BW and total body fat mass, glycemic control and both hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin improved after pioglitazone treatment. Earlier studies have shown that pioglitazone was able to improve insulin sensitivity through a reduction in muscle lipid along with its redistribution into subcutaneous adipose tissue. Indeed, treatment with pioglitazone not only results in improvement in glucose homeostasis but simultaneously also alters fat metabolism and/or fat topography. Indeed, studies show that pioglitazone induces decrease in visceral fat, a shift of fat distribution from visceral to subcutaneous adipose depots consequently leading to improvements in both hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>There are no randomized, controlled trials in the literature that directly compare pioglitazone with any other antidiabetic agent (including other thiazolidinediones). Results of a non-randomized study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] suggest that rosiglitazone and pioglitazone may have a similar effect on blood glucose levels, and that pioglitazone may have a greater beneficial effect on lipid levels while leading to greater weight gain.</p><p>In the US monotherapy studies reported on the FDA Web site,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] patients who had been taking another antidiabetic drug had poorer glycemic control after the switch to pioglitazone. Although this suggests that pioglitazone may be less-effective than the other drugs, this finding may have been the result of follow-up periods being too short for HbAlc values to fully reflect decreases in blood glucose levels.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective, observational study on the efficacy and safety of pioglitazone in Indian patients. In this study, the efficacy of different strengths of pioglitazone combination on top of other antidiabetic drugs (s) has been shown, as both fasting and postprandial glucose better controlled after addition of pioglitazone. The significant improvement of glycemic parameters had been observed since every treatment visits.</p><p>Regarding safety evaluation, the results of the study showed increases in BW and BMI. Although the increase of BW and BMI were indeed very small compared with those found by another study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] they were, however, statistically significant.</p><p>Apart from BW and BMI, we also would be like to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on age-wise reduction in HbA1c [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 4</xref>]. Age range of 18-30 years was statistical non-significant, but clinical reduction in HbA1c was significant. Similarly, age range of 30-60 years and age &#x0003e;60 years was statically significant when adding pioglitazone with current ODAs therapy.</p><p>Urinalysis of all patients on piogliotazone in the study revealed that there was no significant change in urine pH, proteinuria or pyuria and hematuria from baseline up to 2 years of treatment with pioglitazone across all dosages studied, and across all age groups, indicating the absence of any bladder-related abnormalities such as bladder cancer in the treated patients. This is significant in light of the current controversy related to increased risk of bladder cancer in patients on pioglitazone. Our results are similar to those recently reported by Li <italic>et al</italic>., suggesting that pioglitazone may not be significantly associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our present study has some limitations, including a low patients numbers, the lack of control group, a relatively short period of observation (2 years) and lack of other safety parameters such as urine analysis.
