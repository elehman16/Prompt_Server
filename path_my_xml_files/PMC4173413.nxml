Postoperative pain remains the major problem following tonsillectomy, if not treated. Different methods and many drugs have been used to control the postoperative pain. In this study, we evaluate the role of gabapentin premedication vs paracetamol in management of postoperative pain following adenotonsillectomy in children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a double blind randomized study, 70 children were subjected for adenotonsillectomy classified into two equal groups. Group I: Gabapentin 10 mg/kg was given orally 2 hours before induction of anesthesia (Gabapentin syrup 250 mg/5 ml); Group II: Oral paracetamol 20 mg/kg was given orally 2 hours before induction of anesthesia. All children underwent general anesthesia. Pain score was assisted postoperatively 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 18 hours after recovery using visual analogue scale (VAS).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Pain score in gabapentin group was significantly less in 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours postoperatively than in paracetamol group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0003, &#x0003c;0.0001, 0.0004, &#x0003c;0.0001, respectively).

Gabapentin was introduced in 1993 and had been used in the treatment of children's seizures and chronic pain syndromes.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Gabapentin has been used in management of acute conditions in the perioperative period. Gabapentin has role in postoperative analgesia, preoperative anxiolysis, prevention of chronic postoperative neuropathic pain, attenuation of hemodynamic changes during intubation, and prevention of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and delirium.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This clinical study compares effect of gabapentin premedication with paracetamol premedication on postoperative pain following adenotonsillectomy in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was carried out on 70 children ASA I and II who underwent adenotonsillectomy after obtaining approval from the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents of each child.</p><p>Age group was between 4 and 6 years. Exclusion criteria included diabetes, liver and/or kidney disease, hypersensitivity to drugs used, peritonsillar abscess, swallowing disorder, epilepsy or previous treatment with gabapentin or opioids analgesia. Tonsillectomy dissection was done using the bipolar diathermy and was performed in all patients by the four surgeons with the same experience and qualifications. Patients were randomly allocated equally (35 patients) in each group as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>The randomization was performed using sealed numbered envelopes indicating the group of each patient. A blind nurse who did not participate in patients&#x02019; follow up read the number and made group assignments.</p><p>A blinded chief nurse who did not participate in data collection confirmed that each patient ingested the medications as was scheduled. The process of inclusion in the study went on until the required number of patients was reached.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthesia technique</title><p>General anesthesia was induced by sevoflurane (7 vol.%,). After the patients&#x02032; loss of consciousness, intravenous line was inserted. Central orotracheal intubation was performed with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl and rocronium 0.6 mg/Kg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2 to 3 vol.% in N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> (70:30 vol.%) and ventilation was controlled to maintain normocapnia. Standard patient monitoring (electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>) were used during anesthesia.</p><p>After the surgeon had completed the operation, residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with atropine 0.01 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg. Oropharyngeal suction was done under direct vision, all patients were extubated in tonsillectomy position with or without nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway in place to prevent airway obstruction, and were transported to the post-anesthesia recovery room.</p><p>Metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg was administered for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). If PONV still persisted, ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg was administered.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>The pain intensity was assisted by a person who was blind to study by using visual analogue scale graded from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = the worst possible pain) in the following time in the post-anesthesia recovery room 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 18 hours after recovery.</p><p>During the preoperative visit, all children were shown the visual analogue toy containing different animal figures increasing in size from bird (0, bottom = no pain) to elephant (10, top = worst pain), in ten steps.</p><p>Postoperative analgesia was given in all patients depending on VAS score.</p><p>If the VAS value was less than 5 rectal, paracetamol 20 mg/kg was given; if VAS value was more than 5, pethedine 0.5 mg/kg was given intra-muscular and recorded. The time to first dose of analgesia and total amount of pethedine used was recorded in all patients.</p><p>Patients will be discharged postoperative when they had no or mild pain (VAS around 3), were able to tolerate clear fluids and soft food, and had no bleeding or nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Primary outcome measure of this study was the total postoperative pethedine consumption (from the time of extubation). Secondary outcome measures were pain scores, presence of nausea/vomiting, and sedation.</p><p>Sample size was chosen based on the previous study in our institute, which had determined that 35 patients in each group were enough for detection of significant changes in analgesic requirements.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD.

It is thought to bind to the alpha 2_ delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel in the central nervous system. This reduces calcium influx into the nerve terminals and decreases the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>These findings are consistent with that of Jeon <italic>et al</italic>. who concluded that premedication with gabapentin decreased post-tonsillectomy pain during swallowing in adult patients.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>A number of reports from many groups have revealed that preemptive gabapentin may play a considerable role in controlling postoperative pain. However, many of these studies used it preoperatively and postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The present study showed that the total pethedine requirements were less in gabapentin group. This is concordant with the findings of other studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Mikkelsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that gabapentin reduced opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after tonsillectomy. However, the benefits of reduced opioid intake were overwhelmed by side effects of large doses of gabapentin used. They were unable to demonstrate any reduction in postoperative pain scores and postulated the lack of effect of gabapentin in post-tonsillectomy pain.</p><p>On the other hand, gabapentin is expensive and may increase the incidence of postoperative dizziness which may limit its use in day case surgery. However, incidence of nausea, vomiting, and sedation was comparable in both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Gabapentin 10 mg/kg administrated orally
