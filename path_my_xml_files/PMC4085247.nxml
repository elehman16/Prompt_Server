Two yttria-stabilized zirconias; Cercon Base (Cercon, Degudent, Hanau, Germany) and Lava Plus (Lava, 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) and one ceria-stabilized zirconia; NanoZR (Panasonic Electric Works, Osaka, Japan) were used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Manufacturers provided 30 disc-shaped specimens from each material. The specimens were 1.2 mm in thickness and 15 mm in diameter. The dimensions were selected according to ISO 6872<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and were verified using an electronic digital micrometer (Powertechtools, Zhejiang, China).</p><p>Three experimental groups (n = 10) were created from each kind of material. Control specimens were in Group 1 and were abbreviated as CC for Cercon Base, LC for Lava Plus, and NC for NanoZR. Thermocycled specimens were in Group 2 and were abbreviated as CT, LT, and NT, for Cercon Base, Lava Plus, and NanoZR, respectively. Thermocycling was subjected in distilled water at 5 and 55&#x02103; for 10000 cycles in a thermocycling machine (N&#x000fc;ve, Ankara, Turkey). During a cycle, specimens were stored for 30 seconds in each bath.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The mechanical loading group was Group 3. For mechanical loading, the specimens were positioned on the supporting balls which were described in ISO 6872.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Specimens in Group 3 were abbreviated as CM, LM, and NM for Cercon Base, Lava Plus, and NanoZR, respectively. The mechanical loading was subjected with 200 N loads and a frequency of 2 Hz for 100000 times with a mechanical cycler (Instron 8801, Instron, Canton, MA) at the room conditions (22 &#x000b1; 1&#x02103;, and 60 &#x000b1; 5% relative humidity).<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The test was carried out after thermocycling and mechanical loading with a tension-compression test machine (Middle East Technical University, Department of Metallurgy, Ankara, Turkey). The speed of the machine was 0.15 mm/min. The specimens were tested with a technique of piston on three balls, which was identified in the standard of ISO 6872.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Three hardened steel balls (Turkish Aerospace Industries Inc., Ankara, Turkey), 3.2 mm in diameter, were placed at an angle of 120 degrees relative to each other to support the specimens. Each specimen was located on these supports of the testing machine and the centers of the specimens were loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The load was applied with a flat punch (1.4 mm in diameter) until a fracture occurred. The biaxial flexural strengths of the specimens were calculated with the following formula:<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p><disp-formula>S = -0.2387 P (X - Y) / d<sup>2</sup>,</disp-formula></p><p>where S is the flexural strength at fracture (MPa); P is the total load causing fracture (N),</p><p><disp-formula>X = (1 + &#x003bd;)ln(r2 / r3)<sup>2</sup> + [(1 - &#x003bd;) / 2](r2 / r3)<sup>2</sup>,</disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula>Y = (1 + &#x003bd;)[1 + ln(r1 / r3)<sup>2</sup>] + (1 - &#x003bd;)(r1 / r3)<sup>2</sup>,</disp-formula></p><p>and &#x003bd; is Poisson's ratio (if the value for the ceramic being studied is not known, Poisson's ratio of 0.25 is used); r1 is the radius of the support circle, r2 is the radius of the loaded area (mm), r3 is the radius of the specimen (mm), and d is the specimen thickness at the origin of fracture (mm). For this study, &#x003bd; = 0.25, r1 = 5 mm, r2 = 0.7 mm, and r3 = 7.5 mm were used. The Weibull modulus, characteristic strength, 10%, 5% and 1% probabilities of failure were calculated using the biaxial flexural strength data.</p><p>Phase transformation was determined by XRD patterns of the control, thermocycling and mechanical loading specimens before the biaxial flexural strength test. The XRD patterns were recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX 2200PC, Rigaku-Geirflex X-ray Difraktometer, Tokyo, Japan) by using Cu-K &#x003b1;-radiation. Specimens were scanned at 40 kV, 40 mA, 0.018/step interval from 20-40, and 2&#x003b8; degrees. The relative amount of the monoclinic phase (X<sub>m</sub>) was calculated with the following formula described by Garvie and Nicholoson<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> for detecting the phase composition of zirconia: <disp-formula>X<sub>m</sub> = (I<sub>m1</sub> + I<sub>m2</sub>) / (I<sub>m1</sub> + I<sub>m2</sub> + I<sub>t</sub>),</disp-formula></p><p>where I is the intensity detected by the detector, t is the tetragonal peak, and m1 and m2 are the two major monoclinic peaks. The monoclinic phase content was determined by calculating the areas under the t, m1, and m2 peaks with MATLAB (MATLAB 2010 A, Mattworks, Natick, MA, USA).</p><p>Control, thermocycled, and mechanically loaded specimens were examined by a Raman spectrometer (Senterra; Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) before the strength test. The Raman laser was focused on center of the specimen (p1), the center of the radius of the specimen (p2), and the edge of the radius of the specimen (p3)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) at a wavelength of 520 nm and 20 mW power, 3 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution, and 16 spectral integration times. The Raman intensity monoclinic ratio (X<sub>m</sub>) was calculated with the following formula: <disp-formula>X<sub>m</sub>= I<sub>m</sub> (180 cm<sup>-1</sup>) + I<sub>m</sub> (190 cm<sup>-1</sup>) / I<sub>m</sub> (180 cm<sup>-1</sup>) + I<sub>m</sub> (190 cm<sup>-1</sup>) + I<sub>t</sub> (147 cm<sup>-1</sup>)</disp-formula></p><p>where I corresponds the net peak intensities at the Raman shifts. By using the formula of Kim et al.,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the monoclinic fraction (&#x00192;m) was calculated: <disp-formula>&#x00192;m = (0.19 - 0.13 / (X<sub>m</sub> - 1.01))<sup>1/2</sup> - 0.56.</disp-formula></p><p>The flexural strength data were analyzed by using the two-parameter cumulative Weibull distribution, which is often used for ceramic materials because of their asymmetrical distribution. The Weibull moduli were calculated with the formula:<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p><disp-formula>P(&#x001a1;) = 1 - exp [-(&#x001a1; / &#x001a1;<sub>0</sub>)<sup>m</sup>],</disp-formula></p><p>where P is the fracture probability, &#x001a1; is the fracture strength, &#x001a1;<sub>0</sub> is the characteristic strength at the fracture probability of 63.2%, and m is the Weibull modulus. In addition, the 10%, 5%, and 1% probabilities of failure were calculated. All results were evaluated according to the 0.001 significance level. The relative amount of monoclinic phase was analyzed by two-factor factorial ANOVA (analysis of variance). Significant differences with a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.01 (SPSS 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was determined with Duncan's multiple range test. The results of the monoclinic fraction were analyzed by three-factor ANOVA with repeated measures on each factor. Significant differences with a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 (SPSS 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) were determined with Duncan's multiple range test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The Weibull statistical analyses, the characteristic strength, and the 10%, 5%, and 1% probabilities of failure are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.

The CC and LC groups consisted of tetragonal zirconia but the monoclinic contents of the specimens increased after mechanical loading. In the present study, the difference in the monoclinic phase contents of the materials was not statistically significant after thermocycling and mechanical loading. The monoclinic content was not detected in the LC and LT groups. However, the monoclinic phase content of the LM group was significantly higher than that of the LC and LT groups. The difference in the amount of monoclinic phase between the two Y-TZP core ceramics may be a result of the difference in the intrinsic structure or sintering schedule.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The amount of the monoclinic phase of NanoZR ranged from 5.917 &#x000b1; 0.34% to 5.969 &#x000b1; 0.39%. A similar monoclinic content, ranging from 4.8 to 5.5%, was reported by Ban et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Perdig&#x000e3;o et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> evaluated the effect of hydrothermal fatigue on ZrO<sub>2</sub>-based (Lava, IPS and NanoZR) materials. The specimens were stored in water, autoclaved or thermocycled in artificial saliva for 30000 thermal cycles. The observed values in the present study were lower than the values presented by Perdig&#x000e3;o et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although both studies used the same thermocycling conditions, the difference may originate from the higher number of cycles used in the study of Perdig&#x000e3;o et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The monoclinic phase contents of the zirconia-based materials can be detected with Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is able to detect very small regions on a specimen surface without preparation<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and can be useful for defining the amount of monoclinic phase.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Sato et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> evaluated the mechanical properties of Ce-TZP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Y-TZP after sandblasting and heat treatment and detected the phase changes with Raman spectroscopy. Raman analyses showed that the transformation zone depth was approximately less than 10 &#x000b5;m and that the biaxial flexural strength increased after sandblasting but decreased after heat treatment.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the present study, the transformation zone depths were not detected by Raman spectroscopy but the Raman spectra were taken from three different points on the surface of the specimens. In the present study, according to XRD results, the monoclinic phase contents of the materials were not affected by the experiments. However, it was detected that the phase fraction of the materials was significantly affected by thermocycling and mechanical loading when the Raman spectra were obtained from different points on the surface of the specimens (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05). Furthermore, it was observed that the results were significantly lower in mechanical loading groups at the same point and the same material (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05). During mechanical loading, the core materials are subjected to highly localized stresses. Behrens et al.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> stated that applied loads triggered phase transformation and that compressive stresses were higher in the indentation center. The monoclinic phase fractions were found lower at the center of the indent when compared to edge of the indent.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, specimens were subjected to 100000 mechanical cycles under 200 N and the lower monoclinic phase fraction may be a result of the concentrated compressive stresses on the specimens during mechanical loading.</p><p>Y-TZP is a frequently used core material in fixed partial prosthesis. Ce-TZP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a novel material with a high mechanical strength and resistance to fatigue. The results of the study showed that both materials have reliability and can be used clinically. However, further experiments related to the effect of the firing processes, surface treatments on the porcelain connection values of bilayered specimens, and clinical applications are needed to evaluate the long-term behavior of this new material.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the X-ray diffraction results showed that thermocycling and mechanical loading did not have a significant effect on the phase transformation of the tested materials. However, Raman spectroscopy results showed that monoclinic phase fraction of the mechanically loaded specimens were lower at the point p1 where the load was applied. Furthermore, it was concluded that the characteristic strengths of all the tested materials were not affected negatively by thermocycling and mechanical loading and all the tested materials have reliability in clinical use.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by the grant no. 03/2011-08 from Scientific Research Project of the Rectorship of Gazi University, Republic of Turkey.
