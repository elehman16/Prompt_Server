It has a strong familial tendency, there is no approved treatment for early stage disease, and patients with established digital contractures are most commonly treated by surgery. This is associated with prolonged recovery, and less invasive techniques have high recurrence rates. The myofibroblasts, the cells responsible for the excessive matrix deposition and contraction, are aggregated in nodules. Using excised diseased and control human tissue, we found that immune cells interspersed amongst the myofibroblasts secrete cytokines. Of these, only tumour necrosis factor (TNF) promoted the development of myofibroblasts. The clinically approved anti-TNF agents led to inhibition of the myofibroblast phenotype
<italic>in vitro</italic>. This clinical trial is designed to assess the efficacy of the anti-TNF agent adalimumab on participants with early disease. The first part is a dose-ranging study where nodules of participants already scheduled for surgery will be injected with either placebo (saline) or varying doses of adalimumab. The excised tissue will then be analysed for markers of myofibroblast activity. The second part of the study will recruit participants with early stage disease. They will be randomised 1: 1 to receive either adalimumab or placebo at 3 month intervals over 1 year and will then be followed for a further 6 months. Outcome measures will include nodule hardness, size and disease progression. The trial will also determine the cost-effectiveness of adalimumb treatment for this group of participants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Dupuytren&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>anti-TNF</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>adalimumab</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>102538</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The RIDD Trial is funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund (HICF), a parallel funding partnership between the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health UK.

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Between 35&#x02013;50% of patients with early DD manifest as nodules on the palmar aspect of the hand go on to develop finger contractures
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The nodules are typically quiescent for a period and then become active, progressing to flexion deformities over a period of months
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The mainstay of treatment remains surgical excision (fasciectomy) of the diseased tissue or cords
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and recent US data show that ~60% of treated patients undergo surgery
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, with the remainder equally split between collagenase and needle fasciotomy. Generally, patients are offered these treatments once digits are flexed to 30 degrees or more and hand function is impaired
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The recurrence rate in patients treated with surgery is 21% within 5 years
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and these individuals may require more extensive surgery involving excision of the diseased tissue and overlying skin (dermofasciectomy). Post-operatively, patients require up to 6 months of hand therapy and splintage
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Complications occur in approximately 20% of patients undergoing surgery for DD
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Alternative, less invasive techniques to disrupt the cords of diseased tissue with either a needle
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or collagenase digestion
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> are associated with rapid recovery of hand function with minimal therapy
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, recurrence rates are high, at 5 years affecting 85% of patients treated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and 47% of those treated with collagenase
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The complication rate is 20% following needle aponeurotomy
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and over 70%, where the majority are relatively minor and transient, mainly comprising swelling, bruising and pain after collagenase injection
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of early DD. An uncontrolled and unblinded retrospective review of intralesional steroid injection at 6 week intervals in 63 patients with early DD reported that following a mean of 3.2 injections, there was subjective improvement of 60&#x02013;80% in 97% of patients and disease reactivation occurred in 50% of patients 1 to 3 years after the last injection
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Given the paucity and quality of data, this treatment modality has found limited acceptance. Similarly, studies reporting the efficacy of radiotherapy are limited by a lack of quality, with no blinding or randomisation and the use of subjective outcome measures. A recent systematic review of studies reporting outcomes in patients with early disease treated with radiotherapy
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> found that in four studies participant numbers were small (10 or fewer)
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Of the remaining 6 studies, 2 reported improvement
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, 3 described equivocal results
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and one showed no change
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. One study noted that results following radiotherapy did not differ from the natural history of early DD
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Approximately 20&#x02013;30% of patients receiving radiotherapy in the studies included in the systematic review developed long term adverse effects, including dry skin, desquamation, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, erythema, and altered heat and pain sensation
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Based on the published data, NICE recommends that radiotherapy should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or in a research setting
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective therapy to retard progression of early DD and also prevent the development of recurrent disease following surgery, needle fasciotomy or collagenase injection in patients with established finger contractures.</p><p>Our laboratory studies based on tissues from patients with DD normally discarded at the time of surgery revealed the presence of innate immune cells, including macrophages, clustered in nodules
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Freshly disaggregated cells from the nodules secreted a range of cytokines. The effects of these cytokines on contraction and profibrotic signaling pathways were assessed in fibroblasts from the palmar and non-palmar dermis of Dupuytren&#x02019;s patients, and palmar fibroblasts from individuals without Dupuytren&#x02019;s disease. Exogenous addition of TNF, but not other cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;, promoted differentiation only of palmar dermal fibroblasts from patients with Dupuytren&#x02019;s disease into myofibroblasts via the Wnt signaling pathway. Neutralizing antibodies to TNF inhibited the contractile activity of myofibroblasts derived from Dupuytren&#x02019;s patients, reduced their expression of &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin, and mediated disassembly of the contractile apparatus. Of the anti-TNF agents approved for clinical use via subcutaneous administration, adalimumab and golimumab were found to be the most efficacious in downregulating the myofibroblast phenotype
<italic>in vitro</italic> at the doses tested
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>Based on these laboratory data, we are proceeding with a phase II clinical trial using adalimumab to assess the efficacy of intranodular injection for participants with early DD. Adalimumab is used to treat other conditions such as inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and has a well described safety profile. We conducted an end user survey of 46 patients, 24 with early DD and 22 who had previously undergone surgery. Thirty-three patients (71.7%) responded 62.5% (n=15) and 82% (n=18) respectively from each group. Our survey (

<bold>Sample size:</bold> For the early DD RCT, the sample size required is 138 participants based on detecting a standardised effect size of 0.62, at 5% significance (2-sided) and 90% power, allowing for a 20% loss to follow up. The target effect size was determined based on a 5 point change in nodule hardness at 12 months and assuming a standard deviation of 8. These estimates were based on data from a case-control pilot study
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. A pilot study of tonometry data from 25 patients with early DD demonstrated that the palmar tissues of patients with untreated early DD were significantly firmer (53&#x000b1;8) than the corresponding areas of 12 age and sex matched controls (32&#x000b1;3) when measured with a portable Rex Gauge durometer.</p><p>
<bold>Recruitment:</bold> Participants will be recruited primarily from outpatient clinics, as well as advertisements in general practices local to trial sites and through relevant websites. Potential participants will be given/sent the PIL which contains a telephone number and an e-mail address to request further information or to make an appointment for consent and screening to participate in the study.</p><p>Potential participants will be contacted within 4 weeks of initial contact/expression of interest to arrange telephone screening or an invitation for further screening at clinic.</p><p>
<bold>Randomisation:</bold> 1:1 adalimumab: placebo, computer generated stratified by age (18&#x02013;49 or &#x02265;50 years) and centre using RRAMP. RRAMP is used to randomise participants and this will generate a Trial ID and prompt an email to Pharmacy which informs them of which investigational medicinal product (IMP) (drug or placebo) to dispense. RRAMP also stores the treatment allocation enabling emergency unblinding if necessary.</p><p>
<bold>Blinding:</bold> Participants and healthcare professionals involved in follow-up will be blinded.

Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be used as placebo. The safety profile of adalimumab is well known, with the most common adverse reactions being mild injection site reactions
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>Where possible, the adalimumab will be supplied in a single use glass vial. However, a pre-filled syringe may be the only option if using the 40 mg in 0.4 ml formulation.</p><p>
<bold>Procedure for single use glass vials:</bold> Participants, treating physicians and healthcare professionals involved with administering the IMP or administering any trial procedure from the injection onwards will be blinded to treatment.</p><p>The IMP (which will be stored in pharmacy) will be dispensed with accountability to a member of the research team who will take the IMP to a clinic room separate from the participant. In this separate room, a non-blinded member of the research team, who is not involved in administering the IMP or assessing the participant, will prepare and draw up the adalimumab or normal saline in a syringe according to the randomisation, and label the syringes with the participant&#x02019;s ID. The label will not reveal the identity of the IMP. Both the IMP and placebo have a similar viscosity and appearance so that the two treatments, adalimumab or saline, will be indistinguishable. The syringe, without any identifying packaging, will be taken to the trial healthcare professional (blinded to treatment allocation) to inject the participant. Once adalimumab has been drawn up, it tends to lose potency and this precludes preparation of the syringes before the participant presents for treatment. There is no stipulated time limit. For this trial, no more than 1 hour will elapse before the injection is given.</p><p>
<bold>Procedure for pre-filled syringes:</bold> Due to the distinctive appearance of the syringe, it is unlikely to be possible to blind the healthcare professional administering the injection to treatment allocation. Although this adds extra complication to the IMP administration, the benefits of using the new formulation make the efforts to maintain blinding worthwhile. The lower volume of the 40mgs in 0.4ml pre-filled syringe and removal of the excipient containing citrate should result in reduced pain and improved participant acceptability
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. To protect the quality of the data, any person injecting with a pre-filled syringe will NOT be involved in administering any further trial procedures.</p><p>Any healthcare professionals involved with administering any trial procedure, including outcome assessments, after the injection of IMP will be blinded to treatment.</p><p>Participants will be blinded to treatment, using a physical screen.</p><p>The IMP (which will be stored in pharmacy) will be dispensed with accountability to a member of the research team who will take the IMP to a clinic room separate from the participant. A non-blinded member of the research team will prepare the saline injection for the placebo treatment allocation. All syringes (adalimumab or saline) will be labelled with the participant&#x02019;s ID. Care will be taken to ensure any healthcare professionals blinded to treatment allocation are not present for the injection, and the syringe will be hidden from the participant&#x02019;s view. A pre-filled syringe of adalimumab can be stored at up to 25&#x000b0;C for up to 14 days, therefore the one hour time limit described for glass vials is not applicable with pre-filled syringes.</p><p>
<bold>Tissue response RCT:</bold> Consented participants will enter the trial and receive the injection two weeks prior to the scheduled surgery date. Intra-nodular injections will be delivered into the most prominent nodule due to be excised by surgery. If participants do not proceed to surgery at 12&#x02013;18 days following injection, the reason will be recorded and they will continue with normal care. These participants may be replaced if still during the recruitment phase of the tissue response RCT. Participants may withdraw from the study and continue normal NHS care. If possible, data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be retained, and if the participant has received the injection then a safety review of the participant medical notes will be undertaken at 3 months from randomisation.</p><p>
<bold>Early DD RCT:</bold> Consented participants will be screened and if eligible, after consent is reaffirmed, they will be randomised (1:1) to receive injections of adalimumab (40mg in 0.4ml carrier) or saline (placebo 0.4ml) into the active nodule. The participants will receive further injections on a maximum of 4 occasions: baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months with further follow-up at 12 and 18 months with no injections. Injections will not be administered if the treated nodule decreases in size such that there is insufficient nodule tissue to inject. In this case, the participant will be encouraged to continue for all intervention visits and injections may be reintroduced if the nodule recurs. Injections will be discontinued if the participant withdraws from the trial or if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including pregnancy, adverse events, significant protocol deviation or non-compliance with study procedures. Compliance will be defined as attending not less than 75% of injection visits, i.e. 3 visits.</p><p>Participants may withdraw from the study and continue normal NHS care. If possible, data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be retained, and if the participant has received an injection then a safety review of the participant medical notes will be undertaken for up to 18 months from randomisation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial outcome measures</title><p>
<bold>Tissue analysis (Tissue response RCT only):</bold> The injected nodule and surrounding diseased tissue will be removed during scheduled surgery approximately two weeks after treatment. The excised nodule tissue will be transported as per instructions specified in the trial Sample Handling Manual to the Kennedy Institute laboratories in Oxford, where tissue analyses will be undertaken. A scientist not involved with the clinical assessment and blinded to treatment allocation will dissect the nodule and extract the mRNA and protein. rt-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) will be carried out as previously described
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Protein levels will be measured using electrochemiluminescence (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Maryland, USA) or Western blotting (Verjee et al., 2013).</p><p>Tissue samples and derivatives will be stored in the Kennedy Institute laboratory at the Botnar Research Centre in secure -80&#x000b0;C storage. The laboratory has undergone a self-assessment for good clinical practice in line with the UKCRC &#x02018;Self-Assessment Questionnaire for assessing regulatory compliance in laboratories that perform the storage and analysis or evaluation of research samples&#x02019;

<bold>Nodule hardness (tonometry):</bold> Will be measured by a portable Rex Gauge durometer RX-1800-00 (Rex Gauge Company Inc. Illinois, U.S.A.). Tissue hardness will be measured with a tonometer, ensuring that the gauge is balanced perpendicular to the skin without application of external pressure by the observer. Five readings will be obtained on each occasion. A photograph obtained at base line marking the spot to be measured will be used for all subsequent measurement to ensure consistency of placement of the tonometer. Tonometry has been used to evaluate skin compliance before and after surgery

<bold>Range of motion of the affected digit:</bold> Individual range of movement of each joint in the affected digit will be measured using a goniometer.</p><p>
<bold>Clinical assessment of the hand:</bold> Will assess any changes in the injected nodule and adjacent cord.</p><p>
<bold>Nodule size and vascularity:</bold> Nodule size and vascularity will be assessed by an ultrasound scan with the ultrasound probe placed centrally over the nodule. The ultrasound will produce a quantitative result using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant reported outcome measures</title><p>
<bold>Injection experience questionnaire:</bold> Participants will report on the experience of each research injection using an injection questionnaire which incorporates a numeric rating scale.</p><p>
<bold>Participant identified activity most restricted by DD scored on a scale of 1&#x02013;10 (Early DD RCT only):</bold> Participants will be asked to identify at baseline the activity most restricted by their DD on a scale of 1&#x02013;10. This activity will be reassessed at all follow-up timepoints.</p><p>
<bold>Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) (early DD RCT only):</bold> The MHQ
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> is a hand-specific validated outcome measure that, unlike some other instruments, allows the user to separately score each hand. It takes approximately 15 minutes to complete and comprises six distinct scales that assess overall hand function, activities of daily living, pain, work performance, aesthetics, and satisfaction with hand function. The MHQ score ranges from 0&#x02013;100, with higher scores indicating better hand performance and a higher pain score indicating more pain. The MHQ is a validated outcomes measure that has been shown to be sensitive to change when used to assess improvement in hand function following surgery for established DD
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and was selected following a systematic review of outcome measures for DD

<bold>Health utilities using EQ-5D-5L:</bold> The EQ-5D-5L is a validated, generalised, health related quality of life questionnaire recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as the accepted measure for conducting a cost-utility analysis. The EQ-5D-5L has been used to calculate health state utilities
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> in individuals with more advanced DD. The EQ-5D instrument facilitates the generation of a utility score from a person&#x02019;s health related quality of life
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. A utility score refers to the preference that individuals have for any particular set of health outcomes. The EQ-5D consists of five health state dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). There are three levels of health status: no problems, some problems, major problems. Each participant will value their present health at the date of questionnaire completion. Participants will also complete a Visual Analogue Scale which will provide us with a value for the participant&#x02019;s self-rated health at the time of survey completion.</p><p>Permission has been granted for the use of the MHQ and EQ-5D-5L from the relevant agencies.</p><p>
<bold>Resource use questionnaire (early DD RCT only):</bold> Participant self-reported information on service use will be collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months post randomisation to capture the intensity of use of different healthcare services, including primary, community and social care. Unit cost data will be obtained from national databases such as the BNF and PSSRU Costs of Health and Social Care
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Where these are not available the unit cost will be estimated in consultation with the lead hospital finance department. In the latter process a blanket cost will be applied to the items used to carry out the intervention, using a base case provided by the Oxford University Hospital NHS Trust. No additional consent is required for the acquisition of these data. Participants will also have the opportunity to detail their out of pocket expenditure related to their treatment, as well as their ability to return to paid work after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety monitoring</title><p>All adverse events (AEs) graded 3 and above according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0
<sup><xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> occurring during the trial and up to 12 weeks after surgery (Tissue response RCT) or until the end of participation (Early DD RCT) that are observed by the Investigator or reported by the participant will be recorded on the case report form (CRF), whether or not they may be attributed to trial medication. AEs considered related to the trial medication as judged by a medically qualified investigator will be followed either until resolution, or until the event is considered stable. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the trial specific SAE form and reported within 24 hours of the Site Study Team becoming aware of the event. Causality will be assessed by a medically qualified doctor. The Trial Co-ordinating Centre will be responsible for assessing causality and expectedness. Any SAEs deemed to be suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the sponsor, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and ethics committee within required timelines.</p><p>
<bold>Injection site assessment:</bold> The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab is injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling). Adverse event assessment will involve visual inspection of injection site, surgery site and laboratory reports. The injection site will be monitored for adverse events using the trial injection site response form. The surgery site and subsequent scar will be monitored using a validated measure for wound and scar assessment: POSAS
<sup><xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p><p>
<bold>Progression to surgery of the digit being assessed (Early DD RCT only):</bold> Progression to surgery of the digit being assessed, if applicable, will be recorded during the 18 month follow-up. Progression to treatment will be determined by the clinicians, who are not part of the trial team.</p><p>
<bold>Monitor blood circulating levels of adalimumab and antibodies to adalimumab:</bold> 12.5ml of blood will be collected pre- and post-injection to measure circulating levels of adalimumab and antibodies to adalimumab. Monitoring circulating levels of adalimumab will facilitate our understanding of the kinetics of drug absorption following intranodular injections and may provide further information regarding the optimal frequency of intranodular injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Data management</title><p>A detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) will be followed for the management and monitoring of data. All trial data will be entered on paper CRFs, sent to the RIDD trial office and entered centrally into the trial database.

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stata.com/">STATA</ext-link> (StataCorp LP), or other well-validated statistical packages.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographics between the intervention groups. Continuous outcome measures will be presented as a difference in means, together with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dose cohort (where applicable) and overall. Binary and categorical outcomes will be presented as numbers and percentages in each category, as well as the difference in proportions with the corresponding 95% CI.</p><p>The primary outcome for the Tissue Response RCT is expression of mRNA for &#x003b1;-SMA, quantified with PCR using the standard curve method using three housekeeping genes GAPDH, B2M, and PGK1 to normalize the samples. For analysis of the primary and key secondary outcomes the placebo results will be pooled across cohorts to allow for a dose response to be explored. For the safety outcomes, they will be reported within their respective cohorts due to the different volumes being used.</p><p>For the primary outcome of the early DD RCT, the difference in the mean change of nodule hardness between the two groups will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. The comparison of change in nodule hardness between interventions will be analysed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline if it is normally distributed. Otherwise, an equivalent non-parametric unadjusted test will be used. In order to analyse change in nodule hardness over the full-time period, ANCOVA will be used to compare nodule hardness between interventions utilising all time-points up to 18 months and adjusting for stratification and other important prognostic factors. For all other continuous variables, t-tests (or ANCOVA) will be applied if normally distributed to compare the intervention with the control group and the difference in the means, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be reported. If not normally distributed, non-parametric techniques will be used. For categorical variables, chi-squared tests will be used for comparing intervention groups if the variables are normally distributed. If a variable is not normally distributed, a non-parametric test will be used for the analysis. The level of significance to be used is p&#x02264;0.05.</p><p>The primary statistical analysis will be carried out on the basis of intention-to-treat, with all randomised participants included and analysed according to their allocated treatment group, irrespective of which treatment they actually received. Due to the small sample size, missing data will not be imputed for the tissue response RCT. For the primary outcome of the early DD RCT, multiple imputation using multivariate normal imputation, or other appropriate techniques, will be used to impute missing data if required (full details will be specified in the SAP). For the early DD RCT, sensitivity analyses will be run on the per protocol population which will be defined in the SAP.</p><p>Consistency of results will be compared across stratification factors using interactions and displayed in Forest plots; however, no formal tests will be performed by subgroup.</p><p>A decision analytical Markov model combining information on costs, quality of life and transition probabilities associated to each health state for the first and second year post-treatment will be used to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF therapy compared to current clinical practice in early DD for the Early DD RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial committees</title><sec><title>1.

<sup><xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. The mainstay of treatment remains surgical excision but requires prolonged post-operative hand therapy, may be associated with a relatively high complication rate and is not cost effective
<sup><xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Less invasive procedures such as disruption of the cord with a needle or collagenase are associated with rapid recovery of function but have much higher recurrence rates
<sup><xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. The ideal treatment would prevent the progression of early nodular disease, before the development of digital flexion contractures which lead to impairment of hand function. Whilst a number of other treatments, including local steroid injection and radiotherapy, have been reported, evidence for efficacy is lacking and they have not been approved or gained widespread acceptance
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Our laboratory data showed that DD is a localised inflammatory disorder
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The nodular tissue comprises mainly myofibroblasts, which both secrete and contract the matrix, leading to digital contractures
<sup><xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted by the infiltrating immune cells and we have found that only TNF leads to the differentiation of precursor cells into myofibroblasts, and that TNF inhibition downregulates the myofibroblast phenotype
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. These findings form the basis of our current clinical trial, where we will recruit participants with early stage DD to receive either adalimumab or saline at 3 monthly intervals injected directly into the nodules over a 9 month period and followed up for a further 9 months. The majority of patients with flexion deformities of the digits are treated by surgery. This provides the opportunity to obtain tissue for analysis following injection of the IMP. Therefore, we will recruit individuals scheduled for surgical excision of DD, administer adalimumab or placebo two weeks before surgery and determine the effect on the myofibroblast phenotype in the surgically excised tissues. This part of the trial will assess the efficacy of different doses of adalimumab at the mRNA and protein level to inform the molecular mechanism of action of anti-TNF in DD. The myofibroblast is responsible for all forms of fibrosis
<sup><xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> and the data from this trial may inform future studies on other fibrotic diseases such as frozen shoulder.</p><p>

<underline><bold>POINTS TO IMPROVE</bold></underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There does seem to be some misunderstanding of the difference between a nodule and a cord. Yet this distinction is essential. Surely the whole purpose of the study is to examine whether one can prevent a nodule from becoming a cord? This point needs to be fully addressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the Introduction and Discussion, there seems to me to have been just a little adornment in the quest to depict the need for this study: the portrayed risks of progression and complications of existing treatment, the alleged lack of cost effectiveness of treatment and the suggested need for prolonged hand therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The facts in the introduction should therefore be qualified</p><p> &#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>RCT evidence shows that splintage is not needed after surgery, let alone for 3 to 6 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The recurrence rate of 10 to 12% is derived from just one small study and is likely to be inaccurate (due to definition issues).

<italic>STRONG POINTS</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>The Authors present a fascinating and plausible attempt to modify this enigmatic disease.</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>The study design is well-developed and appropriate for the matter in question.</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>POINTS TO IMPROVE</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>There does seem to be some misunderstanding of the difference between a nodule and a cord. Yet this distinction is essential. Surely the whole purpose of the study is to examine whether one can prevent a nodule from becoming a cord? This point needs to be fully addressed.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> We appreciate that nodules represent the early stage of disease, with subsequent development of cords. We will only be recruiting patients with distinct nodules and all injections will be administered intra-nodularly. Accurate assessment of development or extension of cords is very difficult and we will be measuring active and passive joint extension in the early disease stage RCT.</p><p>
<italic>In the Introduction and Discussion, there seems to me to have been just a little adornment in the quest to depict the need for this study: the portrayed risks of progression and complications of existing treatment, the alleged lack of cost effectiveness of treatment and the suggested need for prolonged hand therapy. </italic>
</p><p>
<italic>The facts in the introduction should therefore be qualified</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Please see above our amendment regarding potential complications of existing treatments. We will be assessing cost efficacy of adalimumab as part of our study.</p><p>
<italic>RCT evidence shows that splintage is not needed after surgery, let alone for 3 to 6 months.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> A recent Cochrane review &#x02018;did not recommend routine use but that splinting should be considered on an individual basis&#x02019;. (Rodrigues et al 2015). We agree that the needs of post-operative patients vary, with some patients requiring splintage but not routinely. This now reads: up to 6 months</p><p>
<italic>The recurrence rate of 10 to 12% is derived from just one small study and is likely to be inaccurate (due to definition issues). I would suggest the figure is derived from a suitable review article e.g. Kan et al., 2013 1</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Kan 2013 does not report recurrence rates of surgery alone. Recurrence rates from radiotherapy, fasciectomy, fasciotomy, collagenase injection and other treatments ranged from 2 to 80%. We quoted the data from a prospective randomised study (van Rijssen 2012), which compared 41 limited fasciectomy patients (125 joints) with 52 PNF patients (167 joints) after 5 years and found recurrence rates of 21% following limited fasciectomy and 85% following PNF.</p><p> Page 3, column 1: We have amended the text to read: However,&#x000a0;recurrence rates are high, at 5 years affecting 85% of&#x000a0;patients treated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy&#x000a0;
<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;and 47%&#x000a0;of those treated with&#x000a0;collagenase&#x000a0;
<sup>14</sup>&#x000a0;.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>Published recurrence data for collagenase are now available at 5 years (Peimer et al., 2015)</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, column 1: We have now cited comparable 5 year data and included the reference by Peimer et al (2015)</p><p>
<italic>The complications for surgery and PNF and CCH are not comparable- the high rate of complications after CCH, although frequent, are transient. This should be emphasised.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, column 1: This has now been amended to read: over 70%, the majority being minor and mostly transient</p><p>
<italic>The Authors may consider mention that eventually, manipulation of genetic pathways rather than biochemical pathways will lead to the solution for this disease</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Gene therapy for non-life threatening conditions is some way from the clinic and we consider this to be outside the remit of our trial protocol.</p><p>
<italic>The tonometry is described as measuring &#x0201c;the hardness of the palmar tissue overlying the nodule&#x0201d; (page 8). Surely it measures the hardness of the nodule itself, not the palmar tissue overlying it.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 8, column 2: We have amended this to read
<italic>&#x0201c;the hardness of the palmar tissue and the underlying nodule&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>The inclusion criteria should include a single digit or palmar disease; otherwise the Michigan score will not distinguish disability from one or more cords</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> By limiting recruitment to single digits the population would be very small and difficult to recruit. &#x000a0;We have included disease specific measures and functional measures.</p><p>
<italic>Clarify the &#x0201c;range of motion&#x0201d; measurement. Would this be active or passive?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 8, column 2: This has now been amended to read: Active and passive range of movement.</p><p> POINTS THAT CANNOT BE IMPROVED</p><p>
<italic>It remains to be shown, but is doubtful, that eradication of a nodule will prevent progression of disease in a different site- the nodule is probably not the seed from which the cord of DD grows, but just a localised manifestation of a diffuse tendency. By no means all nodules progress to symptomatic cords This point is crucial, yet seems glossed over in the introduction wherein the Authors make a rather enthusiastic pitch to imply that early treatment of nodules will eradicate the chance of the &#x0201c;risks&#x0201d; of other treatments being required. As a reviewer, I really feel uncomfortable with allowing this presumption to go unchallenged and insist on suitable justification or dilution.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Whilst we agree that not all nodules progress to form cords with resultant flexion deformities of the digits, our published data show that there is an inverse correlation between the presence of nodules and disease severity (Verjee et al, JHS 2009. 34A: 1785-94).</p><p>
<italic>The clinical endpoint- treating nodules of DD before they progress, is laudable but unlikely to be cost effective. Perhaps 11% of people develop DD nodules. These nodules in their early stage might cause anxiety but rarely cause symptoms. It is unlikely that any health care system should view such treatment favourably when comparing the health gains with treating other more symptomatic or sinister conditions funding for which already challenges existing resources.</italic>
</p><p> This study includes an economic evaluation to identify whether it is cost effective or not.</p><p> Response:</p><p> There is a clear plan to assess the cost efficacy of adalimumab. Please see tertiary objectives for the early disease RCT (Table 4)</p><p>
<italic>The Authors aim in Study 2 to recruit patients with &#x0201c;up to 60 degrees&#x0201d;. This represents a substantial cord and does not represent a &#x0201c;nodule&#x0201d; nor &#x0201c;early DD&#x0201d;.&#x000a0; A cord of 60 degrees is likely to be symptomatic. Unless the proposed treatment removes the cord and thus corrects the deformity, entry into the trial of a patient with a combined deformity of 60 degrees will deprive the subject of treatment of a symptomatic condition. I respectfully advise that this inclusion extends beyond the purpose or capability of the study.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Whilst we agree that deformity of 60 degrees at a given joint would not be considered early stage disease, we are referring to up to 30 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints.</p><p> Page 9, Table 6: We have clarified this section to read: Participants with early DD nodules shown or reported to progress in the previous 6 months, with a flexion deformity of &#x02264;30&#x000b0; at the metacarpophalangeal and/or at the proximal interphalangeal joint, i.e. total flexion deformity of up to 60&#x000b0; for the digit being assessed.</p><p> Individuals vary as to the level of deformity that they find acceptable and we will only recruit individuals who do not plan to undergo any elective procedure during the 18 month period of the trial. However, if the deformity progresses such that the participant and their treating clinicians decide to proceed with treatment, this will be recorded.</p><p>
<italic>The EQ5D questionnaire is worthless in DD as it has no sensitivity to change; it is the wrong PROM. The Authors have also employed the hand-specific Michigan scale which is probably more suitable although I am not quite sure that references 37 and 38 robustly prove that it has been validated specifically for DD.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> There are currently no data available for the EQ-5D-5L in assessing early DD. We are aware that whilst it may prove not to be sensitive, the EQ-5D-5L is a validated, generalised, health related quality of life questionnaire recommended by NICE as the accepted measure for conducting a cost-utility analysis. The EQ-5D instrument facilitates the generation of a utility score from a person&#x02019;s health related quality of life.&#x000a0; A utility score refers to the preference that individuals have for any particular set of health outcomes.&#x000a0; The EQ-5D consists of five health state dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).&#x000a0; There are three levels of health status to choose from: no problems, some problems, major problems.&#x000a0; Each participant will value their present health at the date of questionnaire completion.&#x000a0;&#x000a0; Participants will also complete a Visual Analogue Scale which will provide us with a value for the participant&#x02019;s self-rated health at the time of survey completion.</p><p> Page 11, column 2 has been amended accordingly.</p><p> There are no published data relating to validation of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire MHQ) in early DD. Reference 37 (Johnston et al 2008) showed that there was a strong correlation between in MHQ score and change in DD digital fixed flexion deformity. Reference 38 (Herweijer et al 2007) demonstrated that the MHQ can detect change in patients before and after surgery for DD. The MHQ has been shown to have high internal consistency which should be useful when exploring the natural course of DD, where changes occur slowly over time (Shauver and Chung 2013).</p><p>

<italic>Introduction</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>The statement about the proportions of patients treated with surgery etc in the USA needs a reference and time frame because this changes over time.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, Column 1: Reference now provided: Zhao et al. 2016</p><p>
<italic>Postoperative hand therapy for 3-6 months sounds very long, usually not for the typical patient.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, Column 1: We agree that the duration of post-operative hand therapy varies, with some patients requiring more prolonged treatment. This now reads: up to 6 months</p><p>
<italic>To state that collagenase injection treatment has over 70% &#x0201c;complication rate&#x0201d; without specifying the type of complications is problematic. For people not familiar with collagenase it would sound that the treatment is not safe when in fact it is a very safe treatment because these &#x0201c;complications&#x0201d; are mostly local reactions such as swelling, minor hematomas, pain etc that resolve completely within days. Applying the same definition of complications to surgery would mean that all patients have complications.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, Column 1: We have now amended this to read: over 70%, where the majority are relatively minor and transient, mainly comprising swelling, bruising and pain after collagenase injection.</p><p>
<italic>There are no details about how the &#x0201c;acceptability of injection therapy&#x0201d; survey was conducted.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 3, Column 2: We now have included further details of the survey and the response rate. We have amended the text to read: We conducted an end user survey of 46 patients, 24 with early DD and 22 who had previously undergone surgery. Thirty-three patients (71.7%) responded 62.5% (n=15) and 82% (n=18) respectively from each group.</p><p>
<italic>Objectives and Methods:</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>It is not entirely clear what is meant by &#x0201c;control the progression&#x0201d; of early DD.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Table 4, page 7: Progression of early disease is manifest as change in nodule hardness, nodule size or an increase in finger flexion deformity. &#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>How do we know that nodule hardness is a measure of disease progression in patients with DD and joint contracture?</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>and</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>Are there data about the reliability and validity of measuring &#x0201c;nodule hardness&#x0201d; and size?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> We agree that nodule hardness has not been shown to correlate with joint contracture. Relying on progression of finger flexion as a measure of disease progression would have resulted in an unacceptably long follow up period of 3-5 years. We selected nodule hardness as the primary outcome measure in line with the study by Ketchum et al 2000, who assessed the efficacy of local steroid injection into the nodule. However, whilst Ketchum et al relied on subjective assessment of hardness, we will use tonometry to obtain a quantitative measure. We found that tonometry readings were lower in healthy volunteers compared to people with DD &#x02013; please refer to the section on Sample size calculation, page 7. We also referenced a publication by Thurston (1987) who used tonometry and reported softening of the palm following excision of Dupuytren&#x02019;s tissue. We will also use ultrasound scan to assess the size of Dupuytren&#x02019;s nodules but as there are no previous data using this modality for Dupuytren&#x02019;s disease we have chosen this parameter as a secondary objective. Measurement of surface area of nodules has been shown not to correlate with disease progression Lanting (2016).</p><p>

<italic>It would be helpful if a brief description of measuring nodule hardness is provided considering it is the primary outcome.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 11, Column 1: This section has been amended to read: Tissue hardness will be measured with a tonometer, ensuring that the gauge is balanced perpendicular to the skin without application of external pressure by the observer. Five readings will be obtained on each occasion. A photograph obtained at base line marking the spot to be measured will be used for all subsequent measurement to ensure consistency of placement of the tonometer. Tonometry has been used to evaluate skin compliance before and after surgery (Thurston 1987) and reported softening of the palm following excision of Dupuytren&#x02019;s tissue.</p><p>
<italic>Are there any data about responsiveness of the EQ-5D-5L in patients with DD?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 11, Column 2: The EQ-5D-5L has been used to calculate health state utilities (Gu 2013) in individuals with more advanced DD. This has now been added the section Health Utilities in Clinical outcome measures.</p><p>

<italic>Definition of &#x0201c;Early&#x0201d; DD: 60 degrees of contracture in a finger is usually not considered early DD. It could be argued whether this is treatment or prevention of disease progression. Can the active injection result in partial or complete reduction of the contracture? What does the patient expect from the treatment?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 9, Table 6: Whilst we agree that deformity of 60 degrees at a given joint would not be considered early stage disease, we are referring to up to 30 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints.</p><p> We have clarified this section to read: Participants with early DD nodules shown or reported to progress in the previous 6 months, with a flexion deformity of &#x02264;30&#x000b0; at the metacarpophalangeal and/or at the proximal interphalangeal joint, i.e. total flexion deformity of up to 60&#x000b0; for the digit being assessed.</p><p>
<italic>It is unclear whether the total flexion deformity of up to 60 degrees applies to 1 finger or multiple fingers, for example if a patient had contractures in the small, ring and middle fingers.</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 9, Table 6: This refers to a single digital flexion deformity of the digit that we are assessing as clarified above.</p><p>
<italic>Primary outcome: at what time point?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Page 8: The primary outcome is measured over time as described in Table 5, with the final measurement being taken at 18 months.</p><p>
<italic>How will the hand photos be evaluated and will it be done blinded?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> In the Tissue response RCT the photographs will be used to evaluate healing and quality of scarring.</p><p> Page 11, column 1: In the early DD RCT they will not be evaluated but used to ensure consistent placement of the tonometer.</p><p>
<italic>Is the injection painful (more painful than injecting saline)? Can this influence blinding?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> It is not known whether injection of adalimumab into a nodule is more painful than saline although when administered subcutaneously there were no significant differences in the pain scores (Furst&#x000a0; 2003). Pain will not influence blinding as each participant will receive the same treatment (adalimumab or placebo) throughout the course of the study.</p><p> &#x000a0;Furst, D.E., et al., Adalimumab, a fully human anti tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, and concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: results of STAR (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis).

<bold>30</bold>(12): p. 2563-2571.</p><p>
<italic>Does the injection cause local reaction like swelling, bruising etc, and if so how long do these changes persist? Can this influence blinding?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> The participant will be blinded to the treatment received and, as explained above, will receive the same treatment (adalimumab or placebo) throughout. Therefore, the duration of any local adverse effects will not influence participant blinding. All assessments will be performed by a blinded observer before administration of the injection.</p><p>
<italic>It is stated that investigators will be able to discontinue participants on the basis of noncompliance such as not attending some visits; it would be important to avoid introducing risk of bias. </italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> Injections will be discontinued if the participant withdraws from the trial or if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including pregnancy, adverse events, significant protocol deviation or non-compliance with study procedures. Compliance will be defined as attending not less than 75% of injection visits, i.e. 3 visits. We will endeavour to continue to follow up the participants with their consent following withdrawal.</p><p>
<italic>How will the possible decision to proceed to surgery during the study be done?</italic>
</p><p> Response:</p><p> The participant will follow the normal clinical pathway. This now reads: Progression to treatment will be determined by clinicians who are not part of the trial team.&#x000a0;</p><p>
