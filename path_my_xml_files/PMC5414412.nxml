NASH is often a precursor to the development of cirrhosis and in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Because of differences in studied population and the diagnostic methods used, the reported prevalence of NAFLD largely varies. Worldwide, the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population ranges from 9% to 37%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It is estimated that the prevalence of NAFLD in the adult population is between 30% and 40% and that up to 40% of people with NAFLD have NASH. Recent studies in Western countries reported that the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population is approximately 20&#x02013;30%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD progression is not completely understood, but insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and cytokine imbalance are known as key pathophysiological mechanisms in NAFLD.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These factors have been proposed to explain the transformation of NAFLD from simple steatosis to NASH, and interaction of free radicals with cellular constituents may result in their peroxidative deterioration leading to an impaired of cellular functions.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Despite the numerous studies on novel therapeutic options, the standards of pharmacological treatment of NAFLD have not been established. The effectiveness of Vitamin E, Vitamin C and betaine as some antioxidant agents have been evaluated, however, the evidences of the efficacy of such treatments have been equivocal.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Treatment methods that could efficiently decrease both the oxidative stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes in NAFLD are still being searched for. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) produced by the pineal gland. As an effective antioxidant, directly scavenge a variety of free radicals. And also reduces free radical levels via stimulating the activities of antioxidative enzymes.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Decrease in oxidative stress, lessen liver damage, and improve liver histology in rats with high-fat diet-induced NAFLD, has shown after given melatonin simultaneously with the diet.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The hypocholesterolemic and lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of melatonin has shown in some animal studies and the serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced in mice with experimental diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, several studies in human demonstrated that treatment with melatonin was effective in NAFLD.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In rats with NAFLD melatonin alone or administered in combination with pioglitazone or pentoxifylline was been effective and data of animal study indicate that melatonin can be used as promising adjunct therapy in the clinical management of NAFLD with excellent safety and tolerability.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>There is no standard pharmacological treatment for NAFLD and data about effect of melatonin on NAFLD is limited.

The diagnosis of NAFLD was based on both clinical and pathological findings in the liver and appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases. Patients in both gender with age between 20 and 65 years with diagnostic NAFLD were eligible if they had no diabetes mellitus, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary obstruction, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, and decompensated cirrhosis. In addition, patients with the use of drugs known to produce fatty liver disease, and weight loss more than 10% from baseline in the previous 6 months were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all studied patients. For diagnosis of NAFLD and ruling out other diseases that mimic NAFLD all of subject underwent laboratory tests for viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C virus antibodies iron total iron-binding capacity and ferritin for hemochromatosis and serum ceruloplasmin and urinary Cu for Wilson and history of alcohol consumption for alcoholic fatty liver thus all of these diseases is ruled out before enrolling to study.</p><p>Using random-maker software &#x0201c;Random Allocation&#x0201d; eligible patients randomly divided into two case and control groups. Case group included 50 patients who received a tablet of melatonin (orally twice daily). The control group included 50 patients who received placebo which formally manufactured as the same as melatonin tablets. The treatment period was 6 weeks for both groups, and all patients were suggested to have same diet and exercise regimen during this period.</p><p>Clinical and laboratory data were collected before and after treatment. Collected data included weight, waist, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fatty liver grade, and side effects. Weight in kilograms/(height in meter)<sup>2</sup> was used to calculate body mass index and standard clinical chemistry techniques were used measured laboratory data. The grade of fatty liver was assessed by ultrasonography of the live in three grade of mild, moderate, and severe. All ultrasonographies evaluations performed by an expert radiologist, to avoid inter-operator discordance.</p><p>All statistical analyses were done using SPSS software for Windows, version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data for continuous variables were recorded as means with standard deviations, and those for categorical variables were recorded as counts with percentages. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using Chi-square test. In case of continuous variables, differences between means were compared using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, and repeated measurements of ANOVA. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The flowchart of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.
