This study aims to investigate the effect of the consumption of foods prepared with iron- and zinc-biofortified pearl millet (FeZn-PM) by children on biomarkers of iron and zinc status, growth, and immune function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will conduct a randomised controlled feeding trial in identified slums of Mumbai, India among 200 children aged between 12 and 18 months. Children will be randomised to receive foods prepared with the biofortified PM (FeZn-PM, ICTP8203-Fe) or non-biofortified PM. Anthropometric and morbidity data will be gathered every month for 9 months. Biological samples will be collected at baseline, midline and endline to assess iron and zinc status, including haemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, serum zinc, C-reactive protein and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Biological samples will be archived for future analyses. The midline measurement will be a random serial sample between baseline and endline. Immune function will be assessed at each time point by the measurement of T cell counts and vaccine responses in a subset, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has obtained clearance from the Health Ministry Screening Committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research.

In addition, we will collect morbidity data, including changes in types and frequencies of morbidities such as diarrhoeal illness, pneumonia and any chronic disease throughout follow-up during each clinic visit. Caregivers will also be encouraged to come to the clinic at any time for any health-related reasons, which will also be recorded. This will provide an accurate representation of both innate and adaptive immunity in participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2j2"><title>Cognitive function</title><p>To determine whether consumption of biofortified PM improves child cognitive function compared with consumption of non-biofortified PM, we will assess in a subset of children aspects of cognition that (1) previously have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of early iron and/or zinc deficiency; or (2) draw heavily on brain structures or processes thought to be vulnerable to early iron and/or zinc deficiency based on studies of animal models and humans. Thus, we will assess multiple specific aspects of memory, attention and processing speed using automated eye trackers.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, we will also assess higher level, integrative cognitive abilities, including problem-solving and exploratory behaviour and global aspects of attention and inattention during free play with toys.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Data collection and storage</title><p>Prior to data collection, the field staff will be trained on ethical and data collection procedures. The protocol of data collection forms to be used is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.

This will enable real-time feedback and error checking, as well as eliminate errors associated with data entry, facilitating faster data analysis and rapid dissemination of results. All information will be kept confidential. All names will be removed from the data for analysis. The identifying codes and linked names will be securely stored in password-protected computers. All data will be securely stored on a third-party server, which will have limited access by study team members. All biological specimens will be collected by trained medical professionals and evaluated by certified laboratories within India. Biological specimens will be stored appropriately throughout the duration of the study and after the study for future analysis.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Form collection protocol.
