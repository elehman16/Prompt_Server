This analysis examined ARR over 2&#x000a0;years in ADVANCE across subgroups. Patients were treated with peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks or every 4&#x000a0;weeks, or placebo during Year 1. Thereafter, patients on placebo were re-randomized to peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks or every 4&#x000a0;weeks (delayed treatment). Subgroup analyses were conducted by demographics and baseline disease characteristics. The following results compared ARR in these subgroups for patients in continuous 2-week treatment versus continuous 4-week treatment. ARR was similar in most demographic and baseline disease characteristic subgroups evaluated within the peginterferon beta-1a every-2-week arm or every-4-week arm over 2&#x000a0;years. Although for both doses some differences in the point estimates for ARR were noted among the subgroups, considerable overlap in the confidence intervals suggested that the efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a is similar in all patients irrespective of gender, age, body weight, geographical region, and disease activity at initiation of treatment. Within each peginterferon beta-1a dosing group, ARR was generally similar across most subgroups.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Interferon</kwd><kwd>Pegylated</kwd><kwd>Peginterferon beta-1a</kwd><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Relapsing-remitting</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Phase 3</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005614</institution-id><institution>Biogen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peginterferon beta-1a is a new treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with the advantage of a more convenient, low frequency, subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen compared with other beta interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ADVANCE study was a 2-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, with a 1-year placebo-controlled period, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x000a0;mcg administered once every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks in patients with RRMS (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00906399).</p><p>Primary results and 2-year follow-up data for the whole study population (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1512) have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At the end of the placebo-controlled period (Year 1), both peginterferon beta-1a dosing regimens met the primary endpoint [reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR)]. Peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks resulted in a numerically greater treatment effect across relapse activity outcomes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endpoints than peginterferon beta-1a every 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

In brief, patients aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years who had been diagnosed with RRMS (McDonald criteria 1&#x02013;4), had a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of&#x000a0;&#x02264;5.0, and had experienced&#x000a0;&#x02265;2 relapses within the last 3&#x000a0;years (including&#x000a0;&#x02265;1 relapse in the 12&#x000a0;months prior to randomization) were included in the study. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive self-administered SC treatment with placebo, peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x000a0;mcg every 2&#x000a0;weeks, or peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x000a0;mcg every 4&#x000a0;weeks. To maintain blinding, all patients received an injection every 2&#x000a0;weeks; patients in the peginterferon beta-1a every-4-weeks group had alternating injections of peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x000a0;mcg and placebo. At the end of Year 1, patients in the placebo group were re-randomized to SC peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks or every 4&#x000a0;weeks (delayed treatment). Patients were excluded if they had progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) or had received prior interferon beta treatment for RRMS exceeding 4&#x000a0;weeks or discontinued interferon treatment within 6&#x000a0;months prior to baseline.</p><p>The ADVANCE study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site and was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before entering the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary endpoint was ARR at Week 48, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting&#x000a0;&#x02265;24&#x000a0;h, and accompanied by new objective neurologic findings upon evaluation by the examining neurologist. Relapses were confirmed by an Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC). Standardized neurological assessments including EDSS were performed at baseline, every 12&#x000a0;weeks, and at the time of suspected relapse. MRI scans were performed at screening and at Weeks 24, 48, and 96, and were assessed centrally by an expert reader blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In the primary analysis, ARR (total number of relapses divided by patient-years in the study, excluding data obtained after patients switched to alternative multiple sclerosis drugs) was analyzed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with a negative binomial regression model adjusted for baseline EDSS score (&#x0003c;4 vs&#x000a0;&#x02265;4), baseline relapse rate (number of relapses in 3&#x000a0;years before study entry divided by 3), and age (&#x0003c;40 vs&#x000a0;&#x02265;40&#x000a0;years).

These findings suggest that, among the general RRMS population, most subgroups of patients could derive benefit from treatment with peginterferon beta-1a.</p><p>There was considerable overlap in the 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CI) for rate ratios for peginterferon beta-1a versus placebo in Year 1 across the examined subgroups (although some point estimate differences across subgroups were observed), indicating that peginterferon beta-1a had similar efficacy for reduction in ARR regardless of gender, age, weight, geographical region, and baseline disease characteristics. While some subgroups failed to reach statistical significance for peginterferon beta-1a versus placebo (as indicated by 95&#x000a0;% CI for rate ratios crossing 1), this tended to be in smaller subgroups which exhibited a higher degree of variability, and so may be related to reduced statistical power in small subgroups. For example, stratification by weight produced 4 smaller subgroups, which had wider 95&#x000a0;% CIs than larger subgroups in the binary categories such as age and gender; among the geographical regions, Region 2 (Eastern Europe) was the largest subgroup and had the tightest 95&#x000a0;% CIs, revealing significant effects of both peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks and every 4&#x000a0;weeks compared with placebo. Similarly, over 2&#x000a0;years, there were some differences in ARR among the subgroups, but the overlap in 95&#x000a0;% CIs suggested that the treatment effect of peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks on ARR was greater than with every-4-weeks dosing in most subgroups defined by baseline demographic characteristics. Among subgroups defined by baseline disease characteristics, peginterferon beta-1a treatment every 2&#x000a0;weeks over 2&#x000a0;years demonstrated generally consistent efficacy versus every 4&#x000a0;weeks on ARR (the primary endpoint).</p><p>Sensitivity analyses, which examine the influence of protocol design errors, unintended biases, and deviations from assumptions of underlying models, are designed to assess whether a primary endpoint result is robust and generalizable. The current sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the primary endpoint of the ADVANCE study was robust across 2&#x000a0;years, with little difference in outcomes across several pre-planned and post hoc analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peginterferon beta-1a demonstrated generally consistent benefits on the primary endpoint of ADVANCE, ARR at Year 1, across clinically relevant subgroups of RRMS patients with varied baseline demographic and disease characteristics. Similar results were observed over 2&#x000a0;years. Overall, these subgroup and sensitivity analyses support the results from the primary analysis, indicating that peginterferon beta-1a has the potential to provide benefits to patients with MS, with a convenient, low-frequency, SC dosing regimen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the patients and study site personnel who participated in the ADVANCE study.
