subjects were 34 adults who were divided into a good posture belt group (7 men, and 10
women) and a control group (7 men, and 10 women), with 17 subjects each. [Methods] Sensor
mats were used to measure buttock pressure and changes in the total travel distance of the
center of pressure, maximum pressure, and mean pressure. [Results] The good posture belt
group showed smaller increments in center of pressure, maximum pressure, and mean pressure
than the control group. [Conclusion] The use of the good posture belt during cross-legged
sitting is considered to control the increment of buttock pressure, thereby greatly
helping the maintenance of efficient postures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Good posture belt</kwd><kwd>Buttock pressure</kwd><kwd>Cross-legged sitting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inadequate sitting postures maintained for long periods are the major cause of back
pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, because the spine and
pelvis are anatomically composed of the spine-pelvic complex, the position of the pelvis in
sitting postures greatly affects the spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cross-legged sitting (CLS), also called &#x0201c;tailor sitting&#x0201d; entails movements that accompany
hip joint flexion, abduction, external rotation, knee joint flexion and internal rotation,
and ankle plantar flexion. In particular, as CLS includes complex lower limb movements,
increases pelvic posterior rotation, and reduces lumbar lordotic curves, it may cause back
pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultimately, the basis of proper
sitting postures is the pelvis, and maintaining the pelvis in its neutral position is
greatly important in securing postural stability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A method frequently used when analyzing sitting positions is the measurement of buttock
pressure (BP). As a basal area should be prepared through the pelvis in stable sitting
postures, even weight distribution can help maintain proper postures. Generally, in sitting
positions, BP increases over time<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
foam<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and good posture belts (GPB) are
most frequently used to slow down increases in BP. Whereas use of foam has been extensively
studied as a preventive method for bedsores<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
effects of GPBs during CLS have not been studied.</p><p>CLS causes more slumped postures compared to upright sitting postures on a chair.
Therefore, finding and preventing the factors that contribute to slumped postures during CLS
is greatly important. To this end, the present study was intended to examine the effects of
wearing a GPB on BP during CLS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In the present study, 34 male and female college students were selected and randomly
assigned to a good posture belt group (GPBG) with 17 participants (7 men, and 10 women) who
would wear a GPB during CLS and a control group (CG) with 17 participants (7 men, and 10
women) who would not wear any GPB during CLS. The criterion for selection of the study
participants was individuals who had no muscular, skeletal, or neurological problems. Those
who felt pain or were restricted in movement during CLS were excluded. The present study was
approved by the institutional review board of Korea Daegu University
(1040621-201507-HR-001-02), and the participants provided voluntary written agreement for
their participation in the study after sufficiently understanding the overall contents
regarding the purpose of the study and the experiment.</p><p>The general characteristics of the participants were as follows (in mean&#x000b1;standard
deviation): age, 21.41&#x000b1;2.09&#x02005;years; height, 165.94&#x000b1;8.31&#x02005;cm; and weight, 59.42&#x000b1;7.92&#x02005;kg in the
GPBG, and 22.47&#x000b1;3.21&#x02005;years, 168.29&#x000b1;8.33&#x02005;cm, and 61.29&#x000b1;8.45&#x02005;kg, respectively in the CG. To
assess the characteristics of the two groups, the sexes were analyzed by using chi-squared
tests, and the age, height, and weight were analyzed by using independent t-tests. According
to the results, the two groups had no significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05), so their
homogeneity could be assumed for comparison of the test results.</p><p>To examine the effects of GPB on BP during CLS, all the participants were instructed to
maintain CLS on BP measuring mats installed on a flat floor. While maintaining CLS, each
participant was instructed to put their ischial tuberosity into contact with the center of
the mat and maintain a neutral position in order to prevent lumbar lordosis or kyphosis. In
addition, each participant was instructed to rest their hands softly on their knees and
watch videos on the monitor installed 150&#x02005;cm in front of them. The position of the monitor
was adjusted so that the monitor was placed on the plane horizontal to the eyes of the
participant. The participants in the GPBG were instructed to maintain the state of wearing
the GPB during CLS. A GPB (Good Posture, Korea) is composed of a non-elastic tension belt, a
tension belt connecting ring, a length-adjusting buckle, and elastic knee bands. During CLS,
the participants were instructed to wear the GPB by placing the tension belt connecting ring
at the center of the GPB on the spinous process at L3, putting the elastic knee bands
located at both ends on the knees, and pulling the tension belt to fix it when the waist was
in the neutral position.</p><p>BP was measured during CLS by using an S2028 pliance sensor mat 448 (Novel Pliance,
Germany), which is composed of a pressure sensing mat (448&#x000d7;448 mm) containing 256 (16&#x000d7;16)
sensors, a multichannel analyzer, a calibration device, and software that elaborates and
standardizes data. The data detected by the sensors enable the computer to analyze BP
through the software. In the present study, to analyze BP, maximum pressure (MaxP), mean
pressure (MeaP), and total travel distance of the center of pressure (COP) were measured.
The average MaxP and MeaP values, and the total travel distance of the COP for 60 sec during
1&#x02013;2 minutes and during 13&#x02013;14 minutes, respectively, were used as measured values.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed by using the SPSS 18.0 statistical program. Paired t-tests
were used to test the significance of changes in individual groups before and after the
experiment, and independent t-tests were used to test the significance of the differences
between the two groups. The significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in COP, MaxP, and MeaP were presented in mean&#x000b1; standard deviation (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Variation of change in buttock pressure</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Good posture belt group (n=17)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Control group (n=17)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">COP (mm)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">706.1&#x000b1;151.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">764.9&#x000b1;149.4<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">656.3&#x000b1;141.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">784.2&#x000b1;163.3<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MaxP (kPa)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.2&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.9&#x000b1;3.3<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.2&#x000b1;5.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.3&#x000b1;5.4<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MeaP (kPa)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4&#x000b1;0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4&#x000b1;0.5<sup>a</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The presented are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD.

maintain balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, when CLS is
maintained for a long period, the pelvic posterior tilt increases and lumbar lordosis
decreases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, leading to increases in
thoracic kyphosis as a compensatory action for the foregoing, thereby increasing muscle
fatigue and compression on intervertebral disks, resulting in low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
For this reason, many tools are currently being developed through ergonomic analyses.</p><p>In the present study, although COP, MaxP, and MeaP were shown to increase over time in both
the GPBG and the CG, increments in COP, MaxP, and MeaP were shown to be smaller in the GPBG
than in the CG. In particular, the total travel distance of the COP was shown to be shorter
in the GPBG than in the CG. This is considered attributable to the fact that the use of a
GPB supported the lumbar region during CLS so that upright sitting could be maintained for a
long time. The shorter travel distance of the COP means that balance was maintained better
in the GPB than in the CG during CLS. This is considered the reason why the increments in
MaxP and MeaP were smaller in the GPB. Human bodies continuously show minute postural sway
when maintaining static balance. The maintenance of balance can be effectively measured by
measuring the COP<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance control
requires well-controlled voluntary movements and reflexive muscle movements related to body
alignment<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, larger flexion
angles are formed on the lumbar spine to maintain CLS for a long time<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, requiring more effort and energy from the muscles around
the spine<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> so that upright sitting
cannot be maintained and the travel distance of the COP increases over time.</p><p>Ultimately, the use of GPB is considered to support spinal alignment during a long period
of CLS, thereby affecting COP, MaxP, and MeaP, and resulting in positive effects on the
prevention of low back pain that may occur due to BP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Bulich</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship beween posture and back muscle endurance
