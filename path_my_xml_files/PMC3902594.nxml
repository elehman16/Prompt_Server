The hectic life and tremendous stress in daily life has made the conception and continuation of pregnancy till term very difficult. Anemia is one of the common disease conditions, which affects a pregnant woman. In Ayurvedic classics anemia in pregnancy is taken under the <italic>Rasa Pradoshajavikara</italic>. It is clear that <italic>Garbhavasthajanyapandu</italic> occurs due to the fetal demands and improper functioning of the <italic>Rasadhatu</italic> leading to malnourishment of the body. A total of 26 patients were registered from out-patient department of <italic>Streeroga</italic> and <italic>Prasutitantra</italic>, out of which four patients discontinued. The remaining 22 patients were randomly divided into two groups; Group A (n-12) <italic>Pandughnivati</italic> two tablets of 500 mg tds and Group B (n-10) <italic>Dhatrilauhavati</italic> one tablet of 500 mg tds. <italic>Dhatrilauhavati</italic> was selected for the present study due to its <italic>Pandughna</italic>, <italic>Prinana</italic>, <italic>Raktaprasadana</italic> properties. In the present study, <italic>Pandughnivati</italic> a compound formulation developed by AYUSH department was administered for patients of group A. The results revealed that the over all clinical improvement was better in patients of Group B when compared to Group A. Hence it was concluded that <italic>Dhatrilauhavati</italic> was effective in treating anemia during pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anemia in pregnancy (iron deficiency anemia)</kwd><kwd><italic>Dhatrilauhavati</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Garbhinipandu</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Pandughnivati</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Acharya Harita</italic> has described eight <italic>Garbhopadravas</italic> in <italic>Harita Samhita</italic>[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and included <italic>Vivarnatva</italic>, which appears to be pallor that accompanies anemia.
