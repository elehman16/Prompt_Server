Group-based high-intensity functional training (HIFT) provides time-efficient aerobic and resistance exercise at self-selected intensity levels which can increase adherence; behavioral responses to HIFT are unknown. This study examined effects of HIFT as compared to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART) on exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A stratified, randomized two-group pre-test posttest intervention was conducted for eight weeks in 2012 with analysis in 2013. Participants (n = 23) were stratified by median age (&#x0003c; or &#x02265; 28) and body mass index (BMI; &#x0003c; or &#x02265; 30.5). Participants were physically inactive with an average BMI of 31.1 &#x000b1; 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, body fat percentage of 42.0 &#x000b1; 7.4%, weight of 89.5 &#x000b1; 14.2 kg, and ages 26.8 &#x000b1; 5.9 years. Most participants were white, college educated, female, and married/engaged. Both groups completed 3 training sessions per week. The ART group completed 50 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each session and full-body resistance training on two sessions per week. The HIFT group completed 60-minute sessions of CrossFit&#x02122; with actual workouts ranging from 5&#x02013;30 minutes. Participants completed baseline and posttest questionnaires indicating reasons for exercise initiation (baseline), exercise enjoyment, and exercise intentions (posttest). Adherence was defined as completing 90% of exercise sessions. Daily workout times were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants provided mostly intrinsic reasons for exercise initiation. Eighteen participants adhered (ART = 9, 81.8%; HIFT = 9, 75%). HIFT dropouts (p = .012) and ART participants (p = .009) reported lower baseline exercise enjoyment than HIFT participants, although ART participants improved enjoyment at posttest (p = .005). More HIFT participants planned to continue the same exercise than ART participants (p = .002). No significant changes in BMI or body composition were found. Workouts were shorter for HIFT than ART (p &#x0003c; .001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>HIFT participants spent significantly less time exercising per week, yet were able to maintain exercise enjoyment and were more likely to intend to continue.

This is especially problematic for overweight and obese adults due to high risk for comorbid conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For weight loss and control, at least double the weekly amount of moderate-intensity physical activity (&#x0003e;300&#x000a0;minutes) is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As overweight/obese adults are becoming the 'average&#x02019; U.S. adult population, understanding their low exercise participation and high dropout rates is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>High-intensity training (HIT) provides fitness and health improvements in less time per week than current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although the intensity required might be intimidating, the reduced time requirement may be appealing to many adults, showing potential for higher rates of adherence. However, HIT often utilizes aerobic intervals which may not be sufficient; combined aerobic and resistance training among sedentary overweight and obese adults results in greater weight and fat loss and fitness improvements than each modality alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Extrinsic factors often motivate exercise initiation, yet facilitating intrinsic motivation is key for exercise adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Adherence is also impacted by affective responses to exercise intensity, where enjoyment decreases as intensity increases, potentially contributing to high rates of physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, enjoyment rebounds post-exercise for HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Group-based high-intensity functional training (HIFT) temporally combines aerobic and resistance exercises with focus on functional (multi-joint) movements, resulting in improvements to aerobic capacity and body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. HIFT intensity is self-selected by participants. This is important since self-selected intensity results in greater tolerance for HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], especially for previously inactive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Some concerns exist for HIFT, most notably the US Department of Defense and the American College of Sports Medicine have raised concerns for the potential of insufficient instruction in HIFT methods, need for scaling and training progressions, and the importance of monitoring participants for overtraining and injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, Army personnel participating in HIFT had slightly lower injury rates (12%) than those not participating in HIFT (i.e., exercising on their own or doing usual Army physical training; 14%), although higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased injury risk for HIFT participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A cross-sectional survey of HIFT participants found an injury rate of 3.1 injuries per 1000&#x000a0;hours trained, similar to those for weightlifting, powerlifting and gymnastics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Otherwise, limited research exists for HIFT and behavioral responses to HIFT training are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of HIFT as compared to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART) on exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions among physically inactive (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;minutes per week) overweight and obese adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>Participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) were recruited from Kansas State University and surrounding community to participate in a free exercise program which would consist of standard aerobic and resistance training or a CrossFit&#x02122; program.

Participants completed three exercise sessions per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Participants first warmed up using aerobic exercise machines at their own discretion (time not recorded). They completed a total of 50&#x000a0;minutes of aerobic exercise on the machines (minimum of 10&#x000a0;minutes per machine) each session at 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) for weeks 1&#x02013;4 and 50-60% HRR for weeks 5&#x02013;8. Full-body resistance exercises were completed in about 20&#x000a0;minutes during the sessions on Mondays (i.e., bicep curls, military presses, lat pulldowns, and leg extensions) and Wednesdays (i.e., tricep pulldowns, bench presses, reverse leg curls, and seated leg presses). After establishing 1 repetition maximums (1RM) in week 1, participants completed three sets per lift for weeks 2&#x02013;8 (i.e., weeks 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;=&#x02009;50% 1RM, 15 reps; weeks 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;=&#x02009;60% 1RM, 12 reps; weeks 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;=&#x02009;70% 1RM, 10 reps; week 8&#x02009;=&#x02009;75% 1RM, 8 reps). Three sets of 15 crunches were performed both days, and participants rested one minute between each set and exercise.</p><p>The HIFT group utilized CrossFit&#x02122; training for 60-minute sessions led by CrossFit&#x02122; certified trainers. Nine movements (i.e., air squat, front squat, overhead squat, press, push press push jerk, deadlift, sumo deadlift high pull, and medicine ball clean) were introduced in sessions 1&#x02013;2.

DXA scans showed no significant changes in body fat percentage, lean body mass or fat mass for either group. Weight changes were insignificant for both groups (HIFT range&#x02009;=&#x02009;-2.4 to&#x02009;+&#x02009;1.7&#x000a0;kg; and ART range&#x02009;=&#x02009;-3.4 to +1.6&#x000a0;kg).

Five ART participants planned to continue doing &#x0201c;cardio and weights,&#x0201d; and two planned to try CrossFit&#x02122;.

All participants who indicated the extrinsic reason of losing weight, also stated an intrinsic reason for exercise initiation. HIFT participants with higher baseline exercise enjoyment were significantly more likely to complete the study and were significantly more likely to plan to continue the same exercise than those in the prescribed intensity (ART) condition.</p><p>Previous research found improvements in exercise enjoyment for moderate-intensity exercise, similar to those for ART participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As enjoyment is inversely related to exercise intensity, it is not surprising that those with lower baseline exercise enjoyment dropped out of HIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is possible they might have adhered if they had been in the ART group.</p><p>To determine if participant attrition affected our outcome measures, we examined our data using intention to treat analysis, but results did not significantly differ [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/Contents/Item/Display/500">http://www.consort-statement.org/Contents/Item/Display/500</ext-link>].</p><p>Limitations included no measures for intensity or affect changes during HIFT workouts, potentially missing variations in enjoyment that affected intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The act of enrolling in an 8-week exercise study where eligibility criteria included being overweight or obese and physically inactive may have biased participants&#x02019; self-reported answers for exercise initiation and enjoyment. One participant randomized to the ART condition indicated wanting to try CrossFit&#x02122; and losing weight as his reasons for enrolling in the study. This potentially biased for his intention to try CrossFit&#x02122; at the conclusion of the study, although he also planned to run a 5-km race. We did not verify whether participants followed through on exercise intentions (although four enrolled in regular CrossFit&#x02122; classes with two continuing today). Finally, due to the small sample size, these results may not generalize outside of these participants.</p><p>Study strengths included adherence; dropout rates of 19% for ART and 25% for HIFT participants were lower average (45%) for exercise interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Only one HIFT participant (4.3%) experienced an injury in our study, indicating that the HIFT protocol was safely conducted among our participants. Future research could include a larger sample with extended follow-up to determine sustained adherence as well as injury rates per 1000&#x000a0;hours (total training time for all HIFT participants was only 52.6&#x000a0;hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data have public health implications in that HIFT participants spent significantly less time exercising than both ART participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and current US physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], yet were able to maintain exercise enjoyment and intend to continue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This may be due to self-selected intensity levels, exercise variance, or novelty of HIFT. However, it may be helpful for adults with lower exercise enjoyment to initiate moderate-intensity ART training when beginning a new exercise program, as significant improvements in exercise enjoyment can occur. The HIFT training was time-efficient and safely conducted for these previously inactive overweight and obese adults. Participants were able to maintain their body composition during the exercise programs, with some losing over 3&#x000a0;kg. Due to selection of CrossFit&#x02122; for HIFT, participants could continue participation almost anywhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ultimately, public health researchers and practitioners would be well-served to include time-efficient high-intensity exercise options when promoting physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>1RM</term><def><p>One repetition maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p>Aerobic and resistance training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DXA</term><def><p>Dual X-ray absorptiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIFT</term><def><p>High-intensity functional training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIT</term><def><p>High-intensity training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRR</term><def><p>Heart rate reserve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>KMH was responsible for drafting the manuscript and overseeing the study.
