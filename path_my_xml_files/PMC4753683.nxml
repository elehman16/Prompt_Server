However, it was unknown whether brief light exposure at night for medical treatment and nursing care would compromise the benefits brought about by such a light-dark cycle. To examine such possibility, we developed a special red LED light with a wavelength of &#x0003e;675&#x02009;nm which preterm infants cannot perceive. Preterm infants born at &#x0003c;36 weeks&#x02019; gestational age were randomly assigned for periodic exposure to either white or red LED light at night in a light-dark cycle after transfer from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to the Growing Care Unit, used for supporting infants as they mature. Activity, nighttime crying and body weight were continuously monitored from enrolment until discharge. No significant difference in rest-activity patterns, nighttime crying, or weight gain was observed between control and experimental groups. The data indicate that nursing care conducted at 3 to 4-hour intervals exposing infants to light for &#x0003c;15&#x02009;minutes does not prevent the infants from developing circadian rest-activity patterns, or proper body growth as long as the infants are exposed to regular light-dark cycles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms that have a period length of about 24&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

We employed a white LED light for use with the control group and developed a red LED light for use with the experimental group. The red LED light has a wavelength of &#x0003e;675&#x02009;nm, which preterm infants cannot detect due to the prematurity of their retinal photoreceptors such as cone cells, which mature at a later developmental stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The red LED device produces light with a peak wavelength of 725&#x02009;nm and a half value width of 50&#x02009;nm, which is outside the range of perception of infants, while the white LED device produces light made up of a broad range of wavelengths including those that infants can perceive. We hypothesized that exposure to white LED light disrupts the development of circadian rest-activity patterns leading to more nighttime crying and less weight gain, compared to exposure to red LED light. The present study, however, demonstrated that there was no significant difference in rest-activity patterns, nighttime crying, or weight gains between preterm infants exposed to normal white LED light (3480 lux) and those exposed to red LED light (21 lux) while receiving regular repeated nursing care during night in a GCU, which maintained a daily 15-hour: 9-hour light-dark cycle.</p><p>In human adults in constant darkness, the circadian clock has been reported to be responsive to brief light pulses in the evening. A single 2-hour bright light pulse of approximately 4000 lux in the late evening phase delayed the circadian rhythm of melatonin an average of approximately 1.5&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. As for EEG, a single 2-hour blue light pulse (460&#x02009;nm) in the evening affects REM sleep and sleep EEG power density of slow-wave activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Moreover, 3&#x02013;5 consecutive days of exposure to intermittent pulses of bright light (3000&#x02013;11000 lux) as brief as 5&#x02009;min in duration in the evening have been shown to induce 2.3-hour phase advances of the circadian rhythm of melatonin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>In studies of nocturnal animals in constant darkness also, it has been reported that the mammalian circadian clock is responsive to brief exposures of light. In rodents such as mice, rats and hamsters, brief bright light pulses from 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;s to 5&#x02009;min in constant darkness have been reported to phase shift their circadian activity rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. A single 30&#x02009;min light pulse of 1000 lux in the late evening in constant darkness affects the expression of a clock gene, Period1, and/or circadian activity rhythms in mice and rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Since the pupillary light reflex of mice has a much lower threshold than humans and is sensitive to a more divergent range of wavelengths, lower levels and shorter durations of light exposure have been reported to be able to affect mouse circadian systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>One possible explanation for the absence of effects of white LED light on infants&#x02019; physiology could be that the effects of regular light-dark cycles overwhelm those from brief white LED light exposure at night. In most previous studies of both humans and animals, the phase shifts induced by a brief light exposure in the evening were observed not in light-dark cycles, but in constant darkness or constant dim light of &#x0003c;10 lux. In constant darkness or dim light, a larger phase shift can be induced than in subjects exposed to regular light-dark cycles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the present study, the larger resetting effects of light-dark cycles may have erased the possible phase shifts in preterms&#x02019; activity rhythms induced by a brief light exposure in the evening.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the absence of effects of red LED light on infants&#x02019; physiology could be that appropriate parameters to assess the effects of red LED light on infants have not been selected. For instance, it may be that white LED light, but not red LED light, stimulated cortisol secretion and suppressed melatonin in these infants without alerting the measured outcome variables. However, since non-invasive methods such as measurement of saliva cortisol, electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) do not show stable circadian rhythmicy at around term, assessment of these cannot be utilized to assess the circadian development of the preterm infants in this study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. There is evidence in rats that only short wave lengths (blue) affect hormone secretion: in one study, selectively filtering blue light into short wavelengths between 452 and 462&#x02009;nm prevented the rise of corticosterone and restored normal melatonin secretion as well as restored clock gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Further studies to examine wavelength effects on infant hormone secretion could be of interest, but would be ethically difficult to perform since they would require blood sampling.</p><p>In clinical practice the red LED light had a relatively low illuminance level of approximately 21 lux (compared to the 3480 lux generated by the white LED light), but was bright enough for the staff to perform necessary nursing care such as feeding and diaper changes. The use of the red LED light also made it more difficult for the staff to check for apnea in infants from their skin color. However, in practice the red LED light did not prevent the staff from being able to check for apnea in the infants since oxygen saturation monitoring systems are routinely attached to all the infants in the Growing Care Unit (GCU).</p><p>In summary, this study confirmed no significant difference in rest-activity patterns, nighttime crying or weight gains between preterm infants exposed to normal white LED light and those exposed to red LED light for regular nursing care during the night at a GCU in a 15-hour: 9-hour light-dark cycle. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated that exposing infants to light for &#x0003c;15&#x02009;minutes at 3 to 4&#x02009;hour intervals for nursing care does not prevent the infants from developing normal circadian rest-activity patterns or gaining weight as long as the infants are exposed to regular light-dark cycles.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two preterm infants who were born at &#x0003c;36 weeks&#x02019; gestational age (WGA) and hospitalized at Hokkaido University Hospital were studied in an LD (15&#x02009;h light: 9&#x02009;h dark) cycle. After transfer from the NICU to the Growing Care Unit (GCU), used for supporting infants as they mature, medically stable infants were randomly assigned to either white (control group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) or red (experimental group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) LED light exposure during nighttime nursing care, using a table of random numbers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

During nursing care, the control group (white LED light group) was exposed to a white LED light which produced approximately 1100 &#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup> at a distance of 40&#x02009;cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, Atom Medical Co., Saitama, Japan). In the experimental group (red LED light group), a red LED light was used for the same care procedures as in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, peak wavelength of 725&#x02009;nm; 1100&#x02009;&#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 40&#x02009;cm). 1100&#x02009;&#x003bc;W/cm<sup>2</sup> was set for both white and red light groups so that the same light power density reached the eyes of both groups of infants. The illuminance levels for the white and red LED lights for human adults were 3480 lux and 21 lux, respectively (T-10, Konica Minorta Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Both the white and red LED light were bright enough for the medical staff to perform nursing care such as feeding and diaper changes at night. Relative spectral distributions of two lights are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activity Assessment</title><p>Infant activity was monitored continuously using an Actiwatch-L (Minimitter Co., OR, USA), which was also used as a light sensor. An Actiwatch-L was attached on one ankle of each infant using a soft sleeve bandage. The Actiwatch-L records a digitally integrated measure of gross motor activity that is assessed by an internal accelerometer, yielding an absolute number of movements per hour (watch sensitivity was &#x0003c;0.01 N). Daytime and nighttime activity levels were defined by the numbers of movements per hour during the intervals of 06:00&#x02013;21:00&#x02009;h and 21:00&#x02013;06:00&#x02009;h, respectively. For assessing whether there was diurnal variation in movement, day-night activity ratios were calculated by dividing the daytime activity level by the nighttime activity level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. A day-night activity ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the infant is more active during daytime than nighttime.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Crying Assessment</title><p>Nurses recorded each crying episode in the infant&#x02019;s medical chart when they aurally recognized crying during the nighttime. The number of crying episodes during the nighttime was collected from these medical charts.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Growth</title><p>Infants were weighed daily at 09:00&#x02013;10:00&#x02009;h using a calibrated scale.

For a 2-tailed &#x003b1; level of 0.05, we calculated that 21 subjects in each group would be needed to observe a large effect size of 1.0 with a power of 0.90.
