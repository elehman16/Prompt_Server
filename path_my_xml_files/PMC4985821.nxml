Urine sample collection is required to diagnose or exclude UTI; however, current collection methods for pre-continent children all have limitations and guidelines vary. Clean catch urine (CCU) collection is a common and favoured non-invasive collection method, despite its high contamination rates and time-consuming nature. This study aims to establish whether gentle suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold fluid-soaked gauze can improve the rate of voiding for CCU within 5&#x02005;min in young pre-continent children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is a randomised controlled trial of 354 infants (aged 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;months) who require urine sample collection, conducted in a single emergency department in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. After standard urogenital cleaning, patients will be randomised to either a novel technique of suprapubic cutaneous stimulation using cold saline-soaked gauze in circular motions or no stimulation. The study period is 5&#x02005;min, after which care is determined by the treating clinician if a urine sample has not been collected. Primary outcome: whether the child voids within 5&#x02005;min (yes/no). Secondary outcomes: parental and clinician satisfaction with the method, success in catching a urine sample if the child voids, and sample contamination rates. This trial will allow the definitive assessment of this novel technique, gentle suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold saline-soaked gauze, and its utility to hasten non-invasive urine collection in infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has hospital ethics approval and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry&#x02014;ACTRN12615000754549.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but the clinical signs of UTI can be non-specific. Urine collection is required for diagnosis of clinically suspected UTI or to determine the potential source of fever in the absence of a clear clinical focus. Limitations and ongoing debate exist with current invasive and non-invasive methods of obtaining urine samples from young pre-continent children.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The decision on the method of urine sampling balances invasiveness (and hence pain and distress), reliability, speed and contamination rates. Clean catch urine (CCU) is often favoured for being non-invasive and requiring less technical expertise, in hospital and community-based settings,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and has lower contamination rates than other non-invasive methods such as urine collection bags.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Suprapubic aspiration and catheter specimens have lower contamination rates than CCU; however, these methods involve pain and distress for the child and require technical expertise and equipment.</p><p>Guidelines from the UK (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> USA (American Academy of Pediatrics)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and our local Royal Children's Hospital<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> have differing recommendations for the use of CCU for urine collection from febrile infants with suspected UTI. Contamination rates in CCU are high and variable, reported as between 7.8% and 35%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>CCU also ties up valuable resources in clinical settings due to its time-consuming nature, and parents report that obtaining a CCU is time consuming and messy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This may result in increased urine contamination rates due to difficulty preventing accidental contamination of the genital area or collection jar, or CCU being abandoned by the parent or clinician. One previous study found that 58% of children waited longer than 1&#x02005;hour to pass urine with CCU, with a mean time of 71&#x02005;min to either pass urine or leave the department without a sample.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We conducted an initial prospective baseline study to determine success in obtaining CCU with current practice, in pre-continent children aged 1&#x02013;48&#x02005;months. A timer was used to measure time to void after standard urogenital cleaning (without any additional stimulation). In preliminary results from the first 113 children, 13 children (11.5%) voided within 5&#x02005;min.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Of the 57 patients who were aged &#x0003c;12&#x02005;months, 12 patients (21%) voided within 5&#x02005;min.</p><p>Previous studies have examined novel methods to obtain more rapid CCU in pre-continent children. These include vibrating bladder stimulator in infants and toddlers (not effective)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and lumbar/sacral stimulation in neonates (effective but limited age group).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> An effective method to expedite CCU would reduce time to diagnosis, reduce the need for clinicians to instigate painful invasive urine collection methods, reduce urine culture contamination rates and likely improve parent and clinician satisfaction with the CCU method.</p><p>In animals such as rats, the mother stimulates bladder emptying by licking the perigenital skin of her newborn pups, triggering the perigenital-bladder reflex.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Animal model studies have also shown that mechanical and electrical perigenital skin stimulations can excite perigenital-to-bladder spinal reflexes and stimulate bladder contractions in cats with chronic spinal cord injury.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In humans, suprapubic stimulation is proposed to trigger parasympathetic detrusor contraction via the exteroceptive somato-bladder reflex mechanism.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We hypothesise that a simple intervention of gentle suprapubic stimulation using cold fluid-soaked gauze may hasten bladder voiding, by triggering cutaneous reflexes which are present at birth and suppressed later in development.</p><p>We conducted a pilot feasibility study to test if additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with saline-soaked gauze was a feasible and acceptable intervention, and if this method may help to obtain CCU within 5&#x02005;min in children aged 1&#x02013;24&#x02005;months in the paediatric emergency department (ED).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This was tested on 20 children using cold saline (7/20 successful, 35%) and 20 children using room temperature saline (5/20 successful, 25%). Most successful voids were from infants aged 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;months (12/12, 100%), so we chose 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;months as the participant age group for the definitive trial. CCU is not a recommended method of urine collection in neonates (&#x0003c;1&#x02005;month) for investigation of UTI in our institution.</p><p>Our primary objective is to examine whether a simple and easily followed technique (additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold fluid-soaked gauze) increases the rate of voiding within 5&#x02005;min in pre-continent children, compared to using standard urogenital cleaning alone. Secondary objectives are to study whether this method can reduce the number of urine voids that are &#x02018;missed catches&#x02019;, and reduce the need to use invasive urine sampling techniques in some circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study aims</title><p>To determine if suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold fluid-soaked gauze increases the rate of urine voiding within 5&#x02005;min in children aged 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;months in the paediatric ED, where a urine sample is required and the clinician has determined that CCU is an appropriate method of collection.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be undertaken to compare the rate of urine voiding within 5&#x02005;min using standard urogenital cleaning and CCU alone, compared with standard urogenital cleaning and CCU with additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold saline-soaked gauze.</p><p>The population to be studied is children aged 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;months in a single paediatric ED at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligibility criteria for the study are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>.
