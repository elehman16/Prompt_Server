We investigated whether 3 months of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy would be non-inferior to the usual 6 months of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The SCOT study was an international, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 244 centres. Patients aged 18 years or older with high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer underwent central randomisation with minimisation for centre, choice of regimen, sex, disease site, N stage, T stage, and the starting dose of capecitabine. Patients were assigned (1:1) to receive 3 months or 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens could consist of CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOX (bolus and infused fluorouracil with oxaliplatin). The regimen was selected before randomisation in accordance with choices of the patient and treating physician. The primary study endpoint was disease-free survival and the non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio of 1&#x000b7;13. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who started study treatment. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN59757862, and follow-up is continuing.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>6088 patients underwent randomisation between March 27, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013. The intended treatment was FOLFOX in 1981 patients and CAPOX in 4107 patients. 3044 patients were assigned to 3 month group and 3044 were assigned to 6 month group. Nine patients in the 3 month group and 14 patients in the 6 month group did not consent for their data to be used, leaving 3035 patients in the 3 month group and 3030 patients in the 6 month group for the intention-to-treat analyses. At the cutoff date for analysis, there had been 1482 disease-free survival events, with 740 in the 3 month group and 742 in the 6 month group. 3 year disease-free survival was 76&#x000b7;7% (95% CI 75&#x000b7;1&#x02013;78&#x000b7;2) for the 3 month group and 77&#x000b7;1% (75&#x000b7;6&#x02013;78&#x000b7;6) for the 6 month group, giving a hazard ratio of 1&#x000b7;006 (0&#x000b7;909&#x02013;1&#x000b7;114, test for non-inferiority p=0&#x000b7;012), significantly below the non-inferiority margin. Peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or worse was more common in the 6 month group (237 [58%] of 409 patients for the subset with safety data) than in the 3 month group (103 [25%] of 420) and was long-lasting and associated with worse quality of life. 1098 serious adverse events were reported (492 reports in the 3 month group and 606 reports in the 6 month group) and 32 treatment-related deaths occurred (16 in each group).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>In the whole study population, 3 months of oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy was non-inferior to 6 months of the same therapy for patients with high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer and was associated with reduced toxicity and improved quality of life. Despite the fact the study was underpowered, these data suggest that a shorter duration leads to similar survival outcomes with better quality of life and thus might represent a new standard of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Medical Research Council, Swedish Cancer Society, NETSCC, and Cancer Research UK.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, with 1&#x02008;360&#x02008;000 cases occurring annually, and is the fifth most common cause of death from cancer, causing 694&#x02008;000 deaths.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Postoperative adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy was first shown to improve outcomes for patients with stage III colon cancer by Moertel and colleagues.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The addition of oxaliplatin to a fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy backbone produced additional benefit,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is a recommended adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy has been an option for patients with high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer, as reflected in several international guidelines. Only one small study has investigated a 3 month duration of fluoropyrimidine adjuvant treatment. In view of the cumulative peripheral neuropathy that occurs with oxaliplatin, there was a question of whether a shorter duration of treatment would reduce toxicity without sacrificing efficacy. The SCOT study was designed to test for the non-inferiority of 3 months of treatment compared with the standard 6 month duration.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">Worldwide, six studies have addressed this research question, of which SCOT is the largest. Our results showed the non-inferiority of 3 months of adjuvant treatment compared with 6 months of treatment for the overall study population. Peripheral neuropathy was significantly worse in the 6 month group and reducing the treatment duration to 3 months more than halved the number of grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy events reported. Moreover those patients who were most severely affected by peripheral neuropathy also had a significant reduction in quality of life.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">In view of the results of the SCOT study and the meta-analysis of all six worldwide studies conducted by the IDEA collaboration, 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy will become the new global standard of adjuvant treatment for most patients who are suitable for treatment with CAPOX, particularly those patients with T1&#x02013;3, N1 disease.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">The major cumulative chronic toxic effect of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is sensory peripheral neuropathy, which can be disabling.

Patients were recruited from 244 centres in six countries (the UK, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand).</p><p id="para130">Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and had undergone a curative resection for stage III or high-risk stage II (defined as having one or more of T4 disease, tumour obstruction with or without perforation of the primary tumour preoperatively, fewer than ten lymph nodes harvested, poorly differentiated histology, perineural invasion, or extramural venous or lymphatic vascular invasion) adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Patients were enrolled within 11 weeks of surgery and started treatment on their allocated study group within 2 weeks of randomisation. Other eligibility inclusion requirements included WHO performance status 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and life expectancy of greater than 5 years with reference to non-cancer related diseases. Patients had to have a normal CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis before study enrolment and carcinoembryonic antigen less than 1&#x000b7;2 times the local upper limit of normal (ULN) within 1 week before randomisation. Patients with rectal cancer had to have undergone total mesorectal excision surgery with negative resection margins (defined as &#x0003e;1 mm clearance). Exclusion criteria included chemotherapy (except chemotherapy administered with curative intent that was completed &#x0003e;5 years ago and from which there were no residual complications), previous long-course chemoradiotherapy (preoperative short-course radiotherapy alone was allowed), moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance &#x0003c;30 mL/min, as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation), haemoglobin less than 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count less than 1&#x000b7;5&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L, platelet count less than 100&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L, and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 2&#x000b7;5 times the ULN. Other exclusion criteria were clinically significant cardiovascular disease, pregnancy or lactation or being of child-bearing potential and not using, or willing to use, medically approved contraception (postmenopausal women must have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential), previous malignancy other than adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (unless there had been a disease-free interval of at least 5 years), and known or suspected dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.</p><p id="para140">The study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All aspects of the study received ethics approval from the National Research Ethics Service or its equivalent in the participating countries. This study was approved by the West Glasgow Research Ethics Committee (version 1.1 of the protocol) on Jan 21, 2008, and all subsequent amendments approved by the committee, where required (REC reference number 07/S0703/136).

The minimisation factors were centre, choice of regimen, sex, disease site (colon <italic>vs</italic> rectum), N stage (X, 0, 1, or 2) and T stage (X, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) and, if the patient was going to receive the CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimen, the starting dose of capecitabine (from Feb 1, 2010).</p><p id="para160">Initially some participating centres were randomly allocated to randomise patients after completion of the first 3 months of treatment to either receive a further 3 months treatment or to stop treatment. This approach was stopped because of a poorer randomisation rate (ie, fewer patients randomised per month) compared with centres that randomised patients before the start of treatment.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="para170">Participants were enrolled by authorised clinicians, after obtaining patient consent, by contacting the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit in Glasgow, UK, to check eligibility and request an allocation. At the end of the randomisation process, the computer randomisation system allocated every patient a unique identification number and determined their treatment duration. The study was open-label for patients, clinicians, and those doing the data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para180">Patients were assigned to receive oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant treatment for either 3 months or 6 months. The chemotherapy regimen, which could be FOLFOX (bolus and infused fluorouracil with oxaliplatin) or CAPOX, was chosen by the physician and patient and was not randomised.</p><p id="para190">For patients receiving FOLFOX, treatment was given every 2 weeks with the intention of delivering six cycles to patients assigned 3 months of therapy and 12 cycles to patients assigned 6 months of therapy. Intravenous oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was given over 2 h on day one concurrently with L-folinic acid 175 mg or folinic acid (leucovorin) 350 mg. This was followed by an intravenous bolus injection of fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> over 5 min, then a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> over 46 h. At the investigator's discretion, patients receiving FOLFOX who were older than 70 years could start on the bolus and continuous infusion of fluorouracil at 75% of the starting dose, if clinically indicated.</p><p id="para200">For patients receiving CAPOX, treatment was given every 3 weeks with an intention of delivering four cycles to patients assigned 3 months of therapy and eight cycles to patients assigned 6 months of therapy. Intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was given on day one over 2 h. Oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was taken twice per day for the first 14 days of each cycle. Patients with a creatinine clearance of 30&#x02013;50 mL/min had to start treatment with capecitabine at 75% of the full dose. Patients older than 70 years could be considered for treatment with capecitabine at 75% of the full dose, but the decision to reduce dose was left to the discretion of the investigator, depending on the fitness of the individual patient. If the clinician felt that any other patient required a-priori dose reduction because of any other comorbidity, that patient could be started on a minimum starting dose of oral capecitabine 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice per day.</p><p id="para210">Toxicity was assessed by the investigators after each cycle of chemotherapy treatment and graded by use of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version three. If any grade 1 adverse event occurred as a result of chemotherapy, treatment was continued at the full dose. For all treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse, treatment was withheld until recovery to grade 1, then restarted. For CAPOX, if more than one delay or a delay of at least 2 weeks occurred, capecitabine and oxaliplatin doses were reduced by 25% and, if further delays occurred due to myelotoxicity, further dose reductions were allowed at the investigators discretion. For FOLFOX, if more than one delay or a delay of at least 2 weeks occurred, doses of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil were maintained, but the bolus fluorouracil was omitted and, if further delays occurred due to myelotoxicity, the oxaliplatin and infusional fluorouracil doses were reduced by 25%.

Assuming that the study would recruit over a period of 5 years with a subsequent minimum follow-up of 2 years, this design required 8600 patients to undergo randomisation and 2750 events (relapses, deaths, or new colorectal cancers) to be observed. To allow for losses to follow-up, our target recruitment was 9500 patients.</p><p id="para280">From the outset, we recognised that reliable conclusions based on safety and QoL data would not require information on all 9500 patients.

An administrative delay in notifying the sites about the need to end the collection of detailed toxicity data resulted in data being collected from 868 patients. The data monitoring committee had access to summary plots of EORTC QoL data, EQ-5D health status, and FACT/GOG-Ntx4 neuropathy data by study group and study timepoints and following a committee meeting on May 28, 2010 (based on 1047 randomised patients), recommended that the collection of QoL and FACT/GOG-Ntx4 data be continued because they were concerned that the amount of missing data might undermine the comparisons at later timepoints if the original sample size estimates were used. They also recommended that the collection of FACT/GOG-Ntx4 data should be extended beyond 12 months for new patients and, where possible, for patients already on the study. At their next meeting on Nov 23, 2010, the data monitoring committee recommended that the collection of QoL and FACT/GOG-Ntx4 data should stop once 1800 patients had been recruited. Delays in the amendment of the protocol to implement the collection of the FACT/GOG-Ntx4 beyond 12 months led to patient recruitment beyond this recommendation to ensure sufficient numbers of patients at these later timepoints. These recommendations were subsequently endorsed by the trial steering committee. These extensions to data collection were made to compensate for missing data and no formal power calculations were made for these changes.</p><p id="para300">The efficacy analyses of disease-free survival and overall survival included all randomly assigned patients (intention-to-treat population) as far as possible. Kaplan-Meier techniques were used to plot both disease-free survival and overall survival. The analysis of treatment delivery and safety was based on patients who started study treatment.</p><p id="para310">The comparison of disease-free survival and overall survival between the treatment groups was based on a Cox regression model incorporating the minimisation factors as covariates. The HR associated with the treatment groups was derived from this model along with the associated 95% CI. The p value for testing the null hypothesis that the HR of 3 months versus 6 months was greater than or equal to 1&#x000b7;13 was derived from this model by comparing the log-likelihood of the fitted model with the log-likelihood of a model where the HR between the groups is set to 1&#x000b7;13 by use of a likelihood ratio test. The proportional hazards assumption implicit in these analyses was examined graphically via a log-minus log plot of the survival function against log time and via a test of the interaction between the treatment group and time (logged) obtained from a Cox model incorporating an appropriate time-varying covariate.</p><p id="para320">The components of the forest plot (estimated HR for the comparison between groups and associated 95% CI) were derived from a Cox model that included separate terms for the effect of duration within each category of the relevant stratification factor or other factor being examined.

This was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. This AUC was then adjusted by dividing by the follow-up period and subtracting the baseline value for each patient to produce a standardised adjusted AUC. The standardised adjusted AUC was calculated for the five imputed datasets and compared between the randomised treatment groups via a generalised linear model (with study group as an independent factor and study minimisation factors as covariates). The test statistics associated with study group from each of the five imputations were finally combined to provide an overall p value that takes into account the extent of the missing data. To allow for the number of scales being examined, an adjustment for multiple comparisons (separately for the EORTC and EQ-5D questionnaires) was made with the sharpened Hochberg procedure.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The p value threshold for statistical significance was 5% after adjustment.

The data monitoring committee requested the analysis because of apparent differences in disease-free survival curves. The conditional power results were discussed by the data monitoring committee in the context of the limited follow-up on patients and the available survival data.

The study did not meet its recruitment target of 9500 patients because accrual was not as rapid as originally forecast and recruitment needed to stop to allow sufficiently complete follow-up on current patients within the available funding. By increasing the recruitment period by 6 months and extending minimum follow-up to 3 years (88% patients were followed up for 3 year disease-free survival by the reverse Kaplan-Meier method, allowing for a 2 month deviation from the assessment time), 1482 disease-free survival events were observed, giving the study 66% power rather than the originally planned 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis.

Finally, we did a sensitivity analysis to compare the primary imputed results with the results based on observed data only or the imputed results for patients who completed baseline questionnaires only.

The shorter treatment duration was also associated with reduced toxicity and less deterioration in QoL. Because this study recruited 6088 patients with conventionally defined high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer from a large number of centres and countries and made use of standard chemotherapy regimens, the study findings are applicable to a typical patient with colorectal cancer needing adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The non-inferiority boundary was set to exclude a maximum 2&#x000b7;5% fall in 3 year disease-free survival in patients in the 3 month group compared with those in the 6 month group, which&#x02014;as estimated on the basis of results from previous trials&#x02014;would yield a predicted 3 year disease-free survival of 78%. This threshold of 2&#x000b7;5% was chosen because it was half the difference seen in 3 year disease-free survival between patients in the oxaliplatin-containing group and those in the fluoropyrimidine only group in the MOSAIC study. It was felt by clinicians commonly treating colorectal cancer that this small difference would be an acceptable payoff to bring about a significant reduction in long-term neuropathy and potential improvement in QoL to patients who achieve a long-term cure. This difference corresponds to an HR of 1&#x000b7;13, which we aimed to detect with 90% power at the 2&#x000b7;5% one-sided level of statistical significance.</p><p id="para570">Because 6088 patients were recruited and 1482 events were recorded (rather than our initial target of 9500 patients with 2750 events), the power was reduced to 66%.

Our definition of high risk-stage II disease was the same as that used in MOSAIC. At the time SCOT was initiated, less data were available on adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer because many adjuvant studies have excluded these patients, and patients with rectal cancer were eligible to participate if they had received no preoperative chemotherapy (short-course radiotherapy alone was allowed) and had undergone total mesorectal excision with an R0 resection. The only adjuvant chemotherapy these patients received was within this study and randomised for the duration of treatment.</p><p id="para580">We did comparisons of disease-free survival based on the actual duration of treatment received in the study groups, as well as the primary intention-to-treat analyses. These subanalyses did not show non-inferiority, but are inherently biased by the differential exclusion of patients not able to receive prolonged therapy because of the different target treatment durations in the study groups. In a setting such as this where differential compliance is intrinsic to the treatments being compared, our view is that the intention-to-treat analysis is a more accurate reflection of the impact of the intervention on actual clinical practice.</p><p id="para590">In terms of our analyses of smaller subgroups, we have not been able to draw solid conclusions about the effect of treatment duration on specific patient populations such as those with high-risk stage II disease or patients with rectal cancer because the numbers in these subgroups were relatively small and few events occurred. However, the Forest plots did not show any differences in the effect of the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy between patients with high-risk stage 2 disease and those with stage III disease and between those with rectal cancer and those with colon cancer. Therefore, there is no reason to consider that these subpopulations should be treated differently in clinical practice to the trial population as a whole. We can only apply the SCOT results to patients being considered for doublet chemotherapy as tested within the study. In clinical practice in many parts of the world, a substantial proportion of patients with high-risk stage II disease or stage III disease (especially if older than 70 years of age) receive only single-agent fluoropyrimidine for 6 months because the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine has not been shown to improve survival in these patients.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p id="para600">Other factors to consider in terms of prognosis and prediction of response to treatment include the sidedness of the cancer (right <italic>vs</italic> left), <italic>RAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> status, which affect prognosis in metastatic disease, and microsatellite instability status, which affects the outcome of adjuvant treatment.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> These questions cannot yet be answered by the results of SCOT, but there is a translational research substudy&#x02014;the TransSCOT study, which is ongoing&#x02014;that will look at these factors.</p><p id="para610">It is more difficult to give 6 months of treatment than 3 months of treatment. In the SCOT study, 2521 (83%) of 3024 patients assigned to 3 months received 3 months of treatment, whereas only 1773 (59%) of 3013 patients assigned to 6 months received 6 months of treatment. However, the median percentage of the full expected dose of fluoropyrimidine received varied between 94% and 98% for the 3 month group and 82% and 85% for the 6 month group, depending on regimen choice. The corresponding figures for oxaliplatin were between 96% and 98% for the 3 month group and 69% and 73% for the 6 month group. Given that the median fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin doses received were similar between the two regimens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>), compliance to treatment is unlikely to explain the difference seen between the two regimens.</p><p id="para620">Our results showed that 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly more toxic than 3 months of treatment. This difference was most marked for peripheral neuropathy, with 237 (58%) of 409 patients in the 6 month group reporting grade 2 or worse neuropathy compared with 103 (25%) of 420 patients in the 3 month group. Peripheral neuropathy, as reported via a patient questionnaire, was significantly worse in the 6 month group and persisted for at least 5 years (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>). Other adverse events that are symptomatically important to patients such as diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome were also significantly more common with 6 months of treatment. We do note that our conclusions regarding long-term neuropathy must been seen in light of the substantial proportion of missing data. However, the effects are large, as are the significance levels, and there is no evidence that these comparisons are biased between the groups,</p><p id="para630">QoL, as measured by QLQ-C30 global health status and EQ-5D-3L, declined while patients were receiving chemotherapy. QoL was therefore predictably worse for longer in those patients assigned to receive 6 months of treatment compared with 3 months of treatment. QoL improved after treatment stopped and by 1 year, there were no clinically important differences between the two study groups.</p><p id="para640">It is now realised that clinician assessment of neuropathy with methods such as the CTCAE are less sensitive than patient-reported outcomes such as FACT/GOG-Ntx4 and EORTC QLQ chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) 20.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> In this study, although QoL seemed to recover by 1 year, chronic sensory peripheral neuropathy persisted for up to 5 years. We found a significant difference in peripheral neuropathy, with more patients in the 6 month group reporting &#x0201c;Quite a bit&#x0201c; or &#x0201c;Very much&#x0201d; numbness, tingling, or discomfort in their hands or feet in the FACT/GOG-Ntx4 questionnaire, which correlated with significantly worse QoL at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. These differences in QoL were at least minimally clinically important (apart from the result for EQ-5D visual analogue scale at 1 year). This observation is similar to one made in a study showing a correlation between those patients with the most neuropathy symptoms (worst 10%) measured by EORTC QLQ CIPN 20 and a reduction in QoL measured by QLQ-C30 between 2 years and 11 years after treatment for colorectal cancer with oxaliplatin.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The absence of an overall difference in QoL seems to obscure a meaningful difference in the group of patients who have the worst long-term chronic neuropathy.</p><p id="para650">In a parallel initiative to SCOT, the IDEA collaboration was set up to consolidate the results from all trials worldwide that were attempting to answer this question of adjuvant chemotherapy duration, particularly for stage III colon cancer (ie, SCOT, TOSCA, IDEA France, CALGB/SWOG 80702, ACHIEVE, and HORG).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Our results, like those from the IDEA collaboration<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> suggest that the relative effect of shortening the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy might depend on the initial choice of chemotherapy regimen (CAPOX <italic>vs</italic> FOLFOX; p=0&#x000b7;069 for heterogeneity in SCOT). When we looked at the effect of duration for each regimen separately, CAPOX showed non-inferiority in terms of disease-free survival for 3 months versus 6 months of treatment, but this was not the case for patients receiving FOLFOX. The reasons for this difference are not clear. The choice of chemotherapy regimen was not randomised but instead chosen by the physician and patient and the reasons why specific regimens were chosen for individual patients are not known.</p><p id="para660">Also important to note for capecitabine, an oral drug that is self-administered at home, is that we only know the prescribed dose and do not have detailed compliance data, meaning that we might overestimate the fluoropyrimidine dose intensity for patients receiving CAPOX. However, in our experience, except in instances where clinicians curtail or modify doses according to intracycle toxicity, compliance with oral chemotherapy drugs is high.</p><p id="para670">Since the difference in the impact of treatment duration between the CAPOX and FOLFOX regimens does not seem to be easily explained by compliance with treatment or differences in the overall percentage of standard drug doses that were delivered, we perhaps need to consider other potential reasons for this finding. In the CAPOX regimen, the dose of oxaliplatin given with each cycle is higher than that given in FOLFOX, and therefore we presume that higher peak doses of oxaliplatin are achieved. Additionally, although the peak dose of fluoropyrimidine will be lower with CAPOX (capecitabine is given twice daily orally for two out of three weeks) than with FOLFOX (where the fluoropyrimidine is given as a bolus, then infused over 2 days every 2 weeks), the duration and continuity of exposure is greater. Could the micrometastatic disease be rendered more sensitive by one or both of these differences? If each of the cells in this micrometastatic setting are cycling through S phase only sporadically, does the continuity of exposure of the fluoropyrimidine in the form of capecitabine mean that there is a greater overall chance that these cells will be exposed to fluoropyrimidine at the critical part of the cell cycle, compared with fluorouracil given as bolus, then over 2 days every 2 weeks. This notion is supported by data from two previous adjuvant studies.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In terms of oxaliplatin, a drug that is nearly always given over 2&#x02013;4 h, does the peak concentration have more of an effect than the frequency, giving an advantage to the CAPOX regimen and less attrition to efficacy when the overall duration of therapy is shortened? Additionally, a higher dose of oxaliplatin is given in the first 4 weeks of treatment with CAPOX (260 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) than with FOLFOX (170 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). It is very difficult to prove these speculative theories without developing appropriate adjuvant models of malignancy, but the results seen will certainly be a focus of strong debate over the coming months and years.</p><p id="para680">Stage III colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease and data from the IDEA collaboration and from multiple adjuvant trials have shown that patients with T1&#x02013;3, N1 pathology have much better outcomes than those with either T4 or N2 features.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> This has led to the evolution of the concept of a high-risk stage III patient population, with either T4 or N2 disease, as opposed to the lower risk stage III population (T1&#x02013;3, N1); we might need to consider whether patients with high-risk stage III disease need to be treated in a slightly different way to those with lower risk stage III disease.</p><p id="para690">Similarly, our results have shown that patients with T1&#x02013;3, N1 disease have a much better 3 year disease-free survival than those with either T4 or N2 pathology. We found that, in patients with T1&#x02013;3, N1 colorectal cancer, 3 months of treatment was non-inferior to 6 months (HR 0&#x000b7;908, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;75&#x02013;1&#x000b7;098). However, for patients with T4 or N2 high-risk stage III disease, non-inferiority was not met (1&#x000b7;068, 0&#x000b7;934&#x02013;1&#x000b7;222). The HR for disease-free survival is greater than 1 for the 3 months duration compared to 6 months, suggesting that there could be some small loss of efficacy, but the confidence intervals are wide, making this difference difficult to interpret with certainty. Notably, the observed absolute deficit in 3 year disease-free survival between the 3 months and 6 months of treatment for the high-risk group (T4 or N2 disease) is 1&#x000b7;8%, which has to be balanced against the increased toxicity seen with 6 months of treatment. This is particularly important because the worsened peripheral neuropathy persists for at least 5 years after treatment and results in worse QoL outcomes.</p><p id="para700">For patients with T4 or N2 pathology, the absolute increase in 3 year disease-free survival with 6 months versus 3 months of treatment was 2&#x000b7;7% (95% CI &#x02212;4&#x000b7;1 to 9&#x000b7;6) for FOLFOX and 1&#x000b7;3% (95% CI &#x02212;3&#x000b7;7 to 6&#x000b7;2) for CAPOX (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>). However, the forest plots did not show a difference in outcome according to duration of treatment between N1 and N2 disease. In view of the difference in toxicity seen with longer treatment, many patients will accept a small reduction in disease-free survival in exchange for reduced toxicity and this is especially true if they are able to receive CAPOX. There is less evidence to support a shorter duration of adjuvant treatment if it is decided that the patient needs to receive FOLFOX or has T4 disease.</p><p id="para710">Across the whole trial population, SCOT met the criteria for non-inferiority with a difference in 3 year disease-free survival of &#x02212;0&#x000b7;4% (95% CI &#x02212;2&#x000b7;6 to 1&#x000b7;8) between 3 months and 6 months of treatment. While the study was underpowered, the 95% CI for the HR lies below the non-inferiority boundary and the results are consistent with those of other individual studies by the IDEA group, taking into account how the duration effect depended on regimen and risk group. The consistency with these other studies indicates that the results of SCOT are unlikely to represent a false-positive in terms of showing non-inferiority. The concept that underpowered studies are more likely to produce false-positives (ignoring the factor of publication bias, which does not apply to a large scale enterprise such as SCOT) is disputed.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> As noted, the results differed with the (non-randomised) choice of chemotherapy regimens and we can recommend a 3 month duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with T1&#x02013;3, N1 disease (2677 [44%] of the 6088 patients in the SCOT study) if the patient is felt to be suitable for the CAPOX regimen. We have not been able to show with any statistical certainty that 3 months of treatment was non-inferior to 6 months for patients receiving FOLFOX, for whom there was an absolute increase in 3 year disease-free survival with 6 months versus 3 months of treatment of 2&#x000b7;9% (95% CI &#x02212;6&#x000b7;7 to 0&#x000b7;8).</p><p id="para720">Despite the study's size, there are limitations to the reliability of conclusions that can be drawn for some subgroups. The choice of FOLFOX and CAPOX chemotherapy regimen was not randomised and there was clear heterogeneity between the two regimens, the reasons for which are unclear. For patients with low-risk stage 3 disease receiving CAPOX, 3 months of treatment is sufficient, whereas non-inferiority was not shown for FOLFOX. High-risk stage III disease includes either T4 or N2 disease (or both) and this study has not been able to show whether the effect of duration of adjuvant chemotherapy is the same for T4 and N2 disease. The final decision on treatment duration and regimen used for each individual will depend on a careful discussion between the clinician and patient, taking into account the risk of recurrence, the likely absolute difference in disease-free survival and risk of long-term toxicity, and the strength of evidence for that particular setting available both from SCOT and the wider IDEA analysis.</p><p id="para730">SCOT is, to our knowledge, the largest single randomised study on the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer to date. The study achieved its primary endpoint of showing that 3 months of oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy is non-inferior to 6 months of the same treatment in the overall trial population. 3 months of treatment might therefore be considered a new standard of care for adjuvant chemotherapy, especially if CAPOX is to be given.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
