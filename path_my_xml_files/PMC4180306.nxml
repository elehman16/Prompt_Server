This protocol describes an exploratory trial of a theory-based behaviour change intervention in the form of a booklet outlining simple activities (&#x02018;tips&#x02019;) designed both to reduce sedentary behaviour and to increase physical activity in older adults. The intervention is based on the &#x02018;habit formation&#x02019; model, which proposes that consistent repetition leads to behaviour becoming automatic, sustaining activity gains over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention is being developed iteratively, in line with Medical Research Council complex intervention guidelines. Selection of activity tips was informed by semi-structured interviews and focus groups with older adults, and input from a multidisciplinary expert panel.

An exploratory randomized controlled trial will be conducted within a primary care setting, comparing the tips booklet with a control fact sheet.

Of all age groups, older adults tend to spend most time in sedentary activity and least time in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Behaviour change interventions are needed to replace sedentary behaviour with physical activity, cost-effectively, in older adults. Four types of physical activity are recommended in older adulthood: aerobic, muscle-strengthening, flexibility, and balance exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that standing, a light-intensity balance activity, yields cardiometabolic health benefits relative to sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The benefits of reducing sedentary behaviour in older adults should therefore be twofold, reducing the risks associated with prolonged sitting, and achieving the benefits associated with physical activity. While decline in physical functioning can impose limits on activity in older adults, light-intensity physical activity is usually feasible, and can increase fitness, reduce morbidity and mortality, and promote natural uptake of more intensive activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Many interventions have sought to increase physical activity among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but few have explicitly targeted sedentary behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Two studies have shown that provision of individualized consultations and personalized accelerometer feedback is associated with reductions in sitting time and increases in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although these were uncontrolled pilot studies, with relatively small samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;69) and short-term follow-up (&#x02264;24&#x000a0;days), the results support the potential for interventions to primarily reduce sedentary behaviour and, in so doing, achieving the secondary aim of increasing physical activity.</p><p>Many behaviour change interventions have short-term effects, which are eroded when the intervention is withdrawn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This can reflect a progressive decline in motivation, or a dependence on external support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The ideal sedentary behaviour reduction intervention would be self-sustaining. Behavioural psychology suggests that forming &#x02018;habits&#x02019; can &#x02018;lock in&#x02019; behaviour gains over time. &#x02018;Habitual behaviours&#x02019; are actions that are driven by impulses that are activated by encountering a situation (environmental cue) in which the action has been repeatedly performed in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The environmental cue could be, for example, a geographical location, a person or the previous action within an existing routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Context-consistent repetition reinforces a mental cue-behaviour association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], so that an impulse to do the action is activated when the cue is encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While motivation and effort are required to initiate and sustain the early stages of a habit formation attempt, as the habit forms, control over behaviour is delegated to the external cue, and less conscious effort is required to do the action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], so that behaviour is sustained even when intentions are weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Habitual behaviours should continue to occur as frequently as the cue is encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], potentially becoming self-perpetuating. Habit formation thereby offers a potential means to maintain gains from behavioural interventions after withdrawal of external support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>This protocol describes work to develop a theory- and evidence-based behaviour change intervention aiming to displace prolonged sitting time (sedentary behaviour) with at-least-light-intensity physical activity in older adults. The intervention seeks to promote the formation and integration of physical activity habits into existing normally sedentary routines. An exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare the intervention with a control fact sheet setting out national guidelines for physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The primary objective of the RCT is to assess the feasibility of our intervention and our study procedures, as a basis for informing a large-scale future RCT. The secondary objective is to assess changes in behaviour, health and wellbeing. The intervention is being developed in line with the Medical Research Council complex interventions framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This protocol has been prepared in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) and Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], completed checklists for which are provided as additional files (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Theoretical basis: the &#x02018;habit formation&#x02019; model</title><p>Behaviour change interventions explicitly based on theory tend to be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The present intervention is based on the &#x02018;habit formation&#x02019; model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Habit typically forms asymptotically, with initial repetitions causing greatest gains in automaticity (that is, habit strength), and the contribution of further repetitions reducing until a plateau is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Habit formation requires motivational and volitional skills and resources to initiate and repeat behaviour until it becomes automatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Repetition in the early stages is best facilitated where the individual is intrinsically motivated (that is, pursues behaviour for its personal value, rather than to satisfy external demands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], where target behaviours are manageable and realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and where people actively monitor their progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This can sustain interest through the effortful stages of the habit formation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Simpler behaviours may become habitual more quickly than more complex actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and so a &#x02018;small changes&#x02019; approach, based on minor modifications to existing practices, may be more suited to habit formation than the pursuit of major behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The few behaviour change interventions that have applied these principles have found promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For example, the &#x02018;Ten Top Tips&#x02019; weight loss intervention centred on a leaflet outlining ten simple recommendations (&#x02018;tips&#x02019;) designed to create healthy habits (for example, &#x02018;try to eat at roughly the same time each day&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. An exploratory trial among overweight and obese participants found that intervention recipients lost more weight than a matched waiting-list control over 8&#x000a0;weeks, and maintained weight loss 6&#x000a0;months after active treatment ceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Habit gains correlated with weight loss, and participants reported that adherence to the tips became &#x02018;second nature&#x02019;, suggesting that habit formation underpinned intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preliminary work to generate intervention content</title><p>This intervention was modelled on the &#x02018;Ten Top Tips&#x02019; intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The aim was to develop a booklet presenting ten simple physical activity tips selected to be conducive to habit formation, with accompanying motivational text on the importance of reducing sedentary behaviour and increasing physical activity in later life. Empirical evidence was gathered to inform intervention content within the habit formation framework, in four stages; a supplementary figure presents an overview of this process (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). First, a group of older adults discussed attitudes, barriers and facilitators of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in focus groups and individual interviews. This information informed the generation of physical activity tips and accompanying motivational text. Second, expert panel feedback informed a second iteration of intervention content. Third, an additional focus group session and individual interviews among the older adult panel informed a further iteration. Finally, an independent group of 23 older adults rated the intervention content for readability, difficulty, motivation and performance likelihood, informing further refinement. This preliminary work was approved by the University College London ethics committee (1427/003, 4025/001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>First round of focus group and interviews</title><p>A panel of older adults convened by Age UK took part in a focus group session (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) and individual interviews (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17). Participants were self-reportedly 60 to 75&#x000a0;years, retirees, largely inactive (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;minutes of leisure time physical activity of at least three metabolic equivalents per week) and sedentary (&#x0003e;6 leisure time hours spent sitting per day), motivated to reduce their inactivity and physically capable of light physical activity. Topics included experiences of and attitudes towards sedentary behaviour and physical activity, routines and frequently encountered contexts and existing sedentary behaviour habits. Participants were invited to brainstorm ideas for incremental increases in physical activity feasible for repetition by older adults. Thematic analysis identified six themes.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Types of activity</title><p>Participants found it difficult to identify explicit activities suitable for the booklet. However, discussions indicated that mundane everyday activities (for example, stair use, walking, housework, stretching and strengthening exercises) would be feasible and acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Context</title><p>The context for recommended physical activity was seen as important for repetition and motivation; for example, indoor activities would permit year-round activity by avoiding reliance on the weather. Participants felt that physical activity opportunities within existing inactive routines, for example, while watching television at home, or when waiting at a bus stop, should be exploited. Many felt that recommending social forms of physical activity (for example, walking with friends) could bolster motivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Nature of physical activity</title><p>Participants stressed that recommended physical activity should be achievable for older adults, and not &#x02018;hard work&#x02019;. Small changes, based on starting with minimal-intensity physical activity and experimenting with ways to increase physical activity within the constraints of physical capability and health status, were preferred.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Motivators</title><p>Many participants said that recommended physical activities should be interesting, safe and pleasurable, and yield noticeable improvements in mood, confidence and energy, while reducing pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Barriers</title><p>Exercise feeling like a &#x02018;chore&#x02019; or a &#x02018;big deal&#x02019; were common barriers to physical activity. Structured or &#x02018;artificial&#x02019; activities, such as going to the gym or using an exercise bicycle, had negative connotations. Other barriers included health status, especially arthritis, pain, swelling and living with multiple conditions and fear of falling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Booklet design</title><p>Participants advised that the intervention booklet should include simple explanatory illustrations and that text should be motivational, pitched towards older adults and in large print. They recommended avoiding the term &#x02018;exercise&#x02019;, which for some had negative connotations stemming from unpleasant experiences of physical education at school.</p><p>Synthesis of these data led to the generation of 18 physical activity-increasing and sedentary behaviour-reducing tips (incorporating aerobic, muscle-strengthening, flexibility and balance exercises), and brief motivational texts outlining the importance of reducing sitting and increasing physical activity in older adulthood, and explaining the habit formation approach. Text and tips were worded in autonomy-supportive language, to foster intrinsic motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Expert panel</title><p>A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to provide feedback on the tips and text. A total of 32 eligible experts, known to the research team, or known to have done relevant work, were invited, of whom 15 agreed to participate, representing sports and exercise science (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), general practice (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), physiotherapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), health psychology (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), geriatrics (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), ageing (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and physiology (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). The experts were invited to comment on the selection, intensity and safety of the tips, and their motivational quality more broadly, and to suggest alternative content. The text was subsequently refined, and the number of tips reduced from 18 to 16.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Second round of focus group and interviews</title><p>Next, a second focus group session (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and individual interviews (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) with the older adult panel canvassed views on the revised intervention content. Discussions addressed feasibility, comprehension, barriers to adherence and suggestions for improvement. These insights informed further refinement of intervention content, reducing the number of tips to ten, which retained coverage of the four physical activity sub-types (aerobic, muscle strengthening, flexibility, balance).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Nominal group ratings</title><p>A postal survey was then conducted, to assess acceptability among an independent sample of inactive and sedentary retired older adults identified and recruited by Age UK. Participants were asked to rate the readability, difficulty, motivation and performance likelihood of each of the ten tips, on a scale of 1 to 4 (1, least positive; 4, most positive), and provide optional free-text feedback. Of 40 surveys distributed, 23 (57.5%) were returned. The tips were judged to be readable (grand mean, 3.4), easy (3.0), motivating (2.8) and likely to be performed (3.0). The motivational text was rated as interesting (3.4) and easy to understand (3.4). A graphic designer was then employed to create a visually attractive intervention booklet, with photos added to clarify some tips.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Preliminary field testing</title><p>The acceptability of the intervention booklet is currently being tested among 25 retired, sedentary and inactive adults aged 60&#x000a0;years and over, living in sheltered accommodation in London. Participants will be guided through the intervention booklet and asked to use it, along with eight 7-day &#x02018;tick sheets&#x02019; to self-monitor adherence to the tips, for eight weeks. Prior to intervention administration, and at 4- and 8-weeks follow-up, participants will complete quantitative measures of habit strength (that is, automaticity of behaviours), levels of sedentary behaviour and physical activity, health and wellbeing. Semistructured interviews at 12-week follow-up will address experiences of using the booklet. We will also examine the feasibility of various outcome measures. Results will inform further refinement of the intervention, as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Exploratory trial</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Study design</title><p>An exploratory two-arm pilot RCT will be undertaken to evaluate the intervention.

Participants will be blinded to condition, but owing to staffing constraints, the researcher administering the intervention will be required to obtain outcome measures, so will be unblinded.

The study pack will contain a study invitation letter, information sheet and business reply envelope. All documents within the pack will feature unique codes that identify the practice and recipient number, permitting calculation of response rates. Both the invitation letter and information sheet will list eligibility criteria for consideration for entry into the study. A tear-off sheet for return to the research team will be provided, so that interested patients can self-report their eligibility, contact details and consent to be contacted further by the research team.</p><p>Those who return the tear-off sheet will be phoned by a research team member, and asked to confirm their age and retirement status. Patients&#x02019; physical capability will be assessed by asking them to confirm that they could comfortably participate for at least 10 consecutive minutes in a set of physical daily activities, chosen to cover stretching, strengthening, balance and aerobic activities, each of which feature in the intervention booklet (for example, walking, housework). Patients will self-report their physical activity and sedentary behaviour over the telephone, using an adapted and validated short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which documents daily activity and sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and measures of time spent in specific sitting-based activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Patients confirmed as eligible will be invited to an appointment with a researcher at the general practice, at which they will provide written consent. Patients will be asked to bring their invitation letter to this session, to allow recording of per practice recruitment rates. A baseline measurement and treatment administration session will be arranged to take place a week later at the participant&#x02019;s home. Recruitment to baseline is due to cease in December 2014, owing to time constraints.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Consent</title><p>Patients will be advised of their right to decline participation, and to withdraw at any time without giving reasons. To allow for analysis of attrition, participants will be informed that, if they do not complete the study, their data will remain within the study for the purposes of follow-up and data analysis, unless they tell us to withdraw their data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Estimated recruitment rates and study duration</title><p>Total patient populations of the target practices vary from 4,500 to 14,000. Based on UK census data, we estimate that 10% of all registered patients at these practices will be aged 60 to 74&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Data from the 2008 Health Survey for England indicate that around half of all people aged 65 to 74&#x000a0;years, and 35 to 40% of those aged 55 to 64&#x000a0;years, self-report an average of 6 or more daily hours of sedentary behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We therefore estimate that 40% of older adults in each practice (4% of all patients) will meet our inactivity and sedentary criteria. We have based our estimates on self-reported data, as these are likely to be conservative; accelerometry data suggest that sedentary time may average 10 to 11&#x000a0;hours per day among adults aged 70&#x000a0;years or above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We estimate a response rate of 30%, and so expect 1% of all patients in each practice to participate, but have allowed for recruitment rates lower than this by using up to seven practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants will be block randomized to study conditions, using a 1:1 allocation ratio, according to a random number list, computer-generated using specialist software by an independent trial administrator. Randomization will occur between the consent session and the first (baseline) home visit. After completing the consent session, the researcher will phone the trial administrator, who will consult the random number list to allocate the participant to a condition. A unique identification code denoting the participant and the participant&#x02019;s general practice will be allocated by the trial administrator, to permit matching of data across time points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Study procedure</title><p>After consenting at the general practice, participants will be fitted with a waterproof accelerometer (activPAL3; PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland) to wear continuously (day and night) for one week. Our preliminary work indicated that participants wished to complete questionnaires in their own time, and so a questionnaire of self-report behaviour, health and wellbeing measures will also be given at this point, for completion over the following week. One week later (that is, baseline), the patient will be visited at home and the accelerometer and questionnaire collected, objective measures taken and the intervention or control treatment administered. Further home visits will be conducted at 7 and 11&#x000a0;weeks post-baseline to fit patients with an accelerometer and give a further questionnaire, and at 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks post-baseline, to collect accelerometers and questionnaires and obtain follow-up objective measures. Participants will be contacted by phone at 4&#x000a0;weeks to arrange the 7-week home visit. Each subsequent visit will be arranged at the previous visit. If a participant is not home for a scheduled visit, the visit will be rearranged by phone where possible. Where participants are not contactable by phone, a maximum of two letters (at 4-day intervals) will be sent to invite them to arrange follow-up home visits. Those who do not respond to the second letter will be treated as having dropped out of the study. Participants will receive a &#x000a3;10 shopping voucher at the baseline, 8-week and 12-week home visits, in recognition of their help in facilitating intervention assessment. They will also receive a further &#x000a3;30 shopping voucher at 12-week follow-up, conditional on having attended all home visits and returned the accelerometer.</p><p>Intervention and control treatments will be delivered to each participant individually by postgraduate or postdoctoral psychology researchers trained in describing the intervention and carrying out all necessary study procedures. Participants will be given and talked through the main messages of the appropriate booklet, and will have the opportunity to ask questions if they do not understand any part of the booklet. Participants will be asked to contact the lead researcher if they lose their booklet, to request that another free copy be sent by post. The active treatment period is 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Intervention</title><p>For clarity, we report the content of our intervention with reference to the behaviour change technique (BCT) Taxonomy v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The intervention booklet comprises text designed to promote motivation to form a habit, planning and self-monitoring to initiate and sustain change, and context-dependent repetition required for a habit to form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The final intervention booklet will be made available on demand from the first author when the trial has ended.</p><p>Motivational text outlines the health detriments of prolonged sitting and the benefits of physical activity (BCT 5.1: &#x02018;Information about health consequences&#x02019;), and suggests reducing sedentary behaviour, either by directly substituting physical activity for existing sitting time (BCT 8.2: &#x02018;Behaviour substitution&#x02019;), or by promoting physical activity as a way of displacing sitting (BCT 4.1: &#x02018;Instruction on how to perform behaviour&#x02019;; BCT 13.2: &#x02018;Framing/reframing&#x02019;). The booklet explains that &#x02018;physical activity&#x02019; refers not only to cardiovascular exercise, but also to stretching, balancing and muscle-strengthening exercises. It also describes and recommends the habit formation approach as a way of ingraining physical activity into daily routines, and provides guidance on how habits form (BCT 8.3: &#x02018;Habit formation&#x02019;).</p><p>Advice on forming habits is provided in the form of ten tips for physical activities that have the potential to displace sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity, and so improve health, wellbeing or functioning, and, if adopted and repeated consistently, lead to physical activity habit formation and disruption of sedentary behaviour habits (BCT 8.4: &#x02018;Habit reversal&#x02019;). The tips follow a template and feature catchy slogans to enhance memorability (for example, &#x02018;take a stand&#x02019;, &#x02018;limber up&#x02019;), brief descriptions of behaviour and the context in which it might best be done (BCT 1.4: &#x02018;Action planning&#x02019;), and, where appropriate, an explanation of how or why it will reduce sedentary behaviour or improve health or wellbeing. Additional &#x02018;handy hints&#x02019; advise on how to move to higher-intensity variants of the recommended activity (BCT 8.7: &#x02018;Graded tasks&#x02019;), or ways to integrate the recommended activities into existing routines. Photos illustrate how to perform some tips (BCT 6.1: &#x02018;Demonstration of behaviour&#x02019;). The booklet is titled &#x02018;On Your Feet to Earn Your Seat&#x02019;, which reflects its recommendation that an empty seat be viewed as a cue to standing (BCT 7.1: &#x02018;Prompts/cues&#x02019;). Readers are encouraged to place the booklet on their favourite chair or on the kitchen table each evening to remind them to use it the following day.</p><p>Volitional support is provided in the form of a tick sheet with which participants can indicate whether they have achieved each of the tips at least once each day (BCT 2.3: &#x02018;Self-monitoring of behaviour&#x02019;; BCT 2.4: &#x02018;Self-monitoring of outcomes of behaviour&#x02019;), and advice on planning how to fit each recommendation into existing routines.</p><p>For those in the intervention group, the 4-week phone call to arrange the 7-week home visit will also provide an opportunity to discuss with a researcher any problems in adhering to the recommendations, or to obtain further motivational support (BCT 3.1: &#x02018;Social support, unspecified&#x02019;; BCT 3.2: &#x02018;Social support, practical&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Control</title><p>Participants allocated to the control condition will receive an existing fact sheet outlining physical activity and sedentary behaviour recommendations for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This represents &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; as a public health strategy for physical activity promotion among UK older adults.

The study has been approved by an NHS Research Ethics Committee (reference 13/LO/1549).

The committee comprises experts in health services research, sports and exercise science, clinical trials, and general practice, and includes a lay older adult representative. The committee has approved all study procedures described in this protocol, and will meet once during the trial period to review progress and audit trial conduct, and once following cessation of the trial to review results. A copy of the study findings will be submitted to the steering committee for approval prior to submission for dissemination.

Our study will assess the feasibility of evaluating an intervention for older adults that seeks to displace periods of prolonged sedentary behaviour with physical activity. Our intervention represents a &#x02018;small changes&#x02019; approach, recommending forms of physical activity that can be performed at low intensity, and it uses principles of habit formation to promote the automatization and integration of these actions into everyday routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The intervention has been iteratively developed using empirical evidence of older adults&#x02019; activity preferences, verified as appropriate by a panel of experts. The intervention is theory-based, and the activities recommended in the tips are evidence-based, in that they have been shown to improve health and functioning outcomes. The RCT will compare our intervention booklet with a fact sheet that is readily available to older adults and that recommends physical activity and minimizing sedentary behaviour, but offers few suggestions of how this might be achieved. This exploratory RCT aims to test study procedures ahead of a future, fully-powered definitive RCT, but the collection of data on behaviour, habit, health, wellbeing at baseline and two follow-up points permits analysis of changes in these indices.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of our study design. Selection bias may impact findings. Enrolment into the study requires that patients return a declaration of interest by regular post, and attend their general practice to be consented. Older adults who leave the house more often tend to accrue more physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and so these procedures favour those at the more active end of the inactivity spectrum, rather than the highly inactive and sedentary older adults who might benefit most from intervention. Taking consent at the practice was judged necessary to garner interest among practices, which receive financial incentives for consenting on the premises. We have attempted to minimize participant burden by conducting all post-recruitment procedures at participants&#x02019; homes, and offering shopping vouchers to recognise their efforts.</p><p>The intervention is designed to promote behaviour maintenance via habit formation, and it could be argued that the 12-week follow-up period is insufficient for maintenance to be observed. Habit strength has been shown to peak among individuals pursuing physical activity goals after an average of 90&#x000a0;days of daily repetition, six days longer than our follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the habit growth curve is typically asymptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and so notable gains in habit strength can be expected within our study time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. While we cannot observe long-term behaviour maintenance, evaluation of the &#x02018;Ten Top Tips&#x02019; intervention, on which our intervention is based, has shown that individuals who formed habits tended to exhibit greater weight loss at six-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>A secondary aim of the trial is to conduct tests of effects on behavioural and health outcomes, but our two-arm design makes it difficult to identify effects or sources of effects. Should no between-group differences be found, it will be unclear whether true intervention effects have been suppressed because the control treatment has a similar impact to the intervention, or because neither is effective. Should the intervention show greater impact on secondary outcomes than the control, we will be unable to reliably identify the &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of the intervention. Although we will estimate the contribution of habit formation by assessing correlations between gains in habit and behaviour, this analysis will not definitively establish whether habit formation is responsible for behaviour change. Habit formation has been documented in trials of interventions that neither explicitly promoted context-dependent repetition, nor explained the habit formation process to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A third arm, with a matched non-habit-based version of our intervention leaflet, is needed to isolate effects of habit-based advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of trialling our intervention. Should the trial appear feasible, and the intervention leaflet show promise in modifying sitting and physical activity, a definitive large-scale trial conducted over a longer-term period with multiple arms will help to shed light on effects and their likely causes. At this stage in the intervention development process, a pragmatic RCT offers the most logical first step.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Trial status</title><p>The proposed trial has not yet begun.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>This study is listed on the ISRCTN Register, and has been approved by a research ethics committee, under the title &#x02018;Increasing physical activity in older adults&#x02019;. The title deviates from that of this manuscript because our preliminary work suggested that the target population better understands the term &#x02018;physical activity&#x02019; than &#x02018;sedentary behaviour&#x02019;. We do not view this discrepancy as problematic because, given that standing is a form of physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviour necessarily involves increasing physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Authors&#x02019; information</title><p>BJJ is funded by a National Institute for Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship (2010-03-023).
