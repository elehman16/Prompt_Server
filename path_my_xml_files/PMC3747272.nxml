Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is postulated to be a chronic stress biomarker. However, no studies have tracked IL-8 over several shifts or used it for monitoring short-term residual stress. The IL-8 response to the shifts may also increase with age. Conveniently, IL-8 can be measured non-intrusively from urine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a shifts-randomized trial comparing 17 emergency physicians&#x02019; urinary IL-8 levels during a 24 hS, a 14 hS, and a control day (clerical work on return from leave). Mean levels of IL-8 were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Independent associations of key factors including shifts, stress, and age with IL-8 levels were further assessed in a multivariable generalized estimating equations model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean urinary IL-8 levels almost doubled during and after a 24 hS compared with a 14 hS or a control day. Furthermore, IL-8 levels failed to return to control values at the end of the third day after the shift despite a rest day following the 24 hS. In the multivariable model, engaging in a 24 hS, self-reported stress, and age were independently associated with higher IL-8 levels. A 24 hS significantly increased IL-8 levels by 1.9 ng (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.007). Similarly, for every unit increase in self-reported stress, there was a 0.11 ng increase in IL-8 levels (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.003); and for every one year advance in age of physicians, IL-8 levels also increased by 0.11 ng (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.018).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The 24 hS generated a prolonged response of the immune system. Urinary IL-8 was a strong biomarker of stress under intensive and prolonged demands, both acutely and over time. Because elevated IL-8 levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and negative psychological consequences, we suggest that emergency physicians limit their exposure to 24 hS, especially with advancing age.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Work on this manuscript was supported by the ASMUC (Association des M&#x000e9;decins des Urgences de Clermont-Ferrand &#x02013; Association of Emergency physicians from Clermont-Ferrand), University Hospital CHU G.

Shift work is also a fundamental component of emergency medicine, and is associated with chronic stress, including stress at work. Consequently, stress may lead to symptoms of mental exhaustion, physical fatigue, detachment from work, and feelings of diminished competence <xref rid="pone.0071658-Lindeberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Emergency physicians (EPs) are exposed to a complex interplay between stress (life-and-death emergencies &#x02013; a defining characteristic of their job), sleep deprivation, and fatigue due to repeated changes in, and duration of shifts <xref rid="pone.0071658-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Work-related exhaustion can lead to various physical and psychological symptoms, and also may be associated with delayed decision-making <xref rid="pone.0071658-Riad1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The combined effects of stress and fatigue can impact on job performance, often resulting in otherwise preventable medical errors <xref rid="pone.0071658-Tully1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, prolonged stress may expose EPs to a higher risk of multiple diseases <xref rid="pone.0071658-MooreEde1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Siebenaler1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, predominantly systemic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0071658-Elenkov1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0071658-Proietti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Further, IL-8 was postulated to be a chronic stress biomarker in shift work nurses from an acute care department <xref rid="pone.0071658-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although the prolonged immune response of IL-8 to stress has not been studied, some cytokines have been reported to require as many as five days to return to basal levels following a stressful event <xref rid="pone.0071658-Santos1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Similar to most of the cytokines, IL-8 is mainly produced by macrophages <xref rid="pone.0071658-Dunston1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. With advancing age, macrophages remain activated for longer and respond to multiple stimuli <xref rid="pone.0071658-Dunston1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, IL-8 has recently shown links to high physical demands <xref rid="pone.0071658-Fukuda2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Lastly, studies showing links between sleep and immune responses consistently involve artificially induced sleep deprivation protocols <xref rid="pone.0071658-Everson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Irwin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Hirotsu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, no studies have tracked IL-8 over several shifts nor explored its potential for monitoring short-term residual stress, and possible links with advancing age. Furthermore, no trial has assessed the role of IL-8 in a natural model of sleep deprivation induced by work. Conveniently, IL-8 can be measured from urine, non-intrusively and pain-free.</p><p>Prior to this study, using a visual analog scale (VAS), senior EPs subjectively reported a greater accumulation of stress, fatigue and more acute feelings of inefficiency during a 24-hour shift (24 hS) compared with a 14-hour night shift (14 hS), with an impact lasting several days <xref rid="pone.0071658-Dutheil1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. From these observations, we hypothesized that 1) IL-8 levels will be a relevant biomarker of stress and fatigue, sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between two durations of night shifts, 2) IL-8 will be involved in a prolonged response, 3) IL-8 levels in response to shifts will increase with advancing age, 4) IL-8 will identify stressful events surrounding the shifts, and 5) sleep deprivation related to the shifts will exacerbate the IL-8 levels of EPs.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of 14 hS and 24 hS on urinary IL-8 levels of EPs taking part in the JOBSTRESS trial (Biomarkers of Job Stress: a Randomized Trial among Senior Emergency Physicians) and to investigate the independent associations between stress, fatigue, age, sleep deprivation and workload, and urinary IL-8 levels. We also assessed urinary IL-8 levels three days after shift completion to identify prolonged effects of a preceding shift on the immune function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited both men and women to best represent the whole team of the emergency department of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, France.

Exclusion criteria were: endocrine disease, pregnancy, recent extraprofessional life stress event (such as death of a near relative, divorce), any current illness, medications used to modulate inflammatory diseases (corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory drugs), or any medications with a chronotropic effect taken over the previous six months (beta blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, anxiolytics or antidepressants). We did not exclude non-menopausal women because, to our knowledge, no data have described a link between the menstrual cycle and IL-8.

Prior to a 14 hS, EPs are at home from 8.30 until 18.30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071658-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To respect their usual routine they were given no particular instructions and were free to do physical activity, take a nap, or other domestic/leisure tasks before commencing the shift. Each shift was followed by a rest day (day 2; D2), as required by French legislation after night work, and by a day of clerical work (day 3; D3). The clerical work day, during which the physicians had no contact with patients, refers to a variety of medical office and administrative support duties including coding recent medical procedures, reading medical images, interpreting patient&#x02019;s blood sample results, improving skills of students with full-body mannequins that can simulate real-life medical conditions or emergencies, preparing lessons to teach medical students, drafting manuscripts. The clerical work day was added to EPs&#x02019; schedule to avoid bias and permit comparisons only of the effects of 24 hS versus 14 hS on IL-8. Finally, each shift was compared with a control day (CD). The control day was standardized to be a clerical work day (8.30&#x02013;18.30) after returning from at least 8 days of holiday, without jet lag. On this day, they were asked to avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages and to abstain from heavy physical activity.</p><fig id="pone-0071658-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0071658.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental protocol: three days of follow-up after each type of shift compare with a control day.</title><p>IL-8: Interleukine-8.

Interestingly in our study, physical and mental fatigue remained higher after 24 hS than on the control day. The discrepancy on IL-8 levels between the following days of the two shifts, suggests that IL-8 levels may be not only an appropriate chronic biomarker for evaluating the duration of stress effects on humans but also a sensitive marker for discriminating the level of chronic stress and/or the ability to recover after stress among populations subjected to intense demands.

Our results may possibly link to the increased morbidity observed in subsequent patients when cardiac surgeons are confronted with a patient&#x02019;s death in emergency surgery <xref rid="pone.0071658-Goldstone1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The potential for residual effects after life-and-death events in emergency departments need to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>IL-8 is a Marker of Stress and Sleep Deprivation</title><p>Again within the limited results of correlations, we report the link between sleep deprivation and IL-8 levels. These findings support previous studies demonstrating that sleep deprivation also exacerbates other pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion <xref rid="pone.0071658-Everson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Shearer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Irwin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071658-Hirotsu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> or high sensitivity CRP <xref rid="pone.0071658-MeierEwert1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Thus, we speculate that elevated IL-8 levels observed during and following the shifts were linked to sleep deprivation that were exacerbated by the additional work stressors such as life-and-death emergencies. Moreover, the duration of stress could play a major role because we observed an increase in IL-8 levels only after 24 hours of uninterrupted work, which is a common occupational exposure for EPs in some hospitals. Poor sleep can influence inflammatory cytokines and when elevated, these same cytokines can negatively impact on sleep <xref rid="pone.0071658-Motivala1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This is supported by our results showing that elevated IL-8 levels during shifts were associated with poor sleeping patterns the days following shifts. Chronic sleep deprivation increases inflammation and perturbs the circadian clock which in turn, increases susceptibility to diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cancer <xref rid="pone.0071658-Narasimamurthy1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0071658-MeierEwert1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Many EPs are rostered to a 24 hS at least once a week throughout their working lives and our study profiles one shift having prolonged effects on the immune system. Therefore, we propose that more EPs should share the night shifts which may lowered their stress and permit more sleep. This could be investigated in a future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strengths of the present study include: randomized order of the shifts, a run-in design, participants being their own control, adequate statistical power to support the primary hypothesis, factors modifying IL-8 were identified, workload was assessed objectively and subjectively, and the innovation in being the first study to compare two types of night work and following participants into the recovery period.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study: external validity may not extend to emergency departments that have less intensive workloads (48 000 entries per year, 30% hospitalized, for 16 full-time equivalent EPs, 52 nurses, with 14 available beds), and may also lack some external validity because of the data profiles only one emergency department. Duties and shifts of emergency physicians may vary internationally but systemic responses to life-and-death emergencies remain under researched. Our results provide opportunities to generate a number of hypotheses for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, urinary IL-8 is a convenient and non invasive strong biomarker of stress, both acutely and over time. IL-8 was highest during 24-hour shifts. Moreover, the 24-hour shifts were also involved in a prolonged response of the immune system, with increased IL-8 levels at least three days after the shift. Finally, IL-8 secretion in response to 24-hour shifts also increased with advancing age of physicians. Since elevated IL-8 levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and negative psychological consequences, we suggest that emergency physicians limit their exposure to 24 hS, especially with older age.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all emergency physicians of the department of the emergency ward of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, France, who participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0071658-Schneider1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
