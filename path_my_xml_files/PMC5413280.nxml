LASIK was improved in the past few years, but myopic regression was inevitable. Chen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> reported that the rate of myopic regression was 21% in average-risk eyes. Although the exact mechanism of refractive regression after LASIK is unclear, previous studies have suggested a forward shift of the cornea as 1 possible explanation of myopic regression.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Currently, the treatment for visually significant myopic regression after LASIK was repeat LASIK that includes lifting the flap, cutting a new flap, or surface ablation.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The 3 procedures all have potential risks such as epithelial ingrowth, and so on.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our 2006 study<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> indicated that lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) preoperatively and postoperatively may be an effective way to prevent myopic regression and iatrogenic keratectasia after LASIK. Studies have reported a relationship between the elevation of IOP and corneal protrusion.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Increasing attention is now being paid to nonsurgical approaches to treat small amounts of myopic regression. In 2008, Kamiya et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that topical application of an IOP-lowering eye drop was effective for the correction of myopic regression that presumably resulted from the backward movement of the cornea and the flattening of its curvature after LASIK. Although the refractive effect of this treatment is mild (approximately 0.5 diopters [D]), it has advantages over enhancement ablation because it seems to be less invasive and to cause fewer side effects (e.g., keratectasia) in light of the biomechanical stability of the cornea. Many questions still remain, however, regarding the topical application of IOP-lowering drops to treat myopic regression after LASIK.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Timolol (Wuhan Pharmaceutical Limited-liability Company, Wuchang, Wuhan, China) 0.5% eye drops, a nonselective B-blocker, are used most commonly in China in patients with glaucoma. Timolol reduces IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production. As IOP-lowering eye drops have been proven to be effective for the correction of myopic regression after LASIK,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> our study considered 2 issues: what happens to the myopic regression when the application of the IOP-lowering eye drops is stopped? and what factors influence the effectiveness of IOP-lowering eye drops for the correction of myopic regression after LASIK?</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Continuous variables were expressed as mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation</title><p>Sixty-two eyes of 62 patients (30 males and 32 females) with myopic regression of &#x02212;1.18&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.86&#x0200a;D (range &#x02212;0.5 to &#x02212;6.63&#x0200a;D) after myopic LASIK from May 2012 to May 2014 were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Inclusion criteria before and after LASIK were age of patients 19 years or more, patients not wearing contact lens 4 weeks before the surgery, eyes with an IOP ranging from 10 to 20&#x0200a;mm Hg measured by a Goldmann applanation tonometer (YZ30; Suzhou Medical Instrument General Factory, Suzhou, China) and absence of a glaucoma, eyes with normal peripheral retina, and eyes with stable refractive error at least 12 months before surgery. Exclusion criteria before and after LASIK were presence of keratoconus or keratoconus suspect determined on the basis of the corneal topography using a WaveLight Allegro Topolyzer (Lumenis, Dreieich, Germany), eyes with central islands, eyes with active inflammation, eyes with Schirmer test less than 5.0&#x0200a;mm, eyes with a minimum residual untreated posterior corneal thickness of 250&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m, and patients with history of ocular trauma. All patients had bilateral LASIK. In order to obviate intereye correlation, only 1 eye of a patient was included.</p><p>Informed consents were obtained from all patients after explaining the nature and possible outcomes of the study. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study followed the guidelines required by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Peking University Third Hospital.</p><p>LASIK was performed using an excimer laser system (Allegretto Eye-Q; WaveLight, Erlangen, Germany). An automated M2 90 microkeratome (Moria, Antony, France) was used to create a 120- to 150-&#x003bc;m-thick superior hinge flap measuring 9&#x0200a;mm in diameter. The ablation zone diameter was 6.0 or 6.5&#x0200a;mm. In all eyes, the preoperative manifest refraction was selected as the target myopic correction.</p><p>Patients were examined regularly at the preoperative and postoperative visits (first day, first week, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after LASIK). Patients were also examined timely when complains of decreased vision acuity occurred. Myopic regression was defined as myopic shift of 0.5&#x0200a;D or greater in manifest refraction from the first postoperative month after LASIK.</p><p>A total of 62 eyes were randomly assigned into either Group 1 (32 eyes) or Group 2 (30 eyes). Group 1 (32 eyes) included patients who received Timolol 0.5% eye drops twice daily for 3 months; Group 2 (30 eyes) included patients who received artificial tears (Systane Ultra; Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas) in the same manner as that in Group 1. The administration of eye drops was started 7.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.8 months (range 1&#x02013;21 months) after LASIK. The patients were followed for an additional 2 months after cessation of eye drops.</p><p>Before treatment with eye drops (pretreatment), after the treatment with eye drops for 3 months (during treatment), and 2 months after cessation of eye drops (posttreatment), we performed the following examinations: logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), logMAR of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), and IOP with a Goldmann applanation tonometer. The corneal refractive power (RP) and central corneal thickness (CCT) were obtained with the Pentacam system (Oculus Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). We used the correction algorithms<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> to estimate the true IOP after LASIK (Kohlhaas, IOPT&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;IOPG&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;23.28&#x0200a;&#x02212;&#x0200a;0.0423&#x0200a;CCT; IOPT = true intraocular pressure [mm Hg], IOPG = Goldmann applanation tonometric IOP [mm Hg]).</p><p>We used one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to compare the values within groups in different times and independent samples <italic>t</italic> test to compare the results between the 2 groups.

These data indicated that Timolol might be effective for the correction of myopic regression when a 0.5-D or greater myopic shift was detected after LASIK in patients regardless of age, gender, PSE, or anytime we started the treatment only if regression happened.</p><p>In 12 (37.5%) of 32 eyes, however, the twice-daily administration of Timolol was not effective for the correction of refractive regression, although there was some lowering effect of the IOP in all eyes. The reasons may be as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>The IOPT may not be low enough for those noneffective eyes. We combined the use of the IOPT-lowering drug Brimonidine (Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland) (a highly selective a2 adrenergic receptor agonist) with Timolol and gained a higher effective rate (data not shown). A recent study showed that Brimonidine has a significant miotic effect on pupil size.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> The application of this agent 20 minutes before activities in dimly lit areas or at night may be recommended for photic phenomena following refractive surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> We are currently conducting a study to compare the results of Timolol, Brimonidine, and the combination use of Timolol with Brimonidine for the correction of myopic regression after LASIK. Not all antiglaucoma drugs, however, may contribute to an improvement in myopic regression after keratorefractive surgery. An antiglaucoma medication subcategory, the prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; analogs (PGAs), may offer the opposite effect in this regard. Topical application of PGAs after refractive surgeries such as LASIK may significantly reduce the CCT, as a result of prostaglandin F2&#x003b1;-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and subsequent effects on the extracellular matrix of the corneal stroma.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> These effects eventually may weaken the formerly destabilized cornea and subsequently may lead to progressive myopic regression, ectasia,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> or both. But the topical application of Timolol in this study did not show any effect on reducing the CCT.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Refractive effects may not depend simply on the degree of IOP reduction. A higher IOP may be one of the main causative factors for structurally compromised corneas after LASIK.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Hence, we assumed that IOP-lowering drugs may be highly effective for regression primarily caused by corneal geometrical changes.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> But many other factors such as epithelial hyperplasia, development of new stromal collagen, and nuclear sclerosis of the lens may sometimes play significant roles in myopic regression.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> If biomechanical properties of the cornea are still strong or normal after LASIK, or if the corneal wound healing has been stabilized, this treatment may be less effective. Further studies are required to clarify this point.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Hiatt et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> indicated that biomechanical remodeling of the cornea had not been completed even 10 months after the application of IOP-lowering drugs. Epithelial hyperplasia after LASIK may be a natural defense mechanism in which keratocytes respond to corneal trauma and function to reconstruct and preserve the original structure and conformation of the corneal tissue. The return to normal epithelial thickness may take months or even years, and the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been characterized.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> As a result of this corneal mechanism, even though IOP is maintained in the regular range, the corneal biomechanical strength against IOP continues to change. The counteraction between the corneal biomechanical strength and the IOP is a long-term dynamic cross-action. Because it is unclear when the biomechanical properties of the cornea have stabilized, it is also unknown how long this treatment needs to be continued. If the IOP reduction has effect on the refraction, the patients need the antiglaucoma drugs continuously.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> However, there are potential side effects in long-term use of antiglaucoma medication. Long-term use may induce changes in the tear film, cornea, and conjunctival surface and the risk of serious cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Fortunately, all patients were younger than 45 years in patients with LASIK, and so Timolol-related systematic side effects seldom occurred in this group.</p><p>The Goldmann applanation tonometer, the most widely used method of measuring intraocular pressure, is the current gold standard. However, a number of corneal parameters can affect the accuracy of this instrument. Previous studies have proven that intraocular pressure measurements after LASIK for the correction of myopia can always be underestimated.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Kohlhaas et al<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> study indicated that CCT, corneal curvature, and corneal flap stability affect the accuracy of intraocular pressure measurements after LASIK. We used the Kohlhaas correction algorithms to estimate the true IOP after LASIK.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated in this study that when we started the twice-daily administration of Timolol 0.5% at 1 to 21 months (7.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.8 months) after LASIK for 3 months, it was effective for the correction of refractive regression of &#x02212;1.18&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.86&#x0200a;D (range &#x02212;0.5 to &#x02212;6.63&#x0200a;D). But the myopic regression recurred 2 months after cessation of the application. To improve the safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability of LASIK, the intervention of the IOP-lowering drugs, a medical alternative for modulating refractive results after surgery, may be considered. However, there are still many questions remaining regarding the therapeutic use of IOP-lowering eye drugs, and the rational administration for long-term use, the combination use, and the preventive use of IOP-lowering drugs for the correction of myopic regression after LASIK requires further investigation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviation: LASIK = laser in situ keratomileusis.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30872813); National Natural Science Foundation of China (81570813); the LinHu Scientific Research Foundation of Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital; the Scientific Research Foundation for the Excellent Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Peking University Third Hospital; and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YI</given-names></name><name><surname>Chien</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
