pressure biofeedback unit on different bases on the thickness of trunk and abdominal
muscles, and lumbar stability. [Subjects] Thirty healthy young adults (2 males, 28
females) took part in this study. The subjects were randomly and equally assigned to a
stable bridge exercise group and an unstable bridge exercise group. [Methods] The subjects
performed bridge exercises using an abdominal drawing-in method on a stable base and on an
unstable base, and changes in their abdominal muscle thickness and on the stable and on
unstable bases lumbar stability were evaluated. [Results] After the intervention, the
stable bridge exercise group showed a statistically significantly increased muscle
thickness in the transversus abdominis, and the unstable bridge exercise group showed
significantly increased muscle thicknesses of the transversus abdominis and internal
obliques in static and dynamic lumbar stability. The unstable bridge exercise group showed
significant increase after performing the exercise. [Conclusion] Lumbar stability
exercise, with the compensation of the lumbar spine minimized, using an abdominal
drawing-in method on an unstable support of base is effective and efforts to prevent the
compensation may induce a greater exercise effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Abdominal drawing-in method</kwd><kwd>Transversus abdominis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with lumbar pain have greater atrophy of the deep trunk muscles than healthy
subjects and they also have weakened proprioceptive senses, which trigger spinal
instability, which in turn becomes the cause of recurrent lumbar pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stability is a prerequisite element that enables
movement of the limbs by maintaining the spine upright in postural changes and under
loading<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscles that contribute to
lumbar stability include the transversus abdominis, and the internal, and external obliques
of the abdomen, quadratus lumbrum and multifidus of the trunk posterior region, and the
pelvic floor muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the multifidus and the transversus abdominis are
activated faster than the other muscles when the human body moves, adjusting trunk balance,
and the bilateral internal obliques are important for maintaining the lateral stability of
the spine and spinal bending ability.</p><p>Various lumbar stability exercises have been used to maintain and improve lumbar stability
through isometric contraction of the abdomen and the lumbar region. Bridge exercise, one of
lumbar spine exercises, is a closed kinetic chain, weight bearing exercise, which induces
contraction of the multifidus and transversus abdominis. It also improves the coordination
of the large muscles of the body surface surrounding the trunk, and is effective at
recovering adjustment capabilities of the trunk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, excessive lumbar lordosis
may occur due to compensation during bridge exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abdominal drawing-in contracts the transversus abdominis and the
internal obliques and induces concurrent contraction of the muscles during lumbar stability
exercise, reducing excessive lumbar lordosis or pelvic anterior tilt that may occur during
bridge exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent research concerning lumbar stability exercise has used equipment such as an unstable
base, a balance plate, a ball for treatment, and a sponge pad. O&#x02019;Sullivan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that performing stabilization
exercises in a dynamic environment, for example, using a ball for treatment rather than a
static environment, maximized balance ability. Page<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup> also observed that exercise using an unstable device was effective
for postural control and recovery of the somatic senses.</p><p>Previous studies compared trunk stability using an abdominal drawing-in method during
bridge exercise or compared trunk stability and muscle activity using bridge exercise on an
unstable base of support. However, research that compares lumbar stability and the thickness
of abdominal muscles by conducting bridging exercise with an abdominal drawing-in method on
stable and unstable bases of support has been lacking. Accordingly, this study of support
examined the effects of the abdominal drawing-in bridge exercise using a pressure
biofeedback device on different bases on the thickness of trunk and abdominal muscles and
lumbar stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty young adults (2 males, 28 females) were recruited for this study. Subjects were
randomly and equally assigned to a stable bridge exercise group (SBEG) (1 male, 14 female)
and an unstable bridge exercise group (UBEG) (1 male, 14 females). Those who had problems
with muscles, the skeletal system, or the nervous system or had pain in the lumbus or the
pelvis during ordinary activities, or could not performt bridge exercise because they had
pain in the knees or ankles were excluded. The intent of this study and the content of the
entire experiment were sufficiently explained to the subjects and voluntary consent was to
participation was received from them. The mean&#x000b1;SD age, height, and weight of the SBEG were
respectively 19.87&#x000b1;0.35&#x02005;years, 162.84&#x000b1;6.62&#x02005;cm, and 58.34&#x000b1;9.36&#x02005;kg, and the mean&#x000b1;SD age,
height, and weight of the UBEG were respectively 20.62&#x000b1;0.42&#x02005;years, 162.74&#x000b1;4.85&#x02005;cm, and
57.37&#x000b1;9.73&#x02005;kg. Analysis of gender was made with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, and that of age,
height, and weight was conducted with the independent t-test. There were no statistically
significant differences between the two groups were considered homogenous.</p><p>The subjects performed a bridge exercise using an abdominal drawing-in method on a stable
base and an unstable base. In order to provide an unstable base for the bridge exercise
using an abdominal drawing-in method of an Airex Balance Pad (Alcan-Airex AG, Sins,
Switzerland) with a width of 50&#x02005;cm, length of 41&#x02005;cm, and height 6&#x02005;cm was used. For the
starting position of the bridge exercise, the subjects opened both arms to form an angle of
about 30 degrees, with the knee joints bent at 90 degrees, and placed the palms on the base.
Then with the knees and feet shoulder width, they placed the soles of the feet on the ground
in parallel. The head and the neck were maintained straight with the eyes looking at the
ceiling. The subjects held up the pelvis according to the tester struction of &#x0201c;hold up the
buttocks&#x0201d; and maintained the posture for 15 seconds (contraction) according to the tester
instruction of &#x0201c;maintain the position&#x0201d; and lowered the pelvis to the ground for 5 seconds
(relaxation) according to the tester instruction of &#x0201c;place down&#x0201d;. At this moment the tester
directed the subjects to draw in the navel in the upper posterior direction (lumbar
direction) so that the abdominal area slightly subsided. Ten repetitions of this process
were considered one set and a total of six sets were conducted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study employed ultrasonic diagnostic equipment (MysonoU5, Samsung Medison, Korea) in
order to examine changes in the thicknesses of the trunk and abdominal muscles prior to and
after the bridge exercise using an abdominal drawing-in method. A 12&#x02005;MHz linear probe was
used and the measured area was marked during the first measurement in order to measure the
same position. One tester experienced in measuring ultrasonic images conducted the
measurements.</p><p>The subjects relaxed the abdominal area and comfortably lay in a supine position on the
testing board. The probe was transversely placed on the top of the iliac chest, and moved
toward the center of abdomen. The probe was stopped where all of the external obliques,
internal obliques, and transversus abdominis were visible. The thickness of the internal
obliques and transversus abdominis was measured at a point 13&#x02005;mm moved distal from the
region where the fascias of the muscles met<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the measurement of the multifidus, the subject lay comfortably
in the prone position, and the probe was placed perpendicularly on the left transverse
process of the fourth lumbar spine. The thickness from the left transverse process to the
surface muscles was measured<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
subjects were instructed to abstain from talking, laughing, or chewing during the data
collection period and all images were captured and measured at maximal inspiration.</p><p>In order to evaluate static and dynamic lumbar stability prior to and after the bridge
exercise using an abdominal drawing-in method, contractibility of the transversus abdominis
was measured using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) (Stabilizer, Chattanooga Group Inc.,
Hixson, USA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PBU is an inelastic
16.7&#x000d7;24.0&#x02005;cm sack that can be inflated is connected to a pressure gauge, and excessive
changes in PBU pressure show that movement of the lumbar pelvic area is not being adjusted.
For the measurement of static lumbar stability (SLS), subjects lay in the prone position on
hard ground and the PBU was placed below the navel at the midpoint between the bilateral
anterior superior iliac spines. At a PBU baseline pressure of 70 mmHg, the subject pulled in
their abdomen as maximally as possible for 10 seconds without moving the lumbus or hip
joint, relieving pressure in the PBU. Then, the change in the PBU was measured and recorded.
For the measurement of dynamic lumbar stability (DLS), the subjects lay in the supine
position. At a PBU was placed 2&#x02005;cm below the posterior superior iliac spine vertically from
the lumbar spine. With the baseline pressure of 40 mmHg, the hip and knee joints of one leg
were bent and the foot was placed on the ground and the hip joint was abducted to about 45
degrees. The changes in PBU were measured and recorded when the subject returned to the
starting position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to minimize
the sway of the trunk during measurement, folded towels were placed on both sides of the
PBU.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis of the
data. The independent t-test was conducted in order to compare the general characteristics
of the two groups, and the paired t-test was performed in order to compare the muscle
thickness and lumbar stability of each group between prior to and after the exercise of each
group. The independent t-test was used in order to compare muscle thickness and lumbar
stability between the groups prior to and after the exercise. The significance level was
chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of Tra, IO, Multifidus, SLS and DLS between pre- and post-intervention

stable and unstable bases of support on the thicknesses of lumbar and abdominal muscles and
lumbar stability.</p><p>The purpose of spinal stability exercise is to protect spinal joints from repetitive
micro-damage caused by the muscles around the spine, pain from spinal instability, and
degenerative spinal changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
abdominal drawing-in method is effective at activating abdominal muscles, in particular, the
transversus abdominis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Susan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that ultrasonography of the
transversus abdominis showed activation of the muscle after abdominal drawing-in exercise.
Stevens et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that bridging
exercise with the lumbar spine in the neutral position increased activity of the abdominal
muscles, but did not significantly increase activity of the multifidus. This result is
consistent with those of the present study which the thickness of the transversus abdominis
significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) when the bridge exercise using an abdominal drawing-in
method was performed on different bases. On the other hand, the changes in the thickness of
the multifidus were not statistically significant. We consider this is because compensation
bridge exercise using the abdominal drawing-in method increased activity of the abdominal
muscles and minimizes substitutions, such as through increased lumbar lordosis, relatively
reducing action by erector spinae muscles such as the multifidus.</p><p>Cholewicki and McGill<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that
stability indexes of the lumbar spine during performance of different tasks were higher in
tasks that placed a lot of load on the lumbar spine. When instability in the base of support
increases, more muscles for stability and balance maintenance, and more load on the lumbar
spine increases muscle contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This result is consistent with those of the present study in which bridge exercise on the
unstable base significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) dynamic and static lumbar stability
relative to bridge exercise on the unstable base. Adjusting the degree of difficulty of the
bridge exercise on the unstable base, inducing greater trunk muscle activity, and improving
lumbar stability may have resulted in a better exercise effect than exercise on the stable
base of support.</p><p>Lumbar pain triggers fast contraction of the abdominal muscles and impairs muscle function,
and compared to healthy subjects, lumbar pain patients&#x02019; muscle recruitment patterns are
modified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> resulting in instability
between spinal segments. Therefore, in clinical treatment of lumbar pain patients,
conducting lumbar stability exercise using an abdominal drawing-in method minimizing
compensation by the lumbar spine, should be effective at increasing muscle strength and the
spinal instability of the lumbar region. Also efforts to prevent compensation should result
in greater exercise effect.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnett</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Floyd</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: Lumbar repositioning deficit in a specific low back pain population.
