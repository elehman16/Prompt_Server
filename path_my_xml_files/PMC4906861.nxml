Often managing anxious children is arduous, and in some cases even unattainable by these methods. Pharmacological methods have been used as an addendum to augment child cooperativeness and provide quality dental care.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The primary aim of pharmacological sedation in pedodontics is to transform the patient's behavior to a level that allows employing behavior management techniques.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Oral administration is established as efficacious, economic, and convenient among all routes of conscious sedation (CS). Intranasal administration of the drugs is well tolerated by children, effective and fast acting as this site is highly vascularized and very permeable for drug administration, ensuring rapid absorption into systemic circulation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Midazolam is a 1, 4-benzodiazepine derivative with a unique chemical structure and depending on environmental pH, the drug can produce highly water-soluble salts (pH &#x0003c; 4) or exist in lipophilic diazepine ring-closed form (pH &#x0003e; 4). It has been attributed several beneficial effects such as good cardiovascular stability,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] anxiolysis, amnesia, and rapid onset of sedation; however, adverse postoperative behavior changes, hiccups, and paradoxical reactions have also been observed.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative and provides dissociative sedation associated with an analgesic effect by blocking n-methyl d-aspartate receptors. The association of ketamine with benzodiazepines might attenuate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In general pediatrics, studies have reported that premedication regimens that combined the anxiolytic effect of midazolam and the analgesic property of ketamine resulted in better pediatric behavior than the use of these drugs alone.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a potent, highly selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Activation of these receptors in the central nervous system leads to inhibition of sympathetic activity, which causes a reduction in blood pressure and heart rate, sedation, and anxiolysis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It produces dose-dependent milder analgesia without respiratory depression [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and sedation induced by dexmedetomidine is characterized by an easy and quick arousal resembling natural sleep. Dexmedetomidine has been extensively investigated in the pediatric population, and various studies support dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic and sedative adjunct in children.</p><p>Although much research has been conducted on different sedation methods in children, a &#x0201c;golden&#x0201d; combination of sedation drugs has yet to be discovered.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The present randomized, double&#x02013;blinded, controlled study was conducted to evaluate and compare oral midazolam&#x02013;ketamine combination drug and intranasal dexmedetomidine for their sedative properties, safety profile, and ease of treatment completion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials And Methods</title><p>The study consisted of patients in the age group 3&#x02013;9 years, requiring dental treatment (extractions, pulpectomy, and restorations) exhibiting negative behavior according to Frankl's behavior rating scale in their first visit attending the outpatient Department of Paediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Himachal Pradesh Government Dental College and Hospital, Shimla. A prior ethical approval was obtained from the Institute's Ethical Committee.

After 30 min, oral drug/placebo was mixed with mango juice and was given to patient to drink in a disposable cup.

Similarly, sedation level and behavior score were also assessed after every 15 min by the evaluators using modified observer assessment of alertness and sedation (MOAAS) scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] All the treatment steps were performed by a single experienced pediatric dentist, who was blinded to the study design and who gave the ease of treatment completion score using Houpt scale [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

These results are in accordance with studies by Akin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Yuen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Most of these studies reported greater decrease in heart rate 14&#x02013;27%. This mild decrease in our study may be due to the different nature of procedures. In these studies, dexmedetomidine was tested as a premedication before induction of anesthesia, whereas in the present study, the environment of the dental treatment and continuous oral stimulation makes the child more alert.</p><p>In the present study, dexmedetomidine resulted in profound sedation with mean sedation score of 3.46 during the treatment and 3.62 at the end of treatment, as compared to baseline mean sedation score of 6. Sedation level was statistically significant when compared to the control group during treatment and end of the treatment. This result is similar to the study done by Ghali <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in which intranasal 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine resulted in mean sedation score of 2.94 on the same MOAAS scale.</p><p>In our study, the overall success rate of dexmedetomidine was found to be 61.54% with median of 3 regarding ease of treatment completion. This parameter has not been studied previously in relation to intranasal dexmedetomidine in pediatric dental procedures. Wake up behavior was found to be calm and cooperative in 100% children. This is in accordance with previous studies by Yuen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who found similar wakeup behavior.</p><p>None of the patients sedated with dexmedetomidine had any postoperative complications after the procedure.

This increase may be due to anxiety produced by dental setup and the procedure. There was statistically insignificant difference in sedation level produced by midazolam&#x02013;ketamine combination and dexmedetomidine during treatment and at the end of treatment. However, more patients in Group MK (75%) were successfully sedated as compared to Group DX (53.9%) and none of the patients in Group C was sedated.</p><p>In the present study, combination of oral midazolam&#x02013;ketamine (83.3%) resulted in better behavior than intranasal dexmedetomidine (61.6%) during the treatment, and both were better than control group (0%) though the results were statistically insignificant between midazolam&#x02013;ketamine and dexmedetomidine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.460), the results were highly significant in relation to control group. Similar results were found in a study conducted by Daabiss and Hashish [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who reported that patients receiving oral midazolam&#x02013;ketamine combination (84%) were significantly more cooperative and calm as compared to patients receiving oral dexmedetomidine (51%).</p><p>No statistically significant differences were observed when MK combination was compared to intranasal dexmedetomidine in mentioned doses regarding stability of hemodynamic parameters, sedative efficacy, and anxiolysis potential. Both the drugs were found to be better than placebo. Studies with greater sample size may be helpful to further determine the suitability of these drugs in pediatric population.</p><p>Our investigation made no attempt to access the respiratory rate, analgesia potential, and recovery time of the drugs. Literature does not show any published studies that have compared oral midazolam-ketamine combination and intranasal dexmedetomidine as sedative agents in managing the behavior of uncooperative pediatric patients in a dental situation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limits of present study, we conclude the following:</p><p>
