These instruments have many advantages such as less operation time, increased cleanliness of root canal walls and fewer procedural accidents (apical canal transportation, perforations and ledges) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These properties mostly stem from the increased flexibility of NiTi alloy which helps in preservation of root canal curvatures [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, it is stated that engine-driven instruments may damage root dentin by forming craze lines and microcracks [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During root canal preparation, thinned dentinal walls and increased strain can lead to microcrack formation especially at the apical area [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>These defects might propagate and proceed into greater fractures or vertical root fracture (VRF). VRF is the cause of 10.9 to 31% of tooth extractions [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a direct relationship between the amount of dentin removal and crack formation; the greater the canal enlargement, the higher the incidence of VRF [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On the other hand, cleanliness of prepared canal walls depends on removal of surrounding infected dentin [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is still a dilemma in degree of root canal enlargement and apical preparation to reach the least possible level of bacterial counts. </p><p>ProTaper (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) is amongst the pioneer engine-driven instruments that employs full 360<sup>&#x000b0;</sup> rotation with a convex triangular cross-section and multiple tapers within the shaft. The ProTaper Universal (PTU) system is comprised of shaping (SX, S1 and S2) and finishing (F1, F2, F3) instruments [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Mtwo rotary files (VDW, Munich, Germany) have an S-shaped cross-section with deep cutting edges and low radial contact that increase the instrument flexibility and improve file performance [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mtwo provides small-sized files (10/0.04 and 15/0.05) that enable reaching the apical third at the beginning of canal preparation by keeping the canal walls unchanged [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Newer generations of engine-driven systems may create less damage to root canal walls [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Changes in the shape, design of the instruments and type of motion (<italic>i.e. </italic>reciprocation instead of rotation), seem promising. In reciprocation motion, file moves toward apical region by itself with no need to exert more apical force [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This kind of movement also reduces cyclic fatigue of instrument more than rotation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Reciproc (RCP) (VDW, Munich, Germany) is one of the new single-file systems working with reciprocating movement. With S-shaped cross-section and a non-cutting tip, this single file shapes the canal by 150 degrees counterclockwise and then 30 degrees clockwise motion with a speed of 300 rpm. This single file system offers three different sizes [R25 (25/0.08), R40 (40/0.06) and R50 (50/0.05)] [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the formation of dentinal defect after root canal preparation with three mentioned systems (PTU, Mtwo and RCP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in department of endodontics, Ahvaz, Iran. One hundred extracted human single-rooted mandibular premolars were selected for this study. The teeth had been extracted for periodontal/orthodontic reasons and were stored in purified distilled water throughout the study. Radiographic evaluation was performed to exclude presence of resorption defects and root canal obliteration. Root canal curvature was 20-30<sup>&#x000b0;</sup> according to the method introduced by Schneider [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Radii of curvature ranged between 5.2 and 10.1 mm.</p><p>Teeth were examined to confirm the absence of cracks/fractures under a stereomicroscope at 3&#x000d7; magnification (Zeiss, SV6, Jena, Germany) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The teeth were decoronated at CEJ level using a high speed diamond-coated bur under copious water coolant to obtain roots with 11 mm lengths. All roots were covered with a fine layer of silicon impression material simulating the periodontal ligament (PDL) and were then embedded in acrylic blocks. With a random number table the specimens were divided into four groups (<italic>n</italic>=25). In groups 1 to 3, specimens were prepared using Mtwo up to size 25/0.07, PTU up to F2 and RCP R25, respectively. In group 4, the teeth were left unprepared (control group). Each instrument was installed on a handpiece attached to a torque-controlled electric motor (VDW, VDW, Munich, Germany) and was used according to the corresponding manufacturers&#x02019; instructions for each system.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pattern of defects among different groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="background-color:#B8CCE4;" align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="2" colspan="1">

During preparation, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (total volume of 12 mL per canal) was used as the irrigant. Prepared roots were finally rinsed with 2 mL of purified filtered water. All roots were sectioned at 3, 5 and 9-mm distances from the apex by a low speed saw (Leica, SP1600, Wetzlar, Germany) with water coolant. A total of 75 slices were obtained for each group to be blindly inspected for presence of cracks (under 12&#x000d7; magnification). According to B&#x000fc;rklein <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the fracture pattern was categorized as follows: <italic>type I, no defect</italic>; when no fracture was detected inside the root canal, <italic>type II, fracture</italic>; a complete fracture line starting from root canal wall to the root surface, <italic>type III, defected</italic>; an incomplete fracture line starting inside the root canal wall but did not reach the root surface.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows defect patterns among different groups. Fracture category (<italic>type II</italic>) was not detected in any group.

In total, crack formations were observed in 13 teeth from all experimental groups (17.3%). Based on fracture pattern, all these cracks were exclusively categorized as defected (<italic>type I</italic>).

RCP showed less dentinal defects than PTU and Mtwo. No defect was shown in unprepared (control) specimens.</p><p>Rather than an instant phenomenon, VRF is a gradual progression of dentinal crazes [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mastication forces may progress these crazes into a complete VRF [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

There is a direct relationship between excessive dentin removal and formation of root fractures [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; so highly tapered instruments make the root more prone to fractures [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patterns of fracture; <italic>A)</italic> No defect; no fracture line is visible, <italic>B)</italic> Fracture; complete fracture line (arrows) extending to the external root surface and <italic>C)</italic> Defected; incomplete fracture line (arrows) that did not reach the external root surface</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="iej-10-252-g001"/></fig><p>According to the results of the present study, PTU and Mtwo systems produced more dentinal defects (24%) than RCP (4%) and control samples (0%); the incidence of instant root fracture was 0% among all experimental groups. This is similar to the results reported by Bier <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] who reported cracks in 16% of the roots in mandibular premolars prepared with PTU. In contrast, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported cracks in 50% of the roots instrumented with the PTU. However, Yoldas <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed cracks in 30% of the mesial roots of mandibular teeth, that were instrumented with PTU. These contradictory results may be attributed to a number of reasons, and the most likely one is using teeth with different root canal anatomies [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have focused on two factors that might make treated root canals susceptible to fracture: taper and design of files. Arbab-Chirani <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that progressive taper of F1 in PTU system makes the file highly stiff. This criterion may be the cause of more dentinal defects created with this system in the present study. On the other hand, Mtwo files are three times more flexible than PTU F1. However, in this study both systems showed similar results; this might be due to the same degree of taper that was chosen in both systems.</p><p>Preparation technique and the cross-sectional design of the instruments may affect the formation of dentinal defects. In this study full sequence rotary systems, Mtwo and PTU, formed more dentinal defects than RCP as a single file system. This finding probably depends on the type of instrument movement. It is stated that reciprocating systems, such as RCP and WaveOne, caused craze formation significantly more than Mtwo and PTU systems in single-canaled mandibular incisors. They used R40 (40/0.06) RCP instrument. The different findings might be due to the difference in tooth type and size/taper of the used instrument, while R25 (25/0.08) was used in this study. Regarding the effect of file design on formation of dentinal defects, Kim <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that the instrument design may affect stress/strain concentration in apical region which can lead to dentinal defects. </p><p>In this study, cross section of selected instruments was not identical; PTU has a convex triangular cross section that offers strong cutting ability, while Mtwo and RCP are S-shaped [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In spite of the same cross section design of two latter systems, the difference between them was statistically significant which means that not only the design but also other factors, such as type of motion, are influential in this matter. Although Burklein <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] explained that more cutting edges of S-shaped RCP is responsible for more craze line formation, their results showed the same outcome with WaveOne that has a triangle design. That might lead to a less significant role of file design. Berruti <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] suggested that single-file systems remove smaller proportions of dentin than PTU. They concluded that reciprocation motion removes less dentine from root canal walls, therefore it is safer. This kind of motion also reduces the incidence of instrument separation. One important factor for imitating the clinical conditions in laboratory environment is considering the soft tissues surrounding teeth. In the present study samples were mounted in acrylic resin for imitating PDL. Burklein <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], did not mount their specimens. On the other hand, they did not simulate periodontal ligament that may alter stress distribution pattern generated during root canal preparation. Periodontal ligament has an undeniable role in controlling either functional or parafunctional forces on teeth. This could be a strong evidence to back up the difference in results of aforementioned studies Literature suggest that taper and shape of the files as influencing factors could play a significant role in eventual creation of dentinal fractures [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p><p>Finally, it is important to point out that this study was designed and performed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> environment. Currently, there is an evident lack of correlation between the results obtained in this type of studies and the clinical situations. External factors such as masticatory forces, oral environment and <italic>etc.</italic> cannot be imitated in laboratory conditions.</p><p>There are several promising advantages mentioned for RCP; such as time saving, being safe and less probable to cause root fracture or instrument fragmentation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B24"
