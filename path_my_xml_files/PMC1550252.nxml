The number of TIAP implantations is increasing constantly mainly due to advanced treatment options for malignant diseases. Therefore it is important to identify the implantation technique which has the optimal benefit/risk ratio for the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A single-centre, randomized, controlled superiority trial to compare two different TIAP implantation techniques. Sample size: 160 patients will be included and randomized intra-operatively. Eligibility criteria: Age equal or older than 18 years, patients scheduled for primary elective implantation of a TIAP in local anaesthesia and a signed informed consent. Primary endpoint: Primary success rate of the randomized technique. Intervention: Venae Sectio in combination with the Seldinger Technique (guide wire and a peel away sheath) will be used to place a TIAP. Reference treatment: Conventional Venae Sectio will be used with a direct insertion of the TIAP without guide wire or peel away sheath. Duration of study: Approximately 20 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Organisation/Responsibility</title><p>The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with the moral, ethical, and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The trial will also be carried out in keeping with local and regulatory requirements. The Klinisches Studienzentrum Chirurgie (KSC) &#x02013; Centre of Clinical Trials in Surgery at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg is responsible for planning and conduction of the trial. Documentation of patient's data will be accomplished via electronical Case Report Files (eCRF) with MACRO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-Software by the KSC. Randomization, data management, monitoring and biometry are provided by the independent Koordinierungszentrum f&#x000fc;r Klinische Studien (KKS) &#x02013; Coordination Centre for Clinical Trails at the University of Heidelberg.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Totally Implantable Access Ports (TIAP)</title><p>Insertion of a Totally Implantable Access Port (TIAP) is a routinely employed technique in patients who need a save and permanent venous access for e.g. chemotherapy and/or parenteral nutrition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This system needs no external dressing, allows the patient normal physical activity, is probably less prone to infectious complications and will minimize the occlusion rate of the catheter compared to non-totally implantable catheters[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TIAPs are being extensively used world-wide and an increase of port placement can be expected with the broader introduction of innovative therapies in oncology such as the Capri Protocol in pancreatic cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Implantation techniques</title><p>Until today, two alternative approaches to access the central venous system are in use: Blind puncture of a central vein and introduction of a catheter using the Seldinger Technique or implantation of the TIAP through a surgically dissected vein (e.g. Venae Sectio of the cephalic vein; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Both procedures are currently performed by surgeons as well as interventional radiologists and have a certain risk of complications with respect to the applied technique (pneumothorax, hematothorax, "pinch off" phenomena i.e. kinking of the catheter, nerve palsy, thoracic duct injury)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio - Incision of V. cephalica.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio - Insertion of the catheter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Modified Seldinger Technique (combination of Venae Sectio and Seldinger Technique)</title><p>The modified Seldinger Technique is a combination of Venae Sectio and Seldinger Technique using a guide wire and a peel away sheath in the surgically dissected cephalic vein. We believe that the usage of the guide wire and peel away sheath allowes introducting the catheter even in a small cephalic vein and it offers the possiblity to insert the catheter beyond obstacles and narrow curves. The advantage of this technique should be the avoidance of the blind puncture of a central vein (e.g. subclavian vein) and therefore a lower risk of severe complications like pneumothorax, haematothorax and nerve palsy and the possibility to insert the catheter beyond obstacles or narrow curves of the cephalic vein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio + Seldinger - Insertion of the guide wire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-3"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio + Seldinger - Insertion of the dilatator and peel away sheath over the guide wire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-4"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio + Seldinger - Insertion of the dilatator and peel away sheath over the guide wire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-5"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio + Seldinger - Dilatator removed and catheter introduced over the guide wire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-6"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Venae Sectio + Seldinger - Removing of the peel away sheath.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-7-20-7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Medical problem</title><p>Correct placement of the TIAP in the superior Vena Cava is mandatory for optimal and save usage of the central venous access. The success rate of TIAP implantation via the conventional approach by transsection of the cephalic vein (Venae Sectio) ranges between 70 to 94%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A multivariate analysis of 400 patients at the Department of Surgery, Universityhospital of Heidelberg, who underwent a primary port-catheter-system engrafting, showed a success rate of the conventional approach of 80%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One of the major causes for failure was an undersized cephalic vein or an obstacle on the way to the superior Vena Cava[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore this study showed that the secondary approach to blind puncture the subclavian vein with Seldinger Technique achieves an overall success rate of 98% but was also characterized by a number of severe complications causally related to indirect puncture, like a pneumo- or hematothorax[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In almost all interventional series using the Seldinger technique, pneumothorax as a complication occurred (0 to 3.2%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast a literature search was not able to identify pneumothorax or nerve palsy after implantation of a TIAP via Venae Section.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><sec><title>Aim of study</title><p>The objective of this trial is to compare the success and complication rates of two different implantation techniques for TIAP: Venae Sectio of the cephalic vein and direct insertion of the port catheter versus Venae Sectio and insertion of the port catheter with a guide wire and peel away sheath (modified Seldinger Technique).</p></sec><sec><title>Number of patients needed</title><p>Two main factors determine the number of patients needed in a trial.
