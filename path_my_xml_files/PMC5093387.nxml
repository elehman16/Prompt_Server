It has been defined as &#x02018;the deliberate integration of patient care activities between two or more participants involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services&#x02019;.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the USA, the National Quality Forum (NQF) has published preferred practices for care coordination, including transitions of care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This report includes clear recommendations for participation of the patient, or his/her designee, in the decision, planning and execution of a care transition. This is important, as exemplified by a recent Australian article, where patients with colorectal cancer perceived that poor information exchange led to suboptimal care.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Hence assessing patient experience of the referral process may be beneficial in assessing the effect of a referral intervention.</p><p>This article presents the patient experience aspect of a cluster randomised study evaluating the effect of the implementation of referral templates for four diagnostic groups&#x02014;dyspepsia, suspected colorectal cancer, chest pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#x02014;in the patient referral pathway.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Previously, we have shown that the referral templates led to increased referral quality,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the effect on the main outcome, quality of care at the hospital, is in publication. This publication aims to assess whether the implementation of a referral template in the transition of care from the general practitioner (GP) to the hospital has affected the patient experience of the care process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>In Norway, the healthcare system is quite uniformly organised throughout the country. GPs act as gatekeepers to secondary care,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> with specialist health services delivered by governmentally owned regional health authorities, mainly through public hospitals. Some specialist outpatient care is delivered by private specialists, but this is mainly purchased by the regional health authorities. The access to private specialists in the geographical area of the current study is very limited.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a cluster randomised study with the GP surgery as the clustering unit. A total of 14 surgeries were randomised, 7 to the intervention and 7 to the control group. The clustered design was chosen to avoid possible spill-over effect from the intervention to control GPs. Randomisation was performed by simple drawing by a person not connected to the research team, stratified by town versus countryside location of surgery.</p><p>As the intervention was to be actively used by the GPs, the referring GP could not be blinded. Patients, hospital doctors and outcome evaluators were blinded to the intervention status of the patients. Owing to the design of the intervention, the referral letter would sometimes reveal the intervention status, if the electronic template was used. No separate sample size calculation was performed for the patient experience outcome. The full study details are published in the methods paper.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of the distribution of four separate referral templates to the intervention surgeries. These templates covered four clinical areas (dyspepsia, suspected colorectal malignancy, chest pain and COPD). The templates were to be used when initiating a new referral to the medical outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway, Harstad (UNN Harstad). The templates were distributed by the corresponding author (HW) during educational and/or lunch meetings and were provided as laminated reference sheets or in electronic form. In addition, follow-up visits were conducted regularly during the study period and intermittent mail leaflets and reminders were distributed to the intervention surgeries. Control offices continued standard referral practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The main outcome in the project was the quality of care delivered to each individual patient. In addition, health process indicators such as correct prioritisation were recorded and referral quality was also compared between the intervention and control group. The current paper presents the patient experience aspect of the study, as measured by self-report questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participants</title><p>The 14 GP surgeries primarily served by UNN Harstad were included in the randomisation process. In 2013, these surgeries had a total list size of 39&#x02005;523 patients. The individual patients were recruited from consecutive new patients within one of the four clinical areas referred to, at the medical outpatient clinics at UNN Harstad. Study information and a consent form were sent to each individual patient together with their appointment letter. Further information, including a new consent form if appropriate, was provided at their hospital appointment. The individual patients were analysed as part of the intervention or control group depending on the intervention status of the GP surgery they were referred from. Children (&#x0003c;18&#x02005;years of age) and patients with reduced capacity to consent were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The study recruited patients for &#x0223c;2.5&#x02005;years and a total of 538 patients were included with 290 in the intervention arm and 227 in the control arm. The remaining 21 patients were referred from GP surgeries outside the regular area of UNN Harstad, and as such neither in the intervention nor the control group. These 21 were excluded, together with 17 patients who did not fill the inclusion criteria. In total, this left 281 patients in the intervention arm and 219 patients in the control arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011651F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011651F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient inclusion and questionnaire response.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011651f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Questionnaire development</title><p>Multiple tools exist for measuring different aspects of care coordination<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and patient experience; however, no complete questionnaire was located that covered the area in the current study completely.

The questions used were the full version of the Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire (GS-PEQ),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> together with two further questions used in patient experience questionnaires in the Norwegian healthcare system (questions 11 and 12)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the two questions about health interaction from the Commonwealth Fund Survey 2010.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Three further questions were added to assess (1) who referred the patient, (2) if the referral was seen as appropriate and (3) an overall evaluation of the institution. <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011651TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> presents the questions in the questionnaire.

It was then piloted with five outpatients with a median age of 72&#x02005;years (average 68.8&#x02005;years) to ensure face validity and acceptability. Two patients needed clarification on one of the questions before they felt they could answer, and the wording of this question was adjusted accordingly. The patients felt the questionnaire was acceptable, with logical response categories and that the questions covered their clinical path during the referral process well. These patients did not take part when the project was later initiated. No further formal evaluation of the questionnaire was carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Questionnaire distribution</title><p>The questionnaire was mailed to patients who had consented to take part in the referral project presented above. To increase response rates, a prepaid response envelope was included, addresses were handwritten, the questionnaire was kept short and association with research bodies was indicated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For non-responders, one reminder was sent &#x0223c;1 month after the first questionnaire, with a new questionnaire and prepaid response envelope.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study followed the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Before recruitment started, it was presented to the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics Northern Norway, who determined it not to be within the scope of the Health Research Act (REK NORD 2010/2259). The project has been approved by the Data Protection Officer for Research. The study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,</ext-link> with trial registration number NCT01470963. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Imputation</title><p>To further aid the assessment of clustering, missing data were imputed. For the imputation, answers set as &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019; were counted as missing. Missing data were seen to be random and multiple imputation using chained equations was employed. This has been shown to perform well for a variety of variable scaling types.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Every variable used in further statistical analysis was entered into the imputation model, as failure to do so may bias estimates towards the null.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The ordinal response scales for each single question were to be combined into a continuous score, and as such, it was determined that imputation with predictive mean matching was appropriate. As shown by van Buuren,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the number of iterations can usually be quite low, between 5 and 20. In this study, the Stata standard of 10 iterations as burn-in period was used.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are presented on single question basis with comparison between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal data and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for nominal data. No correction for clustering was made as the estimated ICC was very low (shown below). Aggregation of scores was postulated in the methods paper,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but discarded as a main outcome as properties of the questionnaire, with a &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019; answering category, are not easily suitable for such an approach. However, to assess the effect of clustering, a sum of scores from the GS-PEQ part of the questionnaire was calculated and a multilevel regression model was built with the GS-PEQ score from the questionnaire as the dependent variable. Intervention status was included in the model as this is the main point of interest. Gender, age, education level and self-perceived health were included in the model, as these tend to influence patient experience.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> Age was centred to ease interpretation in a mixed model analysis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Self-perceived health was reported on a five-level Likert-style scale and education level in four categories. Both were included as dummy variables in the analysis. Other confounding variables were assessed in the model and included if their inclusion led to a &#x0003e;10% change in the main outcome when added to the base model (main outcome+intervention status). Relevant interactions were checked for relevant variables, where p&#x0003c;0.10 was set as the significance level. As imputation was used, Monte Carlo error estimates were employed to assess the level of simulation error, as suggested by White <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Normal evaluation of multilevel models with loglikelihood ratio tests were not carried out, as this is not well defined for multilevel models with imputed data. The analysis employed restricted maximum likelihood techniques throughout, as suggested when the number of clusters is small.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As described, multiple imputation was used to account for missing data in the multilevel regression model assessing the effect of clustering. Stata V.13.1 (StataCorp 2013, Texas, USA) were used for all analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Response rate</title><p>The response rate was 69.4% before reminders were sent out, rising to 82.0% after reminders (figure 1). The mean age for responders was 61&#x02005;years and for non-responders 47&#x02005;years (t-test &#x0003c;0.0001). There was no significant gender difference between the responders and non-responders, and the response rate did not differ significantly between the intervention and control group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Missing data</title><p>Missing data for most questions were low, ranging from 0 to 11 out of 410 answered questionnaires. Statistically, these were considered missing completely at random (MCAR) with no clear relation to either age, gender, self-perceived health, disease severity or other variables.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, questions 6, 10 and 12 in the general part of the questionnaire had higher amounts of not applicable ranging from 14 to 34 representing 3.4&#x02013;8.3% of returned questionnaires. In these questions, the word &#x02018;treatment&#x02019; was used. This was intended to cover the medical examination and interventions during the outpatient visit. However, it seems that this has been misunderstood by several patients. It seems reasonable to assume that patients who underwent &#x02018;only&#x02019; diagnostic evaluation felt that they had received no &#x02018;treatment&#x02019;, and hence felt unable to answer the question. This was also highlighted by one patient in a free-text response in the questionnaire. &#x02018;Not applicable&#x02019; to questions 6, 10 and 12 did not vary significantly with age (t-test), intervention group status (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test), gender (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test) or self-reported health (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test). This was treated as missing at random for imputation purposes (MAR).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Question 14 had a missing rate of 15.9% but also yielded a high level of not applicable responses, at 46.0% of returned questionnaires. This was expected, as many people will not have had a new appointment with their GP following the hospital outpatient evaluation. It is also reasonable to assume that the high amount of missing was related to the same concept. The response &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019; did not significantly vary with age (t-test p=0.868), intervention group status (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test p=0.064) or self-reported health (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test p=0.459).</p><p>A histogram of responses to questions with five categories showed all response sets to be skewed to the left. However, earlier work has indicated that multiple imputation can perform well, even when the categorical variable is non-normally distributed, as long as MAR does not exceed 10%.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In a 2010 article, Finch<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> argues that multiple imputation performs well for imputation of missing categorical questionnaire data. There was no association between levels of missing data and the multilevel structure of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Baseline characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011651TB2">table 2</xref>. There was no major difference between the intervention and control group with regard to gender, age, urban or rural residency or questionnaire response.

It hence seems that although the intervention has increased the referral quality significantly,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> this has not translated into a more positive patient experience with the referral process and treatment, as measured by self-report questionnaires. In the current study, indepth data analysis with imputation and multilevel regression modelling was employed to further explore the effect of clustering. No clear effect of clustering was found.</p><p>A strength of the current study is the fairly high response rate (82.0%) compared with other mail response studies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, the potential for non-response bias is always present. Others have previously shown the effect of this to be small.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Earlier Norwegian studies have suggested only minor differences between answers provided by responders and non-responders, when the latter have been obtained through telephone follow-up interviews.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> A clear limitation is the use of short-form questionnaires with single items, which may be less valid than longer forms.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, shorter forms will increase the response rate.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The current project aimed to assess the effect of a health system intervention and the patient experiences with care after this intervention. We hence decided to keep the questionnaire short to enable a high response rate and keep the patient and staff workload manageable.</p><p>The current project used a newly developed questionnaire to assess patient experience by combining previously validated questions. The general nature of the final questionnaire may be seen as a weakness, as small changes in the patient experience induced by the intervention may have been missed. Further piloting might have revealed more clearly if the questionnaire did indeed assess the patient experience with the referral and care process in an adequate way. However, in this clinically oriented project, the authors hoped that a more general questionnaire would highlight whether the intervention would cause a more overall positive, or even a negative, change. It is probable that for each individual patient, it is the experience with the entire process that matters, as opposed to the experience of a subpart of the process. If large-scale implementation of referral guidance is contemplated, a more specific questionnaire may need to be validated.</p><p>An additional weakness was the lack of a sound analytical plan proposed in the methods paper.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To ensure transparency, the analysis presented in this paper is therefore simple and based on single-question assessment. Given the clustered nature of the study, an assessment of clustering is given for a subsection of the questionnaire, but very little effect was seen.</p><p>Comparison with other studies was difficult as no clearly comparable analysis was found, except for the two health interaction questions. In the current study, 1.7% in the intervention group and 3.5% in the control group felt the hospital specialist lacked information from the GP. About 4.2% in the intervention and 13.1% in the control group felt the GP lacked information from the specialist. In the Norwegian part of the 2010 Commonwealth Fund Survey, the same questions gave much higher negative ratings, with 12.1% indicating that the specialist lacked information from the GP and 38.3% indicating that the GP lacked information from the hospital.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Data from the 2013 Commonwealth Fund Survey suggest similar ratings as in 2010, although the wording of the questions is slightly different.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A Norwegian report concerning patient experience as inpatients also suggests higher dissatisfaction with co-operation between the hospital and the GP<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> than in the current study. In total, this clearly suggests that the patient experience of the GP/specialist communication is better in a small district hospital than the country average suggests. It is therefore possible that the effect of the intervention on patient experience could have been higher if the level of dissatisfaction with the healthcare cooperation had been higher in the local population. However, this also may suggest that although the hospital consultants often feel information is lacking in the referrals,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> this is not necessarily experienced as a problem by patients.</p><p>In the current study, two questions were answered more negatively than others. These questions therefore probably provide the most interesting points for further quality improvement at the local facility. These two questions represent areas where communication is the main concept, namely patient involvement in the treatment process and information from doctors to patients. Others have previously shown communication and information errors as a cause for dissatisfaction,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and in other jurisdictions even malpractice claims.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
