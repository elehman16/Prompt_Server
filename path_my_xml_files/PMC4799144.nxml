Methods: Twenty-five patients with tropical pyomyositis (Chiedozi grade II) were included in this study. They were randomized into two groups: group A (n = 13), treated with antibiotics and open drainage of the abscesses; and group B (n = 12), treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage of the abscesses. Results: The mean age was 35.3 years (&#x000b1; 19.2) in group A and 30.1 years (&#x000b1; 9) in group B (p = 0.41). There were eight female patients (61.5%) and five male patients (38.5%) in group A; in group B, three were female (25%) and nine were male (75%) (p = 0.11). Staphylococcus aureus was the microorganism most frequently found (72%). The mean hospital stay in group A was 12.7 days (&#x000b1; 2.3), and in group B, 10.6 days (&#x000b1; 1.6) (p = 0.01). The mean duration of antibiotic use in group A was 12.2 days (&#x000b1; 2.3), and in group B, 10.1 days (&#x000b1; 1.5) (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Percutaneous drainage of the abscesses, in association with antibiotic therapy, is an efficient treatment method for tropical pyomyositis grade II, with shorter antibiotic use and hospital stay for patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pyomyositis</kwd><kwd>Myositis</kwd><kwd>Staphylococcus aureus</kwd><kwd>Abscess</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tropical pyomyositis, also known as primary pyomyositis, infectious myositis, pyogenic myositis, suppurative myositis or bacterial myositis<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(1)</sup></xref>, is an illness with high incidence in countries with a tropical climate.

All the patients, or the adults legally responsible for them, agreed to participate in the study through signing a free and informed consent statement, after having been given detailed information about the content and form of the study.</p><p>The sample size was determined prior to the start of the study, by means of specific statistical tests, taking into consideration the &#x003bc; risk (5%) and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> risk (20%), along with the variability of the parameters. From this, it was determined that there should be a minimum of 12 individuals per group.</p><p>Thirty-one patients with a diagnosis of tropical pyomyositis were initially selected. These patients were admitted to the Orthopedics and Traumatology Service of the Regional Hospital of Coari, Amazonas (HRC) and to the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of Mar&#x000ed;lia School of Medicine (Famema), Mar&#x000ed;lia, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, between February 2004 and February 2008. The inclusion criteria were that the patients should be at least 10 years of age and present tropical pyomyositis in Chiedozi stage II. Patients who were using antibiotics or any medication with action or side effects on the immunological system, or had been using them within the preceding 90 days, were excluded. Six patients were excluded from this study: one who was using benzathine penicillin because of a condition of erysipelas in the legs; one, of indigenous origin, who chose not to follow the proposed treatment; and four patients who were classified as presenting Chiedozi stage I. IN this way, 25 patients in total were included. After receiving an initial diagnosis of tropical pyomyositis, all the patients underwent complementary ultrasound, hemogram, blood culture and erythrocyte sedimentation rate examinations. Some patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, only for case documentation purposes. After the initial examinations, the patients were randomized into two groups, by means of the method of drawing opaque sealed envelopes. Group A (n = 13) was treated with an antibiotic (oxacillin, intravenously, 8 g/day)<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(25)</sup></xref> and open surgical drainage of the abscesses; while group B (n = 12) was treated with an antibiotic (oxacillin, intravenously, 8 g/day) and percutaneous drainage of the abscesses. All the patients were operated by the same surgical team within a maximum of 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy, always under the same pre and postoperative conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The anesthetic procedure used was a regional blockade, spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia, depending on the musculature involved. The patients in group A underwent asepsis using degerming polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine and antisepsis using polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine tincture, and sterile fields were set up. These patients then underwent incisions through all the surgical layers until the abscesses were opened up and drained. Extensive cleaning and irrigation of the open area was performed using 0.9% physiological serum. No drains were used in either of the groups. After the abscesses had been cleaned, the muscle layers were brought together and suturing of the subcutaneous cellular layer was performed using absorbable Vicryl* 2-0 thread (Ethicon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The skin was sutured using Mononylon* 4-0 thread (Ethicon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The dressings were open and were changed daily until the seventh postoperative day. From then on, the dressings were left open until the 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, when the stitches were removed.</p><p>The patients in group B underwent the same anesthesia, asepsis and antisepsis procedures and then had their abscesses aspirated percutaneously, using a Jelco<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> no. 14 catheter, which was guided by ultrasonography (Logiq 9<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GE Healthcare). The ultrasound transducers were previously covered with sterile plastic bags throughout their extent. After drainage of the entire infectious area and applying occlusive dressings, no type of suturing was performed. As a standard procedure, for all patients, the venous catheters were replaced every 48 hours.</p><p>The duration of the antibiotic therapy and the patients' release from hospital was conditional on their satisfactory evolution from a clinical point of view (absence of fever, pain, edema, hyperemia and local flushing) and in relation to laboratory tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate VHS &#x02264; 20 mm/h; blood culture: negative; hemogram: absence of leukocytosis or left shift).</p></sec><sec id="cesec30"><title>STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY</title><p>The variables of age, sex, type of microorganism, musculature involved, length of hospital stay and duration of antibiotic therapy were analyzed by means of parametric or nonparametric descriptive statistical tests in a fully randomized model.

It is of crucial importance to emphasize that, although there was a larger number of females in group A, Fisher's exact test showed that there was no statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.11) in relation to this variable.

We disagree with these authors regarding the need for there to be prior muscle bruising and organized hematomas. In the present study, we observed that the major muscle groups of the trunk and upper limbs were the ones most affected, but without any relationship with previous physical trauma.</p><p>We believe that that the fact that these muscle groups are the ones most required in most occupations, and particularly in manual occupations, may be responsible for triggering a greater number of intrinsic lesions and small-scale occurrences of bleeding within the myofibrils, without necessarily requiring muscle bruising or the formation of organized hematomas.</p><p>With regard to antibiotic therapy, even through the difference in the mean duration of antibiotic use between the two groups was minimal, it was sufficient to acquire a statistically significant nature (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>According to the results obtained, we observed that the shorter duration of antibiotic therapy in group B was unrelated to the patients' ages or sex in either group (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figures 14</xref>, <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref> and <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>). In the sparse literature available, we did not find any author who mentioned the length of antibiotic use in relation to patients' ages or sex, in treatments for tropical pyomyositis. Nonetheless, we can infer that the absence of large surgical incisions and the consequent lower degree of tissue damage to the soft-tissue envelope, in patients who underwent percutaneous drainage of the abscesses, contributed towards the shorter duration of antibiotic use.</p><p>A clear diminution of the length of hospital stay was also observed among the patients in group B, compared with the patients in group A (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01).</p><p>Among the results found, even though there was a slight tendency towards a statistical correlation between the length of hospital stay and the patients' sex (<italic>p</italic> = 0.09), the tests performed demonstrated that the reduction in hospital stay was unrelated to the patients' ages or sex (<xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Figures 18</xref>, <xref rid="fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref> and <xref rid="fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>). Again, we did not find any author in the literature who mentioned any possible relationship between the duration of antibiotic use and patients' ages or sex, in cases of tropical pyomyositis. It can be deduced that the lower degree of tissue aggression caused by percutaneous drainage of the abscesses provided the group B patients with a shorter clinical recovery period and, consequently, earlier release from hospital.</p><p>Absence of complications before and after the surgery has also been reported by several other authors who performed the classical open surgical procedure up to the level of Chiedozi stage 2<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, percutaneous drainage of the abscesses in association with antibiotic therapy constituted an effective method for treating tropical pyomyositis (Chiedozi grade II), thereby shortening the patients' total duration of antibiotic use and hospital stay.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bickels</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ben-Sira</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wientroub</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Primary pyomyositis</article-title><source>J Bone Joint Surg Am</source><volume>84</volume><issue>12</issue><year>2002</year><fpage>2277</fpage><lpage>2286</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12473721</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lukert</surname><given-names>BP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pyomyositis.
