Even patients with severe SDB (severe obstructive sleep apnoea or hypoventilation), who are at particularly high risk of adverse health effects, are subject to long delays. Previous research has demonstrated that, within a sleep clinic, management by alternative care providers (ACPs) is effective for patients with milder forms of SDB. The purpose of this study is to compare an ACP-led clinic (ACP Clinic) for patients with severe SDB to physician-led care, from the perspective of clinical outcomes, health system efficiency and cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study in which patients who are referred with severe SDB are randomised to management by a sleep physician or by an ACP. ACPs will be supervised by sleep physicians for safety. The primary outcome is positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence after 3&#x02005;months of therapy. Secondary outcomes include: long-term PAP adherence; clinical response to therapy; health-related quality of life; patient satisfaction; healthcare usage; wait times from referral to treatment initiation and cost-effectiveness. The economic analysis will be performed using the perspective of a publicly funded healthcare system.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (ID: REB13-1280) at the University of Calgary.

The most common type of SDB, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects up to 24% of men and 9% of women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Untreated severe OSA has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, stroke, and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref> Additionally, patients with OSA are at increased risk for motor vehicle crashes,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> use more healthcare resources,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and may experience reduced survival compared with those without OSA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The economic impact of OSA in the USA has been estimated at US$3.5 billion/year, with the mean annual cost of healthcare usage and treatment of medical consequences of OSA exceeding age-matched and sex-matched controls twofold to threefold.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces cardiovascular risk, motor vehicle crashes and healthcare usage, and is cost-effective.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Hypoventilation, defined as a daytime partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide &#x02265;45&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or an increase in nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide &#x02265;10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg occurs in up to 20% of patients with OSA,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and can also occur in obese patients and in association with other common respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with hypoventilation use more healthcare resources than the general population<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and are at an increased risk of acute respiratory failure, hospital admission and death.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Treatment of hypoventilation with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, with or without supplemental oxygen, reduces the number of days in hospital and may reduce physician visits.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, ideal treatment for those with hypoventilation requires overnight monitoring of PAP initiation to determine if CPAP alone is safe and effective, or if additional therapy (non-invasive ventilation (NIV), supplemental O<sub>2</sub>) is required. In contrast, those patients without hypoventilation can be safely treated with home auto-CPAP titration.</p><p>The difficulty in providing timely access to sleep specialists is widespread. Delayed access for sleep care have been reported in Canada,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the USA, Europe and Australia.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These delays are particularly important for patients with severe SDB (severe OSA and/or hypoventilation) due to the increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Current strategies to improve timely access include the use of home sleep apnoea testing (HSAT) or telemedicine consultation with a sleep physician;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> these strategies may be particularly beneficial for patients residing in rural areas or those with mobility concerns. However, their success relies on the supply of sleep physicians for consultation, which is inadequate in many jurisdictions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The use of trained non-physician alternative care providers (ACPs) or primary care physicians to manage patients with SDB has been proposed to improve access to care and to reduce wait times. ACPs, such as nurses and respiratory therapists, have been shown to be effective substitutes for sleep physicians in the management of uncomplicated patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Management by primary care physicians has also been demonstrated to be non-inferior to sleep specialist care.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The above studies have identified potential roles for ACPs and primary care physicians in the management of uncomplicated OSA, but no study has examined whether anyone but a sleep physician can manage patients with more severe forms of SDB such as hypoventilation. It is likely, given the complexity of managing patients who may need more advanced PAP therapies and possibly supplemental oxygen, that these patients are best cared for within a sleep clinic and not in the primary care setting. It is unknown whether non-physician providers within a sleep clinic can safely and effectively diagnose and treat complex patients with severe SDB. Furthermore, the impact on wait times or the quality of patient care have not been evaluated.</p><p>Given the high risk of adverse health outcomes related to untreated severe SDB, and prompted by wait times that far exceed the current Canadian guideline of 4&#x02005;weeks from referral to assessment, we designed an ACP Clinic for patients with severe SDB. This paper provides a description of the model and the protocol for its implementation and evaluation. The rationale for publishing this protocol is to highlight the importance of improving access to care for this patient population, to consider an expanded scope of practice and service delivery for ACPs within a sleep clinic, and to describe our comprehensive evaluation of clinical and health system outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The study is a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study evaluating the 3-month and 1-year outcomes of an ACP Clinic for patients referred with suspected severe SDB. Patients will be randomised to one of two treatment arms&#x02014;standard management by sleep physicians or management by ACPs in the ACP Clinic. The study hypotheses are that, compared with a traditional physician-led approach, the ACP Clinic will:

There are eight sleep specialist physicians at the FMC Sleep Centre (six respirologists, one psychiatrist and one neurologist).</p><p>The FMC Sleep Centre receives &#x0223c;2500 referrals annually, of which 60% are for SDB and 30% are for severe SDB. Twenty-five polysomnograms (PSG) and 75 HSAT are performed each week and all tests are interpreted by a sleep physician. All newly referred patients with suspected SDB undergo HSAT prior to the initial assessment by a sleep physician. Consistent with current Canadian guidelines,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> patients are prioritised based on severity of SDB on HSAT, medical comorbidity, daytime sleepiness and whether they work in a safety-critical occupation. Patients are assigned to sleep physicians based on the suspected diagnosis. Any physician at the FMC Sleep Centre may assess patients with uncomplicated OSA, but prior to this study, patients with suspected severe SDB were only scheduled to see respirologists. Patients may undergo PSG at the physician's discretion if the diagnosis is uncertain or if there is a concern about ambulatory PAP auto-titration.</p><p>Consistent with current clinical guidelines,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> patients with mild or moderate SDB may be offered PAP therapy or referral to a dentist for oral appliance therapy, depending on symptoms and patient preference. However, PAP is recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with severe SDB. Patients are also counselled on lifestyle modification (eg, weight loss, avoidance of excessive alcohol and sedative use) as appropriate. Conventional practice at the FMC Sleep Centre is that ACPs conduct follow-up assessments, either in the clinic or by telephone, guided by sleep physician-approved protocols. For patients with uncomplicated OSA, we have previously demonstrated that this is an effective follow-up model.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The primary sleep physician could be reconsulted by the ACP as necessary; physician reassessment could occur by review of the case with the ACP or direct follow-up with the patient.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Alternative care providers</title><p>All ACPs are respiratory therapists (RT) who have completed a 2-year accredited respiratory therapy training programme in Canada. Completion of this programme includes attendance of 300&#x02005;hours of classroom and laboratory-based learning on respiratory physiology and over 800&#x02005;hours of education and supervised clinical experience with invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation in a variety of medical contexts.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In addition, ACPs at the FMC Sleep Centre have at least 5&#x02005;years of experience assessing and managing patients with SDB. All ACPs are registered with the provincial respiratory therapy professional college in Alberta, Canada, which regulates RTs based on established standards of practice and continuing education requirements.</p><p>The scope of ACP practice at the FMC Sleep Centre is defined by a physician-approved policy that complies with provincial regulations for Registered RTs. ACP activities include: initial education about PAP therapy; follow-up assessment of patients on PAP; and ordering of arterial blood gas and HSAT. ACPs can also make adjustments to PAP equipment, including humidity, ramp and expiratory pressure release settings and small pressure changes to CPAP without a physician prescription. Additionally, regular review of ACP protocols for the management of patients on PAP and education on respiratory and non-respiratory sleep disorders occur bi-weekly at ACP-focused case conferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients who are referred to the FMC Sleep Centre will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet at least one of the following inclusion criteria:

The research associates will allocate patients according to the randomisation schedule and the booking clerk will schedule the patient with the appropriate provider according to the FMC Sleep Centre scheduling policies. The allocation of the participants will be stored in a database, which is only accessible to the research associate. If the patient prefers to be assessed by a particular provider at the time of initial scheduling, then the allocation would be discontinued and the patient would be excluded from the study.</p><p>The research associate and booking clerks will not be blinded to the study. The ACPs and sleep physicians, including investigators, will not be able to identify study patients as both groups will be conducting clinics comprised of a combination of study and non-study patients and there will be no other indications that the patient is a study participant. Owing to the nature of the study, the participants will not be blinded to the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014012F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> presents an overview of study flow. Patients randomised to standard management will receive usual care as described above (see the &#x02018;Study setting&#x02019;). Patients will undergo an initial assessment by a sleep physician, who will establish a management plan with the patient that may include PSG, initiation of therapy for SDB and/or clinical follow-up. Follow-up may be delegated to an ACP, who will manage patients within their scope of practice as defined in existing physician-approved protocols.

Since this patient population is medically complex, the management plan will be reviewed with a sleep physician immediately after the assessment. The sleep physician will meet briefly with the patient to review any additional medical or sleep-related concerns before confirming the proposed plan for further testing and/or treatment. The presence of a sleep physician in the clinic was also deemed important in case a patient was unstable at the time of assessment (eg, severe hypoxemia, decompensated respiratory failure). Follow-up will occur with the ACP to review test results, discuss and initiate treatment and to assess treatment response. The ACP will be able to refer patients back to the primary sleep physician as in the usual care group.</p><p>In both groups, as is standard practice at the FMC Sleep Centre, HSAT requisitions will be completed by physicians or ACPs and interpreted by a sleep physician. PSG requisitions and interpretation, and prescriptions for PAP therapy will be completed by the primary sleep physician.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>A summary of study outcomes and when they will be measured is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016014012TB1">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016014012TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outcome measures collection points</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02005;months</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02005;year</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adherence to therapy

Building on the results of previous studies of alternative models of care delivery for OSA, this study aims to determine whether ACPs can manage patients with severe SDB. If the study aims are met, the role of ACPs in the management of severe SDB will be more clearly understood in terms of their impact on clinical, economic and health system outcomes. The results of this study will help sleep clinicians and health system administrators to determine the optimal scope of practice of ACPs.</p><p>As is the case in many healthcare systems with limited access, sleep clinics may adopt strategies that prioritise patients with severe disease above those with milder disease. This strategy allows patients who are at higher risk of medical complications to be assessed sooner and is particularly important when wait times are long. It could be argued that ACPs are best used to manage milder patients as has been demonstrated in previous studies, thus creating capacity for sleep physicians to assess severe patients. However, given the burden of SDB in the population, a significant proportion of whom have severe disease, and insufficient supply of sleep physicians in many jurisdictions, it is probable that delays for severe patients are also long. Furthermore, if ACP capacity could be increased, it is conceivable that wait times for less severe patients might paradoxically be shorter than for more severe patients. Thus, a strategy that aims to directly improve access for higher risk patients, such as using ACPs to manage patients with severe SDB, is preferable to one in which ACPs only assess patients who are of lower priority.</p><p>Many healthcare systems have insufficient resources to address this imbalance of supply and demand. This study proposes to mitigate this problem through the use of non-physician healthcare providers, under the hypothesis that ACPs can improve access and are cost-effective. However, when proposing a novel model of care, it is essential to demonstrate clinical effectiveness in addition to evaluating the impacts on the healthcare system. This study will comprehensively evaluate an ACP-led pathway for the management severe SDB, including clinical outcomes as well as demand for healthcare resources and costs.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The proposed study has several limitations. First, it is possible that patient preference for care by a sleep physician may influence study outcomes. Our clinical experience with ACP care at the FMC Sleep Centre has been that patients do not object to this management pathway. Furthermore, a previous study of nurse-led care for OSA demonstrated that patient satisfaction did not suffer with non-physician management and in fact was higher with respect to certain aspects of the healthcare encounter.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The research associate will reassure patients that ACP care will be supervised by a sleep physician and that referral back to a sleep physician can be initiated at any point at the patient's request. Finally, we have selected objective outcomes such as PAP adherence, wait times and healthcare costs to minimise potential confounding by patient perceptions of the care they receive.</p><p>A second potential limitation relates to the use of multiple instruments to collect patient reported outcomes. It is possible that patients will experience significant burden from these questionnaires, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data. However, previous work has demonstrated that &#x02018;questionnaire fatigue&#x02019; is not significant in an outpatient setting.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Additionally, we have performed a small time trial for our battery of instruments with patient engagement researchers and observed that the entire set of questionnaires takes &#x0223c;15&#x02005;min to complete. Consequently, we do not anticipate that the completion of questionnaires will lead to any delays on the day of the visit. Our expectation of no significant adverse impact on clinic flow is consistent with previous literature.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>Third, this study uses RTs as alternative care providers. RTs are highly trained in respiratory care and ventilation but are not a recognised health profession in some parts of the world. Thus, the study results might not be generalisable to jurisdictions in which the RT role does not exist. We recognise that an ACP in any clinical setting should have expertise in managing the patient population; in this regard, only RTs with additional expertise in the management of SDB are employed at the FMC Sleep Centre. Similarly, nurses and other healthcare professions should be comfortable with respiratory care and ventilation, and may require specific additional training to achieve this.</p><p>Finally, patients who are randomised to the ACP Clinic arm could experience an adverse outcome related to ACP care, such as the need for an emergency department visit or hospitalisation due to unrecognised illness at the time of assessment. This important patient safety risk will be mitigated by the assignment of each ACP Clinic patient to a primary sleep physician, who will review the management plan with the ACP and meet each patient at the time of the clinic visit. Furthermore, our experience with the delegation of follow-up care to ACPs at the FMC Sleep Centre suggests that trained RTs appropriately identify complex patients, and obtain guidance either through direct communication or by scheduling a follow-up clinic visit with the sleep physician. While we have mandated physician supervision during the ACP Clinic, we recognise that in other jurisdictions, advanced practice nurses or nurse practitioners may have the expertise to manage these patients independently.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MJS, EDP, WWF, WHT, KLF, PJH contributed to study conception/design.
