Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a novel artificial tear preparation containing two active ingredients: Trehalose, a naturally occurring disaccharide with anhydrobiotic functions in many organisms, and hyaluronate, a widely distributed anionic glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide with lubricative and water-retaining properties in biological systems. In a randomized, single center, open label, crossover study, 17 adult patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye syndrome were randomized to treatment with Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (combining trehalose and hyaluronic acid) or Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Patients received 7 days of treatment. The primary efficacy variable was patient satisfaction evaluated by a 0&#x02013;100 visual analog scale evaluated on days 0 and 7 of treatment. Secondary parameters included ocular surface disease index (OSDI), symptoms of dry eye, ocular staining scores (fluorescein and lissamine green), ocular clinical signs, Schirmer test, tear breakup time, and global efficacy assessed by the patient and the investigator. Seventeen patients were included. Patient satisfaction improved from 44.5&#x000b1;19.0 to 70.2&#x000b1;19.2 mm during Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment and from 47.2&#x000b1;23 to 57.1&#x000b1;19.1 mm during Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.043, mixed-effects analysis of covariance). Two secondary efficacy parameters (dry eye symptoms and the impact of their symptoms on work) showed statistically significant advantages for Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> over Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. There were no statistically significant advantages for Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> over Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for any measured parameter. No adverse events were reported. Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> appears to be an effective combination of two active ingredients for the treatment of dry eye and is at least as effective as Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dry eye</kwd><kwd>Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>patients</kwd><kwd>eyedrop</kwd><kwd>tears</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Once considered merely a deficiency of tears, the understanding of dry eye has developed considerably in recent years, and it is now understood to be a complex illness involving inflammatory processes as well as the physicochemical properties of the tear film.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In parallel with this enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of this common illness have developed improved treatments.

Dry eye disease at baseline was moderate in 6/17 (35.3%) and severe in the remaining 11/17 (64.7%) patients. Patients with severe dry eye tended to be older than those with moderate illness (53.1&#x000b1;14.1 vs 42.3&#x000b1;9.7 years). The majority of the patients were female (13/17 [76.5%]).

Moreover, there was a significant advantage for Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in dry eye symptoms on impact on work. However, this was a relatively small study, and the duration of treatment was relatively short, which likely explains the inconsistency between the results on some parameters. Although some parameters (OSDI, for example) did not show statistically significant differences between the two treatments, the direction of the trends between the treatments was consistent; where statistically significant differences were observed between the treatments, they were all in favor of Thealoz Duo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Trehalose-containing eyedrops have previously been shown to be effective in in vitro,<xref rid="b9-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> ex vivo,<xref rid="b11-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and in vivo animal studies<xref rid="b12-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> as well as in a few clinical studies.<xref rid="b13-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A further advantage of this formulation is a longer residency time than hyaluronate alone, as recently shown in a randomized, double-masked study.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-11-595" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Clinical studies have investigated the use of trehalose in eyedrops with positive results.
