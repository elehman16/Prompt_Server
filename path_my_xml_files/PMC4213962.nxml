Now a day, myopia especially in children and adolescence is quite common ophthalmic disease and seldom exceeds 5-6 D. Myopia is that dioptric condition of the eye in which parallel rays of light from infinity come to a focus in front of the retina when accommodation is at rest. Glasses neutralize the effect of such conditions but do not relieve the cause of the trouble, so in many cases, despite using glasses the disease continues to progress.</p><p>Primary symptom of myopia is the blurred vision for distance and it is associated with some other symptoms such as headache, pain in the eye, watering of the eye, eye strain, heaviness of the eye.</p><p>Ophthalmology was recognized as a branch of <italic>Shalakya Tantra</italic> in Indian Medicine. <italic>Acharya</italic> Sushrata (a pioneer of ancient Surgery) had mentioned 76 diseases in the eye. These diseases are more or less comparable with present trends of modern ophthalmology.</p><p>However, in Ayurvedic texts there is no independent disease which perfectly correlates with myopia. By the main feature impairment of distant vision myopia can be correlated with <italic>Drishtigata Rogas</italic> (2<sup>nd</sup>
<italic>Patalgata Timira</italic>).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The prevention of good eye sight is almost impossible without proper eye education and mental relaxation. By the education of the mind and the eyes through some exercises, the muscles of the eye can be trained to bring the blurred image to a focus.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Some Yoga procedures like <italic>Pranayama</italic>, <italic>Trataka</italic> and <italic>Jala Neti</italic> (one of the procedure in <italic>Shatkarma</italic>) are recommended with high emphasis.

All out efforts should be made by man to protect the eye, throughout the period of life. This study was selected in order to trace out an effective treatment line for myopia. As myopia is considered as a more or less developmental anomaly the treatment for the same should be given in the developmental period itself. Hence, that maximum result is possible. Due to the above reason, the patient in the age group of 8 to 30 years were selected in the present study.</p><p>Myopia is considered as a <italic>Tridoshaja Vyadhi</italic> but, clinical study reveals that persons who are having a <italic>Vata Kaphaja Prakriti</italic> (90%) are more prone for myopia.

The familial incidence of myopia was detected in 71.67% of cases. This observation supports the genetic theory, which states that genes are responsible for the development and progression of myopia. Similar observation has been made in Ayurvedic classics, where ocular structure i.e. black part (cornea) and white part (sclera) are said to be inherited from mother and father, respectively.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Overall effect of therapies</title><p>Overall effect of the therapies on 60 patients of myopia in this study shows that, there was no significant reduction in the clinical refraction and V.A. in any of the groups.

This leads to the stimulation of other nerve connections in the brain. Eventually motor and autonomic nerve fibers are fired at the end of the nerve pathways and different parts of the brain are stimulated. The health and optimal function of the body and mind is enhanced through the powerful autonomic nervous influence of <italic>Nadi Shodhana Pranayama</italic> and <italic>Neti Kriya</italic>.
