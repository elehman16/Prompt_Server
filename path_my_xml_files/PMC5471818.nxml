first large pragmatic randomized-controlled clinical trials using comparative
effectiveness research methods, funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
Institute. In the COMPASS Study, we compare the effectiveness of a patient-centered,
transitional care intervention versus usual care for stroke patients discharged home from
acute care. Outcomes include stroke patient post-discharge functional status and caregiver
strain 90 days after discharge, and hospital readmissions. A central tenet of
Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded research is stakeholder engagement
throughout the research process. However, evidence on how to successfully implement a
pragmatic trial that changes systems of care in combination with robust stakeholder
engagement is limited. This combination is not without challenges. Methods: We present our
approach for broad-based stakeholder engagement in the context of a pragmatic trial with
the participation of patients, caregivers, community stakeholders, including the North
Carolina Stroke Care Collaborative hospital network, and policy makers. To maximize
stakeholder engagement throughout the COMPASS Study, we employed a conceptual model with
the following components: (1) Patient and Other Stakeholder Identification and Selection;
(2) Patient and Other Stakeholder Involvement Across the Spectrum of Research Activities;
(3) Dedicated Resources for Patient and Other Stakeholder Involvement; (4) Support for
Patient and Other Stakeholder Engagement Through Organizational Processes; (5)
Communication with Patients and Other Stakeholders; (6) Transparent Involvement Processes;
(7) Tracking of Engagement; and (8) Evaluation of Engagement. Conclusion: In this paper,
we describe how each component of the model is being implemented and how this approach
addresses existing gaps in the literature on strategies for engaging stakeholders in
meaningful and useful ways when conducting pragmatic trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>pragmatic clinical trial</kwd><kwd>comparative effectiveness research</kwd><kwd>patient engagement</kwd><kwd>community-based participatory research</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Engaging patients and other stakeholders in the continuum of biomedical research is a
promising approach to creating more effective interventions and accelerating translation of
effective interventions into practice [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Stakeholder engagement is a collaborative approach
to research that values the unique perspectives and strengths of nontraditional research
partners. It shares the spirit and goals of community-based participatory research (CBPR),
but does not require the full model of CBPR as a starting point. Like CBPR,
stakeholder-engaged research blends lived experiences of patients, expertise of service
providers, power of policy makers, and rigorous science. The focus is on conducting relevant
research, informing policy, and promoting successful implementation and long-term
sustainability.</p><p>In parallel, comparative effectiveness research is the direct comparison of 2 or more
interventions to determine which works best for which patients. When designed to evaluate
the effectiveness of interventions in real-world practice with heterogeneous patient
populations, the study is a pragmatic clinical trial [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>One of the first 5 large pragmatic clinical trials funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes
Research Institute (PCORI) is the Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) Study.
COMPASS will randomize 41 hospitals (40 randomized units) and enroll a widely diverse group
of 6000 patients across North Carolina (NC). Results of the trial will provide evidence to
create national quality standards for post-acute stroke care delivery, which currently do
not exist.</p><p>The purpose of the COMPASS Study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a
patient-centered, transitional care model that provides both structure and processes for
post-acute care of stroke patients versus usual care. Our working hypothesis is that the
patient-centered model will improve functional outcomes and reduce caregiver strain and
hospital readmissions.</p><p>PCORI has established stakeholder engagement as a central tenet of their funded research
portfolio. There is currently little guidance in the biomedical literature on how best to
create and foster stakeholder engagement throughout the research process [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The gaps
include a lack of understanding of how to engage a broad range of critical decision makers
across the health-care system; which methods and modes of stakeholder engagement are
feasible during the earlier and later phases of research; how the views of stakeholders are
synthesized and used to shape research design, implementation, and dissemination; and how to
partner with stakeholders to increase intervention effects, reduce disparities, and/or
sustain tested interventions [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, the purpose of this article is to address
gaps in the literature on stakeholder engagement in comparative effectiveness research by
presenting the model that guides our stakeholder engagement efforts, and sharing the methods
we used throughout the pre-award and post-award study design periods to inform best practice
methods for engaging stakeholders in large pragmatic trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general"><title>Overview</title><p>The COMPASS intervention is built on early supported discharge (ESD) studies in Canada
and Europe [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ESD is now standard of care in
the United Kingdom [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Canada [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but has not been used or evaluated in the US or
rural settings. The COMPASS model of care combines ESD with Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) transitional care services provided by advanced practice providers
(APP) and ESD services coordinated by the APPs and adapted for the US health-care system.</p><p>The COMPASS intervention provides both structure and processes to post-acute care for
stroke patients. The innovative intervention combines services from a post-acute care
coordinator (PAC) who is an registered nurse, and an APP (physician assistant (PA) or
nurse practitioner (NP)) with linkages to community-based services to enhance continuity
and coordination of stroke post-acute care. Patients are contacted at discharge, 2 days
after discharge by phone, an in-person visit within 7&#x02013;14 days after discharge, and phone
calls at 30 and 60 days after discharge. During the clinic visit within 7&#x02013;14 days of
discharge, the PAC performs standardized assessments to assess the physical, social, and
medical determinants of health and specifically screens for common post-stroke problems.
The COMPASS intervention is unique in its focus on addressing post-discharge needs of both
patients and family caregivers. An assessment of the patient&#x02019;s functional status and
related post-acute care needs, and the caregiver&#x02019;s capacity for assisting the patient
provide the basis for an individualized electronic care plan addressing specific needs;
linking patients and caregivers to relevant community-based services (eg, caregiver
support, medication management), and follow-up care. The PA or NP reviews the results of
each assessment with the PAC and&#x02014;incorporating input from the patient and
caregiver&#x02014;creates an individualized electronic care plan for each patient. This plan is
shared with home health, outpatient therapists, primary care, and community service
providers. Therefore, all providers&#x02014;and the patient and caregiver&#x02014;understand and have
reviewed the plan of care. The effectiveness of the intervention is assessed via a 90-day
outcome survey call to the patient, mail survey to the caregiver, and claims data.</p><p>Research reported in this manuscript was funded through a PCORI Award. PCORI had no role

</p><p>While preparing the PCORI proposal, we identified stakeholder partners from among those
listed above, who actively participated in the study planning and grant writing. Still
more stakeholders were added after funding was awarded, primarily from the study team&#x02019;s
professional networks. These key stakeholders have established working relationships
with the study team. Importantly, they were enthusiastic about joining the project and
did not require a lengthy pre-engagement period to agree to participate. Prompt
participation of stakeholders was essential to meet the rapid turnaround time between
PCORI&#x02019;s acceptance of the COMPASS letter of intent and the deadline for the full
proposal. We later expanded the number of partners during study design phase, seeking to
include all stakeholder groups who would be affected by the study and could influence
its success. COMPASS now includes all project-relevant stakeholder groups whose input
has shaped intervention design and implementation plans, for the purpose of maximizing
effectiveness and uptake.</p><p>The academic members of the COMPASS team represent 5 major universities in NC with
expertise in neurology, nursing, rehabilitation, pharmacy, primary care, public health,
health services research, quality improvement, epidemiology, and biostatistics.
Importantly, they also have decades of experience engaging stakeholders in health
services research, health system change, and policy change.</p><p>We included thought leaders in each stakeholder group, including state policy makers,
to support dissemination and long-term sustainability. A previous systematic review of
stakeholder engagement in research indicated that engagement with patients was frequent,
whereas engagement with clinicians and other stakeholders like payers, product makers,
and policy makers was not [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In COMPASS, we
have included a broad range of critical decision makers across the health-care system
and community to maximally support patients&#x02019; recovery after stroke (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we sought the participation of a racially diverse group of patient
partners who share lived, but varied, experiences of stroke recovery. We also wanted to
be guided by people with experiences in advocacy and hospital politics who understood
the communities in rural eastern NC, where the risk for stroke is the highest in the
nation. The lead patient partners for COMPASS are a female African-American stroke
survivor known in NC as an effective advocate and patient leader in initiatives for
stroke and heart disease prevention and a male Caucasian stroke survivor who, after his
recovery, became involved in his local hospital and is now vice chair of a hospital
board in eastern NC. These choices are important because African-Americans, women, and
residents of the eastern part of the state are at greater risk of poor outcomes after a
stroke and their voices needed to be incorporated into the COMPASS Study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-2" sec-type="general"><title>Patient and Other Stakeholder Involvement Across the Spectrum of Research
Activities</title><p>We embedded patients and other stakeholders in the COMPASS Steering Committee and all
study subgroups according to their self-reported interests and skills, so they have
input and support decision making across the research process. Stakeholders experience
the iterative nature of research and their input is incorporated into research
decisions. Examples include educating data collectors to slowly read survey questions so
stroke survivors can understand them, selecting outcome measures, and making the consent
process understandable. This diffusion of stakeholder influence rests on shared
leadership and facilitates management of stakeholder engagement for a trial of this size
and complexity.</p><p>A challenge of engaging a large and diverse number of stakeholders across sectors and
across a wide geographic area is that not all stakeholders interact with all
investigators. However, by embedding stakeholder partners in all subgroups, researchers
and stakeholders can maintain close working relationships around the topics of their
stated preferences. Stakeholders&#x02019; self-reported interests, expertise, time, and
communication requirements informed who would work on which tasks. We consciously allow
the level and type of engagement to vary by stakeholder according to interest, skill,
time, health status, project needs, and budget constraints. We anticipate that these
strategies will leverage stakeholders&#x02019; strengths and interests and foster more
meaningful and productive participation.</p><p>During the study planning/design phase we included stakeholders in 136 engagement
activities, 18 of which occurred during proposal writing or before PCORI funding was
awarded, 118 within the first 10 months of the grant. Using PCORI&#x02019;s definition of
engagement levels, of these 136 engagement activities, 66 (48%) were information
sharing, 40 (30%) were consultation, 17 (12%) were collaboration, and 13 (10%) were
stakeholder directed. Engagement also cut across levels of influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Stakeholder groups that participated in the planning of the Comprehensive
Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S2059866116000261_fig1"/></fig>
</p><p>To illustrate, multiple stakeholders from multiple groups defined intervention goals,
objectives, and key messages; and developed intervention materials and activities based
on the existing scientific evidence [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>],
payment structures, clinical workflow, and stroke patients&#x02019;, caregivers&#x02019;, and
clinicians&#x02019; lived experiences. Multiple stakeholder groups also determined
intervention-specific roles, and the most effective training methods for these various
roles given existing time constraints. These groups also developed intervention training
modules and materials and will train hospital-based and community-based providers.
Patient and caregiver feedback was used to determine our selection of outcomes and data
collection procedures.</p><p>Patients and caregivers also shaped our consent process for data collection. For
example, our partners reviewed several iterations of the consent form to retain
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-required content that will (1) foster comprehension
among potential participants with a range of health literacy levels, and (2) not raise
concerns among potential control group participants (receiving usual care) because they
will not receive the intervention. The result is a consent protocol for pragmatic trials
that meets IRB requirements, but will be easier to understand and be received favorably
by potential participants.</p><p>Community-based service providers assisted with hospital and patient recruitment by
leveraging their professional and personal connections to key decision makers within
hospitals who made the decisions about enrolling their hospitals or hospital systems in
the trial.</p><p>Hospital-based stakeholders included stroke program coordinators, stroke neurologists,
physician emergency department directors, quality/performance improvement coordinators,
nurse managers, patient education directors, and senior hospital administrators. These
stakeholders made a key contribution to the study design by advocating for a delayed
start design [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], meaning that, at the end of
the trial, all hospitals enrolled in the study eventually will receive the intervention.
At baseline, hospitals are randomized to either administer the COMPASS intervention or
to provide their usual standard of care (control). In phase 1, patients in these
hospitals are followed for 90 days so that the effects of the intervention on outcomes
can be observed. In phase 2, all hospitals implement the COMPASS intervention, and the
data obtained during this phase will be used to evaluate how well the intervention
hospitals sustained the intervention without grant support.</p><p>Our statistical collaborators agreed that this design provides the best statistical
control to measure the intervention&#x02019;s effects, and our hospital stakeholders agreed that
this design would help ensure that all communities benefit from study participation,
which was essential to generate buy-in from individual hospitals and larger health
systems.</p><p>Although some stakeholder partners contribute to the COMPASS Study with limited
financial compensation (patients, caregivers, Piedmont Triad Regional Council Area
Agency on Aging), most do not. Several patients and caregivers decline payment because
they value &#x0201c;giving back&#x0201d; to their communities and being involved in a state-wide study
aimed at improving the way we deliver care to stroke patients. Other stakeholders
recognize value in their participation in other ways. Examples include study
participation facilitating entry into hospital systems to build previously inaccessible
partnerships and access to study team members, who can advise stakeholder organizations
on survey design or program design unrelated to stroke care. Building such relationships
is time consuming, but making them a priority holds mutual benefits and sows the seeds
of long-lasting partnerships.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-3" sec-type="general"><title>Dedicated Resources for Patient and Other Stakeholder Involvement</title><p>The more stakeholders are engaged, the more feedback is received. This can lead to
still more relationships, more feedback, and more management. In the COMPASS Study, a
faculty &#x0201c;engagement officer&#x0201d; (25% effort) is charged with developing and executing a
strategy to weave engagement through the trial and holding the study team accountable. A
research coordinator (100% effort) is dedicated to engagement efforts. The oversight of
engagement activities is centralized, but all faculty and staff team members (except
biostatisticians) spend time leading engagement activities in study subgroups (eg,
intervention, outcomes measurement). COMPASS project managers can also direct additional
administrative staff to support engagement efforts when needed. The engagement and
administrative teams meet weekly to discuss administrative support for engagement.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-4" sec-type="general"><title>Support for Patient and Other Stakeholder Engagement Through Organizational
Processes</title><p>Our initial orientation of stakeholders to the COMPASS Study includes a discussion of
the overall importance of engaging stakeholders in research, and the various levels of
and opportunities for engagement (and compensation) in COMPASS, in particular. Our goal
is not to turn stakeholders into researchers but to allow their expertise to shape the
study design, implementation, and dissemination. We clarify that we are seeking partners
with complementary strengths and unique perspectives on the health-care system and that
understanding their needs is critical to the success of the project.</p><p>During the pre-award period, the researchers developed a stakeholder management plan
(&#x0201c;roadmap&#x0201d;) outlining where stakeholders could influence the study. The study team
firmly believed that engagement had to be an iterative process in the post-funding phase
because, if we truly partnered with stakeholders, their influence could certainly
influence the study direction. Creating a stakeholder roadmap allowed us to target
defined actions to engage stakeholders quickly, even before the study begun. Our
stakeholder engagement plan focused on 4 key sets of activities: (1) study planning
(including study design, intervention design and procedures, outcomes measurement,
materials); (2) hospital/patient recruitment and retention; (3) study implementation;
and (4) translation, including interpreting study findings and disseminating results
back to participating communities and the public. Within each activity, we have a series
of circumscribed projects defined (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table

</p><p>Given the rapid start-up phase, we wanted to be sure to capture any additional
opportunities for engagement. Thus, we have designated and trained 1 researcher in each
study subgroup to be the engagement advocate. This person notifies the faculty
engagement officer either when engagement has occurred or when additional engagement of
stakeholders will be needed as the study progresses. This information is tracked in the
Research Electronic Data CAPture (REDCap) data system&#x02019;s engagement tracker, which is
described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-5" sec-type="general"><title>Communication with Patients and Other Stakeholders</title><p>For stakeholders not continuously engaged in the COMPASS Study in the ways already
noted, study updates are provided via conference calls, or by COMPASS team member
updates at regional meetings that those stakeholders were already scheduled to attend.
The team includes skilled facilitators with expertise in leading focus groups or group
feedback sessions. In addition, the team includes experts in primary care practice and
pharmacy quality improvement; physical therapy; and family caregiver needs. They engage
with their respective communities for this study where their contacts and stature as
opinion leaders are most effective. An important component of our stakeholder roadmap is
explaining to partners how their feedback was incorporated and, if not, why not&#x02014;and in a
timely manner.</p><p>Face-to-face contact is invaluable for building relationships, and all study team
members have spent significant time traveling to meet with stakeholders. Yet, limited
time and resources for state-wide travel necessitate using regular conference calls,
webinars, and email contacts. When patient and caregiver stakeholders do not have email
access or cell phone minutes, we call them at their homes. Openness to special
arrangements is important. For example, to connect with 1 highly engaged couple (each
both a stroke survivor and a caregiver) in rural NC, we email their neighbor. This
person prints out emails and drives them to our partners, who then call us from their
house phone when they have time to talk. We also mail documents to our partners when
that seems most practical.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-6" sec-type="general"><title>Transparent Involvement Processes</title><p>Including patients, family caregivers, clinicians, and organizations dedicated to
improving care for stroke patients in COMPASS subgroups, including the Steering
Committee, allows for information exchange, keeps the patient perspective central, and
fosters transparency. To make our engagement processes clear, we clarify roles,
expectations, compensation, workload, timelines, deliverables, and decision-making
processes.</p><p>Most of our stakeholder interactions are defined by the IRB as non-research activities
(eg, committee work, team meetings), but some are defined as research and require IRB
approval (eg, interviews, focus groups). This distinction is made explicit to our
stakeholders.</p><p>Our written compensation policy has evolved to account for stakeholder feedback while
meeting PCORI principles of reciprocal relationships, trust and transparency, and budget
constraints. For example, we do not reimburse clinical or industry partners for their
participation, but we do reimburse patient and caregiver participants. Because employees
of our main community-based partner cannot accept consulting fees, we budgeted support
to the organization in a subcontract. We make clear in advance when we cannot compensate
individuals for their time in an upcoming activity. Some choose to participate and
others decline. This flexible participation is an integral part of our model.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-7" sec-type="general"><title>Tracking of Engagement</title><p>Central to our infrastructure is a system to capture engagement work and stakeholder
feedback so that we can track what actions were ultimately taken based on their input
and to better delineate the impact of a given strategy on outcomes. To do this, we
developed an engagement database within the REDCap software system, a secure platform
for research data collection and analyses developed within the Clinical and
Translational Science Award network [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our
database was designed to (1) document all engagement activities systematically, (2)
monitor the complexities of our engagement process, (3) facilitate data collection for
the annual engagement report to PCORI, and (4) tie engagement activities to processes
and eventual outcomes. Data include which stakeholder groups were involved; when, where,
why, and how they were engaged; their level of engagement (using PCORI&#x02019;s framework); how
challenges to engagement were overcome, and how stakeholder feedback shaped the study.
The database includes a dashboard to visually track each engagement activity and help
the engagement team ensure that activities are on schedule (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).<fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Screenshots from the Research Electronic Data CAPture engagement tracker.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S2059866116000261_fig2"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2-8" sec-type="general"><title>Evaluation of Engagement</title><p>We will monitor our engagement process through proactive oversight of milestones and
deliverables spelled out in our PCORI contract and engagement proposal.</p><p>We will perform quarterly check-ins via survey to ask all patient and stakeholder
partners if they feel their perspectives are valued by the study team, if they are
satisfied with their level of involvement, if they are involved in the activities they
want to be involved in, and if the methods used to elicit their feedback match their
preferred style of communication. These data will be used to continuously improve study
processes, which signals to all stakeholders the power and value of their voice.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper describes the comprehensive methods used to incorporate stakeholders in the
planning and design of a large pragmatic trial. To date, we have successfully included
perspectives and input from multiple stakeholder groups in a timely fashion because our
efforts were driven by a sound conceptual model and built on an existing state-wide
infrastructure. This paper is intended to provide guidance to others planning or conducting
stakeholder-engaged research as we collectively attempt to identify evidence-based
approaches by which engagement can enhance research and close the gap from evidence to
action.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Lynette Staplefoote-Boynton, Betsy Vetter, Gladys Lundy, Laurie Mettam,
