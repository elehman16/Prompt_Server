Protection Agency to estimate drinking water health risks. Seldom
are both methods used concurrently. Between 2001 and 2003, illness
data from a trial were collected simultaneously with exposure data, providing
a unique opportunity to compare direct risk estimates of waterborne
disease from the intervention trial with indirect estimates
from a risk assessment. Comparing the group with water treatment (active) with
that without water treatment (sham), the estimated annual attributable
disease rate (cases per 10,000 persons per year) from the trial
provided no evidence of a significantly elevated drinking water risk [attributable
risk = &#x02212;365 cases/year, sham
minus active; 95% confidence interval (CI), &#x02212;2,555 to 1,825]. The
predicted mean rate of disease per 10,000 persons
per person-year from the risk assessment was 13.9 (2.5, 97.5 percentiles: 1.6, 37.7) assuming 4 log removal due to viral disinfection and 5.5 (2.5, 97.5 percentiles: 1.4, 19.2) assuming 6 log removal. Risk assessments
are important under conditions of low risk when estimates are
difficult to attain from trials. In particular, this assessment pointed
toward the importance of attaining site-specific treatment data and
the clear need for a better understanding of viral removal by disinfection. Trials
provide direct risk estimates, and the upper confidence limit
estimates, even if not statistically significant, are informative
about possible upper estimates of likely risk. These differences suggest
that conclusions about waterborne disease risk may be strengthened
by the joint use of these two approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>drinking water</kwd><kwd>gastrointestinal</kwd><kwd>intervention trial</kwd><kwd>microbial risk assessment</kwd><kwd>waterborne pathogens</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Continued reporting of outbreaks of disease from consumption of drinking

risk assessments as mandated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (<xref rid="b24-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">SDWA 1996</xref>). Risk assessments historically have been used to evaluate the health
risks of properly treated drinking water because of the general belief
that drinking water risks were too low to be detected through epidemiology
studies. Recent drinking water intervention trials, however, have
begun to question the assumption that there is little or no risk of
infectious gastrointestinal (GI) illness attributable to the consumption
of drinking water when water treatment systems are functioning properly (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Payment et al. 1991</xref>, <xref rid="b16-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In contrast, other trials have suggested that there is little or no
risk (<xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Colford et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b8-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Hellard et al. 2001</xref>). Based on these findings and in response to the 1996 Congressional amendment
to the SDWA that emphasizes the need for sound science and risk-based
standard settings [<xref rid="b27-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1989</xref>], there has been increased interest in evaluating methodologies
to help estimate the risk of GI illness attributable to drinking water
in communities. In the present study we compare and contrast two approaches
for the assessment of risk of diarrhea caused by drinking water&#x02014;a
microbial risk assessment and a randomized intervention trial
design.</p><p>Using data collected in Davenport, Iowa (<xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Colford et al. 2005</xref>), we compared the two techniques to estimate the risk from waterborne
pathogens due to exposure to drinking water. For this study, risk assessment
is based on the integration of several independent sources of exposure
information to estimate dose (i.e., water quality, drinking water
treatment plant efficiency, and tap water consumption patterns). We
then used the dose information in a health effects model to predict
the risk of illness due to drinking tap water. The randomized intervention
trial directly measures the impact of drinking water on diarrhea
and compares the incidence of GI illness between intervention and control
subjects.</p><p>Both approaches have wide appeal. The randomized trial is considered the &#x0201c;gold
standard&#x0201d; for providing unconfounded causal risk
estimates associated with a particular exposure. When lacking these
direct estimates of risk, quantitative risk assessment is the preferred
method for attaining risk estimates and is used by the U.S. EPA, U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, World Health Organization, and other
stakeholders for regulatory and operational purposes. Although these approaches
are widely accepted, they also have many limitations. Low sensitivity
because of sample size constraints, and biases due to both exposure
and outcome misclassification must be acknowledged when interpreting
randomized trial results. Similarly, risk assessments are model-based
estimates and rely on water quality data as input, and so must
be interpreted in this context. Both approaches have their strengths and
weaknesses. In the present study our goal was to compare and contrast
the two approaches for obtaining estimates of drinking water risk when
coincident data are available.</p><p>Several authors have proposed methods for estimating the risk of drinking
water (<xref rid="b7-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b13-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Messner et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Regli et al. 1999</xref>). Our study differs from these previous studies in that we incorporated
additional detailed local information relevant to risk assessment, including
measurements of pathogen levels in the source water over a 1-year
period, pathogen removal efficiency of the Davenport drinking water
treatment plant (which uses sedimentation, filtration, and chlorine
disinfection), and data on local tap water consumption.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Attributable risk from intervention trial (Davenport, Iowa)</title><p>The study design of the intervention trial in Davenport is similar to those

Unlike prior randomized trials, however, a crossover design was used
where, for each intervention period (~ 6 months), half the enrolled cohort
had a water treatment device installed at their kitchen faucet and
half had a sham device installed that resembled the real device but
provided no water treatment. At the end of the first treatment period, the
device in each subject&#x02019;s household was switched to the opposite
type, and illness was monitored for another 6 months. Participants
were blinded throughout the study to their specific device type, and
they recorded their daily occurrence of GI symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cramps) in a personal health diary. The study resulted
in treatment assignment and illness data for 1,296 subjects in 456 households. For
further details of the Davenport intervention trial, see <xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Colford et al. (2005)</xref>. As part of the Davenport intervention study, a separate random digit
dial (RDD) telephone survey was conducted in the Davenport area. The goal
of the survey was to obtain population-based estimates of the use
of various home water treatments, water consumption, and the monthly occurrence
of GI illnesses (<xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Wade et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>We define attributable risk (AR) for the trial subjects as the estimated
risk difference in daily rates of highly credible GI illness (HCGI) (<xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Colford et al. 2005</xref>) among the subjects with the treatment device versus those with the sham
device. HCGI is defined as the presence of any one of the following
syndromic manifestations of GI illness: vomiting, watery diarrhea, soft
diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea with abdominal cramps. The
AR was estimated using a linear model with binomial errors and accounting
for correlation using a generalized estimating equation (<xref rid="b34-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Zeger et al. 1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Risk assessment model</title><p>The risk assessment was conducted without knowledge of the results of the

later in this article. The model uses a population of 10,000 and
a risk period of 1 year (365 days). The model is a simple linear process
and works as described below.</p><p>A concentration of the specific source water distribution of pathogens (e.g., <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, and culturable viruses) is randomly sampled for the day. On the basis
of previous studies and goodness-of-fit tests of the source water data
collected in Davenport, we assumed that the average concentrations of
source water for a day followed a lognormal distribution (<xref rid="b10-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">LeChevallier et al. 2003b</xref>). This distribution was estimated using the constant recovery rates shown

ratios (the ratio of those who become ill to those who are infected) for

the Davenport intervention study. These included approximately weekly
measurements of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> concentrations, as well as monthly measurements of culturable viruses (<xref rid="b10-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">LeChevallier et al. 2003b</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0114-001199">Figure 2</xref> shows the raw data for both <italic>Giardia</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, <italic>X</italic><italic><sub>k</sub></italic> , collected at different days, <italic>k</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0114-001199">Figure 3</xref> shows similar data for the culturable viruses.

in the model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001199">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment efficiency</title><p>Direct estimates of treatment efficiency with respect to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species, <italic>Giardia</italic> species, and culturable viruses were not possible from the Davenport treatment
facility because levels in effluent water samples were uniformly
below detection across the study period. Estimates of the efficiency
of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> treatment, obtained from weekly measurements of source water and plant
effluent data (<xref rid="b10-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">LeChevallier et al. 2003b</xref>), were used as a surrogate for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> treatment efficiency. Similarly, removal of somatic coliphage from waters
passing through the Davenport facility was used to approximate a distribution
of treatment efficiency with respect to culturable viruses.</p><p>The log removal for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> from chlorine disinfection was assumed to be zero, whereas the log removal
for <italic>Giardia</italic> and enteric viruses was estimated from chlorine concentration time (CT) values
collected in Davenport. The CT values were estimated for <italic>Giardia</italic> and were therefore directly applied to estimate disinfection efficacy
for <italic>Giardia</italic>. Because there were no equivalent data for viruses, virus disinfection
was assumed to have the same distribution as <italic>Giardia</italic> but a modulated mean value. One way to establish specific viral log removal
values for the model is to rely on data presented in a U.S. EPA
guidance document (<xref rid="b28-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">U.S. EPA 1991</xref>). Table E-7 in this guidance document suggested that 4 log removal of
viruses would be achieved at 20&#x000b0;C, a pH of 6&#x02013;9, and a
CT value of 3. This table was based on hepatitis A data (<xref rid="b25-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Sobsey 1988</xref>) assuming both a 3-fold safety factor and a 2-fold decrease in CT for
every 10&#x000b0;C increase in temperature. Using Table E-4 from this
same guidance document, we can estimate that the CT value in Davenport
was approximately 13. Assuming a linear relationship between viral log
removal and CT would suggest that the log removal of viruses by disinfection
was &#x0003e; 12. This result assumes that viruses are dispersed in
chlorine-demand&#x02013;free water and is not valid for viruses that
occur in nature aggregated and associated with organic particles. Given
the uncertainties associated with all of these assumptions, we chose
to examine a variety of viral log removal values ranging from 4, the
minimum required by the U.S. EPA, to the 13 log removal treatment level
estimated above.</p></sec><sec><title>Water consumption</title><p>During the period of the intervention trial, home tap water consumption
data were collected from the RDD telephone survey. The estimate of the
distribution of regular tap water consumption was obtained from 4,756 interviews. The
water consumption distribution was assumed to be lognormal (<xref rid="b21-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Rosebury and Burmaster 1992</xref>), and we estimated the mean and standard deviation of this distribution. The
RDD survey respondents were asked how much water was consumed in
discrete glasses: &#x0003c; 1, 1&#x02013;2, 3&#x02013;5, and &#x0003e; 5. We took
the number of respondents in each of these categories, made the categories
contiguous (i.e., &#x0003c; 1, 1&#x02013;2.5, 2.5&#x02013;5, &#x0003e; 5), and
estimated the mean and standard deviation of log consumption using
maximum likelihood.</p></sec><sec><title>Probability of disease</title><p>The functions used to generate a probability of disease given a quantity
of pathogen ingested (dose response) were derived from dosing trials
where healthy volunteers were given known quantities of pathogens. Specifically, <xref rid="b4-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">DuPont et al. (1995)</xref> published data for a sample of healthy volunteers infected by known numbers

no evidence of a significant association of the use of drinking water
with disease. The result was negative because there were more cases
reported from the active than from the sham group. Based on the upper
value of the 95% CI, the trial was statistically consistent
with as many as 1,825 cases per 10,000 people per year attributable to

analyses: <italic>a</italic>) instead of assuming a Poisson distribution, we modeled pathogen density
using a negative binomial distribution with different levels of aggregation; <italic>b</italic>) rather than using Davenport-specific treatment efficiency values, we
used published values (<xref rid="b17-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Rachwal et al. 1996</xref>); <italic>c</italic>) rather than using site-specific data from the RDD telephone survey, we
based the mean and standard deviation of the estimated average daily
water consumption on reported U.S. EPA values (<xref rid="b29-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">U.S. EPA 2000</xref>); and <italic>d</italic>) we varied the two dose&#x02013;response parameters by a factor of 10. Results
based on the above variations increased predicted <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> cases to be as high as 25 cases per 10,000 persons per year, <italic>Giardia</italic> cases to as high as 100, and culturable enteric viruses to as high as 15. This
brings the predicted risk to as high as 140 cases per 10,000 persons
per year. There was little effect from adding overdispersion to
the pathogen distribution using the negative binomial model. The higher
estimates were primarily because of the use of non-Davenport-specific
treatment values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, both risk assessments and intervention trials are used to
obtain health risk estimates. The interpretation of the results obtained
from these two approaches, however, can often differ. The data collected
in Davenport provided a unique opportunity to compare and contrast
these two approaches. Even though there was no evidence of a significant
association in the Davenport analysis, the upper bound risk estimate
from the intervention trial (based on the 95% CI) was higher
than the drinking water standards provided by the U.S. EPA. Under
these rigorous standards, the Davenport analysis provides a useful upper
bound on the risk; however, a risk assessment is needed to estimate
the risk within the limits set by regulatory agencies. Specifically
for Davenport, the trial estimated an upper-end risk of 1,825 cases per 10,000 persons
per year, whereas the risk assessment predicted 5&#x02013;14 cases
per 10,000 persons per year attributable to drinking water
from <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, and culturable viruses. An additional finding in our work was a difference
in the estimation of illnesses provided by risk assessment when
using site-specific water quality data rather than generally available
estimates of treatment efficacies.</p><p>Because of the different approaches used by risk assessments and intervention
trials, the analytic results from each approach often have different
interpretations. These differences in the two approaches are summarized
in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ehp0114-001199">Table 3</xref> and discussed below.</p><sec><title>Sensitivity</title><p>Historically, drinking water regulations have been based on a tolerable
annual risk of 1 case per 10,000 persons, that is, a goal of fewer than
one case of infection with a particular pathogen per 10,000 persons
attributable to drinking water (<xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Regli et al. 1999</xref>). Although this value is not explicitly used by the U.S. EPA, it is consistent
with their regulatory guidelines (<xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Regli et al. 1999</xref>). Epidemiologic studies, such as the intervention trial conducted in Davenport, generally
cannot measure such low-magnitude risks. The Davenport
trial was powered to detect approximately 1,100 illnesses per 10,000 persons&#x02014;a
smaller risk difference than that observed in previous
studies (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Payment et al. 1991</xref>). To illustrate this lack of sensitivity, we estimated that to power the
Davenport trial to detect an AR of 20 cases per 10,000 persons per
year, a risk similar to that estimated by the risk assessment, would require
a sample size of 8 million individuals; to detect an AR of 100 cases
per 10,000 persons would require 416,000 individuals. The intervention
trial, using traditional levels of statistical significance, lacks
the sensitivity to detect the low number of cases predicted from the
risk assessment.</p><p>In addition to a limited sample size, the sensitivity of a trial may be
decreased because of biases caused by, for example, misclassification
of disease outcomes and exposure (i.e., people with disease are more
or less likely to change their drinking water patterns). Because of randomization, most
misclassification in the trial was likely to be nondifferential; that
is, if subjects are underreporting disease, they are
likely to be doing so equally while in the both the active treatment
and the sham group. Because nondifferential misclassification biases the
estimate of AR toward the null (<xref rid="b23-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Rothman and Greenland 1998</xref>), estimates that do not account for this misclassification (e.g., the
estimate in this study) would likely underestimate the magnitude of these
estimates. Adjusted risk estimates would increase both point estimates
and the upper end of the 95% CI.</p><p>Even if the sensitivity of the intervention trial precludes us from making
any inference within the narrow range of regulatory limits, the trial
data do provide a rigorous direct estimate of the upper bound to the
risk from drinking water. For example, previous drinking water intervention
trials in Canada showed that up to 35% of GI illnesses
were transmitted through a public drinking water system (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Payment et al. 1991</xref>). The Davenport intervention study was adequately powered to detect differences
considerably smaller than this level and clearly demonstrates
that the drinking water risks estimated in Davenport were below those
observed by <xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Payment (1991)</xref>; that is, the upper end of the 95% CI for the percent AR reported
by <xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Colford et al. (2005)</xref> was 10%, whereas the point estimate reported by <xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Payment et al. (1991)</xref> was 35%. For regulatory purposes the upper bound estimate from
Davenport can be interpreted as the largest risk estimate that is still
consistent with the intervention trial results. As mentioned above, this
upper bound estimate is not only based on random error, due to sample
size, but also on systematic error in a trial, such as the biases
due to nondifferential misclassification.</p></sec><sec><title>Causal evidence and pathogen-specific versus symptomatic outcomes</title><p>Risk assessment methods also have limitations. For example, risk estimates
are model based and provide indirect evidence of risk based on water
quality data, whereas the trials focus on direct estimates of illness. Additionally, the
risk estimates include only a subset of the potential
pathogens, compared with the intervention trial, which provides
a risk estimate for diarrheal disease integrated over all pathogens as
well as nonpathogenic causes of diarrhea. In this risk assessment we
were able to provide estimates for two protozoan pathogens, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic>, as well as for culturable viruses. The microbiologic methods, however, identify
all species of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic>, not all of which cause illness. Likewise, viruses that are culturable
are only a subset of known viral pathogens; for example, noroviruses
are a major cause of waterborne viral infections but are not culturable. These
limitations can therefore lead to both under-and overestimates
of risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Model specification and the inclusion of other sources of risk</title><p>The specific model structure used in any risk assessment carries with it
many assumptions. For example, the model in this study was based on
risks associated with source water contamination and did not consider
the potential contamination within the distribution system (<xref rid="b9-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">LeChevallier et al. 2003a</xref>). Another assumption implicit in the model structure is that secondary
transmission is negligible (<xref rid="b5-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b6-ehp0114-001199" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Both of these assumptions can lead to biased results. By incorporating
such processes, risk assessment models can be made more complicated
and perhaps more accurate. Some environmental processes, such as risk
incurred by the distribution system, can be also captured by the intervention
trial and in fact was accounted for in the Davenport trial. Other
processes, such as transmission processes, can be addressed only
in a limited way by observing within-household transmission. Specifically, the
standard intervention trial design is focused on individual-level
risk, assuming that disease outcomes of different individuals are
independent and therefore cannot capture population-level processes such
as secondary transmission. Risk assessment models that incorporate
disease transmission processes are the only models that account for these
population-level conditions. Increasing the complexity of the model, however, leads
to additional uncertainty with respect to model specification
and potentially parameter specification.</p><p>In general, it is impossible to account for all sources of variation. Models
often must rely on estimates from small studies (e.g., dosing trials
conducted on healthy individuals) and on very strong modeling assumptions. Sparse
site-specific data, such as with the source water measurements
of enteric viruses, increase the uncertainty of model-based
estimates.</p><p>Most of these limitations underestimate risk. There are additional uncertainties
that result in overestimates of risk. For example, uncertainties
in treatment&#x02014;<italic>Bacillus</italic> spores are considered conservative indicators of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> removal, and disinfection CT values are based on half-lives, not the full
integration of disinfection contact times.</p></sec><sec><title>Site-specific versus general estimates in risk assessment</title><p>Our finding of a difference in estimates of illness from using site-specific
rather than general U.S. EPA estimates for treatment efficiencies
highlights the importance of a clear definition for a risk assessment. If
the goal of a risk assessment is focused only on risk within a specified
community (or similar communities), then site-specific data may
be most appropriate and worth the additional effort to obtain. If, however, the
goal is to generalize about risk across multiple communities
or large areas, then the general parameter estimates provided by the
U.S. EPA are likely to be more appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Examining alternative control strategies</title><p>One advantage of a model-based risk assessment is that alternative control
strategies can be examined. For example, the pathogen-specific risk
estimates from the risk assessment provided additional information for
focused waterborne disease control strategies. Given that the viral
log removal by disinfection is on the order of 6 or more, the predicted
risk above 1 in 10,000 persons comes from exposure to protozoan species. Thus, if
the risk levels presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001199">Table 2</xref> are of concern, control efforts should be focused on treatment technologies
that address protozoa rather than virus removal. If, on the other
hand, viral log removal by disinfection is &#x02264; 4, control efforts
should be focused on treatment technologies that address viral removal. Given
the limited data to inform this assumption, resources could
be focused on collecting more viral disinfection data.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost and time</title><p>An additional limitation of intervention trials is that they are costly
and time-consuming to conduct. In contrast, risk assessments are relatively
inexpensive and quick to conduct.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Risk assessment and intervention trials provide complementary approaches
to the estimation of a community&#x02019;s burden of disease attributable
to drinking water. Risk assessments can provide estimates of low-risk
situations; require data that are neither difficult nor expensive
to collect; permit the evaluation of scenarios outside the conditions
under which the data were collected and are therefore an attractive
method for characterizing both existing and potential risk from contamination
of drinking water; and can capture population-level processes
such as secondary transmission. Intervention trials provide direct measures
of AR within communities and provide risk estimates based on all
causes of illness attributable to the drinking water. Even when point
estimates of risk are not significant, these direct measures of risk
can provide valuable upper bound estimates.</p><p>Given their expense, intervention trials must be judiciously applied. Risk
assessments can be used to specify the conditions in which future
trials are justified; that is, they can be used to identify high-risk
conditions based on demographics, magnitude and sources of environmental
contamination, and types of treatment processes. Risk assessment can
also provide information on where are the important data gaps. In particular, this
assessment pointed toward the importance of attaining site-specific
treatment data and the clear need for a better understanding
of viral removal by disinfection. Ultimately, the choice of risk assessment, intervention
trials, or both methods used jointly to evaluate
waterborne disease risks depends upon specific research needs and available
funding.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We acknowledge A. Phipps and M. Birkner for conducting the preliminary
