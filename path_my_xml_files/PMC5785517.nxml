Diminished vision from excessive consumption of alcohol has been implicated in industrial, home, and automobile accidents. Alcohol is also generally recognized as an inhibitor in the brain by potentiating GABA-ergic transmission. In this study, we focused on visual motion processing and explored whether moderate alcohol intoxication induced changes in inhibitory mediated motion repulsion in a center-surround configuration. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on the effect of alcohol on visual motion repulsion. Each subject underwent three experimental conditions (no alcohol, placebo and moderate alcohol) on separate days. The order of the placebo and moderate alcohol conditions was counterbalanced. The results showed that the effects of the surround context on the perception of the center motion direction were similar in both the sober (no alcohol) and placebo conditions. However, contextual modulations were significantly stronger during intoxication compared to both the sober and placebo conditions. These results demonstrate that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with altered neural function in visual cortical areas and that motion repulsion deficits might reflect the inhibitory effects of alcohol on the central nervous system.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Acute alcohol consumption disturbs cognitive, attentional, motor, and perceptual functions in a dose-dependent manner. Negative effects occur with a small to moderate blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of approximately 0.4&#x02013;0.5&#x02009;mg/ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A moderate BAC affects sensory functioning. For example, it has been reported that the social and drinking profiles of road crash casualties with BACs greater than 0.5&#x02009;mg/ml differ from those of other casualties. Diminished vision from excessive consumption of alcohol has been implicated in industrial, home, and automobile accidents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, deficits in visual perceptual functions have been widely identified in alcohol intoxication. For example, contrast sensitivity is reduced with a BAC of 0.43&#x02009;mg/ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This deficit is more pronounced with higher dosages of alcohol and depends on the presentation time of the test stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Acute alcohol intake also significantly changes the processing of contrast sensitivity under certain frequencies compared with control conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Similar to visual perceptual deficits at the behavioral level, visually evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes are reduced during the processing of contrast in alcohol intoxication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Compared to the placebo condition, alcohol intoxication was shown to strongly attenuate early visual activity occipito-temporally in an anatomically constrained MEG study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Alcohol is also associated with deficits in inhibitory systems through potentiation of GABA-ergic transmission in many cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Low to moderate concentrations of alcohol have been shown to enhance GABA-ergic inhibition, specifically by enhancing GABA-A receptor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In fact, GABA agonists and reuptake inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of alcohol, whereas GABA antagonists have been shown to reduce the effects of alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the functional relevance of impaired inhibitory processing on visual perceptual dysfunction in acute alcohol ingestion remains elusive.</p><p id="Par4">One compelling phenomenon that inhibits visual information processing is motion repulsion (MR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. MR is characterized by the concept of illusory motion perception, where human performance in a motion discrimination task shows a perceptual misjudgment of the target direction due to irrelevant motion in the spatial surround of the target stimulus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The paradigm is known to give rise to motion repulsion, reflecting a systematic overestimation of the angular difference between two motion directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In particular, subjects misperceive the physical direction of the target motion when the task is irrelevant and the target moves at directions that are approximately 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; away from the target direction. Motion repulsion is commonly interpreted through lateral inhibitory interactions between motion sensitive neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Motion repulsion falls into the same category as the surround suppression effect, which is believed to be important for visually detecting edges and determining the salience of image features during camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Direction discrimination task and experimental design. (<bold>A</bold>) A trial example. Subjects pressed a predefined key to start the trial. Center-surround moving dot patches were presented for 200&#x02009;ms after a 200&#x02009;ms fixation. Observers were required to report whether the motion direction of the center dots was clockwise (CW) or counter clockwise (CCW) from the internal vertical standard by pressing two predefined keys. The blank window was sustained until the subjects responded. The black arrows show the direction of motion in the corresponding part of the stimulus. In this example, the central target contained 100% coherent motion in the vertical upward direction and the surround annulus contained 100% coherent motion at the &#x02212;60&#x000b0; (CCW) diagonal direction. The direction difference between the center target and surround was 60&#x000b0;. (<bold>B</bold>) Experimental design.

Potentiation of inhibitory mechanisms should increase the magnitude of motion repulsion. We employed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study of the effect of alcohol on motion repulsion. Each subject was exposed to three experimental conditions (no alcohol, placebo and moderate alcohol) on separate days. The dose of moderate alcohol was approximately 0.6&#x02009;mg/ml.

On average, the time to complete the motion direction discrimination task was approximately ten minutes, allowing subjects enough time to repeat the same task three times after alcohol intake. The alcohol metabolic curve of each participant was fitted with a Widmark function. Thus, the MR results shown below were obtained at approximately the peak BAC value for each subject. In the sober (no alcohol) and placebo states, all participants started and completed task performance with a BAC of 0&#x02009;mg/ml. When the task was initiated in the intoxicated state, the participants had a mean BAC of 0.66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03&#x02009;mg/ml.

Tests were then conducted under the placebo and intoxication conditions to identify significant differences at each test direction. We found a significant difference between both the surround direction (F (3, 81)&#x02009;=&#x02009;181.97, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, ehat&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.808) and alcohol condition (F (1, 27)&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.65, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), as well as a significant interaction between them (F (3, 81)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.43, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011, ehat&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.821).

The average thresholds for each experimental condition are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>. The direction discrimination thresholds in the intoxicated state were larger than those in the sober and placebo conditions (F (2, 54&#x02009;=&#x02009;29.63, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, ehat&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.775), and the thresholds were modulated by the surround direction (F (3, 81)&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.13, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, ehat&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.812).

If &#x0201c;high cognitive&#x0201d; effects were present, it was suggested not only that subjects should have more lapses in the intoxication condition (less attention to stimulus presentation) but also that the lapses should be independent of the specific surround condition.</p><p id="Par11">The average lapse rate for each experimental condition is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>.

When responding to the target, subjects may have instead responded to the surround direction of motion. If this was the case, then one should expect to see a correlation between the thresholds and biases for a given condition at a fixed surround of 30&#x000b0; or 60&#x000b0;. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation was conducted between the perceptual bias and discrimination threshold. No correlation was found in the &#x000b1;30&#x000b0; (Pearson r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24) or the &#x000b1;60&#x000b0; (Pearson r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.46) surround direction in the intoxication condition.

We found that the magnitudes of motion repulsion in the intoxication state were significantly stronger compared to those of placebo controls. These results can be explained by altered inhibitory processing in motion-sensitive visual cortical areas during intoxication.</p><p id="Par14">One of the main methodological concerns of studying behavioral differences before and after alcohol consumption is the generalized deficit in performance that is found in practically all tasks. This deficit is attributable to impairments in a number of cognitive and/or affective processes. Since alcohol is known to cause multiple cognitive and motor deficits, one might be concerned that the observed differences in the motion estimation task between the placebo and intoxication conditions are driven primarily by cognitive deficits or other general declines rather than by a sensory deficit. For example, participants in the intoxicated state may have a poorer understanding of the task or motor skills required to perform the task.</p><p id="Par15">However, we believe that this explanation is not likely. In our data, the patterns of motion repulsion in the intoxication condition were very similar to those observed in the placebo condition. This indicates that the MR curves in the intoxicated state were modulated by the difference between the center and surround motion directions, similar to the placebo condition. Stated differently, acute moderate alcohol consumption affected the strength of motion repulsion while subjects reliably represented individual perceptual sensitivities. This replicated phenomenon of motion repulsion observed in the intoxication condition cannot be explained by deteriorated cognition or motor skills. Additionally, we found that motion repulsion differences were present in some directions, but disappeared when the actual angular separation was 0&#x000b0; or 30&#x000b0; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). If generalized deficits play a role, then we should expect to observe a global influence, but this was not the case in our data.</p><p id="Par16">Importantly, the overall changes in lapse rates indicate that our subjects had global changes in attention to the task. Our analysis revealed differences between lapse rates in the three conditions. While the intoxication condition showed an increase in lapse rate, this effect was global across surround orientations, indicating that our subjects had &#x0201c;high cognitive&#x0201d; effects unrelated to specific surround conditions. We also found no correlation between the bias and threshold at 30&#x000b0; and 60&#x000b0; surround directions, which also supports the idea that the motion repulsion changes observed in our results were due to low-levels of motion processing alterations that were caused by alcohol intake. In summary, we believe that the altered motion repulsion observed after alcohol ingestion reflects a specific deficit in visual motion processing, not a general cognitive effect.</p><p id="Par17">Motion repulsion during direction judgments is often explained by inhibitory interactions between motion-tuned neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, particularly neurons in area MT/V5 tuned to visual unidirectional motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In our task, the motion direction repulsion was explained by neural inhibition. As a result, increased motion repulsion was likely to lead to higher neural inhibition in the system. Alcohol-related increases in motion repulsion could be explained by behavioral evidence, implying cortical alterations of inhibitory neural processing in motion-sensitive regions. Specifically, the neural inhibition among neurons responsible for the phenomenon of motion repulsion might have been altered under the alcohol intoxication condition. This interpretation is in line with the notion that ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is linked to disrupted inhibitory functioning in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The current findings extend this concept by suggesting that alcohol intoxication is also involved in impaired inhibitory processing in visual motion cortical circuits. Prior investigations indicated that the predominant mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) depression involves selective alcohol interactions with ion channels that include an allosteric enhancement of inhibition that is mediated by gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors, antagonism of excitation by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptors and, possibly, inhibition of central L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Recently, there was a report that showed that moderate acute alcohol intoxication had minimal effects on surround suppression measured with a sinusoidal grating-defined motion direction discrimination task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Notably, this study used a between-subjects design, where subjects were assigned to an alcohol (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) or control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) group. Because the final level of BAC is generally variable between individuals, this study may have missed strong within-subjects effects. Another explanation is that the dose administered was too small to produce detectable effects. The estimated BAC of the alcohol group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> in Read&#x02019;s 2015 population results) was approximately 20&#x02009;mg/100&#x02009;ml, which is much lower than the BAC level (60&#x02009;mg/100&#x02009;ml) in our study. Thus, the previous study cannot exclude the possibility that larger doses would have produced changes in surround suppression.</p><p id="Par19">In summary, our results suggest that moderate acute alcohol intoxication has significant effects on motion repulsion as measured by a RDK motion direction discrimination task. The results were consistent with findings that show suppression effects of ethanol on neural functioning by enhancement of inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors. Thus, we propose that the GABA-ergic system could account for the observed effects in our study.</p><p id="Par20">A possible limitation of the study is the efficacy of placebo beverage administration. All participants had experience with drinking mixed alcoholic beverages. Given their familiarity with the timeline and subjective effects of alcohol metabolism, they might be able to discern the beverage content from a variety of sensations during the course of the entire session. Two participants reported that one of the two provided beverages tasted like null, though they were unaware of the alcohol content. Research in this area indicates that participants are typically &#x0201c;fooled&#x0201d; by placebo beverages and report that they consumed multiple alcoholic beverages following a placebo dosing beverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, the bolus dosing procedure used in the current study produced a profile (time-course, subjective, etc.) that was likely quite different from the typical drinking patterns of most (if not all) participants. Therefore, while the participants may have been able to indicate that the placebo beverage contained a lower amount of alcohol, they were likely unable to deduce that one of the two beverages did not actually contain alcohol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par21">The study consisted of 28 university students and staff (20 males, 20&#x02013;30 years old, mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.3 years) who did not report any somatic, neurological or psychiatric disease. Subjects completed a questionnaire before participating in the study to ensure that there was no problematic drinking or health conditions. All participants had experience with the dose of alcohol administered in the study, but they were neither binge drinkers nor regular drinkers. Those who reported consistent binge drinking at least once per week were not included in the study. Additionally, subjects were asked to abstain from both stimulants and sedatives, such as caffeine, nicotine, guanine, ethanol and benzodiazepines, for at least one day prior to the experiments. Participants were also asked to fast for one hour prior to alcohol administration. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (mean decimal acuity was 1.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17) and were naive to the purpose of the experiment. This research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Science and Technology of China and followed the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The experiment was conducted in a dimly illuminated room. To avoid local cues of the vertical/horizontal position, the screen was delimited by a 30.0&#x02009;cm diameter circular window cut out of black cardboard. Luminance values were obtained with the help of the contrast box switcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which allowed the luminance range digitization to be extended above 10&#x02009;bits. The eye-to-screen distance was maintained with a chin rest and fixed at 1.5&#x02009;meters. Luminance values were obtained from a 256 RGB gray levels look-up table.

Specifically, the stimulus was a center-surround structure filled with moving random-dot patterns (10&#x02009;dots/square degree; coherence&#x02009;=&#x02009;100%, each dot had speed of 8&#x000b0;/s, 0.1&#x000b0; diameter, and RGB value was 0; dot lifetime was infinite). The stimulus was presented on a mean background with a 45&#x02009;cd/m<sup>2</sup> luminance. The radius of the virtual circular aperture (target) was 1.5&#x000b0;, and the surround annulus virtual aperture had an inner/outer radius of 1.5/4.5&#x000b0; (context; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The stimulus in each trial was presented for 200&#x02009;ms after a 200&#x02009;ms fixation, and no feedback was provided. The surround direction of motion was defined with respect to the center target direction and was one of 7 predefined values, from &#x02212;90&#x000b0; to +90&#x000b0; in increments of 30&#x000b0;. A surround of 0&#x000b0; had a motion direction equal to the central target motion direction. Positive and negative values corresponded to clockwise and counterclockwise directions from 0&#x000b0;, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The perceived direction (counterclockwise or clockwise relative to vertical upward) was reported by pressing left or right arrows on a keyboard. There were 560 trials (80 trials &#x000d7;7 surround directions) in each task, and all conditions were pseudorandomly presented to each subject. The target motion direction was varied from trial to trial for measuring the perceived upward direction of motion under a surround motion direction. A weighted up-down adaptive procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> was used for psychometric curve measurement. For each surround direction, two staircases were assigned with up/down steps of 3/1 and 1/3 in steps of 1&#x000b0;, respectively. Each staircase contained 40 trials, with a starting direction of &#x02212;15&#x000b0;/+15&#x000b0; positioned at the opposite side of the convergence point, allowing for rapid measurement within the transition region of the psychometric function.</p><p id="Par24">Participants were instructed to fixate on a small black cross displayed at the center of the screen and were told that the stimulus would be presented there.

Each subject was exposed three experimental conditions (no alcohol, placebo and moderate alcohol) on separate days. The dose of moderate alcohol was approximately 0.6&#x02009;mg/ml. The no alcohol measure was conducted first. In both the placebo and alcohol conditions, subjects were told that they would receive alcohol. In the placebo condition, several drops of alcohol were floated on the top of each cup of juice to provide the taste and smell of alcohol. Thus, subjects in the placebo condition expected alcohol, but received only a negligible amount, while subjects in the alcohol condition both expected and received alcohol. The order of placebo and alcohol measures was counterbalanced to control for possible learning effects. During each experimental condition, subjects performed the same visual direction discrimination task. Additionally, the experiment was double-blind, in that neither the subjects nor the experimental data analyst were aware of the conditions.</p><p id="Par26">Subjects were first weighed to calculate the appropriate dose of alcohol for each participant. Experiments and trials were initiated by subjects with a keyboard press. Subjects were requested to fixate on a small black square at the center of the screen.
