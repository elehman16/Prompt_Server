One previous study documented the positive effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in reducing newborns&#x02019; length of stay (LOS).

Outcome assessors will be blinded of study design and group allocation. The primary outcome is the mean difference in days between discharge and entry. Secondary outcomes are difference in daily weight gain, number of episodes of vomit, regurgitation, stooling, use of enema, time to full enteral feeding and NICU costs.

The last report of the WHO showed that more than 1 in 10 infants are born prematurely, resulting in 15 million premature infants worldwide in 2010.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> In spite of expensive neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), structural changes in the health care system have led to evidence-based guidelines that reduce preterm infants&#x02019; hospitalisation and deaths. A large rate of US paediatric hospital stays is secondary to neonatal conditions that rank among the most expensive items in the list of services provided for children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> The highest average cost per infant is for preterm newborns with gestational age (GA) between 24 and 31&#x02005;weeks, followed by those between 32 and 36&#x02005;weeks, as opposed to the general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Costs per surviving infant generally decrease with increasing GA. In the USA, preterm/low birth weight (LBW) infants account for half the hospitalisation costs of all newborns and one-quarter of overall paediatric costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> In Italy, the cost per infant per day ranged between &#x020ac;200 and &#x020ac;500 according to infants&#x02019; health conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>Length of stay (LOS) in NICUs is strongly associated with GA and birth weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Infants delivered at the earliest GA have the longest hospital stays, partly because of the higher incidence of medical complications in very LBW infants. The Italian healthcare institute reported an average LOS per different diagnostic categories ranging from 4 to 34&#x02005;days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>However, compared to term infants, premature infants are unique in their need to attain not only medical stability but also physiological maturity, including adequate temperature control, cessation of apnoea and bradycardia and adequate feeding behaviour, before they are safely discharged home.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>Patterns of hospitalisation of preterm infants are also associated with the presence of clinical symptoms of abnormal gastrointestinal function such as vomiting, regurgitation, gastric residuals and functional constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11">9&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Osteopathy is a form of drug-free non-invasive manual medicine, designated as complementary and alternative medicine. It relies on manual contact for diagnosis and treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> It respects the relationship of body, mind and spirit in health and disease; it lays emphasis on the structural and functional integrity of the body and the body&#x02019;s intrinsic tendency for self-healing. Osteopathic practitioners use a wide variety of therapeutic manual techniques to improve physiological function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by somatic (body framework) dysfunction (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code M99.00-09), that is, impaired or altered function of related components of the somatic system; skeletal, arthrodial and myofascial structures; and related vascular, lymphatic and neural elements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p><p>Osteopathic practitioners use their understanding of the relationship between structure and function to optimise the body's self-regulating, self-healing capabilities. This holistic approach to patient care and healing is based on the concept that a human being is a dynamic functional unit, in which all parts are interrelated possess self-regulatory and self-healing mechanisms. Two essential components of osteopathic health care are the structural evaluation of the patient for diagnosis and an array of manipulative techniques for treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Aim of the structural examination is to locate somatic dysfunctions, while the array of manipulative techniques is used to relieve tissues&#x02019; tensions, improve blood flow and lymphatic drainage.</p><p>Although several studies document the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in a population of paediatric patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref> the medical literature lacks information about any potential benefits of the use of OMT in preterm infants. The only study published demonstrated a potential positive effect of OMT in reducing the likelihood of excessive LOS and gastrointestinal symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>Aim of this multicentre randomised controlled trial is to examine the association between OMT and LOS in a larger population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>Primary outcome is to evaluate the effectiveness of OMT in reducing LOS in a sample of premature infants.</p><p>Secondary outcome of the study is to evaluate the difference in daily weight gain, number of episodes of vomit and regurgitation, stooling, use of enema, time to full enteral feeding (breastfeeding and/or bottle) and NICU costs.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study type</title><p>Interventional, multicentre nationwide single-blinded randomised controlled trial.

In this trial, osteopathic care is not based on a predetermined protocol but on needs-based approach. Thus subjects can potentially be exposed to different techniques, leading to intersubjects and intrasubjects OMT variability. Nevertheless, the objective is to provide evidence of the impact of osteopathic approach rather than the association with a given manual protocol.</p><p>On the basis of quantitative data, the scope is to estimate the effect of OMT across different centres, proving generalisability on the effectiveness of osteopathy in NICUs. Well-designed researches are scarce in the osteopathic area, thus the present study will provide the most convincing evidence of relationship between exposure and effect.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study in osteopathy applied to infants using gold-standards methods that include a randomised multicentre approach, a single hub computer-based data collection and a large sample size stratified by risk factors. In addition to this, the statistics that will be used will be aimed to consider different sources of variability, to allow reliable results for the effectiveness of OMT. Finally, the expected benefits for the intervention provided in the trial are shorter period of hospitalisation and improvements in the secondary outcomes, leading to enhanced quality of health service delivered and cost reductions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e222" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002187.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e223" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002187.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors would like to thank Accorsi Alessandro, Cozzolino Vincenzo, D'Orazio Marianna, Gualdi Stefano, Lupacchini Mariacristina and Marinelli Benedetta for their precious contributions.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FC, GP and GB conceptualised, designed and wrote the protocol.
