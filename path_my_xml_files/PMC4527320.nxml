Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of developing GDM. Today, GDM is diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a rather cumbersome test for the women and health care system. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether HbA1c in first trimester of pregnancy could be used as a screening test for GDM in first trimester and throughout pregnancy in order to reduce the number of OGTTs, and whether it could predict preeclampsia and macrosomia in women with PCOS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Post hoc analyses of data from 228 women from a prospective, randomised, multicenter study comparing metformin to placebo from first trimester to delivery. Fasting and 2-h plasma glucose were measured during a 75&#x000a0;g OGTT in first trimester, gestational week 19 and 32 as well as fasting plasma glucose in gestational week 36. GDM was diagnosed by WHO criteria from 1999 in first trimester and throughout pregnancy and by <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria (i.e. lacking the 1-h plasma glucose value) in first trimester. The diagnostic accuracy was assessed by logistic regression and ROC curve analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The area under the ROC curve for first trimester HbA1c for screening of GDM diagnosed by WHO criteria in first trimester was 0.60 (95&#x000a0;% CI 0.44-0.75) and 0.56 (95&#x000a0;% CI 0.47-0.65) for GDM diagnosed throughout pregnancy. Only 2.2&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 0.7-5.1&#x000a0;%) of the participants could have avoided OGTT. HbA1c was not statistically significantly associated with GDM diagnosed by <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria in first trimester. However, first trimester HbA1c was statistically significantly associated with preeclampsia. Both HbA1c and GDM by WHO criteria in first trimester, but not by IADPSG, were negatively associated with birth weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>First trimester HbA1c can not be used to exclude or predict GDM in women with PCOS, but it might be better to predict preeclampsia than the GDM diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12902-015-0039-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>Preeclampsia</kwd><kwd>Birth weight</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as hyperglycemia first detected in pregnancy that is less severe than diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Women with GDM are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially preeclampsia and macrosomia of the newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Today, several sets of diagnostic criteria exist for GDM and a common feature is that they are based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These tests are time-consuming, require overnight fasting and some women become nauseous after drinking the glucose solution. Glycated hemoglobin A1c in blood (HbA1c), a marker of chronic glycaemia, has been approved as a diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has several advantages compared to OGTT, as fasting, glucose ingestion and timed samples are not required, and the preanalytical instability is less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, the analysis is now well standardised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Several studies on the possible role of HbA1c in screening for GDM have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], where HbA1c typically has been measured in late second or third trimester. The results from most of the studies are consistent with HbA1c not being a suitable screening test for GDM. Recently, Fong et al. found that women with HbA1c of 5.7-6.4&#x000a0;% at first prenatal visit (up to 20&#x000a0;weeks of gestation) had a 3-fold higher risk of developing GDM compared to those with HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.7&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The result remained statistically significant when the analysis was restricted to those with HbA1c measured in first trimester.</p><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by oligo-amenorrhea, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. According to the Rotterdam criteria, at least two of the three characteristics must be present to diagnose the syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PCOS is considered to be the most common endocrine disorder among women of fertile age. In a Norwegian study, the prevalence of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria was 14.2&#x000a0;% in women with previous term deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study of 392 adult Turkish women the prevalence was 19.9&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and 17.8&#x000a0;% in a birth cohort-based study of Australian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared to BMI-matched women not having PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They also have an increased risk of developing GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A prevalence of GDM of 25.6&#x000a0;% and 24.2&#x000a0;% by the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and <italic>modified</italic> (i.e. lacking the 1-h plasma glucose value) International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria, respectively, has been reported in a Norwegian PCOS population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is widely held that in many women GDM is an early manifestation of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is suggested that women at increased risk of diabetes should be tested for hyperglycemia early in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As far as we know, no study on HbA1c in pregnant women with PCOS has been published. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether first trimester HbA1c in women with PCOS could be used to screen for GDM in first trimester and GDM diagnosed throughout pregnancy, in order to reduce the number of OGTTs. A secondary aim was to study whether first trimester HbA1c could predict preeclampsia and macrosomia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The current study used data from the previously reported PregMet (Metformin treatment in pregnant women with PCOS) study which was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial in women with PCOS comparing 2000&#x000a0;mg metformin daily against placebo from first trimester to delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Pregnant women with PCOS aged 18-45 years with a singleton viable fetus between gestational week 5 and 12 were included. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria before the actual pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

At gestational week 36, fasting plasma or serum glucose was measured. Those already diagnosed with GDM did not perform a new OGTT, only fasting plasma or serum glucose was measured at subsequent time points. All participants received written and verbal diet recommendations according to the general guidelines for all pregnant women in Norway. Those diagnosed with GDM received more thorough diet and lifestyle advice.

The selection of variables considered for the models was based on variables that should be more easily available to the clinician in the first trimester than HbA1c, and that are known to be associated with or suspected to influence on the dependent variable.

However, more than one third of those avoiding an OGTT would be incorrectly classified. This was also true for GDM-WHO and GDM diagnosed by <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria in first trimester only. However, first trimester HbA1c was statistically significantly associated with preeclampsia, a complication that the GDM diagnosis is supposed to predict, but could not predict in this study.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study on HbA1c as a screening test for GDM in pregnant women with PCOS, who have a significantly increased risk of GDM, compared to an average pregnant population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Several studies have indicated that HbA1c is not a suitable screening test for GDM, but most of them have measured HbA1c in late second or third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Maegawa et al. evaluated HbA1c in first trimester as a screening test for GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The population consisted of pregnant women in Japan. They used the GDM criteria of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Japan Diabetes Society, where two or more of the following results had to be present to diagnose GDM: Fasting glucose&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L, 1-h glucose after 75-g OGTT&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/L and 2-h glucose after 75-g OGTT&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8.3&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Their conclusion, that first trimester HbA1c was not suitable as a screening test for GDM diagnosed by glucose-based criteria, is in line with our present observation in PCOS women. Further, Hughes et al. found an area under the ROC curve for first trimester HbA1c in detecting GDM diagnosed by IADPSG OGTT criteria before gestational week 20 of only 0.711 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. An HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4.8&#x000a0;% (29&#x000a0;mmol/mol) excluded GDM, however, the specificity was only 3.0&#x000a0;%. The study took place in a primary care setting in a population with a relatively low risk of GDM.</p><p>WHO states that women with hyperglycemia detected in pregnancy are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially preeclampsia and macrosomia, and that treating GDM is effective in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In other words, a major goal in diagnosing GDM is to identify those at risk of pregnancy complications. According to our results, GDM-WHO in first trimester and HbA1c in first trimester were both negatively associated with birth weight, while the GDM-IADPSG diagnosis in first trimester was not associated with birth weight. It is noteworthy that the associations were in the opposite direction from what we expected, i.e. higher HbA1c and GDM-WHO in first trimester were associated with lower birth weight. Further, we found that HbA1c in first trimester was significantly associated with preeclampsia, while the GDM-WHO and the GDM-IADPSG diagnoses in first trimester were not. The OR for preeclampsia per % increase in HbA1c was as high as 17, but due to a relatively low number of study participants the uncertainty of the estimate was large (95&#x000a0;% CI 2.4-115). The HAPO (Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome) study concluded that for plasma glucose and HbA1c the ORs were similar for primary cesarean section, preeclampsia and preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These results are not in line with the present study, but in the HAPO study, glucose and HbA1c were measured during gestational week 24-32, which may explain some of the discrepancy. Another possible explanation is that we studied only pregnant women with PCOS. One study examining whether first trimester HbA1c could detect women at increased risk of preeclampsia, was the previously mentioned study by Hughes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They found that the relative risk for preeclampsia was 2.42 (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.34-4.38) for women with a first trimester HbA1c of 5.9-6.4&#x000a0;% (41-46&#x000a0;mmol/mol) compared to those with HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.9&#x000a0;%. However, no results on first trimester plasma glucose or GDM in predicting preeclampsia were reported, so we cannot compare HbA1c to any of those.</p><p>In several of the diagnostic criteria for GDM used today, including the WHO and IADPSG criteria, only one plasma glucose value above a diagnostic cut-off limit is required to diagnose GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The reproducibility of OGTT in pregnancy, measured with 1-2 weeks gap, has been reported to be poor; 22-24&#x000a0;% of the participants were reclassified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Considering the results of Hughes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (i.e. that HbA1c identifies women at increased risk of preeclampsia) and ours (i.e. that HbA1c might be a better predictor for preeclampsia than GDM diagnosis), the poor reproducibility of OGTT in pregnancy and advantages of HbA1c compared to OGTT (as fasting, glucose ingestion and timed samples is not required, and that the preanalytical instability is less), we suggest that HbA1c in first trimester should be further evaluated as a possible risk marker for preeclampsia and compared to GDM diagnosed by established criteria in larger, prospective studies in various populations.</p><p>Women with fasting plasma or serum glucose&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/L at time of inclusion were not included in the study, so our results are not representative for that group of women. However, only one of the 348 women considered eligible for inclusion was not included due to a fasting plasma glucose &#x0003e;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/L. Further, only one woman had a plasma glucose result at the time she was diagnosed with GDM-WHO above the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. She had elevated fasting plasma glucose in gestational week 36. Our results are not representative for pregnant women with glucose values consistent with diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant adults. In the study by Hughes et al. the area under the ROC curve for first trimester HbA1c in detecting diabetes diagnosed by WHO OGTT criteria before 20&#x000a0;weeks gestation was 0.991, with a sensitivity of 100&#x000a0;% and specificity of 97.4&#x000a0;% at the optimal cut-off point of 5.9&#x000a0;% (41&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Accordingly, one could expect that first trimester HbA1c performs better as a screening test for higher degrees of glycemia than in our study, also in pregnant women with PCOS.</p><p>About one third of the women in the present study used metformin at conception and in early pregnancy, followed by a washout period of at least 7&#x000a0;days before inclusion in the study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Further, half of the participants were randomised to metformin from first trimester to delivery (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Seventy-nine women (35&#x000a0;%) did not use metformin at any time point during pregnancy. GDM prevalence and main characteristics by metformin use and GDM status can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. As metformin is an antidiabetic drug, one could suspect that the use of metformin might have influenced our results. Currently, the only randomised controlled trial on women with PCOS on metformin versus placebo from first trimester to delivery with GDM as one of the outcome measures is the PregMet study, which the present results are from. In the PregMet study, metformin did not demonstrate an effect on the prevalence of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further, in the pilot study to the PregMet study, no effect of metformin on indices of glucose homeostasis in women with PCOS was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, this does not exclude that metformin has an effect during pregnancy, and especially, it says nothing about the effect of metformin at conception and early in pregnancy. Because of this, randomisation was considered as an independent variable in the models predicting GDM throughout pregnancy, preeclampsia and birth weight. Using metformin after randomisation did not reach the significance level required to be included in a model (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.10) for any of the models. Further, using metformin at conception and in early pregnancy was also considered as an independent variable for all the models in the present study, in order to adjust for possible confounding. It only reached the significance level required to be included in a model (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.10) for the models predicting birth weight.</p><p>Those diagnosed with GDM-WHO in the present study received more thorough diet and lifestyle advice compared to those with NGT-WHO, and two were treated with insulin, and could thereby have prevented adverse outcomes. By this, it is possible that the associations between the predictor variables and the adverse pregnancy outcomes are underestimated. Further, we were only able to evaluate HbA1c as a screening test related to <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria as 1-h glucose values from OGTT were not available. Studies using <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria have already been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The proportion of GDM cases diagnosed by 1-h value only when using the IADPSG criteria, has been estimated to 14-21&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. According to this, we might have lost up to one fifth of GDM-IADPSG cases, and this must be kept in mind when interpreting the results. In addition, we could evaluate HbA1c as a screening test for GDM diagnosed by the <italic>modified</italic> IADPSG criteria in first trimester only, and not later in pregnancy. The reason for this was that those with a GDM diagnosis by the WHO criteria did not perform an OGTT at later time points, i.e. only those not diagnosed with GDM-WHO performed OGTT at later time points. As an example if a woman got GDM by WHO criteria because of a 2-h serum glucose value of 8.0&#x000a0;mmol/L and fasting plasma glucose of 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L, she would not get the diagnosis by IADPSG criteria, and we would not know if she would have developed GDM by IADPSG criteria at a later time point. Accordingly, we cannot tell whether first trimester HbA1c could be a potential screening test for GDM diagnosed by IADPSG criteria later in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In women with PCOS, first trimester HbA1c is not a good screening test for GDM in the first trimester or later in pregnancy; however, it might be better than the GDM diagnosis in predicting preeclampsia.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12902_2015_39_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
