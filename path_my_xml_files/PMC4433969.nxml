stroke patients using computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR). [Subjects]
Twenty-five stroke patients were randomly allocated to either the CACR group (n=12) or the
control group (n=13). [Methods] Two expert therapists provided the CACR group and the
control group with traditional rehabilitation therapy in 30-minute sessions, semi-weekly,
for 6 weeks. CACR was provided only to the CACR group. The control group received
traditional rehabilitation therapy only. Before and after the 6 weeks of intervention,
electroencephalography (EEG) and a computerized neurocognitive function test (CNT) were
performed, and the results were analyzed. [Results] After the intervention, the CACR group
showed significant differences in the frontal lobe (Fp1, Fp2, and F4) and in the parietal
lobe (P3 and P4), and also showed significant differences in CNT memory (DST and VST
forward/backward test) and attention (VCPT correct responses), but no notable changes were
observed in the control group. [Conclusion] These results suggest that CACR is feasible
and suitable for individuals with stroke. Detailed and diverse investigations should be
performed considering the numbers and characteristics of subjects, and the limitations
affecting the CACR training period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR)</kwd><kwd>Brain wave</kwd><kwd>Computerized neurocognitive function test (CNT)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients suffer neurotransmission problems, decreases in cognitive and visual
perceptions, damage to the sensitivity of sight, decrease in peripheral sensory sensitivity,
and disorders in the vestibular system. Stroke also causes trouble with spatial recognition,
and adjustment of movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke can
result in various problems when performing activities of daily life, such as eating,
clothing, bathing and moving, eventually leading to partial or complete dependency<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stroke limits body function, and its effects vary depending on the location of the affected
area and the level of injury sustained, and it often induces other disorders involving
cognition, visual perception, sensation, and linguistic abilities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive impairment often accompanies various neurological disorders such as stroke.
Mobility is also affected when stroke patients experience cognitive disorders over a long
period. As cognitive impairment increases the difficulty of rehabilitation, a therapeutic
approach involving cognitive impairment is vital for rehabilitation training, and cognitive
rehabilitation using an integrated treatment method is essential.</p><p>There are many methods of treatment for increase of cognitive functions, such as music
therapy, reminiscence therapy, methods for compensating cognitive functions such as memory
assistants, methods for improving memory capability using picture cards or family photos,
methods for inducing improvement in learning ability through virtual reality for people with
memory damage, and computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CACR has recently been highlighted as a cognitive rehabilitation method. CACR was initially
used for improving the memory of patients with brain damage<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It provides objective evaluation and instant feedback on the
patients&#x02019; task performance, and also gives cognitive training based on the
neuropsychological patterns of patients to stimulate the damaged location<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Clinical use of CACR has increased in the treatment of neurological patients, since its
level of difficulty can be adjusted to suit an individual&#x02019;s cognitive level, which reduces
treatment time and costs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to eliminate problems arising from cultural and
linguistic differences, CACR has been translated into the Korean language and is being used
in clinics, and investigations on the effectiveness of CACR for brain-damaged patients are
continuing<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent developments in medical engineering have led to increased clinical use of CACR in
the cognitive rehabilitation field. However, only a limited number of studies have
investigated the effectiveness of brain wave changes and cognitive improvements using this
training method to treat stroke patients. This study aimed to determine the most effective
treatment method for clinicians in the cognitive rehabilitation field by investigating the
changes in stroke patients&#x02019; brain waves, memory and attention elicited by CACR, and the
manner in which these changes affect daily life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were chosen from among thirty stroke patients who were hospitalized

onset within 3 months to 1&#x02005;year, who were able to follow verbal instructions, and
communicate to a certain level. In addition, participants were chosen from among patients
who were able to perform all tests and had experienced light cognitive function failures
that scored between 18 and 23 on the mini mental state examination (MMSE). Subjects were
excluded if they had diplegia, had never attended a school, were biased, or had received
CACR within the past year. All the patients who participated in this study signed a written
consent form after receiving a full explanation of the expected result and side effects of
the study. CACR training was conducted over a period of 6 weeks, in consideration of the
hospitalization period. As the participants were recruited successively, the training was
conducted over 8 weeks. The evaluation included measurements of brain waves and cognitive
function. The control group received occupational therapy and physical therapy, for half an
hour 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The CACR group received the same rehabilitation as the
control group with extra CACR training for half an hour 5 times a week for 6 weeks. Exercise
was prescribed and supervised by two experienced physical therapists. All of the protocols
used in this study were approved by Gachon University. Before beginning the study, the
procedures, risks and benefits were explained to all of the participants, who gave their
informed consent. The CACR program used in the present study, RehaCom (Hospi, Seoul, Korea),
was developed in 1989, and has been used for clinical purposes and in previous research<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It provides cognitive rehabilitation
treatment for patients with cognitive disorders or deficiency with the help of a computer.
Feedback on the result during and after the treatment is provided, which is helpful for
completing the training and developing the right learning strategies for the patient. A
joystick and touch screen can be used as the input device in RehaCom, and the patients could
complete the training using a reaction board while seated and watching the screen. The
attention and concentration programs were chosen from the various CACR programs of RehaCom
and performed for 30 minutes each time according to each patient&#x02019;s functional ability; the
awakening, reactivity, attention and concentration, simultaneous attention, and selective
attention programs were used.</p><p>QEEG-8 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was used to collect brain wave data. The participants
were seated in a comfortable chair, and the method of the trial was explained before brain
wave measurements were performed. The poles were checked after being attached to the
participant&#x02019;s scalp to determine if they were functioning properly. After a 3-minute break,
brain waves were measured for 3 minutes while the participants stared at a designated spot
to the front in a fixed posture. The brain wave poles were attached to 8 regions of the
scalp, and brain waves were measured using the monopolar derivation method. The attachment
location of the poles followed the international 10/20 Electrode System. Eight poles were
attached in the following order: left frontopolar lobe (Fp1), right frontopolar lobe (Fp2),
left frontal lobe (F3), right frontal lobe (F4), left temporal lobe (T3), right temporal
lobe (T4), left parietal lobe (P3), and right parietal lobe (P4). The reference electrode
was attached behind the right earlobe, and the ground electrode was attached to the left
earlobe.</p><p>A computerized neurocognitive function test (CNT) was used to assess memory and attention.
It is comprised of 5 main categories and 17 sub-test for brain disorders. Among these
sub-tests, the digit span test (DST) and visual span test (VST), which test memory, and the
visual continuous performance test (VCPT) and auditory controlled continuous performance
test (ACCPT), which test attention, were used. These four tests, DST, VST, VCPT, and ACCPT
were performed in order from the easiest to the hardest, and they were performed by everyone
in the same order. When the patients used the touch screen, we let the patients use their
non-paralyzed arms<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS ver. 12.0 was used to calculate the averages and standard deviations. The significance
of brain wave, memory and attention differences within a group, before and after the
treatment, was tested using the paired t-test, and the significance of differences between
the groups was tested using the independent t-test. For all data, statistical significance
was accepted at values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Change of brain waves at the eight channels and CNT with respect to CACR training are shown

the temporooccipital lobe, supplementary motor area, and anterior cingulate gyrus before the
intervention than in healthy controls. However, after the cognitive training the frontal
lobe activation had decreased and the anterior cingulate gyrus and right parietal lobe were
more activated. This result reflects the improvement in the patients&#x02019; cognition elicited by
CACR, and continuing the CACR may have spread the activation to other parts of the brain.
Moreover, a difference in the level of brain activation could be predicted based on the
extent of injury that had been sustained by the patient, indicating the necessity of more
subdivided and specialized research into the differences in brain activation depending on
which area of the brain is injured. CACR can be performed by patients with a wide range of
cognitive function. However, for a more effective treatment, it will be necessary to select
different treatments for different diagnoses, inhibitory vs. reward brain waves as
appropriate for the diagnosis. To obtain better evidence of the effects of CACR training,
standardized and accurate EEG measurement and analysis of more than 8 channels will be
necessary.</p><p>CNT concentration assessments can check the attention deficit of brain damaged patients,
and it can also be used as an indicator of the degree of brain damage or recovery of a
patient<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shim et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted ComCog CACR, with traditional
rehabilitation therapy for stroke hemiplegic patients, and the results of cognitive function
assessments with CNT showed that the CACR group showed significant improvements in memory
and attention compared to the group that only received traditional rehabilitation therapy.
In our study, the CACR group showed a significant difference in CNT memory (DST and VST
forward/back ward test) (p&#x0003c;0.05) attention (VCPT correct response) (p&#x0003c;0.05), but no
notable changes were observed in the control group.</p><p>CACR practice based on cognitive rehabilitation therapy usually focuses on memory and
attention, and Kim et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
significant improvements in long-term and short-term memory after CACR memory training, and
Gilsky<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that even though
brain-damaged patients are slower than normal people, they can still acquire a great deal of
knowledge and skills related to everyday life.</p><p>The results cited above indicate that CACR is more helpful at improving the cognitive
function of stroke patients than the use of traditional rehabilitation alone. Besides these
effects, CACR, which use computer games, is a helpful therapeutic mediation method,
considering the convenience and appeal of games. The recovery depends on the injured area
and the injury period; however, intensive rehabilitation, duration, and the patients&#x02019; will
to recover also play important roles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
rehabilitation method, which is performed over a long period, should be easy and interesting
to maintain the active participation of the patient. The average age of the participants in
this study was 60.0&#x02005;years, and thus, most patients were unfamiliar with computers and
electronic devices. However, the patients were familiar with program selection and the
assignment after the second run, and most of the participants actively participated in the
CACR.</p><p>Standardized and more accurate brain wave measurement and analysis are required to provide
sufficient evidence of the benefits of CACR training. In addition, if cognitive function
recovery can be expedited by conducting CACR for stroke patients with cognitive injury, the
patients would be expected to have a quicker rehabilitation. Thus, CACR program development
and activation are required, and more specialized research based on the location of the
brain lesion in patients with cognitive injury would be beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Shumway-Cook</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollacott</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group>: Motor control: Theory and practical applications.
