Based on the current literature, the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of these two FXa inhibitors share some general features.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The bioavailability of apixaban is ~50% and is not significantly influenced by dose or administration with meals.<xref rid="b3-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Rivaroxaban bioavailability ranges from 66%&#x02013;100%, depending on the dose and whether or not the dose is administered with a meal. Rivaroxaban requires administration with food to achieve similar bioavailability between a 10 mg dose and doses &#x02265;15 mg.<xref rid="b4-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Both agents are readily absorbed, achieving maximal plasma concentrations ~3 hours after administration. Protein binding is similar for the two compounds (apixaban ~87%, rivaroxaban ~93%). Apixaban and rivaroxaban also share similar pathways of elimination including metabolism, mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), as well as biliary and renal elimination, and have relatively similar terminal half-lives (apixaban ~12 hours, rivaroxaban ~10 hours). Despite these similar PK properties, these agents are administered differently. Rivaroxaban is administered once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), or a combination of QD and BID, depending on the indication, whereas apixaban is administered BID for all indications. Although individual literature reports are helpful to form a general understanding of their relative PK and PD profiles, no direct comparisons of these agents have been performed in humans. Such a comparison could help elucidate how their PK and PD properties, along with their posology, relate to observed clinical outcomes, and may aid in the transition between therapies. The purpose of this study was to compare the PK and PD (anti-factor Xa activity [AXA]) profiles of apixaban (2.5 mg BID) and rivaroxaban (10 mg QD) in healthy subjects at the doses and schedules approved for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following elective knee or hip replacement surgery.<xref rid="b5-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This study (EudraCT 2009-017278-19) was a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-treatment crossover study in 14 healthy subjects. Primary objectives were to assess the multiple-dose, steady-state PK profiles and compare plasma concentration peak-to-trough ratios (C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub>) of rivaroxaban 10 mg QD with those of apixaban 2.5 mg BID following oral administration in healthy subjects. Secondary objectives included assessment of the multiple-dose, steady-state AXA profiles and safety and tolerability of these agents. The study was carried out in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, including all amendments in effect up to the time the study was conducted. Study protocol and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by an independent ethical committee (Stichting Beoordeling Biomedisch Ethiek Onderzoek, Assen, the Netherlands), and all parts of the study were in compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive (EU CTD) 2001/20/EC.</p><p>Screening was carried out within 21 days prior to study drug administration and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to the start of any study-related procedures.</p><p>Eligible subjects were admitted to the clinical facility (PRA International, Zuidlaren, the Netherlands) the day before the first treatment period and remained in the clinical facility for the duration of the study.

Blood samples (2.7 mL) for measurement of apixaban plasma concentrations were collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes predose on days 1 and 4 of each treatment period and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after the morning dose, and at predose (12 hours) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 60 hours after the evening dose on day 4 of the treatment period. Samples were stored on ice immediately after collection and processed within 30 minutes by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 1,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 4&#x000b0;C.

(Middleton, WI, USA), respectively. For apixaban, sample extraction for plasma utilized protein precipitation. Apixaban-M4 (a hydroxylated metabolite of apixaban) was used as the internal standard for the assay. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for apixaban was 1.00 ng/mL. The between-run and within-run variability (coefficient of variation [CV]) for apixaban in quality control samples were &#x02264;6.7% and &#x02264;4.1%, respectively, with deviations from the nominal concentration of no more than &#x000b1;3.7%. All samples were analyzed within the period of analyte stability. For rivaroxaban, sample extraction for plasma utilized liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction. Rivaroxaban-d4 (deuterium-radiolabeled rivaroxaban) was used as the internal standard for the assay. The LLOQ for rivaroxaban was 0.5 ng/mL. The between-run and within-run variability (CV) for rivaroxaban in quality control samples were &#x02264;5.1% and &#x02264;8.8%, respectively, with deviations from the nominal concentration of no more than &#x000b1;5.6%.

A total of 14 healthy subjects (eleven male, three female) were enrolled and received study medication. All 14 subjects completed the study.

Median time to peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 2 hours for both compounds. Peak concentrations were followed by a multiphasic decline with a mean terminal half-life of 8.7 hours for apixaban versus 7.9 hours for rivaroxaban. Evaluation of mean trough concentrations on days 4 and 5 indicated that steady state for both apixaban and rivaroxaban had been reached by the fourth day of dosing. On day 4, rivaroxaban C<sub>max</sub> was 171 ng/mL, ~2-fold higher than for apixaban (81 ng/mL). Conversely, the C<sub>min</sub> for rivaroxaban (10 ng/mL) was ~40% lower than for apixaban (17 ng/mL). The greater fluctuation in rivaroxaban plasma concentration over the dosing interval was reflected in the differences in the C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio. The geometric mean of the C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio for rivaroxaban (16.9) was 3.6-fold higher (90% CI: 2.82&#x02013;4.61) than that for apixaban (4.7). Despite the difference in C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio over the dosing interval, the daily AUC at steady state (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) was only ~17% higher for rivaroxaban (mean [%CV] AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub>: rivaroxaban =1,094 [29] ng &#x000b7; h/mL; apixaban =935 [24] ng &#x000b7; h/mL). Intersubject variability, expressed as %CV, was lower for apixaban exposure parameters (20%&#x02013;24%) than for rivaroxaban exposure parameters (29%&#x02013;46%).</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>The results of the PD analyses were similar to those of the PK analyses for apixaban and rivaroxaban.

A close temporal relationship between plasma concentration and AXA was seen for both compounds across the dosing interval (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cpaa-6-179">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cpaa-6-179">3</xref>). Plotting AXA against plasma concentration of each drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cpaa-6-179">Figure 4</xref>) confirmed a direct linear relationship for both compounds; the slope of the regression lines appeared to be different (slope: rivaroxaban 0.0172 IU/ng vs apixaban 0.0134 IU/ng; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Consistent with the PK findings, AXA fluctuated less over the dosing interval for apixaban than for rivaroxaban. The geometric mean peak-to-trough AXA ratio for rivaroxaban was 3.5-fold higher than for apixaban (16.5 vs 4.7, respectively): peak AXA was ~2.5-fold higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (2.82 IU/mL [%CV 51] vs 1.12 IU/mL [%CV 21]), whereas trough AXA was ~30% lower for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cpaa-6-179">Table 3</xref>). The AXA geometric mean AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub> was ~34% higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (17.8 IU &#x000b7; h/mL vs 13.3 IU &#x000b7; h/mL). Apixaban mean AXA half-life (8.9 hours) was similar to the half-life observed for plasma concentration (8.7 hours). Rivaroxaban mean AXA half-life could not be estimated over a similar time interval as for plasma concentration since AXA results for all but two subjects were below the assay&#x02019;s LLOQ 24 hours after administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Apixaban and rivaroxaban were well-tolerated in this study. A total of 22 AEs were reported by ten subjects after the start of study medication. Twelve AEs were reported by seven subjects following rivaroxaban administration, consisting of contusion, pharyngitis, and rhinitis, each reported twice, and single reports of epistaxis, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, diarrhea, paresthesia, and procedural pain. Ten AEs were reported by eight subjects following administration of apixaban, consisting of three reports of dizziness, two reports of contusion, and single reports of epistaxis, catheter site hematoma, catheter site-related reaction, cough, and musculoskeletal chest pain. All AEs reported during the study were mild and resolved without treatment.

Both apixaban 2.5 mg BID and rivaroxaban 10 mg QD were readily absorbed, reaching T<sub>max</sub> in 2 hours, and both agents had multiphasic elimination profiles with terminal half-lives of ~8 hours. For apixaban 2.5 mg BID, there is significantly less daily fluctuation in plasma concentrations and AXA (ie, lower peak-to-trough ratio), as well as less variability in PK parameters (ie, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC), than for rivaroxaban 10 mg QD. The PK results for apixaban in this study were generally consistent with previously published multiple-dose data on apixaban<xref rid="b7-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in healthy subjects. The fluctuations in mean apixaban concentrations following administration of apixaban 2.5 mg BID in multiple ascending dose studies in Western and Japanese subject populations were ~3.0 and ~4.2, respectively, and the mean terminal half-lives were 8.1 and 9.7 hours, respectively.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To our knowledge, the multiple-dose steady-state PK of rivaroxaban 10 mg QD in healthy subjects have not previously been reported, and the limited available data for 5 mg QD<xref rid="b8-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> do not permit estimation of the concentration fluctuation, although the half-life (8.4 hours) was similar to that in the current study.</p><p>Although the PK and PD profiles of rivaroxaban and apixaban in VTEp patients differ somewhat from that in healthy subjects due to differences in covariates impacting the PK, the observations in healthy subjects are generally relevant to the patient population.

For apixaban, the C<sub>max</sub> value in VTEp patients is similar to that in our study, but the C<sub>min</sub> value is higher,<xref rid="b6-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> resulting in a C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio of ~1.5. Although the fluctuation values are lower, the difference between the two drugs is similar to that observed in healthy subjects.</p><p>Given that direct linear relationships between plasma concentration and AXA were evident for both apixaban and rivaroxaban, AXA findings are largely consistent with the PK of these agents. Peak AXA was observed at 2 hours postdose, coinciding with the C<sub>max</sub> for the respective compound, and apixaban maintained a lower AXA peak-to-trough ratio over the dosing interval. The difference between apixaban 2.5 mg BID and rivaroxaban 10 mg QD total daily AXA (AXA AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub>) was somewhat greater than the difference observed for exposure, with AXA AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub> being ~34% higher for rivaroxaban. This finding is consistent with the difference observed in the slope of the AXA concentration regression lines for rivaroxaban and apixaban. Although the regression for rivaroxaban was determined over a wider range of concentrations than that for apixaban, this is unlikely to provide an explanation for the difference in slope. Rivaroxaban has also been shown to have a greater effect than apixaban in the prothrombin time assay, at a concentration of 1,000 ng/mL, that cannot be attributed to the &#x0223c;5% difference in molecular weight.<xref rid="b9-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Despite a slightly lower daily AXA<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub>, apixaban AXA activity persisted well beyond the time at which the next scheduled BID dose was to be administered, whereas rivaroxaban AXA was near or below the lower limit of detection of the assay at the time of the next scheduled QD dose. Although QD administration may be favored based on convenience, it clearly results in higher peaks and lower troughs.<xref rid="b12-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The impact of greater fluctuation in levels of anticoagulation on clinical outcomes with oral FXa inhibitors is not known. Thus, the clinical importance of differences in rivaroxaban and apixaban AXA observed over their respective dosing intervals in this study remains to be determined.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of apixaban and rivaroxaban dosed QD and BID have been studied in Phase II clinical trials of VTE prevention. A Phase II dose-ranging clinical trial in patients undergoing total knee replacement was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban total daily doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg administered in QD and BID regimens.<xref rid="b16-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Numerically lower rates of VTE and death were observed with the apixaban 2.5-, 5-, and 10-mg BID regimens compared with the same total daily doses administered QD, whereas bleeding was similar for both BID and QD administration. A pharmacometric analysis performed with the apixaban Phase II VTE prevention data further supported a trend for a more favorable risk&#x02013;benefit profile for the apixaban BID regimen.<xref rid="b15-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Thus, a BID regimen was selected for further study.</p><p>QD and BID regimens of rivaroxaban were evaluated in four separate Phase II studies of VTE prevention.<xref rid="b17-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> No clear dose&#x02013;response relationship was seen for efficacy across these trials, whereas bleeding increased with increasing doses. Comparisons of rivaroxaban QD and BID regimens have mainly focused on cross-study assessments, with the exception of one study<xref rid="b20-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> that included a single QD regimen among several BID regimens. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles of the rivaroxaban QD and BID regimens appeared to be similar,<xref rid="b20-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and a QD regimen was chosen for further study. While the outcomes of the Phase III clinical trials in VTE prevention have been favorable for both apixaban and rivaroxaban relative to low-molecular-weight heparin,<xref rid="b21-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> no comparisons of dosing frequency were performed in these trials.</p><p>This study was performed in a small number of healthy subjects receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban under supervision. As already mentioned, PK/PD differences in specific patient populations may alter the risk&#x02013;benefit profiles of these agents in real-world clinical use. Additionally, factors such as compliance may impact outcomes, especially over the longer-term outpatient settings where dosing cannot be monitored. While compliance can be affected by dosing regimen, it can also be affected by the side-effect profile of the drug in question, as well as other factors. The compliance of both agents during real-world clinical use and its impact on clinical outcomes remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, this study reports the first head-to-head comparison of apixaban and rivaroxaban PK and PD. Apixaban 2.5 mg BID demonstrated lower fluctuations in peak-to-trough plasma concentration and AXA throughout the dosing interval, lower interindividual variability in concentration and AXA, and a lower AXA AUC compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg QD. Although this study provides an informative comparison of apixaban and rivaroxaban PK and PD at dose regimens used for the prevention of VTE, it is important to note that it is difficult to extrapolate data from this healthy subject study to patients. It is possible that other factors encountered in clinical practice, such as drug interactions, varying degrees of renal function, and other patient characteristics may influence both the relative PK and PD profiles observed in this study and their relationships with real-world efficacy and safety outcomes. Although efficacy and safety exposure&#x02013;response relationships in the prevention of VTE have been reported for apixaban, using AUC as the measure of exposure,<xref rid="b15-cpaa-6-179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> these relationships have not been reported for rivaroxaban. Therefore, the impact of greater or lesser fluctuation in plasma concentration or AXA resulting from their respective dosing regimens on the relative efficacy and safety profiles of apixaban and rivaroxaban in clinical practice remains to be determined.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Study conduct, analysis, and reporting were supported by Dr Maria Velinova and the staff of PRA International, the Netherlands.
