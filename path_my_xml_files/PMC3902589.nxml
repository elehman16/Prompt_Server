(Family: <italic>Rubiaceae</italic>; Sanskrit name: <italic>Papata</italic>) is 2-5 m tall, shrub or small tree with opposite branches and grows in the Asia - Pacific region including Sri Lanka. <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> is one of the worm infestations described in Ayurveda. <italic>Enterobius vermicularis</italic> is among the most common of worms affecting children and adults. <italic>E. vermicularis</italic> is considered as one type of <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic>. Sri Lankan traditional and ayurvedic physicians use <italic>P. indica</italic> to treat different ailments including <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> (<italic>E. vermicularis</italic>) infestations successfully. Since no scientific studies have been undertaken to study these effects so far, the present clinical study was carried out to evaluate the effect of <italic>P. indica</italic> in treatment of <italic>E. vermicularis</italic> infestation. Fifty patients between age of 5 and 12 years (Group A and B) and 50 patients between 13 and 65 years (Group C and D) with symptoms of <italic>E. vermicularis</italic> infestations such as itching in the anal region, impaired appetite, abdominal pain, eructation, diarrhea or constipation and presence of ova in stools were selected. Two decoction of the trail drug with different concentration was prepared. Group A and Group B were treated with 60 ml of decoction 1 and 60 ml of placebo respectively, twice daily for 14 days. Group C and Group D were treated with 120 ml of decoction 2 and 120 ml of placebo respectively, twice daily for 14 days. Groups A and C showed complete or partial reduction of symptoms, that is; itching in the anal region, impaired appetite, abdominal pain, eructation, diarrhea and also ova of <italic>E. vermicularis</italic> were absent in stools after treatment with <italic>P. indica</italic>.

A vast description is given in those books on different types of worms, etiology, clinical features of worm infestation and their management. <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> is one type of worms described in Ayurveda. The signs and symptoms of <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> Roga are eructation, impaired appetite, pain in the abdomen and itching in the anal region, emaciation and diarrhea.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> Roga can be correlated with <italic>Enterobius vermicularis</italic> infestation.</p><p><italic>E. vermicularis</italic>, commonly referred to as the thread worm or pinworm is a nematode with the largest geographical distribution of any helminthes. Humans are the only known host and about 209 million persons world-wide are infected. More than 30% of children world-wide; most commonly those of school age, are infected. Some people may have an infestation without having any symptoms. When symptoms are present, the most common one is that of itching around the rectum. This itching is usually worse at night and is caused by worms migrating to the area around the rectum to lay their eggs. When a person scratches the itchy area, eczema or a bacterial infection around the rectum can result. In females, thread worm infestation can spread to the vagina and cause a vaginal discharge.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p><italic>Pavetta indica</italic> L. (Family: <italic>Rubiaceae</italic>; Sanskrit name: <italic>Papata</italic>; Sinhala name: <italic>Pawatta</italic>) is nearly a smooth or somewhat hairy shrub growing 2-5 m or more in height.

The patients having such symptoms as <italic>Udgara</italic> (eructation); <italic>Agnimandya</italic> (impaired appetite); <italic>Shoola</italic> (pain in abdomen); <italic>Agnisadana</italic> (poor digestion); <italic>Gudakandu</italic> (itching in the anal region); <italic>Vidbheda</italic> (loose stool); <italic>Vishtambha</italic> (constipation); <italic>Nihshwasa Vidgandha</italic> (bad breath having fecal odor); <italic>Parushya</italic> (dryness of the skin); <italic>Pandutha</italic> (whitish-yellow discoloration of the skin); <italic>Karshya</italic> (emaciation) were selected. Detailed examination of the patients was carried out. In adults, the patients who are over 65 years and those who are suffering from recurrent attacks of bronchial asthma, anemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were excluded from this research. In children, the patients who are below 5 years, underweight, suffering from eczema and cough, were excluded from this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical study</title><p>Selected patients were divided into two groups according to their age; that is, children between 05 and 12 years and patients above 13-65 years.

Group D consisted of 25 patients between 13-65 years and was treated with 120 ml of placebo, twice a day after meals for 7 days. Stools test for ova was carried out pre- and post-treatment.

Due to these properties <italic>P. indica</italic> acts as a <italic>Kaphaghnadravya</italic> (ingredient which reduces <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>). According to principals of Ayurveda, predominance of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>, supports a favorable environment for the reproduction, growth and propagation of worms in the human body. Any ingredient that reduces <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>, makes the environment unfriendly for the survival of worms. This will cause the worms to die out. This action will lead to reduction of the symptoms of <italic>E. vermicularis</italic> infestation and to make stools free of ova. Based on this chain of actions, it can be proposed that <italic>P. indica</italic> acts as a reducer of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> which in turn reduces the growth and reproduction of worms including <italic>E. vermicularis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most patients who were treated with decoction of <italic>P. indica</italic> had complete or partial relief from the symptoms which occur in thread worm infestation; especially itching in the anal region, impaired appetite and pain in the abdomen. According to this study, ova in stools disappear after the treatment of decoction of <italic>P. indica</italic>. It is concluded that decoction of <italic>P. indica</italic> is a traditional decoction, which can be very successfully used in treatment of <italic>Purishaja Krimi</italic> (<italic>E. vermicularis</italic> infestation) in children and adults.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Madhavakara</surname></name><name><surname>Madhava</surname><given-names>Nidana</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adhyaya 7/13, 14.
