In particular, these uncertainties include longer-term sustainability of beneficial effects, safety, and potential impact on outcomes.

This included both therapy dosing (correction phase) and maintenance dosing (maintenance phase). In summary, total FCM doses were between 500 and 2000 mg iron FCM (or equivalent volume of placebo solution) in the therapy phase (dosed at baseline and Week 6), and thereafter maintenance FCM dosing of 500 mg iron (or equivalent volume of placebo solution) at each of Weeks 12, 24, and 36, if ID was still present (criteria for ID were re-assessed at each visit).</p><p>Each administration of study drug occurred after completion of all applicable study-related assessments (including quality of life assessments and collection of blood samples).</p><p>Ferric carboxymaltose is a dark brown and cannot easily be masked from placebo (0.9% saline).

The 6MWTs were planned to take place shortly after breakfast (i.e. early morning) or lunch (i.e. early afternoon). All tests were performed along a flat, straight corridor with a hard surface, at least 25 m long with turnaround points marked by two chairs at each end of the measured course. Prior to testing, vital signs were measured in a sitting position after a rest of 10 min and subjects completed the Fatigue Score (assessed using a 10-point visual analogue scale, ranging from 1 for no fatigue to 10 for very severe fatigue). Subjects were instructed to walk the length of the course at their own pace while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 min. The person supervising the 6MWT encouraged the subject verbally at frequent intervals. Subjects were allowed to rest on the chairs during the test, but were encouraged to resume walking as soon as they felt physically able to do so. The distance walked in 6 min, to the nearest meter, was recorded. Every effort was made to have the same member of the site supervising all 6MWTs for a specific subject.</p><p>Secondary end-points included changes in NYHA class, Patient Global Assessment (PGA), 6MWT distance, Fatigue Score and health-related quality of life [evaluated using Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), European Quality of Life 5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire] assessed at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52.

Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 130 subjects per group (i.e. 260 patients in total) were required to detect a mean treatment effect of at least 29 m at Week 24 with 90% power using an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided).

In addition supportive analysis will be performed on the per-protocol analysis set.</p><p>The primary efficacy end-point, change in 6MWT from baseline to Week 24, included imputations for missing values from subjects who were hospitalized at that time or had died. For hospitalized patients, the worst non-null 6MWT result collected across the study was then used for the analysis. For subjects who died, a value of 0 was imputed. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted using an analysis of the covariance (ANCOVA) model on the change in 6MWT from baseline to Week 24, with adjustment for baseline 6MWT distance, Hb level at screening and country (Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other European countries) on the FAS.</p><p>Supportive analyses were performed using the per-protocol set (those subjects included in the FAS without major protocol violations) and observed cases (without imputation for subjects that were hospitalized at the time or had died).</p><p>NYHA class missing values due to subjects who died were imputed using the worst possible assessment of class V, and subjects hospitalized during the planned assessment were attributed a value of class IV.

These favourable results were consistent across all pre-specified subgroups including patients with and without anaemia. The beneficial effects of treatment with FCM were confirmed by concomitant improvement in patients functional status and quality of life throughout the study. Importantly, patients treated with FCM demonstrated significantly reduced risk of hospital admission due to worsening HF during 1-year follow-up. Long-term correction of ID with FCM was supported by a good safety profile and was well-tolerated.</p><p>Current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for the management of HF recognize ID as a common and clinically relevant comorbidity, complicating the natural course of the disease, and recommend to actively search for this abnormality using laboratory parameters in all patients with HF.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> At the same time, there is a relatively weaker recommendation to manage ID in such patients, which mainly results from a paucity of evidence-based data confirming the benefits of iron therapy.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="EHU385C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In fact, there is only one medium-size, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (FAIR-HF) showing beneficial effects of i.v. iron therapy with FCM on functional status, exercise intolerance and QoL in ID patients with HF over a 6-month follow-up period.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> There is no doubt that for a stronger recommendation of ID as a valid therapeutic target in HF, additional well-designed and controlled studies with longer follow-up period are needed. To this end, CONFIRM-HF was designed and executed.</p><p>Noteworthy, the results of CONFIRM-HF should be viewed as adding incremental and clinically relevant information over already existing data in the following aspects:

Beneficial effects of FCM were already seen at Weeks 6 and 12 (strong trend favouring FCM), reaching statistical significance at Week 24 and were sustained until the end of 1-year follow-up. The magnitude of the treatment effect of FCM on the 6MWT distance, exceeding 30 m in the last 6-month study period, is robust and clinically meaningful. In previous interventional studies, such beneficial effects have only been seen with cardiac resynchronization therapy.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Importantly, improvement in 6MWT distance was seen across all examined subgroups, including patients with and without anaemia, which further challenges the traditional view linking adverse consequences of ID with anaemia. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with the assessment of peak oxygen consumption is another method applied to evaluate functional capacity in HF, which can provide even more objective information on exercise tolerance than 6MWT. Currently, there is an ongoing clinical trial using this method (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrial.gov">www.clinicaltrial.gov</uri>: EFFECT-HF, NCT01394562), which will provide complementary information on the effects i.v. iron therapy with FCM in iron-deficient HF patients.</p><p>Patients included in this study represent a contemporary population of stable, systolic HF with optimized medical management. Of importance, compared with the FAIR-HF study, we recruited nearly equal numbers of patients in NYHA class II and III (compared with 18% NYHA class II patients in FAIR-HF) with higher LVEF (mean LVEF&#x02014;37 vs. 32% in FAIR-HF). The benefit was seen regardless of clinical severity (as evidenced by no interaction between NYHA class, LVEF and BNP level with treatment effect), which further broadens the clinical applicability of our results.</p><p>In the subgroup analyses, the presence of diabetes and impaired renal function interacted with treatment effects. However, these interactions are not for the direction of effect but only for its magnitude (with a greater benefit for sicker patients with diabetes and impaired renal function). Interestingly, these findings may have important clinical implications allowing us to identify HF patients who could potentially benefit most from i.v. iron therapy. Of note, it has recently been demonstrated that ID is common in patients with coronary artery disease with concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus and independently predicts poor outcome.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Heart failure patients with renal dysfunction are prone to develop ID, which often coincides with low-Hb level.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Therapy with i.v. iron is able to correct these ominous abnormalities. Interestingly, Toblli <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> demonstrated that in anaemic HF patients with ID and renal dysfunction, short-term i.v. iron therapy resulted in significant improvement in renal function. At this stage, however, these intriguing findings need to be considered as hypothesis-generating only, and further tested in prospective clinical trials.</p><p>In this study, beneficial effects of ID correction with FCM were further confirmed by observed improvement in the other indices of functional capacity (NYHA class, PGA, Fatigue score) as well as in QoL throughout the whole study period. This is particularly important, as despite modern improvement in HF management, a considerable proportion of patients remains symptomatic. Hence, well-tolerated therapies with good safety profiles, improving symptoms in the long-term perspective are eagerly awaited.</p><p>In evaluating the effects of new therapies in the settings of chronic HF one would expect these would improve patients' clinical status and QoL, reduce the risk of deterioration (i.e. hospital admission due to worsening HF), and finally prolong survival. Recently, investigators observed a striking reduction in mortality in patients with chronic HF with a parallel increase in the hospital admission rate due to worsening HF.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> As hospitalizations due to worsening HF are always related to poor outcome and impairment of patient's quality of life and constitute an economic burden for society,<sup><xref rid="EHU385C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> there is evident need for their prevention. In this context, the results of CONFIRM-HF showing that FCM treatment was related to a significant risk reduction in first hospital admissions due to worsening HF are of particular interest. Additional analysis taking into account all recurrent HF hospitalizations showed an even stronger effect with a rate ratio (FCM vs. placebo) of 0.30. Among recently introduced pharmacological therapies, only ivabradine<sup><xref rid="EHU385C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> has demonstrated such results. Although there was no difference in the numbers of deaths between groups, a 1-year follow-up may not be adequate to detect any mortality difference. We are aware that the study was not designed primarily to address the morbidity/mortality aspect of ID therapy with FCM, but our results constitute a strong background for such a study to be performed in the near future.</p><p>As in previous studies,<sup><xref rid="EHU385C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="EHU385C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> our patient population was identified on the basis of laboratory biomarkers of ID&#x02014;ferritin and TSAT. However, in contrast to these studies we used a simplified dosing regimen for FCM recently proposed by Evstatiev <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> based on weight and Hb levels. These authors demonstrated that this simplified dosing regimen is superior in efficacy to dosing using the traditional Ganzoni formula<sup><xref rid="EHU385C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> with an accompanying good safety profile. In the FCM arm, the median total dose was 1500 mg of iron during the 1-year study period (with a dosing range of 500&#x02013;3500 mg iron) and over 75% of the patients required a maximum of two injections of FCM to correct ID and maintain the iron parameters within the normal range. Additionally, we extended the previous experience with FCM therapy in non-anaemic ID patients which included patients with Hb levels between 9.5 and 13.5 g/dL,<sup><xref rid="EHU385C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> whereas in this study only patients with Hb values &#x0003e;15 g/dL were excluded.</p><p>In most of the recent studies, ID in HF patients has been corrected using i.v. iron with favourable results. Thus, a relevant question arises, whether similar results would be observed with oral iron therapy. This complex problem remains as yet poorly investigated and unanswered. There are several premises favouring i.v. iron and practicality seems to be the most obvious one. To replete ID in HF, which is typically estimated in a range exceeding 1000 mg, several months of oral therapy would be required with subsequent risk of poor tolerance. In contrast, with FCM as studied in FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF, a low risk of adverse effects is observed and only few injections are needed to treat ID (in CONFIRM-HF over 75% of the patients required a maximum of two injections of FCM to correct and maintain iron therapy). Recent experimental evidence demonstrates disrupted regulatory mechanisms of duodenal iron transportation systems in animals with induced HF and ID.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> On the other hand, iron absorption has never been investigated in HF patients, and whether the phenomena described in rodents would play any role in a clinical setting of HF is entirely unknown. It is also tempting to link ID in HF with inflammation, and to hypothesize about the leading role of elevated hepcidin, which also blocks iron absorption. Recent studies, however, report rather low-hepcidin levels in HF patients and no association between pro-inflammatory activation (as evidenced by circulating IL-6) and hepcidin levels.<sup><xref rid="EHU385C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="EHU385C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="EHU385C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> There is only one small clinical study showing the advantage of i.v. iron therapy over oral iron on exercise capacity in anaemic iron-deficient HF patients,<sup><xref rid="EHU385C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> but with only 18 subjects analysed it is far from being conclusive. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of oral iron therapy in iron-deficient HF patients in adequately large, prospective, randomized clinical trial. To our knowledge such a trial is planned (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrial.gov">www.clinicaltrial.gov</uri>: IRONOUT, NCT02188784).</p><p>In conclusion, treatment of stable, symptomatic, iron-deficient HF patients with ferric carboxymaltose over a 1-year period results in sustained improvement in functional capacity, symptoms and quality of life, and may reduce hospitalizations due to worsening HF.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehu385/-/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>European Heart Journal</italic> online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Vifor Pharma Ltd., Glattbrugg, Switzerland.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> P.P. received honoraria from Vifor Pharma Ltd. as member of the CONFIRM-HF Steering Committee, is a consultant and has received honoraria for speaking from Vifor Pharma Ltd. and Amgen, Inc.
