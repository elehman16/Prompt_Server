Whilst the development of proficient psychomotor technical skills is critical for safe midwifery practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], equally important is the development of non-technical skills. These non-technical skills include proficiency in global clinical performance, communication, documentation and, essential to midwifery practice, an acknowledgement that pregnancy and birth is woman centred. Woman centred care is practiced in such a way that it values, supports and respects the woman, her ideas, questions, preferences, choices and decisions. Woman centred care is effected in an environment of shared power and responsibility between the woman and her midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Woman centred care in clinical assessment is safe, supportive, and gentle. Woman centred care is an art that is handed down from one generation of midwives to another, the foundations of which are embedded in undergraduate midwifery courses, and strengthened through shared experiences in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Simulation in the midwifery context</title><p>Simulation has been a key educational technique in medical and nursing training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in which elements of the real world are appropriately integrated to learning. Midwifery education has employed simulation methodology since the 1700&#x02019;s when Madame de Coudray, a royal midwife, was commissioned by King Louis XV to travel and teach student midwives and used life size models of women she made from leather, bones and fabric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the following centuries, torso models and manikins were used to teach midwifery clinical skills such as abdominal palpation, mechanisms of labor and neonatal resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Simulation fidelity in the midwifery context</title><p>Simulation techniques vary in their levels of fidelity or realism and this is not dependent upon the level of technology. High fidelity may be achieved through low technology simulations and conversely the use of high technology simulators does not guarantee high fidelity. Simulation fidelity varies in midwifery education including the use of scenarios, peer-to-peer learning, partial task trainers, computerized task trainers, screen based simulations, virtual reality, haptic systems, standardized patients and full scale simulation and is used extensively in Australian midwifery programs to teach both technical and non-technical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A study by McKenna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], looked at the perceptions of Australian midwifery educational leaders, who believed simulation could offer educational opportunities to support the development of competent midwives as long as the realism of the equipment was appropriate. This study recommended further investigation regarding the effect of differing levels of simulation fidelity on educational outcomes to ensure the most appropriate use of limited resources.</p><p>Recently simulation has been used to address the need to develop clinical skills prior to clinical practice to ensure patient safety, enhance clinical confidence prior to clinical exposure and reduce pressure on over-worked clinical environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite this change in educational methodology, minimal documentation regarding the effectiveness of these educational methods exists, including the effect on the development of woman centred care skills in student midwives.</p><p>In our study high fidelity will be achieved using simulated standardized patients, whom are individuals trained to act as a real patient to simulate a set of symptoms or problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Medium fidelity will be achieved using part-task trainers in combination with an innovative hybrid standardized patient in the format of a life size poster of a pregnant woman known affectionately as &#x02018;Flat Maggie&#x02019;. &#x02018;Flat Maggie&#x02019; was developed internally by Pauline Lyon and Penelope Buntine, as a visual simulation of a pregnant woman in order to increase the realism of the learning experience. Low fidelity will be achieved by the use of part-task trainer only.</p></sec><sec><title>Wom<italic>a</italic>n centred care vs. wom<italic>e</italic>n centred care</title><p>Within the literature a great deal is written about the primacy of woman centred care in the practice of midwifery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The concept of woman centred care is central to midwifery practice and underpins the philosophy statement of the International Confederation of Midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the Australian College of Midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Debate exists around wom<bold><italic>e</italic></bold>n centred care and wom<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>n centred care with the former relating to institutional or organisational practices that cater for particular groups of women and the later to practices demonstrated by the individual midwife that cater for an individual woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Regardless, to promote the safe and effective care of women and families, the development of woman centred care behaviours are essential for student midwives to care for women in a holistic manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Measuring midwifery skills</title><p>A variety of tools exist to measure development of task-based skills in health care professionals, including the Global Rating Scale (GRS) for the evaluation of technical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the Integrated Procedural Performance Instrument (IPPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A useful framework for assessing the development of practice behaviours in student midwives is the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council National Competency Standards for the Midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, a review of the literature demonstrates the absence of a valid and reliable tool to measure the development of woman centred care behaviours. So piloting a tool to measure woman centred care behaviours is an important secondary aim in this research. These essential woman centred care behaviours are seen as integral in any midwifery care episode and therefore should be embedded, developed and assessed as part of the education of student midwives.</p><p>A proposed conceptual framework for woman centred care comprises eight key concepts which have been identified and defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These concepts have subsequently been linked to competencies, elements and cues from the National Competency Standards for the Midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and translation into practice behaviors identified and described. For example in the Woman centred care scale (WCCS) under the construct of Midwife /Mother relationship, the student performing the procedure will need to demonstrate skills in accurately interpreting the woman&#x02019;s sensory cues during the procedure and demonstrating compassionate responses to performing care in order achieve a strongly agree standard on the tool. These practice behaviours can be directly linked the National Competency standards for the Midwife 2.1 and 3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These eight key identified and defined concepts of midwifery care form the basis of the tool to assess performance of woman centred care behaviours during practice of clinical technical skills. Further details of the development, content validation and refinement of this tool will be reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim(s) of the study</title><p>This research aims to determine the effect of progressive simulation fidelity on the development of global and integrated technical skills and woman centred clinical assessent skills in student midwives.
