			<italic>Objective:</italic> We sought to determine if changing the surgeon's gloves after delivery of the infant and
prior to manual placental removal decreases the incidence of postcesarean endometritis.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Methods:</italic> Laboring women undergoing cesarean delivery between September 1, 1994, and August
31, 1995, were prospectively randomized into either a change or no-change glove group. In the
change-glove group, the surgeon's gloves were changed after delivery of the infant and before
manual removal of the placenta. All patients enrolled received a single prophylactic dose of an IV
antibiotic after clamping of the umbilical cord. Endometritis was diagnosed by an oral temperature
of &#x02265;38&#x02103; on 2 occasions at least 6 h apart and &#x0003e;24 h after delivery, uterine tenderness, peripheral
blood leukocytosis (&#x02265;15,000 cells/ml), and the exclusion of other foci of infection. In order to detect
a reduction in endometritis from 14% to 2%, at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 with 80% power, we needed 95 patients
in each group.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Results:</italic> Two hundred twenty-eight women were randomized to 2 groups: 113 were in the change
group and 115 in the no-change group. No significant differences were noted between the groups
with respect to demographics, duration of labor, length of ruptured membranes, number of vaginal
examinations, duration of internal monitoring, length of surgery, blood loss, or infant weight. There
was no decrease in the incidence of endometritis between the change group (17.7%) and the no-change
group (15.7%) (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.75&#x02013;1.47).</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Conclusions:</italic> In this study, the incidence of postcesarean endometritis was not decreased by
changing the surgeon's gloves after delivery of the infant but before placental extraction.</p>
