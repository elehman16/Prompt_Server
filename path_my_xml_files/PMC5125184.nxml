Melatonin has been tried in the treatment of delirium and has shown a beneficial effect in OPCP. This study was conducted to know the effect of melatonin on duration of delirium and recovery profile in OPCP patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Double-blind randomised placebo control trial in which 56 patients of OPCP confirmed by history and syndrome of OPCP with low plasma pseudocholinesterase, aged &#x0003e;18 years and weighing between 50 and 100 kg, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of &#x0003c;20 were studied. Group M (<italic>n</italic> = 26) received tablet melatonin 3 mg and Group C (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received placebo tablet at 9 PM, every night throughout the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU, thrice a day. Sedation was provided with injection midazolam, fentanyl and lorazepam.

Changes occur over a short period, and it has a fluctuating course.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The incidence of delirium in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ranges from 45% to 87%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Delirium is an independent risk factor for death in the ICU, and can result in over sedation, increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased length of ICU stay.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Risk factors for delirium include metabolic impairment, substance withdrawal, severe sepsis, drugs like atropine, organophosphorus compound poisoning (OPCP) and sleep deprivation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Various drugs such as dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have been tried to treat and prevent delirium; however, these drugs are associated with adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The endogenous hormone melatonin is very well known to influence the circadian rhythm,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and has effects on sleep quality and cycle which can be used in the management of delirium.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Few animal studies have shown the benefit of melatonin in OPCP-induced delirium, by reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation of the brain caused by OPCP. However, data regarding its use in humans for the same is sparse.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hence, this study was conducted with the primary aim of assessing the effect of melatonin on delirium and recovery profile in OPCP patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between September 2014 and December 2015. After Institutional ethical committee approval, informed written consent was obtained from patients&#x02019; relatives. Patients aged between 18 and 50 years, presenting with history and clinical syndrome suggestive of organophosphorus compound poisoning (OPCP) with low pseudocholinesterase levels (&#x0003c;5320 IU/L) were included in the study. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were assessed at the time of admission and patients whose score was &#x0003e;20 were excluded. Postcardiac arrest patients, patients on chronic opioids and opioid antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, central nervous system depressants, warfarin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, moderate to severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, known psychiatric disorder through history from relatives and patients with history of cardiac disease were excluded from this study. Decontamination of skin and gastrointestinal tract was done as per standard institutional protocol. Injection atropine intravenous (IV) was administered as 2 mg boluses, till signs of atropinization were achieved (heart rate &#x0003e;80 beats/min, systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;90 mm of Hg, drying of oral and tracheobronchial secretions) and then it was followed by a titrated infusion to maintain heart rate of 80&#x02013;100/min. Injection pralidoxime (P2AM) IV 30 mg/kg was administered as loading dose, followed by 8&#x02013;10 mg/kg/h infusion over 48 h. Patients who developed acute respiratory failure due to OPCP-induced cholinergic crisis or intermediate syndrome during admission to ICU or during the course of stay in ICU were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Using a computer generated randomisation scheme, patients were allocated into two groups. The drug and the placebo (same coloured sugar tablets as melatonin) were removed from their original packs and placed in similar looking sachets numbered as per computer generated random numbers by the nurse not involved in the study. The details of the sachet number, its contents and the patient receiving it, was maintained by the principal investigator and not revealed to others till the end of the study. The nurse who administered the drug, the patient who received it and the doctor who observed the findings were all blinded to the contents of the sachet. Group M received tablet melatonin 3 mg, at 9 PM through the Ryle's tube daily from the day of admission and Group C received a placebo tablet at the same time in the same manner throughout the duration of ICU stay. Delirium was assessed in two steps by Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU). The level of consciousness was first assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), (a 10-point scale ranging from +4 to &#x02212;5). RASS score of 0 represents calm and alert patient and scores of &#x02212;4, and &#x02212;5 correspond to coma in whom delirium cannot be assessed. Patients with RASS score of &#x02212;3 or more were evaluated for delirium. The CAM-ICU assesses patients for four features of delirium (1) acute onset of mental status changes or a fluctuating course, (2) inattention, (3) disorganised thinking and (4) altered level of consciousness. The presence of at least three out of these four features was considered for a diagnosis of delirium.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The level of sedation and delirium were assessed 3 times a day at 9 PM, 8 AM and 4 PM daily (every shift), and the patient was diagnosed to have delirium if ICU-CAM was positive even on one occasion of assessment. In case of agitation or intolerance to mechanical ventilation, (RASS &#x02265;2), rescue sedation with injection midazolam 1 mg IV and injection fentanyl 30 &#x003bc;g IV bolus followed by infusion of a drug solution containing injection midazolam (0.4 mg/ml) and injection fentanyl (5 &#x003bc;g/ml), was given and infusion titrated to maintain the RASS scale between &#x02212;2 and +1. In those who were not intubated, injection lorazepam 4 mg IV boluses were used to maintain RASS scale between &#x02212;2 and +1.</p><p>Primary outcome measures were, effect of melatonin on the duration of delirium during ICU stay in OPCP, overall prevalence of delirium and sedation (fentanyl and midazolam or lorazepam) requirement. The requirement of atropine, number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the total duration of ICU stay were secondary outcome measures. Intensive monitoring of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation and electrocardiogram were done throughout the ICU stay. Fluid and nutritional management was followed uniformly in both groups. Other significant events and side effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting if any were observed.</p><p>On the basis of an unpublished pilot study conducted in our ICU, the average duration of delirium in OPCP patients was observed to be 8.5 &#x000b1; 2.5 days. We hypothesised that melatonin administration would reduce the duration of delirium. To detect a minimum of 25% reduction in duration of delirium, assuming normal distribution of values, at least 44 subjects would be required with 80% power and 5% probability of Type I error to reject null hypothesis. We included 56 patients for better validation of results.</p><p>For analytical purpose, delirium was categorised as present or absent. Percentage of patients with delirium was calculated by keeping number of patients having delirium on numerator with total number of patients assessed for delirium on that day as denominator. The average of the percentage of delirium over 10 days is depicted as the prevalence of delirium. Doses of atropine, midazolam, lorazepam, fentanyl were categorised as increased, decreased or no change and ventilation requirement as present or absent. APAACHE scores were categorised into &#x02264;8 and &#x0003e;8.</p><p>Chi-square test was used for categorical data. Multiple comparisons were performed using analysis of variance test for repeated measurements (RMANOVA). Paired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for paired numerical data with normal variance. RMANOVA was done to know difference within and between groups for each independent variable. Further analysis was done using Mantel&#x02013;Haenzel Chi-square test to reduce the effect of confounding variables between groups. Time taken to be delirium free was analysed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. All analyses were two-tailed. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The requirement of sedation was also reduced. However, there was no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.</p><p>Society of critical care medicine recommends that all ICU patients should be evaluated for delirium,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and it is evaluated by CAM-ICU. The CAM-ICU method was originally validated by Ely <italic>et al</italic>. for assessing delirium and it was further used by other authors later on.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It was found to be highly sensitive and specific, with a high inter-rater reliability, which allows easy and reliable assessment of delirium, even by non-psychiatric physicians and others. Assessment can be done even in intubated patients, who cannot speak.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Delirium commonly seen in OPCP may be due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and imbalance between antioxidants and oxidants.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It can also be due to pesticide itself, hypoxia, alcohol, other medical conditions and, atropine at therapeutic doses causes toxicity (delirium). Delirium is also seen during recovery from the cholinergic syndrome.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Sleep rhythm is altered in OPCP patients, thus contributing to delirium.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Delirium, sleep deprivation or excessive sedation can interfere with the assessment of patient's neck muscle weakness and general condition. This can lead to difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation in OPCP patients, leading to increased duration of ICU stay and an overall increase in the costs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Melatonin is mainly produced in the pineal gland from tryptophan,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and acts through multiple receptor sites including opioidergic, benzodiazepinergic, muscarinic, nicotinic and most importantly melatonergic receptors present in the central nervous system and dorsal spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It regulates sleep-wake cycle; resets sleep cycle if it is disturbed.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It has antioxidant property and reduces oxidative stress, thereby decreasing delirium.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It also has additional analgesic and sedative sparing effect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The drug melatonin (3 mg) has been approved by Drug Controller General of India as a sedative for sleep disorder, jet lag and circadian rhythm disorders.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Studies with different doses of Melatonin on sleep and sedation in critically ill patients was found to be safe.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a study assessing the pharmacokinetic property of the drug, melatonin at a dose of 3 mg, in critically ill patients had satisfactory oral bio-availability and also pharmacological levels were maintained up to 10 h following administration.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Hence, a dose of 3 mg melatonin was selected for the study. Studies assessing the effect of melatonin on delirium have shown contrasting results. In a recent study, administration of 0.5 mg oral melatonin in elderly patients at night resulted in a reduction of incidence of delirium,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] whereas a dose of 3 mg in elderly patients with hip fracture did not reduce the incidence of delirium but reduced the duration of delirium.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In the present study, administration of melatonin decreased the duration of delirium and prevalence was reduced from the 3<sup>rd</sup> day significantly. Administration of oral melatonin perioperatively produced clinically relevant anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic-sparing effect in various types of surgeries. It also reduced tourniquet-related pain and produced analgesia in orthopaedic upper limb surgeries,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In the present study, it was observed that melatonin administration decreased the requirement of midazolam and fentanyl. It has been observed that melatonin added to P2AM and atropine in the treatment of acute OPCP poisoning increases acetylcholinesterase activity in brain tissue, and shows a beneficial effect on brain injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in brain tissue which may explain the beneficial effects observed in our study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a recent meta-analysis, assessing the influence of delirium on outcome in ICU patients, the overall risk ratio for death in patients, severity of illness and the adjusted risk of mortality was high in patients with delirium.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In similar analysis, there was increased length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in intensive care in patients with delirium.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] We did not find any difference in the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay which may be attributed smaller sample size. Since the primary aim of this study was to assess the effect of melatonin on the duration of delirium due to OPCP and its treatment, we excluded patients with APACHE score &#x0003e;20 (severely ill).</p><p>There was attrition of data after 4 days, due to shift out of the patients to wards and hence validity of the study is limited. We could not follow the patients in the wards, and there was data loss on retrospective analysis of their case sheets and hence we are not able to comment about hospital stay or mortality after discharge from ICU. However, none of the patients included in the study died during ICU stay. Effect of melatonin on sleep quality of these patients could not be commented since sleep quality was not monitored in the present study, which is a major limitation. In this study, we did not obtain the basal blood levels of melatonin which would have thrown further light on the possible effect of OPCP on melatonin and consequently, delirium. Future multicentric studies with larger sample size, sufficiently powered enough to assess the effect of melatonin on the overall outcome of the patient may be required before using this drug on a routine basis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Melatonin when given to organophosphate compound poisoning patients at a dose of 3 mg orally reduces the prevalence and duration of delirium.
