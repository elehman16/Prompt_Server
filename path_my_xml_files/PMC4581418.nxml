We examined if home visits by community health workers (CHW) can improve growth outcomes for children of mothers who are antenatally depressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cluster randomized controlled trial of all pregnant, neighbourhood women in Cape Town, South Africa. Almost all pregnant women (98&#x000a0;%, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1238) were recruited and assessed during pregnancy, two weeks post-birth (92&#x000a0;%) and 6&#x000a0;months post-birth (88&#x000a0;%). Pregnant women were randomized to either: 1) Standard Care (SC), which provided routine antenatal care; or 2) an intervention, The Philani Intervention Program (PIP), which included SC and home visits by CHW trained as generalists (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;11 visits). Child standardized weight, length, and weight by length over 6&#x000a0;months based on maternal antenatal depression and intervention condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Depressed mood was similar across the PIP and SC conditions both antenatally (16.5&#x000a0;% rate) and at 6&#x000a0;months (16.7&#x000a0;%). The infants of depressed pregnant women in the PIP group were similar in height (height-for-age Z scores) to the children of non-depressed mothers in both the PIP and the SC conditions, but significantly taller at 6&#x000a0;months of age than the infants of pregnant depressed mothers in the SC condition. The intervention did not moderate children&#x02019;s growth. Depressed SC mothers tended to have infants less than two standard deviations in height on the World Health Organization&#x02019;s norms at two weeks post-birth compared to infants of depressed PIP mothers and non-depressed mothers in both conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A generalist, CHW-delivered home visiting program improved infant growth, even when mothers&#x02019; depression was not reduced.

Depression is the most common of the mental health challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with the highest YLD (3.7&#x000a0;%), and is about twice as common among women compared to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet, to date, mental illness has not achieved commensurate visibility or funding compared to other diseases, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders and the known association with poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], data on the consequences of depression, particularly maternal depression, is limited for LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Maternal depression has repeatedly been demonstrated to negatively impact both mothers and their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Globally, children of depressed mothers show deficits in cognitive, physical, and social development, with the most significant deficits demonstrated among children in LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Children of depressed mothers consistently demonstrate mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], yet the infant developmental outcome most affected by maternal depression remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>This study focuses on infants of antenatally depressed mothers in a community sample of pregnant women in South Africa over the first six months of life. Though less well documented than postpartum depression, depression in pregnancy is significantly associated with adverse child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], including poor child growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, depression also co-varies with a range of related stressors. Perinatal depressed mood is also associated with poverty and life stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which are in themselves strongly related to poor child growth. In South Africa, up to 47&#x000a0;% of women have been diagnosed with major depression across the perinatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Key aspects of infant development (e.g., growth) are compromised in the context of parental poverty and mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Concurrently, depressed mothers in LMIC are likely to experience overcrowding, food insecurity and poor sanitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Infant growth is more complex than being based solely on food security and caloric intake. Factors such as the health environment, availability of health care, and feeding and care practices of the mother influence infants&#x02019; growth.</p><p>In the context of antenatal depression and poverty, retarded infant growth has consistently been linked to maternal depression in Asia, with multiple studies in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In Asia, the studies have been conducted with both clinical and community samples, and cross-sectional and longitudinal data. However, there have been inconsistent results regarding the impact of maternal depression on growth in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Identifying sustainable and effective strategies to improve maternal and child outcomes in LMIC is a high priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Intervention trials with postnatally depressed mothers have hypothesized very different mechanisms by which children are influenced by maternal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Depressed mothers may provide sub-optimal care which has detrimental effects on the health of her child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Depression may compromise care-giving behaviours (e.g., ensuring adequate hygiene, optimal nutrition through breastfeeding, immunization, recognizing illness and seeking care), as well as responsive parenting that is needed for physical and mental development of a child. In Pakistan the children of antenatally depressed mothers showed growth retardation in the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. When the mothers received home visits by CHW, maternal depression was reduced, but infants did not improve weight- or length-for-age over the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Maternal and child health intervention strategies have tended to address only one health risk at a time. As a result many studies provide little insight on the confluence of challenges faced by mothers in LMIC. Our project evaluated a community-based, home visiting program utilising CHW who were trained to address multiple health challenges facing pregnant South African mothers and their newborn infants. The CHW were trained to conduct home visits that addressed nutrition, alcohol, and HIV among pregnant township women, but not maternal depression. The training approach aimed to teach principles of behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], based on cognitive-behavioral principles (CBT). CHW supported the mother to problem solve her own situation, rather than to provide solutions for her daily stressors and health challenges. While the CHW did not focus specifically on depressed mood, many of the factors related to positive child outcomes were addressed by the CHW. We report the child growth outcomes over the first six months of life, based on intervention status and maternal depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Institutional Review Boards of University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Stellenbosch University, and Emory University approved the study, whose methods have previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Three independent teams conducted the assessment (Stellenbosch), intervention (Philani Maternal, Child Health, and Nutrition Project, hereafter referred to as Philani), and data analyses (UCLA).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study context</title><p>Cape Town contains five major peri-urban settlements (townships) with formal and informal rudimentary housing. Unemployment in Cape Town townships is estimated at between 25 and 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Most women live within 5&#x000a0;km of a prenatal clinic. In each area, there is formal housing and vast areas of informal houses (shacks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>In 2009, 26 township neighborhoods were matched on size (450&#x02013;600 households), density, public utilities (water, electricity, toilets), distance of primary health care, and the number of alcohol bars. UCLA randomized matched pairs of neighborhoods to either the PIP or SC condition. The minimum number of pregnant women needed per neighbourhood to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.40 set the sample size; the original size was 1238. Participant flow through each phase of the study can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2015_606_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>A recruiter obtained consent to contact and repeatedly visit all households in all neighbourhoods from May 2009 to September 2010 in order to identify all pregnant women.

Treatment for depression is theoretically possible, but it is highly unlikely that health care providers would identify or refer cases of depression, unless symptoms of active psychosis were detected during a clinic visit. Because the HIV rate in this population is about 26&#x000a0;%, standard clinic care includes HIV testing of virtually all women and extensive treatment for Mothers Living with HIV (MLHIV), including the following: dual therapy for Prevent Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT), referral to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for women with CD4 counts below 200 or World Health Organization Stage 4 disease, the return of PCR test results for infants by 6&#x000a0;weeks of age, and co-trimoxazole for exposed infants starting at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Nutritional supplements were also available from clinics during this study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Philani Intervention Program (PIP)</title><p>Philani is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that has been operating in Cape Town townships for more than 30&#x000a0;years. Local township women with good social skills and who were mothers themselves were recruited and trained as CHW to visit the homes of pregnant women and intervene to reduce alcohol misuse, increase adherence to perinatal HIV regimens, and boost child nutrition. CHW&#x02019;s were trained in: 1) cognitive-behavioural approaches to establishing healthy routines and to problem-solving around goal setting, choices, triggers, and shaping of desirable behaviours; 2) key information about general maternal and child health, techniques for framing each health issue that is a risk (nutrition, alcohol, and HIV), and strategies for applying the health information in families&#x02019; daily lives; and 3) coping with their own life challenges. Trainers actively rehearsed and observed videotapes about how to solve challenging life situations, build engaging relationships, and keep responsibility for change with the mother. CHW were supervised weekly (face-to-face supervision as well as via mobile phones), and randomly observed twice a month. Specific PIP content has been described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data collection</title><p>A driver transported all participants to a central assessment site, allowing interviewers to be blinded to condition. All women provided written informed consent to participate in data collection. All data were collected using mobile phones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Data collectors were taught methods of assessing infants&#x02019; growth, strategies for building rapport and collecting honest answers, and how to interact in a non-judgmental manner. Before going into the field, all data collectors observed five client interviews and practiced interviewing skills. All CHW were certified by supervisors prior to becoming interviewers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Maternal mood</title><p>Maternal mood was assessed at the baseline recruitment interview during pregnancy and at 6&#x000a0;months post-birth using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a 10-item measure, with items rated on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 for severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The EPDS is a screening tool and is not used to make a confirmatory diagnosis of clinical depression; however, for the purposes of this study, we used a cut-off score of &#x0003e;18 to indicate the probable presence of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Screening tools, by definition, will not have the sensitivity or specificity of a clinically validated tool such as the Standard Clinical Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If the goal was to measure prevalence, we would have wanted to maximize sensitivity and accept some degree of false-positives. In this study however, we wanted to maximize specificity to reduce false positives, so we used the highest recommended cut-point to increase the chances that a screen positive was a definite case, likely to represent cases of severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Infant measures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Anthropometric measures</title><p>Weight and length was measured at two weeks post birth and at six-months post-birth. Weight was assessed on scales calibrated monthly. Length was measured supine, using a roller meter with infant feet at zero position and bringing the headboard down to the crown of the head. Standardized z-scores (height-for-age, weight-for-age, height-for-weight-for age) were generated using new World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards for infants under 24&#x000a0;months of age and calculated from WHO Anthro-2005 software. Infants were then categorized as underweight if they had a weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;2 and stunted if they had a length-for-age z-score (HAZ) of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Newborn infants were also provided with a &#x0201c;Road to Health&#x0201d; card on which birth weight, length at birth and delivery date were recorded. These measures were highly consistent with the interviewers&#x02019; measure (r&#x02009;&#x0003e;0.9) and, therefore, we only examine the results using the interviewer collected data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Before analyzing infant outcomes, we checked for confounding variables and found no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics within or across study conditions among the full sample or among mothers depressed antenatally. Using SAS PROC MIXED (version 9&#x000b0;2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA), we modelled infant growth z-scores longitudinally using an unstructured time trend in hierarchical linear regressions that included two random effects: one to model the correlation of repeated measures within a participant and another to model the correlation between participants clustered within the same neighborhood. Explanatory variables included indicators for intervention (PIP; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;intervention, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;SC) and antenatal depression (DEP; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;depressed, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not depressed), time (TIME; 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;birth, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;post-birth, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;six months), and the two- and three-way interactions of PIP, DEP, and TIME. Intervention as a moderator of the depression effect on the change in z-score over time (PIP*DEP*TIME) was the effect of interest, and we considered a 2-sided p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 to be significant. Using SAS PROC GLIMMIX, we also modelled the moderating effect of intervention on infant growth (z-score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;&#x02212;2) cross-sectionally at each assessment period using logistic random effects regressions controlling for neighbourhood clustering. Explanatory variables included indicators for intervention (PIP; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;intervention, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;SC), antenatal depression (DEP; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;depressed, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not depressed, and their interaction. Intervention&#x02019;s moderation of depression&#x02019;s impact on infant growth (PIP*DEP) was the effect of interest, and we set the criteria for a 2-sided p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.05 to be significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarises the self-reports of mothers in the PIP and SC conditions at the baseline interview conducted at mean of 26&#x000a0;weeks gestational age (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.2&#x000a0;weeks).

Children of antenatally depressed children in the control condition tended to be significantly shorter at birth. Because only 16.5&#x000a0;% were significantly depressed (EPDS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18), the power to detect significant differences in growth is substantially reduced. The rate of stunting (being two SD lower in height) was more than double at two weeks post birth (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.36) and similar 6&#x000a0;months later (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8) compared to children of depressed mothers in the intervention condition. However, with clustering of neighbourhoods and the reduced sample size, the confidence intervals are too large to have precision in evaluating if this is a significant difference. These rates suggest that CHW may be able to reduce stunting of depressed mothers by focusing on encouraging depressed mothers to maintain caretaking. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature examining the impact of community based interventions on child health in the context of perinatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>The intervention&#x02019;s negative effect on WFHZ score is a reflection of the positive intervention effect on height (HAZ). Intervention children are taller and significantly less likely to be stunted, their weight for height is at the desirable mean score of 0 (normative weight) at 6&#x000a0;months post birth. Children of antenatally depressed mothers in the control condition were shorter, but of similar weight compared to the children of antenatally depressed mothers in the intervention condition and children of non-depressed mothers in both conditions. Therefore, when calculating WFHZ, the children are relatively heavier at their height, above the desirable mean of 0 and similar to the children of non-depressed mothers in both conditions.</p><p>The PIP intervention&#x02019;s benefit in height was achieved in the context of a study where CHW were not specifically trained to address depression (through screening or treatment) and in which the prevalence of depressive symptoms were highly similar in the intervention and control conditions over time. A study by Rahman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] examined whether or not delivering a cognitive behavioural therapeutic intervention to depressed mothers using village CHW women would improve infant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and found that directly addressing depression had a large impact on reducing maternal depression, but had no impact on improving infant growth. The work of Tripathy and colleagues in Nepal, on the other hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] found significant reductions in neonatal mortality amongst moderately depressed women in a group- based intervention programme aimed at improving social support and problem solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Similar to findings of our South African study, this result was achieved without specifically targeting perinatal depression. It is likely that the psycho-educational activities of the PIP intervention providing skills to address alcohol, nutrition, and HIV enabled women to be better caretakers of their infants, in spite of being depressed.</p><p>Increasingly, antenatal depression is being seen as an important public health concern. The link between postnatal depression and compromised child development is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but this is less the case with antenatal depression although this relationships is increasingly a target of investigation. Our data suggest that interventions during the antenatal period are crucial. Our findings provide support for training CHW as generalists, in order to address the highest priority health issues in a local community. Training of CHW to address caretaking, problem solving and support, appears to benefit child growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Treating depression does not necessarily remove the conditions that frequently cause or exacerbate depression &#x02013; such as poverty and interpersonal violence. On the other hand, providing mothers the tools to help their infants thrive (something most mothers are highly motivated about) allows them to act toward a powerfully motivated goal. Indeed, an inability to help their child thrive may be a real driver of maternal depression. While our findings also provide evidence that there are benefits for child development in the context of perinatal depression, the primary preventive nature of community -based interventions, such as PIP, may not ameliorate moderate to severe depression.</p><p>Intervening in multiple health risks concurrently, even by paraprofessional CHW, appears to benefit child growth, even when mothers are depressed during pregnancy and remain depressed. The mechanism by which the caretaking influences height and stunting, but not weight gain is a mystery. It is surprising that the children of PIP mothers who were antenatally depressed had children who were less stunted but did not weigh as much as the children in the SC condition who had depressed mothers. In other analyses we have conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], PIP mothers were significantly more likely to breastfeed their infants and to breastfeed longer. The children of antenatally depressed PIP mothers also breastfed their children longer. Breastfeeding often results in lower weights, which may explain that the intervention children were of normal weight per height.</p><p>More research is needed in order to establish the optimal mix of interventions that are sufficiently targeted (screening for perinatal depression and providing referral or treatment), while also being sufficiently generalised and horizontally integrated given the resources constraints of LMIC. Given the explanatory models of mental illness in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which link disturbance to social adversity and social problems rather than individualistic explanations, interventions targeted at these social determinants of health may be more acceptable to local communities. Given what is known about the causes of depression, it also may be more appropriate. As a clinical condition, depression is often highly stigmatized as an individual deficiency. In some contexts, interventions may be more efficacious when framed as addressing community challenges, rather than as a treatment program for individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The PIP model did not target individual depression, but aimed to improve parenting and child health. Every household was visited in the neighbourhood, regardless of such risks as HIV and alcohol use. The strategic approach adopted in the PIP program is similar to the &#x0201c;Thinking Healthy&#x0201d; programme of Rahman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and uses cognitive behavioural change principles as a generic method of intervention for a broad range of social problems, rather than depression alone.</p><p>The relationship between maternal mental health and child growth is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is possible that interventions focussed on maternal depression may not fully address this complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], while generalist models of implementation are not sufficiently targeted to make a significant impact on moderate to severe perinatal maternal depression. Evidence is needed on what the optimal implementation models are. The improvements we have seen in this study warrant continued tracking to examine sustainability and durability of an intervention&#x02019;s impact when delivered by CHW.</p><p>Finally, Philani is a NGO which has survived 30&#x000a0;years. Over that time, it has developed core relationships with staff in the Department of Health, community leaders, church officials, clinics and a broad range of key community roles. Unlike many other NGOs, it has well-developed accountability and training systems for both CHW and supervisors. Diffusion of this model to other NGO without these strengths is likely to face many obstacles. The strengths of this study are that it is a cluster randomized controlled trial of mothers monitored during pregnancy and the similarity of the mothers and infants and the high retention in the intervention and the control condition are additional evidence of the strengths of this design. We did not conduct full diagnostic interviews for depression, which is a limitation of our current design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed benefits to infant growth in the context of antenatal depression when community health workers intervened to address concurrent community health risks, but not specifically trained to address depression through screening or treatment.
