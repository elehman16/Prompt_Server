The CAD106 first-in-human study demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising antibody response. We investigated long-term safety, tolerability and antibody response after repeated CAD106 injections.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two phase IIa, 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled core studies (2201; 2202) and two 66-week open-label extension studies (2201E; 2202E) were conducted in patients with mild Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) aged 40 to 85&#x000a0;years. Patients were randomized to receive 150&#x003bc;g CAD106 or placebo given as three subcutaneous (2201) or subcutaneous/intramuscular (2202) injections, followed by four injections (150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g CAD106; subcutaneous, 2201E1; intramuscular, 2202E1). Our primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated injections, including monitoring cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans, adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs). Further objectives were to assess A&#x003b2;-specific antibody response in serum and A&#x003b2;-specific T-cell response (core only). Comparable A&#x003b2;-immunoglobulin G (IgG) exposure across studies supported pooled immune response assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-eight patients were randomized (CAD106, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;47; placebo, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11). Baseline demographics and characteristics were balanced. Forty-five patients entered extension studies. AEs occurred in 74.5% of CAD106-treated patients versus 63.6% of placebo-treated patients (core), and 82.2% experienced AEs during extension studies. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, were not study medication-related and did not require discontinuation. SAEs occurred in 19.1% of CAD106-treated patients and 36.4% of placebo-treated patients (core). One patient (CAD106-treated; 2201) reported a possibly study drug-related SAE of intracerebral hemorrhage. Four patients met criteria for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) corresponding to microhemorrhages: one was CAD106-treated (2201), one placebo-treated (2202) and two open-label CAD106-treated. No ARIA corresponded to vasogenic edema. Two patients discontinued extension studies because of SAEs (rectal neoplasm and rapid AD progression, respectively). Thirty CAD106-treated patients (63.8%) were serological responders. Sustained A&#x003b2;-IgG titers and prolonged time to decline were observed in extensions versus core studies. Neither A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> nor A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> induced specific T-cell responses; however, positive control responses were consistently detected with the CAD106 carrier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>No unexpected safety findings or A&#x003b2;-specific T-cell responses support the CAD106 favorable tolerability profile. Long-term treatment-induced A&#x003b2;-specific antibody titers and prolonged time to decline indicate antibody exposure may increase with additional injections. CAD106 may be a valuable therapeutic option in AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00733863">NCT00733863</ext-link>, registered 8 August 2008; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00795418">NCT00795418</ext-link>, registered 10 November 2008; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00956410">NCT00956410</ext-link>, registered 10 August 2009; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01023685">NCT01023685</ext-link>, registered 1 December 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13195-015-0108-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly populations, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 35.6 million individuals in 2010, a number expected to almost quadruple by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The global economic cost of the disease is huge and was estimated in 2010 to total US$604 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current management of AD involves symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor partial antagonists and other drugs used to treat secondary behavioral symptoms associated with the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AD has identified a key role for amyloid-&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) peptide deposits in the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Blocking aggregation of A&#x003b2; peptides and reducing A&#x003b2; plaque burden using disease-modifying immunotherapies is a promising approach in the treatment of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, recent phase III trial results of using monoclonal antibodies targeting A&#x003b2; have demonstrated equivocal evidence for efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], although clinical studies with solanezumab in patients with mild AD are continuing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In a phase II trial of an active immunotherapy antibody to full-length A&#x003b2; peptide (AN1792 protein given with the adjuvant QS-21), researchers reported meningoencephalitis in a subset of patients, which led to concerns regarding T-cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, the novel, active immunotherapy CAD106 is targeted against a small peptide fragment of A&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub>) and is conjugated to a carrier (Q&#x003b2; bacteriophage). CAD106 is designed to ensure repetitive antigen (A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub>) presentation and strong B-cell response, stimulating the generation of A&#x003b2;-specific antibodies while avoiding initiation of A&#x003b2;-specific T-cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Preclinical evidence suggests that CAD106 is capable of reducing A&#x003b2; accumulation in the brain by inducing antibodies that interfere with amyloid deposition and by binding to A&#x003b2; aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Following these positive preclinical findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], researchers in the first-in-human CAD106 study (CCAD106A2101; NCT00411580) investigated safety, tolerability and A&#x003b2;-specific antibody response following three subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of CAD106 or placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The findings from that study suggested that three injections of CAD106 (50 or 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) have a favorable safety profile and are capable of eliciting promising antibody responses without inducing autoimmune reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In that study, total plasma A&#x003b2; concentration increased, whereas free A&#x003b2; in plasma decreased, indicating <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of antibodies to A&#x003b2;.

Patients or their caregivers were instructed to record details of local and systemic injection-related reactions in a diary over a 7-day period following each injection. MRI was performed at screening, three times post-baseline during the core studies (Weeks 10, 20 and 52 (2201); Weeks 14, 26 and 52 (2202)) and three times during the extension studies (Weeks 74, 100 and 122).

The responder threshold was increased after learnings from the 2201E and 2202E extension studies were implemented. Serological responders were defined as demonstrating a consistent antibody response after the second and third injections: A&#x003b2;-IgG titers above 16 U between the second and third injections and above 26.8 U after the third injection. The threshold of 16 U corresponds to the LLOQ plus three times the SD, and the threshold of 26.8 U corresponds to three times the LLOQ. Antibody response was characterized by the area under the titer curve (AUC), calculated using the trapezoidal method for observed data.</p><p>Change from baseline in phospho-tau in CSF was analyzed by using a mixed-effects repeated measurement model, adjusted for phospho-tau baseline value and including visit week and the interaction as repeated factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patients</title><p>Fifty-eight patients were randomized and exposed to study drug during the core studies: 47 to CAD106 and 11 to placebo.

In 2202E, only 13 patients (54.2%) received the scheduled four injections. Eight patients (33.4%) did not receive the fourth injection, owing to temporary suspension of CAD106 dosing during the evaluation of an SAE (subdural hematoma followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)), initially suspected to be related to study drug in another study with CAD106.</p><p>Baseline (core study) demographics and disease characteristics were generally well balanced between patients randomized to receive CAD106 versus placebo, although patients in the CAD106 pooled group were, on average, 2&#x000a0;years older and less frequently apolipoprotein E4 allele (ApoE4) carriers (60% versus 82%).

In the extension studies, seven patients (15.6%) reported cardiac disorders; four of these patients had previously reported such events during the core studies. Of the nine patients with cardiac disorders, two patients required hospitalization: one for myocardial ischemia along with an AE of coronary artery stenosis, and one for complete atrioventricular block. In addition, four patients reported rhythm disturbances (bradycardia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), ventricular extrasystoles (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), tachycardia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1)), two reported cardiac perfusion-related AEs (angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis coronary artery) and one experienced left ventricular hypertrophy.</p><p>There were no incidences of meningoencephalitis, autoimmune disease or CNS inflammation, as confirmed by CSF laboratory assessments and regular MRI scans. No relevant findings were reported on ECGs, vital signs measurements or standard laboratory evaluations in patients treated with CAD106 or placebo. There was no increase in white blood cell count in CSF and no abnormalities in albumin or total IgG CSF : blood indices. Increase in oligoclonal bands in CSF only, with no concomitant signs or symptoms, was detected in two (9.1%) CAD106-treated patients during core study 2201.</p><p>Across the two core and extension studies, one patient died during the open-label extension study 2202E. The death was not considered to be related to study medication (progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). There was no imbalance of SAEs during the core studies across treatment groups. Of the 13 reported SAEs, a single case of ICH was assessed by the investigator as potentially related to CAD106 during core study 2201. After receiving the three scheduled injections of CAD106, the patient did not meet the responder criteria and had last detectable A&#x003b2;-IgG at week 16 (12.6 U). A small sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage was identified on the scheduled MRI at week 20, and an ICH was diagnosed during an unscheduled MRI at week 36, conducted after the patient experienced word-finding difficulties and disorientation. A relationship to study drug was considered possible by the investigator. The patient completed the core study safety monitoring until Week 52, but was not eligible to continue in the extension.</p><p>During the extension studies, two patients discontinued as a result of SAEs (SAEs of rectal neoplasm (2201E) and rapid AD progression (2202E)).</p><p>During the core studies, two patients presented with findings meeting ARIA-H criteria: one placebo-treated patient (9.1%) presented with two or more new microhemorrhages (2202), and one CAD106-treated patient (2.1%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (2201; the same patient who reported SAE of ICH). During the extension studies, two further patients (4.3%) presented with two or more new microhemorrhages. All four patients across the studies remained asymptomatic. The three CAD106-treated patients were carriers of one ApoE4 allele, whereas the placebo-treated patient was a non-carrier. Only one of the CAD106-treated patients (with a finding of at least two new microhemorrhages during the extension) met the criteria for being a serological responder.</p><p>No MRI findings compatible with ARIA-E criteria were reported. One asymptomatic case of new hyperintense T2-weighted lesion (CAD106-treated patient (2202)) at Week 52 was confirmed as related to a small cortical infarction (stroke) upon repeat MRI.</p><p>Brief, self-limited injection-related reactions, either local reactions (for example, redness, induration or swelling) or systemic reactions (such as flu-like symptoms, fever, headache, fatigue, chills or muscular pain), were observed in the majority of patients receiving CAD106. The reactions were mostly mild to moderate and did not require treatment. None of the reactions led to discontinuation of injections. In one case, a patient experienced transient systemic reactions (syncope) associated with the second and third injections in the core study (2202; s.c. route) that were suspected to be related to study drug. This patient entered the extension study and received the fourth injection (first injection of extension) under supervision at the hospital. All four injections in the extension study were well tolerated, and there were no further reports of similar systemic reactions in this patient. During the core studies, tolerability with the i.m. route of injection (2202) was comparable with the s.c. route (2201 and part of study 2202) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

The affinity profiles demonstrated wide polyclonal distribution of A&#x003b2;-specific antibody response, with a notable improvement in overall apparent affinity of response between Weeks 8 and 14, with a subpopulation of antibodies reaching nanomolar affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> at Week 14 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C).</p><p>At each lumbar puncture, all patients who contributed CSF samples were also tested for A&#x003b2;-IgGs in CSF. Only two of the 47 CAD106-treated patients had quantifiable A&#x003b2;-IgGs in CSF; both patients had high serum A&#x003b2;-IgGs at the same time points. One patient had CSF IgG titer of 2.87 U and serum level of 1,240 U (2201E1 at Week 96), and the other had a CSF IgG titer of 1.13 U and serum level of 260 U (2202 at Week 14). These titers yield a CSF : serum ratio of antibodies close to 0.2%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>T-cell response</title><p>A Q&#x003b2;-induced T-cell response (change from baseline in IFN-&#x003b3;-secreting cell numbers) was consistently detected in patients treated with CAD106. Mean change from baseline (SD) in Q&#x003b2;-induced T-cell response increased with injections and reached a maximum 2&#x000a0;weeks after the third injection in both studies (Week 14 (2201)&#x02009;=&#x02009;31.0 (48.95) and Week 8 (2202)&#x02009;=&#x02009;39.2 (67.34), respectively). No change was observed at any time point with A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> or A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> in patients treated with placebo. Neither A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> nor A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> induced any specific T-cell responses. The number of T cells secreting IFN-&#x003b3; remained stable up to 2&#x000a0;weeks after the third injection.

Overall in the core studies, no treatment effect was observed on any CSF disease-related markers with CAD106 versus placebo at the early CSF time point of 8&#x000a0;weeks after the third injection (Week 20 (2201) and Week 14 (2202)). During the extension studies, lumbar puncture was optional and only a few patients contributed CSF (13 at Week 96 and 8 at Week 122 on open-label treatment with CAD106). Decreases in CSF phospho-tau concentrations from core study baseline were observed in the extension studies. Baseline values at the start of CAD106 open-label treatment (Week 56) were not available for comparison. For patients treated with CAD106 throughout the core and extension studies, the model base (mixed-effects repeated-measures analysis) indicated consistent results between studies. The least squares mean change over time was &#x02212;24.38&#x000a0;pg/ml (95% confidence interval (CI): &#x02212;28.25; &#x02212;20.51) at Week 96 and &#x02212;21.29&#x000a0;pg/ml (95% CI: &#x02212;26.42; &#x02212;16.16) at Week 122. Of note, the two patients who received placebo during the core studies also showed a decrease in phospho-tau from core study baseline when receiving CAD106 in the extension studies.</p><p>Brain atrophy consistent with natural disease progression, and in line with published annual rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], was observed across all studies and treatment groups. There were no treatment-related findings with respect to total brain volume or total ventricle volume.</p><p>There were no treatment-related benefits with respect to outcomes on clinical scales compared with placebo at any time point. Patients generally demonstrated deterioration on all assessment scales over the course of the studies, consistent with the progressive nature of AD. Of those patients who continued in the extension studies, mean (SD) change from baseline on the ADAS-Cog at Week 52 was 5.6 (7.2) for CAD106 versus 5.0 (7.3) for placebo; at Week 122 (all patients receiving CAD106), the mean change from baseline was 12.8 (11.1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of these studies suggest that long-term treatment with CAD106 is in line with the findings from the phase I study and demonstrate that CAD106 is capable of generating a consistent antibody response over the course of seven injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The study population was representative of patients with mild AD. In a review of ApoE status and its relationship to AD, the frequency of ApoE4 carriers was estimated to be 58% in the AD population versus 23% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The overall proportion of ApoE4 carriers in these studies (&#x0003e;60%) is relevant when evaluating the safety of CAD106 in ApoE4 carriers, who have been reported to be at greater risk for ARIA-E following treatment with the passive amyloid immunotherapy bapineuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Throughout the studies reported here, no patient met the criteria for ARIA-E and four patients met the criteria for ARIA-H. One patient who received CAD106 during the core study experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was diagnosed with an ICH 16&#x000a0;weeks later, approximately 5&#x000a0;months after receiving the last injection of CAD106.</p><p>Our findings support the safety and tolerability of CAD106 observed in the phase I study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There were no unexpected safety findings related to treatment with CAD106 and no occurrences of meningoencephalitis, autoimmune disease, CNS inflammation or asymptomatic vasogenic edema, in contrast to previous reports with A&#x003b2; antibody therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although events related to cardiac disorders were reported more frequently in CAD106-treated patients versus placebo during the core studies, a similar number of patients reported cardiac events in the CAD106 open-label extension studies. No specific pattern of disorder was identified, and the occurrence rate (&#x0003c;16% overall) was in line with that expected in an elderly population followed for up to 122&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The favorable tolerability and serological response of i.m. versus s.c. administration seen in core study 2202 resulted in selection of i.m. administration for future trials of CAD106.</p><p>Long-term administration of CAD106 was associated with a safety and tolerability profile similar to the initial injections received during the core studies. CAD106 was generally well tolerated, with most AEs considered mild or moderate in severity and consistent with that expected in an elderly population. They were generally not considered related to study medication, with the exception of short-lasting and self-limited injection-related reactions, which were experienced by most patients.</p><p>As observed in the phase I study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], treatment with CAD106 during the core studies induced an antibody response against A&#x003b2; in the majority of patients. This finding provides supporting evidence that CAD106 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g is an effective dose for producing an antibody response. Antibody titers at Week 8 (after second injection in 2201 or third injection in 2202) were similar across the studies, indicating that the additional early injection at Week 2 in 2202 did not contribute to the magnitude of the immune response. Only two patients had a quantifiable level of A&#x003b2;-specific IgGs in CSF, each at one time point during the studies. The CSF : serum IgG ratio was in line with the expected ratio for diffusion of large molecules, such as antibodies, through the blood&#x02013;brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A full mechanism supporting the potential for peripheral antibodies targeting CNS A&#x003b2; has not yet been elucidated. Despite the small levels of A&#x003b2;-specific IgGs anticipated to reach the CSF, these antibodies can exert a multitude of effects on CNS A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Long-term treatment with CAD106 induced A&#x003b2;-specific antibody titers similar to the initial response, but with a prolonged time to decline, suggesting that antibody exposure may be increased between injections. The observed greater increase in total plasma A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub> with long-term treatment could be explained by affinity maturation of the A&#x003b2;-specific antibodies following repeated injections. Indeed, affinity maturation profiles of the antibodies for A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> demonstrated a pronounced increase in affinity after the third CAD106 injection, compared with after the second injection in the same patient. However, the limited sample size means that these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The absence of A&#x003b2;-specific T-cell responses in CAD106-treated patients suggests that CAD106 does not induce a T-cell-mediated immune response against A&#x003b2;, consistent with previous findings from the phase I study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This mechanism was involved in the autoimmune meningoencephalitis observed with the full-length A&#x003b2; protein, AN1792 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Positive control T-cell activation by the Q&#x003b2; CAD106 carrier particle was shown in preclinical studies with CAD106 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but our findings represent the first time this response has been observed in humans. Overall, the T-cell response to CAD106 treatment supports the favorable tolerability profile of CAD106, minimizing the likelihood of autoimmune reactions while indicating its validity as an active immunization.</p><p>In addition to A&#x003b2; accumulation, AD pathology is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles formed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which has been hypothesized to be a downstream product of A&#x003b2; toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the present study, phospho-tau concentrations in the extensions were numerically lower than in the core studies, irrespective of core study treatment. Although the relevance of these observations is difficult to assess in the absence of appropriate reference measurements, the apparent decrease in phospho-tau may be due to natural disease progression or a direct treatment effect after more than 2&#x000a0;years of disease evolution in patients with mild AD. Indeed, recent longitudinal data have demonstrated that CSF biomarkers, including phospho-tau, decrease in the later stages of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>No treatment-related differences were observed in brain volume or in any of the AD clinical scale measurements. However, the results on the clinical scales should be interpreted with caution, owing to small population sizes. Continuous exposure to antibody titers through regular injections, along with targeting earlier disease stages, might increase the likelihood of positive effects on clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, recently published results modeling A&#x003b2; accumulation using amyloid positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated a sigmoidal pattern of amyloid accumulation within the brain and suggested that therapeutic strategies designed to reduce amyloid deposition may be most effective if administered early in the disease course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A recent review summarized treatment development in AD over the last 30&#x000a0;years and highlighted the need for further detailed proof-of-concept studies with anti-amyloid therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of these studies indicate that long-term treatment with CAD106 induced antibodies to A&#x003b2; and increased A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub> levels in serum, suggesting that this approach can achieve target engagement in the periphery. The favorable safety profile of CAD106 observed in these studies supports active immunization with A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;6</sub> and, combined with the absence of a specific T-cell response against A&#x003b2; and the ability to produce a sustained antibody response, suggests that CAD106 may be a valuable therapeutic option in the chronic treatment of AD. A 12-week interval between CAD106 injections is currently being evaluated across seven injections. This regimen is expected to result in continuous exposure to higher antibody titers. Our data support the continued investigation of active immunization strategies in AD and offer promise for immunotherapy as a future treatment option.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13195_2015_108_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
