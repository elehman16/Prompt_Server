It is available as several different formulations, including transdermal patch, chewing gum, sublingual tablet or lozenge, inhaler and nasal spray. The patch is a &#x0201c;fixed&#x0201d; delivery format, whereas the other formulations can be considered acute or flexible formats. As the principal action of NRT is relief of withdrawal symptoms, including craving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>], it may be possible to increase the efficacy of NRT if new formats reduce these symptoms faster and more effectively. Existing NRT formats are limited by relatively slow systemic absorption of nicotine, with the possible exception of nicotine nasal spray; however, the nasal spray causes marked initial local irritation, which restricts its appeal.</p><p>A new nicotine mouth spray (NMS), which delivers 1 mg nicotine per spray, has been developed to enable more rapid nicotine absorption than from existing oral NRT formats. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study reported a shorter time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration (10&#x02013;12.5 min post-administration), and significantly higher area under the plasma-concentration time curve during the first 10 min, with NMS 1 mg or 2 mg than either 4 mg nicotine lozenge or gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Unpublished results from a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study show that comparable doses of 4 mg nicotine per hour (NMS 2 mg every 30 min) resulted in steady-state plasma levels somewhat higher than those for gum (14&#x02013;22%) or lozenge (10&#x02013;15%). Unpublished results from a craving relief study demonstrate that two doses of NMS 1 mg reduced craving significantly faster than either nicotine lozenge 2 mg or 4 mg (both unpublished studies were presented by A. Hansson, R. Perfekt and H. Kraiczi at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 17th Annual Meeting, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2011).</p><p>The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of NMS 1 mg per spray <italic>versus</italic> placebo in achieving continuous abstinence from smoking from week 2 until week 6, 24 and 52, respectively. In an effort to replicate an over-the-counter situation, counselling was as unobtrusive as possible.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and conduct</title><p>This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 52-week study was performed at three smoking cessation clinics in Denmark (Copenhagen) and Germany (Mannheim and T&#x000fc;bingen) between March 2009 and June 2010.

Subjects were instructed to quit smoking completely the day after the baseline visit and to start using the spray. The study comprised 11 clinic visits (baseline, and week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 52) and four telephone contacts between weeks 24 and 52. Low-intensity counselling was provided, with general written and brief (&#x0003c;10 min) verbal smoking cessation advice at baseline, and very brief (&#x0003c;3 min) verbal cessation advice at subsequent visits up to and including week 24. The primary study end-point was self-reported, objectively verified continuous abstinence from smoking from week 2 until weeks 6, 24 and 52. The study protocol was approved by local independent ethics committees and all subjects provided verbal and written, signed, informed consent before entering the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study treatment</title><p>All study medications were manufactured by McNeil AB, Helsingborg, Sweden. The NMS (1 mg of nicotine per spray after priming) and placebo spray contained 150 metered spray doses for administration into the mouth. The nicotine solution is clear to weakly opalescent, colourless to light yellow, with a peppermint scent. The placebo was identical in appearance, but contained capsaicin instead of nicotine to mimic the taste of nicotine.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dosage instructions</title><p>During weeks 1&#x02013;6, subjects were instructed to use one to two sprays when they normally would have smoked a cigarette or when they experienced an urge to smoke; the second spray could be used if cravings were not reduced within a few minutes of the first spray. For many smokers, this meant one to two sprays every 30&#x02013;60 min; the recommended maximum dose was four sprays per hour, and 64 sprays per day. After the 6-week full dose period, subjects were instructed to reduce spray use so that by the end of week 9 they were using half of the average number of sprays used per day during weeks 1&#x02013;6, then to continue to reduce to not more than four sprays per day by week 12. Occasional use (not more than four sprays per day) was permitted during weeks 13&#x02013;24.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Assessments</title><p>Smoking status was assessed at all visits, using self-reports, objectively confirmed by measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels in exhaled air after a 15-s breath hold using a CO monitor (Micro CO Monitor, Cardinal Health, Basingstoke, UK). A CO level &#x02265;10 ppm classified the subject as a smoker.</p><p>During the first 4 weeks, subjects self-reported daily use of study drug, adverse events and craving and withdrawal symptoms experienced during the previous 24 h, using a Palm Treo<sup>TM</sup> 650 portable electronic diary (eDiary; software by CRF Health, Helsinki, Finland).

He used approximately 10 sprays of NMS per day before permanently stopping treatment 4 days prior to the AMI (6 months into the study). However, he was still smoking 10 cigarettes per day.

Most events were rated as mild; none were severe.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of NMS 1 mg for smoking cessation. Active spray was superior to placebo with respect to abstinence up to 6, 24 and 52 weeks, with 53% of subjects continuously abstinent at week 6 still abstinent at week 52. The observed RR of 2.48 at 1 yr is higher than that for other NRT formulations. For NRT the relative efficacy has been fairly consistent across the level of support and different settings, such as over-the-counter, general physician practices and specialist smoking cessation services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. However, our 1-yr absolute abstinence rate of 13.8% was lower than that in several previous smoking cessation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>], probably due to the minimal counselling employed in our study. It has been shown that quit rates increase with increasing intensity of counselling and number of clinic visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>].</p><p>The median nicotine substitution level after 2 weeks among point prevalence abstinent subjects on active treatment was low. This was reflected by 65&#x02013;85% of abstinent subjects in the active group having average daily doses of spray regularly below their baseline number of cigarettes per day, during the 6-week full treatment period. Two trials that addressed scheduling of NRT as a way of improving adherence compared a fixed-dose regimen of nicotine 2 mg gum against a smoking-urge-driven regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. The fixed-dose regimen had higher quit rates (and higher treatment usage) but the difference was nonsignificant (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.92&#x02013;1.61) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Our study employed a new, more intuitive, schedule that essentially combined an urge-driven and a fixed-dose regimen, <italic>i.e.</italic> a flexible schedule (subjects were asked to take a spray when they would normally have smoked a cigarette, or experienced cravings) that also included a typical fixed schedule for most smokers. One option for the future with the aim of increasing the overall level of nicotine substitution could be to use a combination of NMS plus nicotine patch, which delivers a more constant level of nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Combination therapy with two types of NRT has been shown to increase quit rates compared to monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite the low nicotine substitution levels attained with NMS, use of active spray resulted in higher observed efficacy relative to placebo. This could possibly be attributed to the more rapid absorption of nicotine compared to other oral NRTs and thereby faster relief of cravings (unpublished results presented by A. Hansson, R. Perfekt and H. Kraiczi at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 17th Annual Meeting). This explanation is supported by the lower mean craving scores among abstinent subjects using active NMS compared to placebo during the first few weeks. A relationship has been reported between the severity of some withdrawal symptoms, including craving, and outcome of attempts to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>].</p><p>Although almost 90% of subjects using active spray reported adverse events, the number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events was low (NMS 9.1%, placebo 7.5%), and was comparable to other NRTs or varenicline in smoking cessation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. The high incidence of hiccups with NMS was probably secondary to irritation from swallowed nicotine, so current patient instructions advise users not to swallow the spray straight after spraying.</p><p>In summary, NMS is effective in helping smokers quit and, with a relative success rate of 2.48 compared to placebo regarding abstinence at 1 yr, might have greater relative efficacy than other forms of NRT. The NMS seems to be well tolerated during use, with an expected adverse event profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the other study investigators (Z. Saghir and H.
