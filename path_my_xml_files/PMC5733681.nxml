The aquaretic-discontinued subjects were younger, had better baseline renal&#x000a0;function, and had higher fasting urine osmolality than aquaretic-continued subjects. Of the 750 subjects reporting an AAE, 105 (14%) discontinued for another reason (non-aquaretic-discontinued group). Compared to non-aquaretic-discontinued subjects, aquaretic-discontinued subjects were more commonly male, had better baseline renal function, and discontinued the study drug faster. After 3 years of therapy, 75% of tolvaptan subjects indicated that they could tolerate their current dose for the rest of their lives, compared to 85% of placebo subjects.

Consistent with its mechanism of action, the use of tolvaptan in clinical trials has been associated with aquaretic adverse events (AAEs). Given their high frequency, AAEs might be expected to impose some limitations on tolvaptan use in the clinic, but this has not been directly examined. To dissect this issue in more detail, the current subanalysis of the TEMPO 3:4 trial and its open-label extension TEMPO 4:4 characterized the impact of tolvaptan-related AAEs on a subject&#x02019;s decision to discontinue from the trial. This study also aimed to identify characteristics of ADPKD patients who were at increased risk for AAEs, which may allow for better tolvaptan titration regimens and encourage compliance.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Trial Design</title><p id="p0025">This was a <italic>post hoc,</italic> exploratory subanalysis of the TEMPO 3:4 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT00428948" id="intref0015">NCT00428948</ext-link>).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> TEMPO 3:4 was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year trial assessing the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in subjects with ADPKD. Eligibility requirements included a diagnosis of ADPKD according to the Ravine criteria, a total kidney volume of&#x000a0;&#x02265; 750 ml as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an estimated creatinine clearance rate of&#x000a0;&#x02265; 60 ml per minute as calculated by the Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault formula, and an age of 18 to 50 years. A total of 1445 eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either tolvaptan (n&#x000a0;= 961) or matching placebo (n&#x000a0;= 484). Following randomization, subjects were to be administered 2 doses of study drug per day for 3 years, initiating with a 3-week titration period. During the first week of the titration period, the active arm received tolvaptan at a dose of 45 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the afternoon. This split dose was increased to 60/30 mg in the second week and to 90/30 mg in the third week according to subject-reported tolerability. Subjects were allowed to down-titrate to 45/15 mg at any time during the trial but were advised to remain on their highest tolerated dose throughout the remaining trial period. The investigators were instructed on the necessity to explain the mechanism of action of the drug in relation to expected AAEs including polyuria and the need to compensate with adequate water intake.</p><p id="p0030">To confirm any conclusions about AAEs in TEMPO 3:4, we further examined prior placebo subjects who crossed over to open-label tolvaptan in TEMPO 4:4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0020">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01214421" id="intref0025">NCT01214421</ext-link>).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> TEMPO 4:4 was a nonrandomized, open-label extension of TEMPO 3:4 that sought to determine whether tolvaptan modified the progression of ADPKD and whether its effects could be sustained over time. The trial included 871 patients on open-label tolvaptan, 557 who had received tolvaptan in TEMPO 3:4 and 314 who had received placebo. The entry criteria were completion of TEMPO 3:4 and an eGFR<sub>MDRD</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02265; 30 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Treatment used the same split-dose regimens as the TEMPO 3:4 trial for a minimum of 2 years.

These are referred to in this report as&#x000a0;aquaretic-continued (AC), non&#x02013;aquaretic-discontinued (NAD), and aquaretic-discontinued (AD), respectively. Subjects who experienced an AAE were analyzed separately for those who continued or discontinued the trial and separately for those who discontinued the trial due to polyuria versus all other combined aquaretic AAEs.</p><p id="p0045">Specific assessments conducted on the individual subpopulations included the following: frequency and timing of AAEs and non-AAEs leading to trial discontinuation; dose of tolvaptan at trial discontinuation; highest titrated dose of tolvaptan before discontinuation; baseline demographics, including age, sex, height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV), renal function (eGFR<sub>CKD-EPI</sub>), and fasting baseline urine osmolality (uOsm).</p><p id="p0050">In addition, in a patient-reported outcome analysis in TEMPO 3:4, the percentage of subjects who tolerated their current dose of study drug was determined. The analysis was based on a questionnaire that asked, among other queries, whether the subject could tolerate his or her current dose of study drug for the rest of his or her life (those who answered &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to this question were either titrated to a lower dose of medication or discontinued from the trial).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="p0055">Baseline characteristics were calculated for subjects who reported an AAE separately for those who continued or discontinued the trial and separately for those who discontinued the trial due to polyuria versus all other combined aquaretic AAEs.

Once adjusted to the aquaretic side effects, overall tolerability to ongoing therapy was very favorable in the ADPKD trial population. In fact, 75% of subjects who were still receiving tolvaptan at 3 years indicated that they could tolerate their current dose of medication for the rest of their lives, compared with 85% of placebo patients. Accordingly, only 10% of subjects withdrew because of an AAE over the course of the trial.

In general, the safety profile for tolvaptan in TEMPO 4:4 was similar to that in TEMPO 3:4. Most adverse events were related to the aquaretic effect of tolvaptan. These AAEs were more frequently reported in the delayed-treatment group who had not been previously exposed to tolvaptan. The higher proportion of subjects in TEMPO 4:4 who did not titrate past the starting dose of 45/15 mg could be attributed to a more relaxed outlook on pushing titration to the maximum tolerated dose, as this was an open-label extension and not a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="p0115">Although most tolvaptan-naive subjects from TEMPO 3:4 and TEMPO 4:4 attempted to down-titrate before discontinuation, a large cohort of subjects never titrated past the starting dose of 45/15 mg (TEMPO 3:4, n&#x000a0;= 22 [31%]; TEMPO 4:4, n&#x000a0;= 13 [62%]).

Given that urine concentrating ability decreases with disease progression, subjects in later stages of disease may be more accustomed to managing a higher urine volume and, consequently, may perceive the polyuria and nocturia associated with increased aquaresis as being less burdensome.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p id="p0120">From a mechanistic perspective, elevated cAMP levels in renal tubule epithelial cells play a key role&#x000a0;in&#x000a0;ADPKD pathogenesis.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Achieving maximal antagonism of cAMP via V2-receptor inhibition, that is, titrating tolvaptan to its highest available dose, is thus expected to have maximal clinical benefit. This therapeutic goal, however, must be balanced by the recognition that excessive aquaresis can be an important factor limiting compliance; thus, 750 of 961 tolvaptan-treated subjects in TEMPO 3:4 (78%) reported at least 1 AAE, of whom 72 (10%) discontinued from the trial because of an aquaretic-related event. The current subanalysis identified 2 important risk factors for tolvaptan discontinuation in ADPKD patients. First, subjects with better renal function, as measured by higher eGFR, and subjects with a greater ability to concentrate their urine were more likely to discontinue tolvaptan. Second, sensitivity to tolvaptan-mediated AAEs appeared most pronounced early after drug initiation, as observed by the significant difference in time to discontinuation between AD and NAD groups (96 vs. 372 days, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.0001, respectively) and those who discontinued for other AEs (96 vs. 288 days, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). This finding is supported by the early-treatment group in TEMPO 4:4, who had completed 3 years of tolvaptan treatment in TEMPO 3:4. Although they continued to report a high frequency of AAEs (350 of 557 [63%]), very few discontinued because of an AAE (3 of 350 [1%]). This was further validated in the recent Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Function: An Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and Efficacy in ADPKD (REPRISE) trial, which used a tolvaptan titration (2 weeks) and run-in period (3 weeks) to enrich the trial for subjects who could tolerate tolvaptan treatment, to minimize the number of early aquaretic-related discontinuations.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Of the 1491 subjects who entered the tolvaptan titration period, adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment in 6.8% of subjects, most of them (4.6%) aquaretic-related, consistent with the findings in this report. Practically, this argues that clinicians should take particular care when administering tolvaptan to ADPKD patients who are in early stages of their disease, in particular starting at a low dose (45/15 mg) and delaying subsequent titration until tolerability has been established.</p><p id="p0125">Given that enrollment in the open-label extension trial TEMPO 4:4 occurred continuously upon completion of TEMPO 3:4, the vast majority of subjects were unaware of the positive efficacy data from the pivotal TEMPO 3:4 trial, as the data were not unblinded or published. Indeed, 9% of prior placebo subjects discontinued the TEMPO 4:4 trial because of AAEs associated with tolvaptan treatment, similar to the 10% AAE discontinuations reported in TEMPO 3:4. An intriguing issue is whether tolerability in real life could be higher than in the setting of the trial. Clinical experience suggests that patients newly exposed to tolvaptan may be more tolerant to polyuria, as many were already exposed to high water intake. More generally, patients may be more inclined to accept adverse events resulting from the mode of action of a given drug, once that drug has been approved. The fact that <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses from the TEMPO 4:4 trial showed positive outcomes for the subgroup of rapid progressors, that is, those patients eligible for tolvaptan prescription, may also be a motivating factor.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="p0130">The aim of dose titration is to block activity of vasopressin at the renal V2 receptor as completely and constantly as possible, while maintaining acceptable fluid balance. The adequacy of vasopressin suppression can be monitored through measurement of fasting trough urine osmolality, which could prove to be an effective strategy to optimize dose titration and tolerability to treatment.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In a recent <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of TEMPO 3:4, subjects with the greatest mean change from baseline in urine osmolality were more&#x000a0;likely to achieve a better clinical response as measured by slowed renal function decline.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> A target decrease of&#x000a0;&#x02265;300 mOsm/kg from baseline may be considered ideal in most cases, although a decrease of&#x000a0;&#x02265;200 mOsm/kg from&#x000a0;baseline may be appropriate in patients who are relatively early in their disease course and are likely to be more sensitive to the aquaretic side effects of tolvaptan. If possible, an absolute urine osmolality&#x000a0;&#x0003c;300 mOsm/kg should be maintained at all times. Thus, measuring changes in urine osmolality over time could help guide dosing and titration decisions.</p><p id="p0135">In conclusion, to support long-term compliance, tolvaptan dosing and titration decisions in ADPKD patients with high baseline renal function and high fasting baseline urine osmolality should be approached conservatively and in partnership with the patient before initiating therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0140">OD and ABC are members of the steering committee of the TEMPO 3:4 trial and have received research funding from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &#x00026; Commercialization, Inc.
