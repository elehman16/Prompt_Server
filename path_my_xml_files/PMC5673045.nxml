Current local anesthetics display suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile during CWI; chloroprocaine (CP) has ideal characteristics, but has never been tested for CWI. We performed an animal study to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile and anti-inflammatory effect of CP during CWI. A total of 14 piglets received an infusion catheter after pararectal laparotomy and were randomly allocated to one of three groups: 5 mL/h infusion of saline (group A), CP 1.5% (group B) and CP 0.5% (group C). Blood sampling was performed to assess absorption and systemic inflammation at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 102 and 108 hours. The wound and contralateral healthy abdominal wall were sampled for histological analyses. Absorption of CP from the site of infusion, evaluated as the plasmatic concentrations of CP and its metabolite, 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid (CABA), showed a peak during the first 6 hours, but both CP and its metabolite rapidly disappeared after stopping CP infusion. Local inflammation was reduced in groups B and C (CP-treated <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), in a CP dose-dependent fashion. While CP inhibited in a dose-dependent manner pig mononuclear cells (MNCs) in vitro proliferation to a polyclonal activator, no effect on systemic cytokines&#x02019; concentrations or on ex vivo monocytes&#x02019; responsiveness was observed, suggesting the lack of systemic effects, in line with the very short half-life of CP in plasma. CP showed a very good profile for use in CWI, with dose-dependent local anti-inflammatory effects, limited absorption and rapid clearance from the bloodstream upon discontinuation. No cytotoxicity or side effects were observed. CP, therefore, may represent an optimal choice for clinical CWI, adaptable to each patient&#x02019;s need, and protective on wound inflammatory response (and hyperalgesia) after surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>continuous wound infusion</kwd><kwd>pig model</kwd><kwd>chloroprocaine</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>postoperative pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Postoperative analgesia still remains a challenge,<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the importance of targeted treatments has often been stressed.<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Pain involves different mechanisms (peripheral nociception, central modulation and primary and secondary hyperalgesia), with nociceptor&#x02019;s activation being the trigger for all.

Final conditions were held for 3 minutes before equilibration back at starting conditions.</p><p>The triple-quadruple was operated in positive ions mode for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The following characteristic fragmentations were used for identification and quantitative analyses: CP from m/z 272 to 198.6 or 153.9, CABA from m/z 172.2 to 128 or 153.9, and d<sub>4</sub>-PABA from m/z 142.1 to 98.8 or 123.9. The most abundant transition was used for quantitative analysis, while the second transition was used as qualifier for additional identification purposes.

The reduction in inflammatory infiltrates and signs of tissue regeneration are more evident with higher doses of CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-jpr-10-2515">Figure 4</xref>), however no statistically significant difference was observed between groups B and C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-10-2515">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Systemic inflammatory analysis</title><p>Plasma cytokine quantification at different time points did not reveal any statistical differences between groups B and C versus group A, respectively, for the pro-inflammatory cytokines&#x02019; levels (IL-1&#x003b2;, <italic>p</italic> = 0.8 and 0.4; IL-6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7 and 0.9; IL-8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6 and 0.6; IFN-&#x003b3;, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06 and 0.2) and those of the anti-inflammatory ones (IL-10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3 and 0.3) during the entire follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-jpr-10-2515">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro and ex vivo cell proliferation analyses</title><p>The effect of CP and its metabolite on the in vitro proliferation of pig MNCs stimulated with PHA was evaluated at different concentrations in 4 animals using MNCs obtained before any kind of surgical procedure and treatment.

Moreover, CP and CABA did not induce in vitro cell proliferation at any concentrations of resting MNCs, indicating no antigenic activity.</p><p>In order to assess the effect of CP and CABA we evaluated ex vivo the response to PHA of MNCs isolated from blood collected at different time points (basal, 96 and 108 hours).

In a translational perspective, and responding to the need of testing this molecule in an experimental setting, we investigated the use of CP in a large animal model (pig).</p><p>The current investigation confirmed the hypothesis that CWI in our large animal model would result in relatively low amounts of CP being absorbed, and in light of the extremely short half-life of CP in plasma may definitely limit the possibility of systemic effects: indeed during the 96 hours of 5 mL/h continuous administration of both 0.5% and 1.5% CP, the overall amount of CP penetrating the systemic circulation (that is plasma concentrations of CP + its plasmatic metabolite CABA) reached an average <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> at least 10-fold lower than that observed in obstetric patients receiving epidural CP during cesarian section.<xref rid="b24-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A dose-related increase in concentrations was observed after the beginning of the CWI and up to 6 hours, suggesting an initial blood vessel-dilating response to CP,<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> resulting in a peak of absorption that appeared to progressively decrease over time. We registered no side effects or allergic reaction in any of the enrolled animals. Our study confirms CP as an ideal local anesthetic for CWI, due to its fast catabolism, safety and on/off profile.</p><p>The lack of a cholinesterase inhibitor at collection prevents the actual assessment of systemic exposure to intact CP since CP degradation occurs very rapidly in plasma, but reporting the total amount of CP entering the bloodstream (that is CP + CABA) our study reliably describes the overall absorption of CP upon CWI, showing concentrations well below those observed upon epidural administration during either cesarean section or vaginal delivery,<xref rid="b24-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> peaking between 3 and 6 hours and decreasing to undetectable levels after infusion was suspended. Therefore, also taking into account potential differences in esterase activities between the experimental animal used and humans, the systemic exposure to CP appeared very limited, as confirmed by the lack of effects on inflammatory parameters or blood cell activity. Indeed no correlation was detected between treatment and systemic inflammation, as assessed by determination of plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that only local inflammation was modulated by the presence of CP. Additionally, local infusion of CP did not affect the ex vivo response of immune cells obtained from treated animals, even if PHA-induced proliferation of MNCs was suppressed by in vitro addition of CP, further supporting the lack of significant circulating concentrations of intact CP as suggested by the relatively low plasmatic concentrations of CABA.</p><p>Our data also suggest that the continuous infusion with CP displays local anti-inflammatory effects. These effects were dose-dependent, as we observed a more pronounced reduction of inflammatory response in the group treated with higher concentrations of local anesthetic. Since we did not monitor pain, we cannot determine if the dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect is associated with either better pain relief, or with a more pronounced reduction of neurogenic inflammation or with specific anti-inflammatory effect of CP. Investigating the pain response would have provided additional support to our studies, but measuring pain in a large animal model can be very challenging, and a well-accepted model is still lacking. Nevertheless, apart from the assessment of the analgesic effect, our study was able to confirm in a large animal model results previously obtained only in small animals,<xref rid="b26-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> ie, the ability of nociceptive block to reduce local inflammation. In consideration of the promising results relative to the limited absorption and the anti-inflammatory effect of CP obtained with this study, future trials are warranted to address this topic.</p><p>Despite the low sample size (typical of studies in big animal models<xref rid="b19-jpr-10-2515" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we confirmed the limited absorption and a local anti-inflammatory activity of CWI with CP. Once these results are confirmed in humans, they may show CP to be a good choice for CWI allowing immediate analgesic benefit and fast elimination; patients with liver or kidney diseases may take advantage of rapid plasmatic clearance of CP, preventing accumulation and toxicity. Clinical studies are needed to define the lowest effective dose of CP and investigate its anti-inflammatory effect in a human model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study on CP continuous infusion in a large animal model may display future translational value. Once confirmed in humans, our data may show CP to be a first-line choice for CWI, with limited systemic exposure, high compliance to the needs of each patient and potential applications to a broad spectrum of clinical situations. The dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect may have clinical relevance in pain medicine, showing CP to be an interesting target for future clinical applications and research purposes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the following colleagues as strong contributors to this study: Tommaso Dominioni and Andrea Peloso &#x02013; Department of Surgical, Clinical, Paediatric and Diagnostic Science, University of Pavia, and General Surgery 1, IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Andrea Fanelli &#x02013; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico S.
