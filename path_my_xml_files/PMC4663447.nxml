It takes part in energy production, oxygen transportation and DNA synthesis, and is indispensable for the development of the central nervous system. Iron is required for the myelination and production of neurotransmitters. It has been well documented that iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), that is, decreased concentration of haemoglobin (Hb) and depleted iron stores, is associated with impaired child development.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> If the diagnosis of IDA is delayed, the deficits may be irreversible.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A recent Cochrane review stated that iron treatment may improve developmental outcomes in young children with IDA, but the existing evidence is scarce and there is an urgent need for trials assessing long-term effect of this therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common single nutrient deficiency and may affect up to 20% of children of 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;years of age in Europe.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> ID has the potential to negatively influence psychomotor development. However, a causal relationship is not as clear as that for IDA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Exclusive breast feeding increases the risk of ID, but controversies exist about whether iron supplementation in this population should be recommended.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Previous studies have suggested that iron supplementation in healthy infants may enhance psychomotor development. A meta-analysis carried out by our group (Szajewska <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) evaluated the effects of iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women and in non-anaemic healthy children aged <bold>&#x0003c;</bold>3&#x02005;years on the mental performance and psychomotor development of the children. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified, five of which referred to supplementation during infancy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref> Although the included trials were of relatively good methodological quality (all were blinded and most of these were randomised, with proper allocation concealment), the major limitation was incomplete outcome data (&#x0003e;20% lost to follow-up) and risk of selective reporting (study protocols were not available). The pooled results of three RCTs (n=561) showed significant improvement on the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at approximately 12&#x02005;months of age in the iron-supplemented group compared with the control group (mean difference: 4.21; 95% CI 2.31 to 6.12). No significant effect of iron supplementation on the Mental Development Index (MDI) or behaviour was found. A follow-up study of children aged 9&#x02005;years who participated in a randomised trial during infancy (daily supplementation of iron, zinc, iron and zinc, or placebo at 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;months of age for 6&#x02005;months; 92% of participants available for follow-up evaluation) has been recently published.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Cognitive and school performance did not differ significantly between the four groups.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Another recently published systematic review aimed to assess effectiveness of oral iron treatment to improve the developmental and haematological outcomes of preschool children (1&#x02013;5&#x02005;years) with non-anaemic ID (normal Hb concentration and depleted iron stores).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Two randomised trials were identified (n=69), both with moderate risk of bias due to insufficient information on allocation concealment and open-label intervention in one of the trials. One trial showed a statistically significant difference in the post-treatment MDI score among children who received oral iron therapy compared with no therapy (mean difference: 6.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 11.0). Authors concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend oral iron therapy to school-aged children with non-anaemic ID. Adequately powered, randomised trials are needed in children with non-anaemic ID.</p><p>Given that ID is a common problem in young children, measures to prevent it are being taken. According to the Committee of Nutrition of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN CoN), this should be achieved by delayed umbilical cord clamping, the use of iron-fortified formulas when formula feeding is needed, the postponement of the introduction of whole cow milk as the main drink until the end of the first year of life, and the promotion of consumption of complementary foods rich in iron.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, the ESPGHAN CoN concluded that there is no convincing evidence that iron supplements should be provided to normal birth weight, exclusively breastfed infants during the first 6&#x02005;months of life in populations with a low prevalence of IDA among 6-month-old infants. In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends iron supplementation (1&#x02005;mg/kg/day) in exclusively breastfed infants beginning at 4&#x02005;months of age that should be continued until iron from complementary foods is available.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As the level of iron intake is uncertain in partially breastfed infants, the AAP recommends that those who receive more than one-half of their daily feedings as human milk also should be supplemented with 1&#x02005;mg/kg/day of iron beginning at 4&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>This considerable difference between European and US guidelines is based on different interpretations of the scarce available evidence. The only study that has previously addressed this issue was performed by, among others, a member of our group (MD). In that study, 101 Swedish and 131 Honduran, non-anaemic, breastfed infants were randomised into three groups: placebo from 4 to 9&#x02005;months, iron supplements (1&#x02005;mg/kg/day) from 4 to 9&#x02005;months, or placebo from 4 to 6&#x02005;months and iron supplements from 6 to 9&#x02005;months of age.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The study showed that iron supplements effectively decreased the risk of IDA at 9&#x02005;months in Honduran infants, but not in the Swedish infants, who already had a low prevalence of IDA at 9&#x02005;months (&#x0003c;3%). However, in the Swedish infants who received iron supplements, a negative effect was observed on growth.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Unfortunately, these infants were not followed up for a longer period than&#x000a0;9&#x02005;months, and neurodevelopmental outcomes were not assessed.</p><p>There is, therefore, a clear need for interventional studies of good methodological quality to evaluate the role of iron supplementation in non-anaemic infants on their mental and psychomotor development, as well as on possible adverse effects on growth and infections (A Chmielewska, P Dziechciarz, D Gieruszczak-Bia&#x00142;ek, <italic>et al</italic>. Personal communication, 2015).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Iron preparations in the form of syrup or drops, which are usually prescribed for the treatment of anaemia in children, have an unpleasant taste, may stain the teeth, and cause adverse effects mostly related to the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, these preparations need careful measuring to obtain the desired dose.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Micronised ferric pyrophosphate is a novel form of microencapsulated iron, which can be packaged in easy-to-use sachets and added to milk or weaning foods. It has been generally recognised as safe as a nutrient supplement in food.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Ferric pyrophosphate, marketed as SunActive Fe, has been shown to be effective in infants with anaemia.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Its use was less often related to episodes of diarrhoea, vomiting and teeth staining compared with ferrous glycine sulfate drops.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The easy-to-use form of the powder, which can be added to liquids or foods without changing the taste, makes long-term supplementation easier to pursue.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Trial objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The main objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of low-dose iron (1&#x02005;mg/kg/day) supplementation in healthy, term, breastfed infants from 4 to 9&#x02005;months of age with regard to optimising their developmental outcomes measured at 12, 24 and 36&#x02005;months of age. The hypothesis being tested is that psychomotor and mental development will be superior in iron-supplemented children.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of iron supplementation on infant growth (weight, length, head circumference) and laboratory parameters of iron status (Hb, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), haematocrit, serum ferritin (s-Ferritin), reticulocyte Hb, hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor concentration (sTfR)).

Parents will be approached either shortly after birth at the obstetrics department (a tertiary care clinical hospital for women: Department of Obstetrics and Gyneacology, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland) or during well-baby visits at general practitioners&#x02019; offices located within the community of Warsaw. Those who are eligible will be invited to participate in the study. Parents considering participation will receive oral and written information on the study. A researcher will contact the caregivers by telephone at approximately 3.5&#x02005;months of age to check for the eligibility criteria again. Those exclusively breast fed or predominantly breast fed, that is, receiving breast milk for over 50% of feedings at the age of 4&#x02005;months, will be considered for inclusion and invited to the study site. After caregivers provide informed consent, an infant will be included and blood will be obtained. Those without anaemia, defined as Hb &#x0003c;105&#x02005;g/L (&#x0003c;10.5&#x02005;g/dL),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> will be randomised to receive either the iron supplement or placebo from the age of 4 completed months until 9&#x02005;months of age.

If approached shortly after delivery, the mother of a child must express the intention to breast feed. If the child is recruited at an older age, an infant must be breast fed either exclusively or predominantly (&#x0003e;50% feedings). A caregiver must provide written informed consent. This will be obtained by one of the two physicians involved in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The following exclusion criteria will be applied: preterm delivery (&#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks of gestation), birth weight &#x0003c;2500&#x02005;g, multiple pregnancy, major illness or congenital anomaly, being &#x0003c;50% breast fed at the time of inclusion, food allergy, anaemia (Hb &#x0003c;105&#x02005;g/L (10.5&#x02005;g/dL)) at inclusion, lack of informed consent and difficult communication with caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation criteria</title><p>The participants will be randomised at the age of 4 completed months, after rechecking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, under the condition of being exclusively breast fed or receiving breast milk for at least 50% of their daily feeds at the time of randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><p>Infants in the experimental group will receive the powder preparation of iron pyrophosphate and maltodextrin (Actiferol, SunActive Fe, Sequoia, Poland) in a single daily dose of approximately 1&#x02005;mg/kg of body weight from 4 to 9&#x02005;months of age (dose in line with the AAP recommendations). Three doses will be used: 7&#x02005;mg for infants up to 7&#x02005;kg of body weight, 10&#x02005;mg for infants from 7 to 10&#x02005;kg of body weight, and 15&#x02005;mg for those exceeding the weight of 10&#x02005;kg. Caregivers will be instructed to administer the daily dose at the same time of a day after mixing the content of the sachet with a little amount of breastmilk or milk formula. Infants in the placebo group will receive maltodextrin alone. Maltodextrin is an almost flavourless, easily digestable polysaccharide commonly used as a food additive.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title><p>A computer-generated randomisation list prepared by a person unrelated to the trial will be used to allocate participants to the study groups (A or B) in blocks of 10. Stratification by infant gender will be applied. Consecutive randomisation numbers (each number assigned to intervention or placebo in a blinded way, as described below) will be given to participants at enrolment. This procedure will be performed by one of the two physicians involved. The study products will be delivered to the centre in boxes labelled with the letters A and B (meaning of A and B will be blinded, information deposited in a sealed envelope in a safe at the administrative part of the department). The boxes will also carry the information on the specific dose (7, 10 or 15&#x02005;mg). Subsequently, the letters A and B will be removed from the boxes by an independent person unrelated to the study planning and conduct, and replaced with numeric codes corresponding to the randomisation numbers, for example, 001&#x02013;7, 001&#x02013;10, 001&#x02013;15, 002&#x02013;7, 002&#x02013;10, 002&#x02013;15&#x02005;mg, etc. Sachets containing the study product will be packed in small packages of 30 pieces each. Neither the collective packages nor the sachets will carry any labelling and all the unused sachets will always be returned by the parents before switching to a higher dose. The active product and placebo will be packed in identical sachets, and the content will look and taste the same. Researchers, caregivers, outcome assessors and a person responsible for the statistical analysis will be blinded to the intervention until a statistical report for the 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; developmental assessment is available. After that, both the caregivers and main outcome assessor will remain blinded until the completion of the study.

study</title><p>Retaining participants in a clinical trial of long-term duration represents a substantial difficulty for research teams. To make the obtained results the most credible, a high percentage of participants should complete the study and their data should ideally be available for the assessment of main outcomes.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The current study is a trial with a relatively long intervention period and a long follow-up. To avoid high attrition rate, actions recommended in the literature are planned.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The caregivers of participating children will be free to contact a researcher (paediatrician) or a nurse by telephone or email at any time. The researchers and study nurse will contact parents by telephone during the intervention period to ensure that the infant receives the supplement. Visits will be scheduled by telephone 2&#x02005;weeks in advance, and the parents will receive a reminder text message on the day before the scheduled visit. Transportation cost refund will be offered.</p><sec id="s2l1"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Data monitoring committee has not been established since the intervention within the trial (iron 1&#x02005;mg/kg per day) does not differ from standard of care in infants from risk groups.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The profile of potential side effects is also known.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Power calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated for the main outcome of fine and gross motor, cognitive, language, and social-emotional development scores to be measured using the Bayley-III test at the age of 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the previous editions of the test, these elements of the assessment were combined into the PDI and the MDI. To detect a difference of five points in the PDI between the study groups with a power of 80% and &#x003b1;=0.05, a sample of 91 infants is needed in each study group. This sample size is based on the assumption that the SD would be 12 points for the PDI in each study group. To account for 20% of loss to follow-up, we aim to recruit a total of 220 infants for this study.</p><p>Achieving the target sample size might be challenging within the planned period. If the recruitment pace is considered to be too slow, all efforts will be made to increase the number of parents approached mainly by involving additional paediatric practices.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SAS System (SAS System V.9.4, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA, 2013) will be used for calculations: Power, NPAR1WAY, TTEST and MIXED Procedure. Results will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Per-protocol analysis will be applied to compliers only (&#x0003e;75% of doses taken). The experimental and control groups will be compared in terms of developmental scores by means of the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance will be performed for developmental scores at 12, 24 and 36&#x02005;months. For categorical variables, Fisher's exact test will be used. In exploratory analysis, two factors will be taken into account: gender and birth weight (2500&#x02013;3000 vs &#x0003e;3000&#x02005;g). Psychomotor development as the main outcome of the study will be adjusted for gestational age, parental education and socioeconomic status. A two-tailed p value of the test statistics &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered to be significant.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Practical importance of the project</title><p>Iron supplementation in infants at risk of iron depletion is an established practice and one of the main objectives of this project is to optimise neurodevelopment by means of preventing non-anaemic ID and anaemia. Exclusive breast feeding increases the risk of ID, but controversies exist about whether iron supplementation in this population should be recommended. The results of our project may shed light on these uncertainties and will contribute to optimising child healthcare. If repeated by other research teams, these results may substantially influence early feeding recommendations and practices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw issued the study approval before recruitment started. Any important modifications in the protocol will be communicated to the Committee. The full protocol will be available freely due open access publication. The findings of this RCT will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal (paediatric, nutrition or gastroenterology). Abstracts will be submitted to relevant national and international conferences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AC and HS conceptualised the study.
