Four formulations of a novel recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) administered concurrently with a licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in older adult subjects were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in this randomized, observer-blinded study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 220 healthy males and females&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, were vaccinated concurrently with TIV and RSV F vaccine or placebo. All vaccine formulations produced an acceptable safety profile, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or evidence of systemic toxicity. Vaccine-induced immune responses were rapid, rising as early as 7&#x000a0;days post-vaccination; and were comparable in all formulations in terms of magnitude, with maximal levels attained within 28 (unadjuvanted) or 56 (adjuvanted) days post-vaccination. Peak anti-F protein IgG antibody levels rose 3.6- to 5.6-fold, with an adjuvant effect observed at the 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose, and a dose-effect observed between the unadjuvanted 60 and 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g regimens. The anti-F response persisted through 12&#x000a0;months post-vaccination. Palivizumab-competitive antibodies were below quantifiable levels (&#x0003c;33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) at day 0. The rise of antibodies with specificity for Site II peptide, and the palivizumab-competitive binding activity, denoting antibodies binding at, or in proximity to, antigenic Site II on the F protein, closely paralleled the anti-F response. However, a larger proportion of antibodies in adjuvanted vaccine recipients bound to the Site II peptide at high avidity. Day 0 neutralizing antibodies were high in all subjects and rose 1.3- to 1.7-fold in response to vaccination. Importantly, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with TIV did not impact the serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not impact the immune response to the RSV F vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>RSV F protein nanoparticle vaccine induced increases in measures of functional immunity to RSV in older adults and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Adjuvanted formulations provided additional immunogenicity benefit as compared to increasing antigen dose alone. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01709019.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-F IgG</kwd><kwd>F or fusion protein</kwd><kwd>Microneutralization</kwd><kwd>Nanoparticle vaccine</kwd><kwd>Palivizumab-competitive antibody (PCA)</kwd><kwd>Recombinant</kwd><kwd>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</kwd><kwd>Avidity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide, is increasingly being recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although infants and children are usually infected by 2&#x000a0;years of age, the resultant immunity to RSV is relatively ineffectual and frequent reinfections occur throughout life. RSV infection in older adults generally begins in the upper respiratory tract, but progressively spreads to the lower respiratory tract in 90% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Adults with underlying risk factors may present with RSV-associated disease of increased severity and duration. RSV may also trigger clinical deterioration in frail older adults, the immunocompromised, and those with chronic cardio-pulmonary disease, resulting in RSV-associated hospitalization rates approaching those associated with influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. RSV is a predictable seasonal cause of respiratory illness that burdens the healthcare system, resulting in increased numbers of medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Published estimates indicate that approximately 11,000 to 17,000 older adults die annually of RSV-related illnesses in the United States (US), with about 10-fold more (177,500) admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Vaccination against RSV has the potential to be a highly beneficial and effective approach to limit symptomatic RSV infection in older adults as well as other high-risk adult and pediatric populations.</p><p>A novel RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (herein termed RSV F vaccine) was developed based on a purified, recombinant, near-full-length RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be stable, well-tolerated, immunogenic, and fully protective in animal challenge studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinical evaluation in healthy young adults has shown that both unadjuvanted and aluminum phosphate adjuvanted RSV F vaccine formulations were well-tolerated and induced robust antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including the induction of antibodies with specificity to epitopes on the Site II domain- the target of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab and motavizumab.</p><p>The present study sought to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single immunization with a 60 or 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose of RSV F vaccine, formulated with or without aluminum phosphate, in older adults, age 60&#x000a0;years and older. The dose-ranging component of this study was directed toward selection of a formulation and dose level to examine in future clinical trials that will also explore efficacy of the RSV F vaccine. Given that the annual RSV and influenza epidemics share similar seasonality, this study also sought to address the impact and potential for immunological interference between the RSV F vaccine and TIV when administered concurrently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study conduct</title><p>This study was conducted at four clinical sites in the US (Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Utah) from 12 October 2012 to 05 November 2013, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and informed consent were reviewed and approved by a central institutional review board (Copernicus Group IRB, Research Triangle Park, NC), and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to any trial-related procedures. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01709019).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This Phase 1, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial enrolled healthy male and female subjects&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease or risk factors known to increase the risk of influenza-related complications, including diabetes mellitus, congenital or acquired blood dyscrasias, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and morbid obesity; and who had not received any influenza vaccine within 3&#x000a0;months prior to study start. A total of 220 eligible subjects were enrolled and randomized in one of five treatment groups, with stratification by age (60 to&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;75&#x000a0;years and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;75&#x000a0;years) to distribute the proportion of persons in each age stratum equally across treatment groups. Treatments comprised a single intramuscular (IM) dose of a placebo or RSV F vaccine on day 0 into the left deltoid as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, with concurrent TIV IM immunization in the opposite deltoid. Rescue TIV immunization was provided to active vaccine recipients in Groups A through D on day 28 (to control the risk that the initial dose with RSV F vaccine may have blunted the influenza hemagglutination inhibition [HAI] response), while subjects in Group E received a second dose of placebo. Study follow-up spanned approximately one year from dosing on day 0 for all subjects.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Subject disposition</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12979_2017_90_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The vaccine was formulated at two RSV F protein dose levels in a 25&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer, pH&#x000a0;6.2, with 0.15&#x000a0;M NaCl, 1% histidine, and 0.01% Polysorbate (PS)-80 for unadjuvanted formulations; or in a 12.5&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer, pH&#x000a0;6.2, with 0.15&#x000a0;M NaCl, 0.5% histidine, 0.005% PS-80, and 2.4&#x000a0;mg/mL of aluminum phosphate (AdjuPhos, Brenntag Biosector, Frederikssund, Denmark) for adjuvanted formulations. The licensed TIV, Fluzone&#x000ae; (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA), included the three influenza strains recommended for the 2012&#x02013;2013 influenza season in the Northern hemisphere and was administered according to manufacturer instructions. The placebo consisted of isotonic saline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Immunogenicity measurements</title><p>Subjects provided blood samples on days 0, 7, 28, 56, 119, 182, and 364. Antibody concentrations/titers for the palivizumab-competitive antibody (PCA) and linear antigenic Site II peptide ELISAs; and the RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralization (MN) assays were determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the anti-F IgG ELISA, serial dilutions of subject sera and an anti-F IgG reference standard were added to RSV F antigen-coated microtiter plates and incubated, followed by washing, and then the addition of anti-human IgG peroxidase conjugated antibody and the peroxidase substrate. A four-parameter logistic curve fit was applied to the reference standard and the reported result for each sample was determined from the mean calculated from serial dilutions, interpolated from the reference standard concentrations in arbitrary ELISA Units (EU). Day 0, 28, 56, and 182 sera were used for HAI titer determination for all three antigens contained in the TIV. Influenza hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) testing was conducted at an initial dilution of 1:10 and followed by a series of 2-fold dilutions until a final dilution of 1:1,280 was reached. The appropriate virus antigen and indicator erythrocyte suspension was added to designated wells in two steps, with mixing and incubation at each step. The titration end-point was taken as the highest dilution that demonstrated complete inhibition (100%) of hemagglutination. The serum HAI titer was the geometric mean (GM) of duplicate test results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Surface plasmon resonance</title><p>Binding kinetic assays were performed according to standard kinetics application method using the Biacore&#x02122; T200 (GE Healthcare Life Science, Pittsburg, PA). In brief, biotinylated antigenic peptide (NSELLSLINDMPITNDQKKLMSNNV, synthesized by Peptide 2.0, Chantilly, VA) was immobilized onto a Sensor Chip SA (GE Healthcare Life Science) at 15&#x02013;20 resonance units (RU) on the active flow cell. Human sera were subjected to centrifugal filtration, then diluted 1:50 into HBS-EP buffer (0.01&#x000a0;M HEPES pH&#x000a0;7.4, 0.15&#x000a0;M NaCl, 3&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20). An RSV negative serum sample (diluted 1:50, Valley Biomedical, Lot # E50790S) was used as the sample buffer control. Palivizumab served as the positive control. Samples were injected through the flow cell at 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min for 180&#x000a0;s; dissociation was recorded for 420&#x000a0;s. The chip surface was regenerated by injecting 100&#x000a0;mM HCl at 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min for 30&#x000a0;s between runs. Data were analyzed by kinetic analysis using 1:1 fitting; only k<sub>off</sub> rates were analyzed. A k<sub>off</sub> rate of 1 was assigned to any sample whose sensorgrams showed no detectable binding or had a dissociation rate too rapid to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Safety measurements</title><p>Vaccinees were monitored for approximately 30&#x000a0;min post-injection for observation of immediate local or systemic reactions. Diaries were provided to all subjects to document any AEs (both solicited and unsolicited) and to record body temperature, concomitant medications, and medical visits and procedures, starting on each vaccination day and continuing for 6&#x000a0;days thereafter. A series of local injection site (pain, bruising, redness, and swelling) and systemic (oral temperature, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue) reactions, reasonably likely to occur in vaccine programs, were solicited in the diary. AE severity grading was based on the FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Toxicity Grading Scale (TGS) for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (September 2007).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The safety population was used for all safety analyses and was defined as all study subjects who provided consent, were randomized, and received any study test article. The Per Protocol (PP) population was used for all immunogenicity analyses and was defined as all subjects in the safety population who received the assigned dose of the investigational vaccine according to protocol and as randomized, had RSV serology results at least at days 0 (baseline), 28, and 56, and had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary immunogenicity outcomes as determined by Novavax prior to unblinding. The primary endpoint for the immunogenicity assessment was anti-F IgG EU, while the HAI titers against each of the influenza A and B antigens included in the TIV were the secondary endpoints. Other RSV serologic measures were exploratory endpoints.</p><p>Safety assessments were performed descriptively and included the number and percentage of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs over 7&#x000a0;days post-dosing; all unsolicited AEs over 56&#x000a0;days post-dosing; and medically-attended events (MAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) over one year post-dosing. Summaries of solicited local and solicited systemic AEs were presented by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and by vaccination window (days 0&#x02013;6, days 28&#x02013;34, or combined). Unsolicited AEs were summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), and presented by severity and relationship. Clinical laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were included in the summary of all AEs.</p><p>The primary objective of demonstration of an adjuvant effect was tested by examining the differences in the means of the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed day 28 and (separately) day 56 anti-F IgG EUs in subjects who received 60 or 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g RSV F antigen dose with or without adjuvant (Geometric Mean Ratio<sub>Adj/Unadj</sub>; GMR<sub>Adj/Unadj</sub>). In order to increase the power of this contrast between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted formulations, an analysis of pooled adjuvanted vaccine (Groups A&#x02009;+&#x02009;C) versus pooled unadjuvanted vaccine (Groups B&#x02009;+&#x02009;D) groups was performed, after testing for homogeneity of variance among groups, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline EU as a covariate. The same pooled analysis strategy was used to determine whether the 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose could demonstrate an immunogenicity advantage over the 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose, with or without aluminum phosphate (GMR90&#x003bc;g/60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g). The effect of RSV F/TIV co-administration on resultant HAI titers (for each antigen included in the vaccine) was assessed descriptively, based on HAI Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs), Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs), Seroconversion Rates (SCRs), and Seroprotection Rates (SPRs), with their 95% CIs. Seroconversion was defined as either a baseline HAI titer&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10 and a post-vaccination titer&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40, or a baseline HAI titer&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10 and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4-fold increase in post-vaccination HAI titer relative to baseline. Seroprotection level was defined as a post-vaccination HAI titer&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40. All statistical analyses were two-tailed and assessed at the 5% significance level.</p><p>The GMTs or geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and their associated 95% CIs were measured to describe the response profile for the exploratory immunogenicity endpoints (e.g., antigenic site II and PCA ELISAs, and RSV/A and RSV/B MN).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p>Given a total of 160 subjects receiving an RSV F vaccine in association with TIV, the study had an 80% probability of detecting at least one AE that occurs at a true rate of 1.0%, and an upper 95% confidence bound for incidence rate of 1.9% for any event which was not observed. This was selected as adequate and reasonable for an initial review of the safety profile, rather than for statistical reasons. For immunogenicity analyses, a sample size of 80 subjects in pooled RSV F vaccine groups would provide 88% power to detect a 2-fold difference in GMTs for detecting adjuvant effects. Power estimates were based on a log<sub>10</sub> SD of 0.6 for anti-F IgG EUs, with an alpha of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for significance determination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Subject disposition</title><p>A total of 220 subjects were randomized into the study and all received placebo or RSV F vaccine concurrent with TIV on day 0 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); 90 to 95% of subjects across treatment groups received the rescue TIV (Groups A to D) or second dose of placebo saline (Group E) on day 28.

</p><p>Two important study objectives were to determine whether an adjuvant effect could be demonstrated and whether the 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose could show an immunogenicity advantage over the 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose. Aluminum phosphate adsorption of the RSV F antigen resulted in a statistically significant enhancement of the anti-F IgG response in pooled antigen dose groups (1.4-fold increase on day 56, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) relative to the pooled unadjuvanted vaccine groups at day 56, although not day 28. This difference was primarily attributable to enhancement of the anti-F IgG response at the 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose level, which individually showed a significant effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, the 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g antigen dose produced stronger responses, with or without aluminum phosphate, relative to the 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose, eliciting a near-significant 1.4-fold increase in response to unadjvuanted formulations (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06) and a significant 1.3-fold increase in response to adjvuanted formulations (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022,) on day 56. Pooled analyses showed significant 1.3-1.4 fold RSV-F dose effects on anti-F IgG responses on both days 28 and 56.</p><p>Results of the PCA analysis, which detects antibodies with specificity to an epitope shown to be clinically relevant in the prevention of RSV disease, largely followed the kinetic pattern of anti-F IgG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The post hoc concordance analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] further demonstrates the close relationship of both antibody responses after active vaccination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), but not in placebo recipients. Notably, PCA levels were not measurable above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ, 33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) at day 0 in 88% of subjects, but rose rapidly from baseline in all active vaccine groups, indicating subjects were immunologically primed to this epitope. PCA levels declined one year post-dosing, but remained above the LLOQ in&#x02009;~&#x02009;65% of 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine recipients. The antigenic Site II peptide ELISA, which measures binding of vaccine-induced IgG antibodies to the linear peptide (amino acids 254&#x02013;278) of the F protein that is recognized by palivizumab, followed a very similar pattern of rise and decay when compared to the PCA antibody kinetics for all formulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, performed post hoc to access the binding avidity of vaccine-induced antibodies to the immobilized antigenic Site II peptide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), found that few subjects had high avidity antibodies at day 0.

</p><p>Given that RSV and influenza share a common seasonality and that co-immunization with vaccines developed against both infectious agents is cogent from a logistics and compliance perspective, it was important to seek evidence of interference with resultant influenza HAI responses with this strategy. Because this initial Phase 1 study was not powered to test for non-inferiority, the HAI analysis provided only a descriptive summary of vaccine responses among the RSV F/TIV groups versus the placebo/TIV group. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, there was no apparent negative impact of RSV F co-administration on influenza HAI titers achieved, as post-immunization GMTs for all antigens were comparable to, or higher than, those of the placebo group.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we evaluated a novel RSV F vaccine for the first time in an older adult population. The RSV F vaccine was well-tolerated and highly immunogenic across all doses and formulations tested, eliciting rapid, booster-like post-vaccinal increases in vaccine-specific antibodies, including strikingly concordant increases in anti-F IgG and PCA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In comparison, the high baseline levels of neutralizing antibody only resulted in a modest boost in titers post-vaccination. We have reported this phenomenon previously in young adults; and have shown, given the relatively high background levels of RSV MN antibodies in normal adult sera, that adding even fairly large concentrations of the known neutralizing monoclonal palivizumab (80&#x02013;120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) results in only a modest fold-increase in MN titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, all measured immune responses were durable over a period consistent with potential protection for a temperate winter RSV transmission season, but manifested a substantial decline over one year of follow-up.</p><p>As in younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], PCA levels in pre-immune sera were notably low (generally below the assay LLOQ of 33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) in this population, despite evidence of high baseline MN antibody titers indicating a history of previous RSV/A and RSV/B infections. The presence of day 0 Site II peptide antibodies provide further evidence that this antigen is presented to the immune system during infection. It seems likely that PCAs are present at low levels in elderly persons, but below the LLOQ of the currently available assay. Alternatively however, it is also possible that immunization with the RSV F vaccine fundamentally changes the spectrum and proportion of antibodies in serum with palivizumab-like specificities. In other words, the vaccine may induce a class of binding specificities which do not occur at significant levels after natural RSV infection, despite multiple lifetime exposures. Along these same lines, aluminum phosphate adjuvantation appears to provide both a quantitative and qualitative enhancement in the immune response produced by older adult vaccine recipients, as evidenced by both the increase in Site II-specific antibodies and the fact that a substantial proportion of these antibodies (greater than with unadjuvanted vaccine alone) bind to the Site II epitope of the F protein with high avidity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). It is possible to speculate that induction of high avidity Site II antibodies might contribute importantly to protection, and that immunization with an aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted RSV F vaccine as a two-dose regimen might further improve the affinity maturation of anti-F specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>PCA concentrations and MN titers rise in parallel after RSV F immunization and are associated with protection against RSV challenge in animals models (e.g., cotton rats) that lack background levels of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the absence of data from prospective, well-designed, controlled efficacy trials, the correlation of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and other frequently measured immune measures to RSV with clinical protection remains to be defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although sero-epidemiology studies in both children and adults have shown an inverse relationship between RSV-specific serum neutralizing antibody levels and the risk of RSV-associated hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], these findings do not fully explain the ongoing risk of recurrent RSV infection as MN levels are often high in susceptible populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a surveillance study conducted during a single RSV season, Falsey et al. determined there was an inverse relationship between RSV-neutralizing antibody titer derived from past infections and disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], although there was considerable overlap between MN titers of infected and uninfected individuals. In older adult humans, anti-RSV immune responses following decades of recurrent natural RSV exposure include a complex array of anti-F, anti-G, and other antibody specificities which may or may not be protective despite activity in an in vitro neutralization assay. This quantitatively substantial milieu of baseline circulating RSV neutralizing antibodies may not, at a given level of neutralization antibody titer, consistently and qualitatively indicate clinical protection. Data from substantial controlled trials will be required to understand the contribution of vaccine-induced immune responses.</p><p>Finally, given the winter seasonal nature of RSV transmission in temperate regions and the observed decline of RSV F vaccine-specific antibody responses over the course of a year of follow-up, the RSV F vaccine, if shown to be safe and efficacious, would likely be administered prior to the onset of winter along with a seasonal influenza vaccine. In preliminary support of potential future strategies to co-administer RSV F and seasonal influenza vaccines, we demonstrated the absence of an adverse impact of RSV F and seasonal influenza vaccine co-administration on HAI responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Preliminary clinical development of this novel RSV F vaccine in older adults indicates an acceptable safety profile and the induction of neutralizing anti-RSV immune responses that include responses specific for antigenic Site II, which is known to be the target of protective antibodies in children. The substantial burden of severe RSV disease in older adults and the predictable nature of the annual RSV epidemic warrant further development of this promising vaccine to address an urgent unmet public health gap.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>ELISA units</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>F</term><def><p>Fusion protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GM</term><def><p>Geometric mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMC</term><def><p>Geometric mean concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMEU</term><def><p>Geometric mean ELISA unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMR</term><def><p>Geometric mean ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMT</term><def><p>Geometric mean titer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAI</term><def><p>Hemagglutination inhibiting antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IM</term><def><p>Intramuscular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLOQ</term><def><p>Lower limit of quantification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAE</term><def><p>Medically-attended events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p>Palivizumab-competitive antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>Per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p>Preferred term</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSV</term><def><p>Respiratory syncytial virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCR</term><def><p>Seroconversion rates</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNMC</term><def><p>Significant new medical conditions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>System organ class</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPR</term><def><p>Seroprotection rates</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIV</term><def><p>Trivalent influenza vaccine</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the volunteers who participated in the study; the clinicians, nurses, and research coordinators at the study sites; laboratory technicians who performed the testing; and the project staff of the sponsor for support and contributions throughout the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This trial was funded and sponsored by Novavax, Inc., 20 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, US.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Datasets will not be made available publicly due to their proprietary nature.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LF, DNT, EK, HL, GS, SPH, GG, and PP made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data.
