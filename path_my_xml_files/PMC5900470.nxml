Incidence of IBS has been increasing over last two decades.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>IBS pathogenesis is poorly recognized and many theories have been proposed to explain its pathogenesis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Low-grade mucosal inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, immune activation, visceral hypersensitivity, and disturbed gastrointestinal motility are possible mechanisms of pathogenesis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dysregulation of brain-gut axis function is becoming an acceptable theory to explain IBS through different mechanisms including neurotransmitters found in the brain and gut e.g., cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and serotonin.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moreover, food allergy or vitamin deficiency may play a role.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Higher incidence of IBS was recorded in patients with anxiety, major depression, personality disorders, and hysteria; moreover, IBS itself can cause anxiety and depression.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have suggested a relationship between vitamin D and IBS. Vitamin D has a potential role as immune modulator, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial agent that can explain its role in IBS.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, vitamin D receptors (VDR) are expressed in the gut affecting gut function, motility, and IBS symptoms.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Moreover, depression, which initiates or aggravates IBS symptoms, is more common in vitamin D deficiency.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Low vitamin D level was recorded in IBS patients in many studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This deficiency can be attributed to many factors as altered digestive pattern or intolerance to dairy and fatty food. Supplementation of vitamin D in adult IBS patients significantly improves their symptoms and quality of life.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, similar studies are lacking in pediatric patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in adolescents with IBS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial that was carried out from April 2015 to April 2017 on 112 adolescent IBS patients with vitamin D deficiency aged 14&#x02013;18 years who were selected from the outpatient clinics of Pediatrics Departments, Tanta University Hospital. The study was approved by the local ethical committee of Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Written informed consent was signed by parents of all participants involved in the study. The study was registered at www.pactr.org (PACTR201706002337124).</p><p>Inclusion criteria: IBS adolescents aged 14&#x02013;18 years diagnosed with ROME III criteria for diagnosis of childhood irritable bowel syndrome [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and with vitamin D serum level less than 20 ng/ml.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: adolescents with recent use of antibiotics (4 weeks), recent change in IBS therapy, gastrointestinal infection, history of gut surgery or radiation, celiac disease, chronic drug therapy that interfere with vitamin D metabolism such as antiepileptics and glucocorticoids, overweight, or underweight adolescents according to the centile curve,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] chronic disease such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, and patients taking vitamin D supplementation. Our participants were randomly divided into two groups:</p><p>Group 1: included 56 IBS adolescents who received oral vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) in the form of two drops daily for 6 months where one drop contains 1000 IU of vitamin D3.</p><p>Group II: included 56 IBS adolescent patients who received placebo in the form of two drops daily of glucose 5% placed in the same container as vitamin D3.</p><p>Participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two study groups according to computer-generated random numbers in a 1:1 ratio using a random block size of 6. The random number list was generated by QuickCalc GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA. The randomization was performed by an independent statistician. Allocation concealment was done by sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. After the written consent was signed, the sealed opaque envelope was opened and the patient was enrolled into the respective group. All treating staff and outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment group.</p><p>All participants were subjected to the following:</p><p>

IBS-SSS consists of 5 items (severity and frequency of abdominal pain, bloating, satisfaction with bowel habits, and quality of life) collected by direct interview using visual analog scale (VAS). Each item was scored on a scale from 0&#x02013;100. Score below 75 means that the patient is in remission. The mild, moderate, and severe boundary scores are 75&#x02013;175,175&#x02013;300, and above 300, respectively.

Serum samples were left to clot 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature and were centrifuged at 1000&#x000d7; g for 10 minutes. A part of the serum samples was used for routine laboratory investigations and the other part was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C till the time of 25 (OH)D assay. 25 (OH)D was measured using vitamin D total assay kit (25-hydroxyvitamin D, Catalog No: 05894913190). Vitamin D assay was performed with cobase 602 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, USA). Subjects with serum levels of vitamin D (less than20 ng/ml) were considered deficient in vitamin D according to endocrine society clinical practice guideline [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and included in the study.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All participants were instructed to record a diary (recording adherence to therapy, bowel habits, any side effects of the drug, abdominal pain, and other abdominal symptoms). Moreover, we followed the participants by phone weekly for compliance and any complications and to remind them of visit dates, besides face to face meeting every 3 months to provide study-materials and to get feedback. Furthermore, all patients were asked to return the used packages of drugs during the follow-up visit to ensure compliance to treatment.</p><p>All symptoms, serum calcium, serum vitamin D levels, and the three IBS scores were evaluated before and 6 months after treatment and any side effects of the drug were recorded during face-to-face meetings. If any adverse effects were reported during the study, both serum vitamin D level, and serum calcium levels were checked. If vitamin D exceeded 100 ng/ml and serum calcium exceeded 11 mg/dl, the study was stopped for that patient and further evaluation of kidney function was done and treatment was given, as required.</p><p>The primary outcome was to assess IBS symptoms and severity score after treatment with vitamin D for 6 months. Secondary outcome was to assess serum vitamin D levels and QoL in IBS patients before and after vitamin D supplementation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size of 45 IBS patients in each group was required to achieve power of 80% with alpha = 0.05 to detect a difference of 60 in the mean of IBS-SSS (the primary outcome) based on a previous study.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We recruited more than the estimated sample size as we assumed that not all our patients would be compliant with the treatment and hence we increased the sample size in consideration of withdrawal of any patient, which would undermine our results. Moreover, all our patients in group 1 had vitamin D deficiency and were instructed to take therapeutic vitamin D treatment with or without involvement in our study.

Pathogenesis of IBS is still not well understood. Most studies regarding pathogenesis and management of IBS were done in adult patients, and to our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on adolescent IBS patients.</p><p>In our study, IBS adolescent patients who received vitamin D had a significantly higher serum vitamin D compared to placebo group. In addition, there was significant improvement in the clinical status in adolescents with IBS who received vitamin D evaluated by the three scores (IBS-SSS, IBS-QoL, and total score) compared to placebo group. Such improvement has been recorded before but only in adults.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Even though the exact mechanism of how vitamin D supplementation improves symptoms and scores in IBS patients is still unknown, many explanations have been suggested. One explanation focuses on anxiety and depression as major psychological elements in the onset and progress of IBS symptoms that also affects their QoL; numerous studies also found a link between vitamin D deficiency and depression, with supplementation of vitamin D in these patients leading to improvement in their anxiety and depression.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Thus, vitamin D supplementation in IBS patients can act through ameliorating their anxiety, stress, and depression, and consequently, improving symptoms and quality of life.</p><p>It is reported that there is a state of chronic low mucosal inflammation in IBS caused by activated mast cells, T lymphocytes, and proinflammatory cytokines that altered colonic distension causing most IBS symptoms. Moreover, inflammation causes an increase in the sensitivity of nervous system and consequently increases gut hypersensitivity and perception of abdominal pain. Nevertheless, vitamin D has a potential anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulator effect that helps the state of low-grade mucosal inflammation and altered immunity presented in IBS patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed through the nervous system and in the gut where its activation is linked to neurotransmitter levels, serotonin synthesis, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and bowel inflammation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Moreover, binding of 25 (OH)D-VDR complex results in the expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase which converts 25 (OH)D to 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This 25 (OH)D metabolite has been shown to upregulate neutrophins which in turn promote survival and differentiation of nerve cells.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Hence, vitamin D may directly affect neurological development, gut function, and consequently improveIBS symptoms and QoL, as shown in the results of our study.</p><p>In a study on IBS adult patients, vitamin D supplementation was provided for 6 months at a dose of 50,000 IU weekly that effectively raised serum 25 (OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels more than 2.5 times than the baseline and significantly reduced the mean IBS-SSS score in vitamin D treatment group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This was similar to our results, however, the mean rise of serum levels of vitamin D in their study was more than ours that could be due to higher dose of vitamin D used in their study. Contrary to our results, Tazzyman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported no significant improvement in IBS symptoms after 12 weeks of vitamin D supplementation in adults with IBS. That study was a pilot study (included only 50 patients in three arms) and was therefore underpowered to provide significant findings. Moreover, participants were recruited following a poster campaign at a university and this would only assess a selected group of people. In addition, short duration of supplementation (3 months) could be another cause of negative results besides age variation in their study unlike our study.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>This is a one-centre study; however, our hospital is a tertiary centre that received referral from a wide range of area. Variation in the time of the year could affect vitamin D status; however, our country is sunny most of the year. The findings of our study are limited to our population and further studies are needed in different pediatric age groups. We used normal vitamin D dose to treat deficiency in our study, and further studies comparing the effects of different doses of vitamin D on children with IBS are needed to develop a protocol for supplementation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Vitamin D supplementation can be effective in treating adolescents with IBS. Larger studies in other ethnicities are needed to examine the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation in treating IBS and to determine the optimal protocol of vitamin D supplementation.</p><sec
