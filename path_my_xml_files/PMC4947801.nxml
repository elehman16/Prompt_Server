<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> with minor modifications to the device in each study. There were only minor differences between the studies. For example, patients with atrial fibrillation were excluded from AMADEUS but included in TITAN and TITAN II. Patients were included if they had symptomatic congestive heart failure at least NYHA class 2 who were stabilised on heart failure medications for at least 1&#x02005;month. In order to qualify, patients had to have 2+ or greater (at least moderate) MR, a 6&#x02005;min walk test (6MWT) of 150&#x02013;450&#x02005;m, as well as high-risk features, including a dilated left ventricle (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD)&#x0003e;55&#x02005;mm), and depressed left ventricular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%. Patients were excluded if the aetiology of heart failure was not due to ischaemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, or if the MR was due to a degenerative aetiology. Additional exclusions included the presence of a cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) lead in the coronary sinus, severe renal insufficiency (creatinine&#x0003e;2.2&#x02005;mg/dL), need for revascularisation or percutaneous coronary intervention within the prior 30&#x02005;days, a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the prior 3&#x02005;months, or use of mechanical or inotropic support within the prior 30&#x02005;days.</p><p>Patients underwent baseline screening, including echocardiography, a 6MWT and assessment of their baseline clinical status by NYHA classification, as well as evaluation for medication use, and baseline chemistries. Major adverse events were reviewed by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board.</p><p>The Carillon Mitral Contour System procedure has been previously described.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The procedure can be performed under general anaesthesia or conscious sedation, depending on the preference of the operator, and on whether transoesophageal or transthoracic echo was used during the procedure. A 9 French sheath is placed in the right internal jugular vein and standard arterial access for coronary arteriography is obtained. From the internal jugular vein, the coronary sinus is accessed with a wire and a 7 French multipurpose or Amplatz diagnostic or guiding catheter inside of a proprietary 9 French curved delivery catheter. A marker catheter is placed inside the delivery catheter after it is placed in the great cardiac vein, to be used as a measuring device. Measurements are made of the venous dimensions, including vein diameters at the sites of anticipated anchor placements, as well as usable vein length.</p><p>The device is composed of two self-expanding nitinol anchors, with a curvilinear segment connecting them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="OPENHRT2016000411F1">figure 1</xref>), and is incorporated into a dedicated delivery system. The distal anchor is unsheathed in the great cardiac vein and then locked. Tension is applied to the system by pulling back on the delivery system at the level of the internal jugular vein. Coronary angiography is performed to evaluate for coronary artery compression. If the coronary artery is adequately patent, the proximal anchor is then unsheathed and locked. Echocardiography (either transoesophageal or transthoracic) is performed to evaluate improvement in MR. If everything appears acceptable, the device is released, the delivery system retrieved and the procedure concluded.</p><p>If there is coronary artery compromise, slipping of the distal anchor on applying tension or placement at the incorrect location, the tension can be released and the device recaptured and removed, as necessary, prior to releasing the device. An additional attempt with a new device may be tried, perhaps at a more proximal location if coronary compromise was an issue.</p><p>Patients receiving implants were followed at 1, 6 and 12&#x02005;months intervals for clinical and echocardiographic parameters. Clinical parameters included assessment of NYHA classification, 6MWTs, changes in medications and hospitalisations. Echocardiographic parameters included quantitative assessments of MR by an independent core echo laboratory (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA), as well as measurements of left ventricular, mitral annular and left atrial dimensions, and ejection fraction. Cinefluoroscopy was performed of implanted devices at discharge, 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months after implantation to evaluate device integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables are reported as mean and SDs. Categorical variables are presented as n/N (%).</p><p>Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to estimate means of each measure at each visit to account for repeated measures per participant; a compound symmetry working correlation structure was used. p Values for the assessment of a significant impact of time (visit) are based on F tests from the ANOVA models. Similar analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to estimate the change from baseline at each visit. The dependent variable was change from baseline, while visit and baseline value of the measure were included as covariates. A compound symmetry working correlation structure was used to model the covariance between repeated measures per participant. p Values for the assessment of change from baseline are based on t-tests from the ANCOVA models.

Three of these patients had an ischaemic aetiology and the other three had non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. These non-implanted patients were followed for 30&#x02005;days, for safety events only.</p><p>Thus, a total of 30 patients successfully received permanent Carillon implants (83%). Twenty-two patients were successfully implanted with a single attempt (73%). Seven required two attempts and one required three attempts.</p><p>One patient had coronary angiography performed after placement of both anchors, finding a partial compromise of a small calibre, diseased atrioventricular branch of the circumflex coronary artery, which caused chest pain. The proximal anchor was recaptured, resolving the coronary compression and chest pain, but it was not possible to recapture the distal anchor. This was due to the distal anchor placement in a very small distal aspect of the great cardiac vein, beyond a sharp angle. Eventually, the recaptured proximal anchor, now distorted, was redeployed in the middle of the great cardiac vein, without tension in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="OPENHRT2016000411F3">figure 3</xref>).

The primary end point of the 30-day rate of major adverse events was similarly low in this study, as it was in AMADEUS and TITAN.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This excellent safety profile of the Carillon device and procedure is notable, especially given the high-risk population of symptomatic patients with large left ventricles and low ejection fractions treated in these three studies. As in TITAN, there was only a single major adverse event, a death after hospital discharge, not clearly related to the Carillon procedure. Also, similar to TITAN, there were no device-related clinical complications, and specifically there were no device-related myocardial infarctions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The three studies (AMADEUS, TITAN and TITAN II) varied in the use of slightly modified devices in each trial. A significant finding in TITAN II is the lack of fatigue-related fractures of the anchor wireforms, which were seen in 25% of devices in the TITAN study. Although there was one fracture of a proximal anchor seen in TITAN II, this is attributable to the incorrect placement of a recaptured/redeployed (and therefore damaged), proximal anchor in a dynamic portion of the great cardiac vein. This placement was necessitated by the inability to recapture the distal anchor, an unusual occurrence related to distal anchor placement in a small calibre, tortuous vein segment. This scenario can be avoided by attention to this anatomical characteristic when placing a distal anchor.</p><p>There were similar clinical and echocardiographic benefits seen in TITAN II as there were in TITAN. This includes improvement in quantitative parameters assessing MR, and reduction in mitral annular dimensions, as well as improvement in NYHA class and 6MWTs. There was also a trend towards a reduction in ventricular size (data not shown), similar to that seen in TITAN. Thus, it appears that the modification of the device used in this study had similar functionality to the device used in TITAN.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of the Carillon device shown in this and the prior studies compares favourably to other percutaneous therapies used to treat FMR, with shorter procedure times and comparable (if not superior) periprocedural major adverse event rates and similar clinical benefits.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Limitations</title><p>The number of patients with adequate quality follow-up imaging for quantitative measurements was low, partially as a result of loss of storage data of echo images involving six patients at one of the most actively enrolling sites. However, the echo findings were consistent with the findings in AMADEUS and TITAN. So even though the ability to draw conclusions from the echo measurements in this study is limited, the consistency between the trials is meaningful. Clinical benefits, such as improvement in the 6MWT and assessment of NYHA class, can be prone to biased assessments. Heart failure hospitalisations were based on site-reporting and were not systematically evaluated. There was no comparable population, with non-implanted patients only followed for safety analysis at 1&#x02005;month, unlike the TITAN study where non-implanted patients were followed identically to implanted patients over 12&#x02005;months. Of note, the implant rate was higher in TITAN II than in TITAN, 83% vs 68%. Overall, the findings are consistent with those in the two prior studies with this therapy, and the improvements in the 6MWT continue to be significantly greater than what was historically seen for cardiac resynchronisation therapy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The modified Carillon Mitral Contour System used in TITAN II was associated with a low rate of procedure-related complications, and improvements in clinical and echocardiographic measures of MR severity.
