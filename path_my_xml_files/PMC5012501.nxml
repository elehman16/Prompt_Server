The Strategy Europe 2020 presents social challenges particularly in health and demographic change and wellbeing. A key response to this rapid change in the age structure consists in promoting the creation of an active aging culture throughout life, thus ensuring that the people close to sixty, or more, have opportunities for employment and active participation in social life and family<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> conducted, it was found that there is no strong evidence of an increased training of family caregivers and dependents when subjected to interventions through the use of educational technologies than those who are subjected to another type of intervention. However, there are clear improvements in various outcome measures that indicate a benefit when implementing education programs over the internet.</p><p>This project aims to bridge the gap between the advances of technological research and the practical needs of family caregivers, through the development of communication solutions and easy access to information via internet. The interactive educational technology "Caring for Dependent People" is a platform that aims to assist family caregivers in the self-care environment of a dependent person with greater security and autonomy. This technology covers the following topics: self-care, feeding via a nasogastric tube, positioning and transferring. The tool contains six different menus: intro, themes, photo gallery, contacts, useful links and tool map. The multimedia (image, video, audio and text) are present in the six menus. The family caregiver opens the tool from an internet browser (explorer or chrome).</p></sec><sec><title>Objective </title><p>To evaluate the contributions of the educational interactive technology: "Caring for Dependent People" in the development of knowledge in the family caregivers at home, and evaluate their satisfaction with its use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Quasi-experimental, not randomized study, of the before and after type. The sample of convenience consisted of 65 family caregivers of patients admitted with functional dependence assessed by the Barthel index, identified over a period of five months in two Medicine Services of a hospital in the Porto region, Portugal. Inclusion criteria were to accept to participate in the study, being aged 18 years or more, to have access to the internet at home with basic skills to handle information technology or support of a family member or significant other meeting these conditions and having under their responsibility one dependent person with recent hospitalization.</p><p>The experimental group (EG) began with 38 family caregivers. However, there were five losses by the death of the dependent person and a loss by disease of the family caregiver. In the control group (CG), 36 family caregivers were included but for the death of two dependent people and the institutionalization of another, it remained with 33 family caregivers. </p><p>To prevent the participants of the CG to had contact with those of the EG, it was decided to carry out the selection of participants in both groups in different services and during the first 70 days of the start of data collection. After this period the groups were reversed in the middle of the selection period and the service where the EG was identified was then identified as the CG and vice versa. Only the EG had access to a link http://online.esenf.pt/cuidarpessoadependente/ that allowed access to the interactive educational technology at home. Both groups underwent two stages of evaluation with a set of tools that allowed assessing the knowledge. The family members of EG completed a satisfaction questionnaire on the use of educational technology.</p><p>The instruments used for data collection were:</p><p>- Sociodemographic questionnaire for family caregivers and dependent person built specifically for this study with relevant variables for the characterization of the participants: age, gender, occupation, marital status, years of education, number of children, cohabitation and clinical variables reason for hospitalization, reason of dependence and previous hospitalizations.</p><p>- The Barthel Index (BI), adapted Portuguese version<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>- The <italic>questionnaire for evaluation of the knowledge</italic> of family caregivers was built specifically for this study. It included ten questions to assess each segment (nasogastric tube, positioning and transfer). The questions were prepared taking into account the main care points in each of these procedures. The internal consistency of the instrument was assessed by <italic>Cronbach's alpha</italic>. The assessment questionnaire of knowledge on how to "transfer patients" presented an alpha value of 0.79 in the first and 0.83 in the second evaluation. The questionnaire assessing knowledge about the care in "positioning the patient" showed an alpha coefficient of 0.72 and 0.65 in the first and second evaluation respectively. These figures are indicative of reasonable to good internal consistency<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>- The <italic>questionnaire of satisfaction of family caregivers</italic> was adapted from the instrument "Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction" (QUIS) reduced version 7.0<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. The instrument consists of two parts: the family caregiver characterization data that included socio-demographic and technological variables, such as age, sex, education level, marital status, skill level in computer use, frequency of use of new technologies and time spent with educational technology; the second part consisting in the evaluation of satisfaction with the use of educational technology and containing 7 groups with 21 specific questions. Thus, the family caregiver, for each question from each group and through a measurement scale of 9 points (positive adjectives in the right and negative side on the left), assessed the <italic>overall reaction to educational technology</italic>, the <italic>screen</italic>, the <italic>terminology and the information system</italic>, the <italic>learning</italic>, the <italic>capability of the educational technology</italic>, the <italic>navigation guide and online help</italic> and finally the <italic>multimedia group</italic>.</p><p>Data collection carried out by the researcher and associates (nurses) of the Medicine services, took place from March to July 2014. The first evaluation of baseline was while patients were still hospitalized and the second evaluation was performed during a home visit, which had been agreed upon and happened one month after the clinical discharge. The evaluation of the contribution of interactive educational technology was performed using the evaluation intra- and inter-subject. Both groups had the same procedure except that the interactive educational technology was not presented to the control group, nor provided a guide for navigation. A telephone contact between the 1st and 2nd contact was done for the EG, in order to identify whether the participants had any problems or doubts with interactive educational technology. After the second evaluation, the CG was granted access to the tool. </p><p>For the data analysis the information was processed through the statistical program SPSS version 22.0 IBM<sup>(r)</sup> using parametric statistics<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. The t-Student test was used to compare the averages between independent samples comparing EG with the CG in relation to the evaluation questionnaires knowledge. The intra-subject comparison was performed using the Student t test for paired samples to compare variations within the groups in the two evaluated periods. To assess the accuracy and reliability of each of the knowledge questionnaires, it was used the Cronbach's alpha. This procedure is the most used and reported in the literature, and its value is calculated based on the average of the interrelations among all test items<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

The analysis of socio-demographic data was performed using descriptive statistics using measures of central tendency and dispersion. When comparing the groups it was considered a significance level of p &#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research Coordination Office (DEFI) and by the Hospital of Porto Central Ethics Committee (CHP) under Ref 157/11 (107-DEFI / 137-CES). In this study, the rules of conduct referred to in the Helsinki Declaration and the national legislation were respected, and the confidentiality of the data collected was guaranteed. Caregivers who met the inclusion criteria were selected and invited to participate. All family caregivers who agreed to integrate the study signed a Free and Informed Consent form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study participants were 65 family caregivers, 33 belonging to the CG and 32 to the EG, mostly females: 27 (EG) and 29 (CG). The average age at the EG was 57,69 years and 56,64 years in the CG, with an average of 8,34 years of schooling in the EG and 7,85 years in the CG. Regarding the occupation of the 65 family caregivers, 25 (38,5%) were in retirement or preretirement situation, 23 (35,4%) were active, 16 (24,6%) unemployed and 1 (1,5%) handicapped. Of the total family caregivers, the majority 36 (55,4%) were daughters and 12 (18,5%) spouses. On the whole, 44 (67,7%) were married, 48 (73,8%) lived with the dependent person and were providing assistance for an average of 5,4 years (EG) years and 3,8 years (CG). Moreover, the majority 61 (93,8%) tended for the dependent person and only four (6,2%) were first-time caregivers. In the total sample, 40 (61,5%) of family caregivers said there was no family support to take care of the dependent person and 25 (38,5%) reported that the siblings or children provided this support. </p><p>Regarding the dependent person, the main reasons for hospitalization in the Medicine service were respiratory, cardiac and urinary problems. The largest share, 43 were female (66,2%), 22 (33,8%) were male, with an average age of 80,97 years (EG) and 78,85 (CG). Regarding the degree of dependence, the majority 47 (72,3%) were totally dependent; 14 (21,5%) had severe dependence and only 4 (6,2%) with moderate dependence; with a dependence time of less of one year (24,6%), between one and four years (43,1%) and from four to 27 years (32,3%) with an average of 4,4 years of being dependent. The main causes of dependence were mental and behavioral disorders 31% (Alzheimer's, dementia), nervous system diseases 7,5% (Parkinson) and diseases of the circulatory system, in particular stroke (16,9%), among others. There were no statistical differences in the distribution of age, gender, educational level of family caregivers, time being caregiver and age of the dependent person, between EG and CG. </p><p>In both groups, participants with higher educational level have shown a higher level of knowledge in the care of feeding through a nasogastric tube, in positioning and transferring patients. In relation to nominal variables sex, marital status, relationship to the dependent person, the application of Chi-Square also did not show significant differences between EG (32) and CG (33).

This technology successfully met the technical quality and learning needs of caregivers and was considered easy and stimulating.</p><p>The development of knowledge was considered the indicator to assess the impact of interactive educational technology, having been found statistically significant differences in the outcome variables, both in inter-subject evaluation, and in intra-subject evaluation. The difference in results found in the EG allows us to state that the use of educational technology "Caring for Dependents People" contributed to the development of knowledge in family caregivers in the different domains of self-care. It is suggested the expansion of the research subjects, just as the study sites for its implementation.</p><p> These results emphasize the need to include strategies to integrate interactive educational technologies in the training of family caregivers to care for dependents in organizational contexts. It is a challenge to implement and enhance health policies that include training and the application of educational technology and achieve its mastery in the educational processes of family caregivers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extrated from Doctoral Dissertation "Tecnologias educacionais interativas: Contributo para o desenvolvimento de conhecimento dos familiares cuidadores", presented to Instituto de Ci&#x000ea;ncias Biom&#x000e9;dicas Abel Salazar, Universidade do Porto, Porto, PT, Portugal.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Jornal Oficial da Uni&#x000e3;o Europeia</collab></person-group><source>Decis&#x000e3;o N&#x000ba; 940/2011/UE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho de 14 de Setembro de 2011 sobre o Ano Europeu do Envelhecimento Activo e da Solidariedade entre as Gera&#x000e7;&#x000f5;es (2012)</source><year>2011</year><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.igfse.pt/upload/docs/2011/Decis%C3%A3o%20n%C2%BA%20940-2011.pdf">http://www.igfse.pt/upload/docs/2011/Decis%C3%A3o%20n%C2%BA%20940-2011.pdf</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European Commission</collab></person-group><source>A pocket guide on the innovation union</source><year>2014</year><publisher-loc>Luxemburgo</publisher-loc><publisher-name>European Commission</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European Commission</collab></person-group><source>European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing</source><year>2014</year><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm?section=active-healthy-ageing&#x00026;pg=about">http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm?section=active-healthy-ageing&#x00026;pg=about</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European Commission</collab></person-group><source>Relat&#x000f3;rio sobre a proposta de decis&#x000e3;o (COM (2013) 0500 - C7-0219/2013 - 2013/0233 (COD)) do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho relativa &#x000e0; participa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o da Uni&#x000e3;o no programa de investiga&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e desenvolvimento "Envelhecimento ativo, vida aut&#x000f3;noma e assistida" executado conjuntamente por v&#x000e1;rios Estados-Membros</source><year>2013</year><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2014-0076+0+DOC+XML+V0//PT">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2014-0076+0+DOC+XML+V0//PT</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European Commission</collab></person-group><source>European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.
