These agents are recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension and the reduction of cardiovascular risk. Early studies pointed to the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ARBs in high-risk patients. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) established the clinical equivalence of the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of telmisartan and ramipril, but did not find an added benefit of the combination over ramipril alone. Similar findings were observed in the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE INtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trial conducted in ACEI-intolerant patients. In ONTARGET, telmisartan had a better tolerability profile with similar renoprotective properties compared with ramipril, suggesting a potential clinical benefit over ramipril. The recently completed Olmesartan Reducing Incidence of Endstage Renal Disease in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (ORIENT) and Olmesartan and Calcium Antagonists Randomized (OSCAR) studies will further define the role of ARBs in cardioprotection and renoprotection for high-risk patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>angiotensin receptor blockers</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>outcomes</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade is a cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy in high-risk patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-vhrm-7-315">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-7-315">2</xref> Blockade of the RAAS reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke in addition to providing renal protection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-7-315">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-vhrm-7-315">3</xref> Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are among the agents recommended as first-line therapy for treatment of hypertension and reduction of cardiovascular risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-vhrm-7-315">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-7-315">2</xref></p><p>Prior to the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), the clinical relevance of the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ARBs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or their combination was largely unknown.

This study was pivotal in establishing the role of angiotensin II blockade in cardiovascular protection. Losartan was better than atenolol in reducing the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction by 14.6% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009), and losartan was associated with a 25% lower incidence of new-onset diabetes, a significant cardiovascular risk factor. The cardiovascular protective effects were even more impressive in a subanalysis of 1195 diabetic patients enrolled in the LIFE study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-7-315">15</xref> This analysis established the efficacy of an ARB over that of a &#x003b2;-blocker in diabetic patients for cardiovascular protection, with a relative risk of 0.76 for the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, in favor of losartan (<italic>P</italic> = 0.031).</p><p>This cardiovascular protective effect was shown in even higher risk patients in the Morbidity and Mortality After Stroke, Eprosartan Compared With Nitrendipine for Secondary Prevention (MOSES) study. The MOSES study was the first to demonstrate superiority of an ARB over a calcium antagonist for secondary stroke prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-vhrm-7-315">16</xref> The ARB, eprosartan, was shown to be superior to nitrendipine for the secondary prevention of morbidity and mortality after stroke in 1352 evaluable high-risk hypertensive patients with a history of a cerebral event within the previous 24 months, while having comparable reductions in blood pressure. The composite endpoint of mortality and all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including recurrent events, was lower in patients treated with eprosartan versus nitrendipine (13.3 versus 16.7/100 patient-years; <italic>P</italic> = 0.014).</p><p>It has become clear in the last two decades that effective blockade of the RAAS confers important benefits in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Earlier, ACE inhibitors were shown to confer target organ protection in patients with hypertension and diabetes; more recently, ARBs in large clinical trials have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological complications.</p><p>ONTARGET resolved the question regarding the effectiveness of an ARB compared with an ACEI in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus without heart failure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-7-315">17</xref> although there continues to be confusion over the clinical implications of these findings. In ONTARGET, telmisartan was shown to be equivalent to ramipril in the incidence of primary outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-7-315">Figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-7-315">17</xref> To underscore their similarities, the primary outcome occurred in 16.5%, 16.7%, and 16.3% of patients receiving ramipril alone, telmisartan alone, or their combination, respectively. The secondary outcome in ONTARGET, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, occurred in 14.1%, 13.9%, and 14.1% of patients receiving ramipril alone, telmisartan alone, or their combination, respectively. The relative risk ratio was 1.01 for the primary outcome and 0.99 for the secondary outcome with telmisartan versus ramipril, suggesting similarities in the degree of cardioprotection offered by these agents individually and in combination over ramipril alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-7-315">17</xref></p><p>Furthermore, data from ONTARGET do not support the use of the combination of an ARB plus an ACEI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-7-315">17</xref> The relative risk ratios of combination therapy compared with ramipril were 1.00 for the primary outcome and 0.99 for the secondary outcome. Blood pressure reductions were greatest in the combination therapy group, with an average reduction at six weeks of 9.8/6.3 mmHg compared with 6.4/4.3 mmHg for ramipril alone and 7.4/5.0 mmHg for telmisartan alone. However, no correlation of risk reduction was demonstrated in ONTARGET despite lower blood pressure in the combination group. Combination therapy was also associated with a higher incidence of adverse events.</p><p>Similar to ONTARGET, the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE INtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trial was conducted with a population of patients intolerant to ACEIs with established coronary artery, peripheral vascular, or cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes with end-organ damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-7-315">18</xref> TRANSCEND showed a statistically significant benefit of telmisartan versus placebo for the secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87; <italic>P</italic> = 0.048).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-7-315">18</xref> Compared with placebo, telmisartan was also associated with fewer cases of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations.</p><p>Another recently completed study, the Olmesartan and Calcium Antagonists Randomized (OSCAR) study, compared olmesartan (an ARB) alone with the combination of olmesartan and a calcium channel blocker in elderly high-risk Japanese patients with hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-vhrm-7-315">19</xref> Primary endpoints include the composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, and death from any cause. Data from this study will provide further insight into the role of ARBs and combination therapy.</p><p>It remains to be shown whether there are some patient subgroups, such as those with diabetes and proteinuria, who may benefit from dual inhibition of RAAS. For now, in uncomplicated hypertension, dual blockade of RAAS is not indicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-term ARB tolerability and renoprotection</title><p>Early clinical trials suggested the efficacy of ARBs in the prevention of progression of nephropathy in diabetic patients.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included a composite of the time to first occurrence of a cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event, change in proteinuria, and change in renal function calculated by the slope of the reciprocal of serum creatinine against time.

A growing body of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness and long-term cardiorenal protective properties of ARBs indicate that ARBs may be used successfully and with potentially greater clinical benefit compared with ACEIs.

However, further investigation is needed to clarify these findings. ONTARGET data demonstrate that combination therapy with an ARB and an ACEI does not provide an additive benefit and, therefore, should not be used routinely in clinical practice, particularly in high-risk and elderly patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This work was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals.
