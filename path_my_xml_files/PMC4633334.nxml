Participants were asked to limit their fat intake to 25% of their total calories and to self-monitor their calorie and fat intake. The home-based physical activity goal advanced from 150 minutes/week at 12 weeks to 180 minutes/week at 6 months, then 210 minutes/week at 12 months.

Participants in the SBT+SE group met with their interventionist prior to the first group session to collaboratively develop their calorie and activity goals with a target date for goal achievement. Lack of progress towards goals triggered an identification of possible barriers and engaged the participant in problem-solving.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Each individual session began with participants completing a one-page assessment of perceived self-efficacy and the level of importance for the behavior change on a scale of 0-10.

Sources of self-efficacy were incorporated through collaborative goal-setting of specific, proximal and attainable goals; cognitive behavioral and problem solving strategies were offered to increase the participant&#x02019;s confidence in attaining the newly established goal; vicarious experience occurred by using credible models to demonstrate behavior change (e.g., Leslie Sansone<sup>&#x02122;</sup> exercise tapes) and physiological cues (e.g., less fatigue with physical exertion) were highlighted as evidence that supported behavior changes were occurring. Telephone sessions were available as an alternative to in-person at participant request; 11% of the sessions were conducted by phone. To ensure treatment fidelity, all one-on-one sessions were audio-recorded. A random sampling of 10% of these sessions was reviewed first by one investigator and then, a second investigator reviewed a 10% subset. Issues revealed during reviews were discussed at weekly intervention team meetings and additional training was provided if indicated.

Interventionists reviewed, recorded feedback and returned the diaries to participants at the next session. Group sessions covered nutrition and reinforced principles of behavior change (goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Individual goal setting was not conducted during the group sessions; goal adjustments for SBT group participants were provided by written feedback on their paper diaries.

Health-related quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, version 2 (MOS SF-36).</p><p id="P17">Intervention adherence was measured by 5 variables: attendance, calorie and fat goals, activity goal, and dietary self-monitoring. Attendance adherence was determined by percent of the 20 group sessions attended for both groups, and the percent of the 30 individual sessions attended for the SBT+SE group. Dietary adherence was assessed via two unannounced 24-hour dietary recalls (1 weekend, 1 weekday) within a 6-week window around each assessment guided by the Nutrition Data System for Research program and conducted by blinded and trained research staff.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Dietary adherence was defined as achieving 85%-100% of the dietary goal.

We posit that participants derived what was needed from the one-on-one sessions and then began to see that the group sessions provided additional benefits beyond those gained in the one-on-one sessions.</p><p id="P32">Compared to the SBT group, adherence to dietary self-monitoring was not significantly better in the SBT+SE group. A clinical trial that conducted individual intervention sessions based on behavioral choice theory also reported that self-monitoring of dietary intake adherence did not differ between groups.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Both groups in SELF used paper diaries and demonstrated declining adherence to self-monitoring over time at a typical rate.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In a previous trial, we observed greater adherence to dietary self-monitoring with a handheld computer or mobile device versus a paper diary.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P33">The SBT+SE group demonstrated better adherence to the calorie goal than the SBT group but no difference in fat goal adherence. The adherence to the fat goal was low and declined over time. We have demonstrated in previous studies,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> that of the five protocol components in SBT (self-monitoring, group attendance, and calorie, fat and exercise goals) adherence to the fat goal is lower than to the other targets. Other behavioral intervention trials have not reported adherence to the dietary goals.</p><p id="P34">In the PREMIER Trial, 30% of participants self-monitored their physical activity, on average, less than once a week, and approximately 38% self-monitored an average of 1.0 to 2.9 days per week.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Initially 70% of our sample was adherent to the exercise goal. This declined to approximately 5% by the end of the study suggesting a need for greater emphasis and improved strategies to increase adherence to this crucial part of maintenance.</p><p id="P35">We hypothesized that delivering an intervention based on self-efficacy enhancement would improve weight loss maintenance in the SBT+SE group. However, we observed no significant change in self-efficacy, as measured by the WEL, over time or between the two groups. We believe this is not a measurement issue as we have used the WEL in previous studies and have demonstrated significant change in WEL scores over time among those who have participated in SBT for weight loss.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The absence of the anticipated effect may be the result of several small differences beyond the increased attention the SBT+SE group received. Attendance at the group sessions by the SBT+SE group declined rapidly until the 20th week when it increased and leveled off; missing some of the initial group support might have contributed to this reduced effect. Also, only 66% of the individual sessions were completed, which resulted in a reduced dose effect. The participant perception of the ratio of &#x02018;burden to benefit&#x02019; of the two types of sessions may have changed at 20 weeks, at which time the group sessions were moving to a less burdensome monthly schedule and the benefit of the bi-weekly individual sessions also may have been maximized for individuals. SBT+SE participants were more adherent to the energy intake restriction, which may have contributed to their improved maintenance; however, there was no difference in other adherence measures.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="P36">A limitation to this study is that our sample was comprised of predominantly White, middle-age, well-educated women. Thus our findings may not be generalizable to certain populations. Strengths include the randomized 2-group design and the excellent retention of 80% at 18 months. Additionally, we had a 28% representation of non-Whites in the sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P37">We compared SBT to a modified SBT (SBT+SE) in which participants were provided 30 one-on-one sessions focusing on collaborative goal setting for achieving dietary and exercise goals and self-efficacy enhancement. Participants in both groups achieved significant weight loss and maintained over 5% of the weight loss at the end of the study. However, the SBT+SE group had a larger, but not statistically significant different weight loss maintenance. This difference may be due to several factors; however, the design of the study and the multi-component intervention precludes us from identifying the self-efficacy enhancement intervention as the main contributor to the nonsignificant difference. Future studies need to design interventions incorporating maximal optimization approaches such as multi-factorial designs so that one can tease apart the contribution of each intervention component.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by NIH through P01NR010949 and K24NR010742.</p><p>Funding: P01NR010949 and L.

overweight and obesity. Over 75% of adults who intentionally lose weight regain most of the weight. Standard behavioral treatment (SBT) protocols have been used for several years with numerous variations but have shown little improvement in weight loss maintenance rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased self-efficacy is associated with behaviors related to weight loss (e.g., improved adherence to dietary and physical activity goals). Individuals who have higher perceived self-efficacy are more likely to continue their weight loss efforts until the desired goal is reached. Self-efficacy can be increased within behavioral weight loss interventions. There is evidence that applying the sources of self-efficacy (e.g., mastery performance, modeling) can lead to an increase in one&#x02019;s perception of his/her capability to perform a behavior.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>What this study adds</title><p><list list-type="bullet" id="L2"><list-item><p>Explores the effect of supplementing group-delivered behavioral weight loss interventions with one-to-one sessions designed to target self-efficacy enhancement to support weight loss maintenance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Describes patterns of adherence to group sessions concurrent to one-on-one sessions for the experimental group</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reinforces the importance of face-to-face contact in behavioral weight loss interventions as a tool for weight-loss maintenance</p></list-item></list></p></sec></boxed-text><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-708270-f0001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Adherence to attendance and intervention goals (y-axis=% of sample adherent; x-axis=weeks in protocol).
