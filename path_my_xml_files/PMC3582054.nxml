Introduction</title><p>Pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is indicated for the treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Pantoprazole is one of the highly prescribed PPI in the management of peptic ulcer diseases. It shows high specificity for the relevant binding sites on activated proton pumps with little propensity to cause unwanted systemic effects [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium, administered as a 40&#x02009;mg enteric-coated tablet, is quantitatively absorbed. Its absolute bioavailability is 77% and does not change upon multiple dosing. Following a single oral dose of 40&#x02009;mg, <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> is approximately 2.5&#x02009;mg/L with a <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> of 2-3&#x02009;h. Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver and has a total serum clearance of 0.1&#x02009;l/h/kg, a serum elimination half-life of about 1.1&#x02009;h, and an apparent volume of distribution of 0.15&#x02009;L/kg. 98% of pantoprazole is bound to serum proteins. Elimination half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution are independent of the dose. Almost 80% of an oral or intravenous dose is excreted as metabolites in urine; the remainder is found in feces and originates from biliary secretion. The clearance of pantoprazole is only slightly affected by age, with its half-life being approximately 1.25&#x02009;h in the elderly [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pantoprazole is an acid labile drug that requires protection from degradation in acidic media [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, oral formulations of pantoprazole are available as enteric-coated tablets.</p><p>Cyclodextrins are nonreducing cyclic oligosaccharides, consisting of dextrose units. Cyclodextrins have a &#x0201c;doughnut&#x0201d; shape, with the interior of the molecule being relatively hydrophilic. Because of their unique chemical structure, cyclodextrins are capable of forming &#x0201c;inclusion complexes&#x0201d; with many drug molecules if the drug is capable of undergoing chemical degradation in solution. The drug molecule can be protected by inclusion complexation with a cyclodextrin [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Amongst thousands of excipients used for modifying the physical properties of drug or for altering its biopharmaceutical characteristics, cyclodextrins can be considered as the most excellent one [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cyclodextrins can improve the stability of a number of labile drugs against dehydration, hydrolysis, oxidation, and photodecomposition and thus increasing the shelf life of drugs. Cyclodextrin-induced enhancement of drug stability is due to inhibition of drug interaction with vehicles and/or inhibition of drug bioconversion at the absorption site. By providing molecular shield, cyclodextrin complexation encapsulates labile drug molecules at the molecular level and insulates them against various degradation processes [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Of all the cyclodextrin derivatives available, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) is the safest, as it does not permeate the membranes. A literature survey shows that the toxicity of HPBCD has been extensively studied. HPBCD has been shown to have a reduced haemolytic potential, making it suitable for parenteral use as well as for oral and/or topical applications. HPBCD encapsulation technology is well known for its solubilizing power. HPBCD is well tolerated in most species, particularly if dosed orally, and shows limited toxicity, depending upon dose and route of administration [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previously an attempt has been made to evaluate the solubility of pantoprazole by using beta-cyclodextrin and HPBCD. It was found that beta-cyclodextrin and HPBD increased the solubility of pantoprazole by 4 and 36 times respectively, [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, a generic preparation of pantoprazole with HPBCD has been developed for clinical use. Although the generic and the innovator preparations contain the same active ingredient, they differ from each other by manufacturing processes as well as content of excipients, which affect the rate and extent of absorption of active drug. Therefore, the bioequivalence testing is mandated to confirm the bioavailability between the two preparations in human subjects. In the present study, the objective was to determine the bioequivalence of two oral formulations of pantoprazole in human subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Subjects</title><p>Twenty-six healthy Indian male subjects aged between 20 and 32 years old and the body mass index within 18&#x02013;25 participated in this study. Subjects were in good health on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and routine blood test. Subjects with known contraindication or hypersensitivity to pantoprazole were excluded as well as those with history of drug abuse, heavy alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking. No drug was allowed 1 month before the study period. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee in Mumbai, India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Study Design and Method of Drug Administration</title><p> The experimental design of two-way crossover and randomized study with 25 healthy male volunteers was adopted in the study. As per the randomization schedule, each subject received a single oral dose of 40&#x02009;mg pantoprazole tablet (either Tripepsa or Pantocid) on the morning with 240 &#x000b1; 2&#x02009;mL drinking water at room temperature in sitting posture, under 10 hours overnight fasting condition. The fasting state continued for 04&#x02009;hrs after dose. Water and lunch were served 2 hours and 4 hours after dose, respectively. The washout period between each treatment was 1 month. After a washout period, subjects were administered the different brand of pantoprazole in the same manner. An identical meal and fluid intake were served during the two study periods. Subjects were required to refrain from drinking caffeine containing beverages and alcohol. The blood samples for the analysis of pantoprazole in plasma and collected at the following time points. Predose blood sample (00.00&#x02009;hr) was collected just after phlebotomy within 2.0 hours prior to drug administration and the postdose samples were collected at 0.30, 1.0, 1.30, 2.0, 2.20, 2.40, 3.0, 3.15, 3.30, 3.45, 4.0, 4.15, 4.30, 4.45, 5.0, 5.20, 5.40, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, and 30.0&#x02009;hrs (each contains 1 &#x000d7; 5 mL) after dose, respectively. Within 30 minutes, the blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma. The plasma samples were immediately kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assay.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Determination of Pantoprazole Concentration in Plasma</title><p>Drug analysis of pantoprazole in plasma was performed by suitable analytical method developed and validated at the Analytical Department, Drug Monitoring Research Institute, according to the international guidelines. The assay was operated using a highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detector set at 288&#x02009;nm. A highperformance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method was established to determine the concentration of pantoprazole in human plasma. The limit of quantification during sample analysis was concentration range for pantoprazole of 19.9&#x02009;ng/mL to 5000.1&#x02009;ng/mL. A Shimadzu LC-10ATvp pump (Kyoto, Japan) and a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp detector (Kyoto, Japan) were used. Chromatography was performed on a Diamonsil C18 column (particle size 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, 200&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 4.6&#x02009;mm ID, Beijing, China), using a mobile phase of methanol-water (60&#x02009;:&#x02009;40, V/V), which was delivered at a flow rate of 1.2&#x02009;mL<italic>&#x000b7;</italic>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Under the present chromatographic conditions, HPLC retention time of pantoprazole and the IS (internal standard, betamethasone) was 6.3&#x02009;min and 9.0&#x02009;min, respectively.

The mixture was vortex-mixed for approximate 1&#x02009;min, then shaken on a mechanical shaker for 10&#x02009;min. After centrifugation at 2000&#x02009;g for 5&#x02009;min, the upper organic layer was removed and evaporated to dryness at 40&#x000b0;C under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
