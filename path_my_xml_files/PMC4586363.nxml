Serious mental illnesses are associated with obesity-related risk factors, irrespective of treatment (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), while psychiatric medications add to risks of weight gain, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Behavioral approaches to reducing cardiometabolic risk are considered the first line of treatment for overweight and obese adults in the general population (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Recent evidence, including from the STRIDE project (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), suggests such interventions can be equally effective for adults with serious mental illnesses (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) During STRIDE&#x02019;s 6-month intensive intervention period (weekly sessions), intervention participants lost 4.4 kg more than control participants. Following an additional 6 months of monthly sessions (maintenance intervention), intervention participants were 2.6 kg lighter than controls. (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) Fasting glucose levels increased in controls at the 12-month measurement (from 106.0 mg/dL to 109.5 mg/dL), but decreased among intervention participants (from 106.3 mg/dL to 100.4 mg/dL). (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) Medical hospitalizations for the 12-month intervention period were significantly reduced in intervention compared to control participants, and at 12 months, 47% of intervention participants had lost at least 5% of baseline body weight, compared with 36% of controls. (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</p><p id="P7">Despite short-term successes, however, long-term maintenance of weight loss and improved lifestyle have been difficult to achieve in general populations (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and, as of this writing, we are aware of only one study that has examined maintenance of weight loss and lifestyle change among people with serious mental illnesses (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Predictors of long-term weight-loss maintenance in general populations include: 1) reduced dietary fat, increased dietary fiber, increased exercise, and increased self-monitoring (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); 2) among Caucasians, better mental and physical health (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); consumption of diets with higher protein and lower glycemic indices (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); and, among women, flexible cognitive restraint, lower levels of uncontrolled eating in response to stimuli, exercise self-efficacy, exercise intrinsic motivation, and body dissatisfaction (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Among people with serious mental illnesses, the In SHAPE replication is the only study to date of long-term maintenance following a successful lifestyle intervention (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In contrast to STRIDE&#x02019;s group intervention model, In SHAPE (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) tested an individualized health coach plus fitness club membership intervention compared to fitness club membership alone. The intevention reduced weight and improved fitness, reducing cardiovascular risks. Most importantly, improvements (exercise levels, improved diet, weight loss, improved fitness) were sustained in the 6 months after the intervention was withdrawn, though the investigators did not report predictors of maintenance beyond sustained dietary change and exercise.</p><p id="P8">In this paper, we report maintenance outcomes of the STRIDE weight-loss and lifestyle change program for the period 12-24 months following the end of the intervention. We also report exploratory analyses of predictors of maintaining a weight loss of 5% or more of baseline weight one year after the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><p id="P9">The STRIDE trial (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) tested an adaptation of the PREMIER lifestyle intervention with DASH eating plan (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). PREMIER/DASH successfully reduced weight and blood pressure among people in the general population (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and the DASH eating plan has been shown to reduce other cardiometabolic risks, through increases in HDL cholesterol, lowered triglycerides, reduced fasting blood glucose levels, and improved insulin resistance (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Details of the STRIDE study design, rationale, implementation process and 12-month outcomes have been described elsewhere (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

A full description of the protocol is available elsewhere (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) The focus of the intervention was on moderate caloric restriction, increased moderate exercise, and improved dietary practices (DASH Eating Plan: increased fruit, vegetable, and low-fat dairy consumption; reduced fat consumption). The intervention goal was weight loss of 4.5-6.8 kg (10-15 pounds) over 6 months, the same goal as the PREMIER intervention.

Using a stratified randomized block design, 96 were randomized to the usual care control and 104 to intervention. Individuals were excluded if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy during the study period; had an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization within 30 days (although we allowed deferred participation); had a history of, or plans for, bariatric surgery; had a history of a cancer diagnosis in the 2 years prior to enrollment; had experienced a heart attack or stroke within 6 months; or had cognitive impairment that could interfere with informed consent.</p><p id="P14">We collected data between July 2009 and October 2013.

We found no significant differences in attrition between study arms at any assessment point. Participants from all study arms who had elevated blood pressure or laboratory results were referred to primary or urgent care after each assessment. The KPNW Institutional Review Board reviewed, approved, and monitored all study sites and study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Measures</title><p id="P15">Our pre-specified outcome measures were weight change from baseline, BMI change from baseline, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the HOMA-IR index of insulin resistance (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>); the Framingham Diabetes Risk Score (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. In addition, we collected data on a variety of other measures for exploratory analyses including: the SF-36v2 General Health subscale (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); sleep quality, measured with items from the Berlin sleep apnea scale (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>); and the BASIS-24 measure of mental health (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Other measures included the Patient Activation Measure of health-related self-efficacy; positive and negative social support for lifestyle changes; the B-WISE body image scale; the Wisconsin Quality of Life Index General Quality of Life Subscale; dietary self-efficacy; weight outcome expectancies; past 7-day exercise; and dietary content from Block Screeners (see Yarborough et al.

We also assessed adverse events occurring in the periods between assessment visits, including all medical and psychiatric hospitalizations.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Analyses</title><p id="P16">We examined distributions for all outcomes to determine whether transformations or different models were needed, and used generalized estimating equations (GEE) because they estimate population-averaged effects while controlling for the non-independence of observations inherent in repeated-measures data.

(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) We tested whether the joint effect of the interaction of time and study arm equaled zero using Wald tests. Each time-by-arm interaction term represents the difference in the change from baseline, 6 months, or 12 months, to the 24-month time point&#x02014;all time points are included in figures and tables to provide a full picture of changes over time. We included age and study site as time-invariant covariates, and whether or not outcomes-related medications (e.g., for blood pressure, lipids, or diabetes; and medications producing weight gain or weight loss) were being taken at a given time, as time-varying covariates. We used GEE models with a normal distribution and identity link. The working covariance matrix was specified as exchangeable. We report covariate-adjusted results using robust estimates of standard errors.</p><p id="P17">We also conducted sensitivity analyses for each outcome using transformations that improved the normality of the outcome, a different family and link (e.g., negative binomial with log link) where appropriate, and unstructured working covariance matrices. For time-varying covariates, we also ran models that specified them as time-invariant (i.e., baseline only). There were no substantive differences among models in almost all cases.</p><p id="P18">We examined between-group differences at 24 months for percentage weight change, proportion of participants at or below baseline weight, and proportion of participants who had lost at least 5% or 10% of baseline weight. In contrast to other analyses, these were not intent-to-treat results because computation of change scores required complete data. We then tested differences in percentage weight change between intervention and control groups using oneway ANCOVAs, and used multiple logistic regression analyses to test whether the proportion of participants at or below baseline weight at 24 months differed between the 2 arms. Finally, we used multiple logistic regression analyses to explore factors associated with maintaining a weight loss of 5% or more from baseline weight, irrespective of study group, and we used chi-square analyses to examine differences in medical and psychiatric hospitalizations at 24 months.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S11"><title>Results</title><sec id="S12"><title>Outcomes at 24 Months</title><p id="P19">We found no significant differences in intent-to-treat analyses comparing weight at 24 months to weight at previous assessments: baseline (2.10, 95% CI [&#x02212;0.96, 5.15]); 6 months (&#x02212;2.45, 95% CI [&#x02212;6.00,1.10]); or 12 months (&#x02212;0.60, 95% CI [&#x02212;3.09,1.90]) (the omnibus test for the interaction was significant because there was a difference in the weight change between groups during the intervention phase) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In analyses of complete cases at 2 years, intervention participants had lost 3.7% of their baseline weight, and control participants had lost 2.1% of baseline weight, <italic>F</italic>(1,156)=1.2, <italic>p</italic>=0.29. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> presents adjusted time-by-group coefficients and confidence intervals for intent-to-treat analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> show estimated marginal means for all study outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> provides the estimated marginal means for 12 and 24 months).</p><p id="P21">There was no evidence that the intervention group was more likely to be at or below their baseline weight at 24 months compared to the control group (odds ratio = 1.33; 95% CI [0.69, 2.58], <italic>p</italic>=0.40).

For fasting glucose and insulin, we report results of the negative binomial GEE. There were no significant time-by-group interactions for fasting insulin, Framingham Diabetes Risk Score, or HOMA-IR. For fasting glucose, there were no significant differences in the change of the log of the incidence rate ratio at 24 months compared to baseline (.047, 95% CI [&#x02212;.017, .111]). For fasting insulin, the time-by-group interaction was not significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.12), although the coefficient representing the difference in change from 6 to 24 months was significant (log of the incidence rate ratio = .347, 95% CI[.054,.640]). On average, fasting insulin in the intervention group decreased from 10.1 to 7.91 &#x003bc;U/mL and the control group&#x02019;s level increased from 11.66 to 12.92 &#x003bc;U/mL.</p><p id="P23">In addition, there were significantly fewer medical hospitalizations in the intervention group (4.8%) compared to the control group at 24 months (16.7%; <italic>&#x003a7;</italic><sup>2</sup>[1, 200] = 7.47, <italic>p</italic>=0.006; risk ratio = 0.29), while psychiatric hospitalizations did not differ. Given that the intervention was designed to improve physical health outcomes but not psychiatric outcomes, these results are consistent with intervention goals. Moreover, this was a randomized trial, so hospitalizations should have been equal at baseline. There was also no evidence for differences in self-reported health or functioning between intervention and control groups at baseline.</p><p id="P24">Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significant, though because average values were within normal ranges at baseline, no significant change was expected.

Their 24-month outcomes expectancies also differed from those who were unable to achieve and maintain this level of weight loss.

Factors <italic>not</italic> found to be associated with weight loss maintenance in this sample were general or mental health, sleep quality, confidence in ability to change eating habits, patient activation/health-related self-efficacy, general quality of life, positive or negative social support for lifestyle changes, marital status, 7-day exercise frequency, or dietary content.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">The weight loss intervention tested in this trial produced significant weight loss during the 1-year intervention period, but the difference in weight loss between the trial arms diminished after the intervention period ended and was no longer statistically significant. Similar relapse following the end of interventions is typical in weight loss studies conducted with the general population of overweight and obese adults. Our results suggest, however, that some health improvements were sustained over two years (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and that some had lasting clinical significance, as evidenced by continued reduced hospitalization rates among intervention participants during the second year of follow-up. These reductions are consistent with recent findings showing reduced hospitalizations among lifestyle intervention participants with diabetes (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and findings of sustained cardiovascular risk reduction among people with serious mental illnesses who received health coaching and a fitness club membership. (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) In a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for this study, we estimated that reduced hospitalization costs would save approximately $137,500/year in each of the two years studied. (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) Furthermore, diabetes prevention studies have consistently shown that lifestyle interventions reduce diabetes risk long after the trials have ended. (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) The steady decreases in fasting insulin levels found in this trial suggest that improved insulin sensitivity may help explain the long-term benefits of such lifestyle modification. Interestingly, improvements seen among control participants in the trial likely result from a combination of factors that could inform future interventions. These include: the importance of being ready to change; the value of routine measurement and feedback about weight and other outcomes provided as part of participation; and the importance of routine monitoring and referral to treatment for at-risk lab or other values.</p><p id="P27">Analyses of qualitative interviews with participants indicated that the support, common mental health and medication-related experiences, and the accountability provided by group members were extremely important to participants, and that they had a much harder time maintaining lifestyle changes after the intervention ended. (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) Together, these results are consistent with recent evidence suggesting that adopting a chronic disease perspective, with corresponding extended care for weight maintenance and other lifestyle changes, is likely to be more effective than shorter-term interventions. (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) These results are also consistent with evidence that extended care can be beneficial even when it is of low intensity. (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)</p><p id="P28">Given the special needs and risks experienced by individuals with serious mental illnesses taking antipsychotic medications, interventions that produce long-term changes in weight and cardiometabolic risks are needed to reduce this population&#x02019;s rates of early cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. In this context, it is noteworthy that participants reported that the end of intervention contacts at 1 year made their continued efforts to improve their lifestyles more difficult. Recent evidence in the general population suggests that extended care provided in group formats (as opposed to individual contacts with interventionists) is more effective for producing long-term weight maintenance and sustained lifestyle improvements. (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) In contrast, however, In SHAPE&#x02019;s weekly personalized one-on-one health coaching produced longer-term benefits without continued intervention, though the In SHAPE 6-month no-intervention maintenance period was not as long as STRIDE&#x02019;s 12-month period, and outcomes may have changed after an additional 6 months. (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) Nevertheless, it is possible that individuals with serious mental illnesses benefit more from individualized attention than other populations. Because such interventions are likely to be more costly to deliver than group interventions, future research should compare effects of longer-term follow-up in group contexts vs. shorter one-on-one interventions. Cost-effectiveness analyses of these different approaches could be useful to policy makers and program managers.</p><p id="P29">Our findings that better body image was associated with sustained weight loss, and that outcomes expectancies were more closely associated with actual weight loss among individuals who successfully maintained a 5% reduction in weight, have important implications beyond weight and health. First, there may be significant psychological benefits to weight loss resulting from improved body image. In this already stigmatized population, known for reduced social integration, both better feelings about oneself, and improved perceptions of others, (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) could improve quality of life and facilitate mental health recovery. Second, specifically targeting outcomes expectancies as part of interventions to help participants develop more realistic expectations may help people feel more successful in their efforts and enhance their ability to sustain behavior changes.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P30">Participants in the intervention were not as representative of the target population as we had planned. Their average age was about 47 years (with well-established chronic illnesses), we had fewer male participants (28%) than expected, and we had few participants from racial or ethnic minorities (14%). While this pattern is typical of lifestyle change programs generally, it may limit the generalizability of these results to men and members of minority groups in this patient population. In addition, we report results for significant changes in fasting glucose thought 6-24 months when the omnibus test was marginal. For this reason, these results should be interpreted with caution and examined in future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P31">People with serious mental illnesses taking antipsychotic medications can lose weight and improve diabetes and other cardiometabolic risks factors when offered a group-based lifestyle intervention. Few changes are likely to be maintained without extended care, though significant clinical benefits may be sustained, as indicated by reduced hospitalizations beyond the intervention period.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Grant R18DK076775, entitled &#x0201c;Reducing Weight and Diabetes Risk in an Underserved Population.&#x0201d; The authors would like to thank our scientific and community collaborators and the clinical and project management staff that supported this trial.
