This method, however, has reduced creativity and problem-solving skills training in the curriculum. The virtual microscope (VM) system has been shown to be an effective and efficient educational strategy. The present study aims to describe a VM system for undergraduates and to evaluate the effects of promoting active learning and problem-solving skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two hundred and twenty-nine second-year undergraduate students in the Third Military Medical University were divided into two groups. The VM group contained 115 students and was taught using the VM system. The light microscope (LM) group consisted of 114 students and was taught using the LM system. Post-teaching performances were assessed by multiple-choice questions, short essay questions, case analysis questions and the identification of structure of tissue.

As a result there has been a significant increase in the number of students entering medical school. China&#x02019;s medical education system is the largest in the world; in 2008 there were 159 medical teaching institutions and approximately 1.7 million students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because of the high number of students, shortage of teachers and limited equipment, Chinese teaching usually relies on rote learning and instruction instead of active investigation by students, which can promote creativity and imagination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Compared with most developed countries in Europe and North America, China faces some unique problems within its medical education as a result of its history and culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Education and training in histology, anatomical pathology and cytopathology remain essential to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. At most universities in China, histology courses are traditionally lecture-based, incorporating the use of textbooks, glass slides and conventional microscopy. These courses have been confronted by resource limitations, including too many students and not enough space to accommodate them all, and very few instructors and teaching resources, including human specimens and microsections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Circumstances such as these can act to reduce creativity and problem-solving skills training in the curriculum. To enhance these skills, schools in North America and Europe currently have used problem-based learning (PBL), case-reinforced learning (CRL) education methodologies and new e-based technologies and approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The PBL methodology, which aims to cultivate students&#x02019; creativity and practical abilities, has been used in China since the mid-1980s. While some recent studies have shown that analytical and problem-solving skills have improved among PBL students, the application of PBL is limited because of faculty shortage and a lack of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, strategies to enhance students&#x02019; active learning and problem-solving skills are increasingly used in the better-known Chinese medical schools.</p><p>Over the last two decades, the number of web-based histology resources has expanded dramatically, with centralized histological resources being simultaneously provided to many students. Virtual microscope (VM) is a computer-based program that enables viewing, navigating and annotating of digital slides, and is similar to working with a real microscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The VM system for basic medical education and quality control overcomes several traditional problems, such as faculty shortages and lack of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There are some published studies addressing VM in several countries, particularly in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; however, little comparative information on education and professional development is available in developing countries, especially China. New teaching methodologies are required for Chinese students to ensure that the purpose of the current educational system is achieved, and to improve active learning and problem-solving skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>This project aims to describe and discuss the VM system for Chinese undergraduate histology courses, and explores the outcomes of the VM system with the hope that histology teaching will become more process-oriented. We designed our VM system as an open assisted platform to empower our learners to develop active learning and problem-solving skills to overcome the limitations facing traditional lecture-based learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participating students</title><p>The participating students were 229&#x000a0;second-year students at the Third Military Medical University. These students enrolled in the course directly from high school in the autumn of 2011. Their first year consisted of a basic science curriculum, which includes mathematics, chemistry, physics and anatomy. The students then began their basic medical curriculum in the third semester, which includes histology courses. Based on the students&#x02019; academic record from their first academic year, the students were assigned into two groups. Group 1 was scheduled for virtual microscopes and thus became the VM group, and Group 2 was scheduled for light microscopes, thus becoming the LM group. A pre-test was conducted before the course and the results showed no difference between the two groups. The teaching staff comprised six teachers experienced in teaching histology.

Our VM system can be exploited to increase students&#x02019; basic knowledge and problem-solving skills despite the lack of available space, equipment and instructors in traditional LM settings. This technology is referred to as virtual microscopy and has created enormous opportunities in histological training and education. Using this method, students can learn key histopathological skills, such as identifying areas of diagnostic relevance from an entire slide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Medical curricula are changing to reduce scheduled time for basic science instruction as well as focusing on student-centered learning approaches. Histology laboratory instruction is moving away from the sole use of the traditional combination of LM and glass slides in favor of virtual microscopy and virtual slides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Virtual microscopy represents one such simulation-based technology that has the potential to enhance student learning and readiness to practice while revolutionizing clinical problem-solving skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, virtual microscopy is a reliable and more reproducible technology and has several advantages over glass slides. The VM system is easily accessible by faculty and students inside and outside the laboratory, overcoming the limitations of space and equipment. Groups of students can view exactly the same specimen, allowing for the same point of reference in group work and discussions. Moreover, the use of annotations on the virtual slides is found to be a useful way for interpreting findings in textbooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>As our university is a military medical school, all the students are soldiers and histology is one of their basic medical training requirements; both the VM group and LM group maintained a high participation rate in our study. Because there are more students than available teachers and equipment, traditional Chinese teaching usually relies on a lecture-based format as the formal approach to preclinical training. This rote teaching approach facilitates retention of knowledge but fails to effectively integrate students&#x02019; skills of critical thinking and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The VM system can provide an opportunity to learn critically in the setting of limited physical resources. Of the 115 participants who studied histology using the VM system over one semester, 95% preferred to use virtual microscopy. By examining the students&#x02019; test scores, we found that their knowledge of histology significantly improved after the course compared with students using LM. Students indicated that the VM helped to stimulate their interest in the topic before the discussion, enhanced their ability to memorize the information and helped them to become more active participants. This result is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The structure characterization of tissue is one of the key skills for histopathologists. The VM system enables this skill to be developed in a web-based environment by viewing, navigating, and annotating digital slides, where the student/trainee can see the morphologic patterns or diagnostic feature in the context of the entire sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Questionnaire results showed nearly all the students (99%) found the virtual slides easy to navigate, and 93% thought that the virtual image quality was at least as good as that of a normal microscope. In the VM teaching trials, the students learned to effectively use various sources of information and were trained in the rapid retrieval of relevant clinical pathological knowledge. These are important skills for medical professionals who must act quickly in real clinical problems. Under the advantages of the VM system, the VM students achieved better results in the categories of identification of tissue structure and case analysis questions. Similarly, previous studies have also reported positive attitudes toward the use of virtual slides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the students&#x02019; results showed no differences in the short essay questions and multiple-choice questions. This indicates that the short essay and multiple-choice questions require more complex levels of knowledge (i.e., regarding comprehension or analysis). This result supports a study by Krippendorf and Lough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which demonstrated a significant improvement in the identification of tissue structure and case analysis exam performance by students who learned using virtual microscopy when compared with those who used conventional microscopy.</p><p>The VM system also provides variant training opportunities. Virtual microscopy has the benefit of delivering histology courses to students outside the classroom setting. Students can access online virtual microscopy courses at any time and place, allowing them to view slides that would have traditionally been restricted to the slide box and classroom. Thus, students no longer need to be in the same room as the glass slide. The student surveys indicate that the VM enhances student confidence through communication with others and the ability to identify structures by annotation; it improves their productivity, promotes learning efficiency and positively affects their learning experience (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The VM system was also able to meet the students&#x02019; various study preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The online educational environment with collaborative assignments and interactive content was a novel experience.</p><p>Although it has provided us with a new, convenient and effective teaching method, VM-based education indicates the loss of training in manual traditional light microscopy. This is a controversial topic for many schools who recognize that students may have the opportunity to use LMs in settings outside the course, such as clerkship rotations or research projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Compared with traditional light microscopy, the VM course is more suited for Chinese undergraduate education; however, the instructional model needs further development to be appropriate for training.</p><p>In conclusion, the integration of the digital slide-based virtual microscopy into conventional courses is an important step towards a blended learning strategy. Students can regularly use the VM system and enjoy the opportunity of learning without temporal or spatial restrictions and enhance their active learning and problem-solving skills. We believe that these interactive programs provide a better approach to interactive learning as an assisted platform.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through the cooperative efforts of faculty and students, our VM system is an effective solution as an assisted platform against the limitations facing traditional optical laboratories, enabling us to implement new, collaborative teaching and learning strategies. Students can use the VM system regularly and augment their basic knowledge and problem-solving skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>Y T and M Q, MD, are Senior Lecturers.
