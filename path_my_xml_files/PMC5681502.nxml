In total, 44 acute ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided to the XXMT treatment group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) or the placebo group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) in a 2-week trial. Before and after the treatment, the neurological assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging examinations were carried out. Compared to the placebo group, the scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SSQOL) significantly improved in the treatment group. In addition, XXMT-treated patients demonstrated significantly enhanced functional connectivity within the default mode, frontal-parietal, and motor control networks. Furthermore, the changed connectivity in the left precuneus was positively correlated to the improvement of NIHSS and SSQOL scores. The present study indicated that XXMT treatment significantly improved the neurologic deficit and quality of life of acute ischemic stroke patients and that the therapeutic effect may be based on the modulation of XXMT on the functional connectivity of brain networks.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular disease, is the second most common cause of death and the leading cause of acquired long-term disability in adults worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Ischemic stroke, which is caused by large cerebral artery occlusion, is the primary pathological type of stroke and an important contributor to vascular dementia and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, the early diagnosis and intervention at the acute stage of ischemic stroke are vital in the prevention of the stroke recurrence and subsequent dementia. These early measures are also considered critical and preventive part of therapies for vascular dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Currently, common clinical practice in treating patients with an acute ischemic stroke involves fibrinolytic therapy (administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, rt-PA) and antiplatelet agents (such as aspirin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, rt-PA treatment is more effective only if given within approximately 3&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;hours of symptoms onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, merely a small percentage of patients can be treated within this time frame in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, several studies have reported that antiplatelet therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke as expected, but instead it considerably increased the risk of bleeding and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The limitations of these treatments, likely reflecting the multiple mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic strokes, thereby prompted the desire to explore other treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par4">Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) provides an alternative therapy for ischemic stroke and has been widely used in stroke treatment in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Xueshuan Xinmai&#x000a0;tablets (XXMT) is a traditional Chinese patented medicine that is commonly used in clinical practice and that has been approved for ischemic stroke by the China Food and Drug Administration in 2003 (Z20030145). XXMT is composed of more than a dozen Chinese herbs and is based on the TCM theory of these raw materials. Treatment efficacy with this medicine has been further refined using modern advanced technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>Ligusticum wallichii</italic> (chuanxiong in Chinese) and <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> (danshen in Chinese) are two major components of XXMT. As a compound medicine of Chinese herbs, XXMT is functionally characterized as benefiting qi via activating blood circulation (Yiqi Huoxue in Chinese) and shows a better therapeutic effect on acute ischemic stroke patients. However, as with any other traditional Chinese medicine compound, XXMT includes a variety of active ingredients, thus it is difficult to explain the therapeutic mechanism of action.</p><p id="Par5">Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a promising and noninvasive neuroimaging technique to measure spontaneous and intrinsic brain activity under no external input or performance demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It has been recently used to investigate the functional changes in brain networks and recovery after stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These resting-state fMRI studies on ischemic stroke have confirmed the disruption or reorganization of intrinsic connectivity not only between cortical areas around the ischemic lesion but also in widely distributed neural networks, including the default mode network (DMN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the fronto-parietal network (FP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the motor network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the disrupted neural networks in patients with strokes always exhibited restoration accompanied with the recovery of neurologic deficit and quality of life after treatment, a fact that is credited to neural plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, a placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed to assess the therapeutic effect of XXMT on acute ischemic stroke patients using both stroke scales and rs-fMRI technique measures to define the outcomes. We hypothesized that 1) the neurologic deficit and quality of life of patients with acute ischemic stroke can be improved after two weeks of treatment with XXMT, and that 2) the therapeutic effect of XXMT is associated with its modulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the neural networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Demographics, neurological testing and blood biomarker detection</title><p id="Par7">There were no differences in age (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.085), gender (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.899) or education (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.566) between the placebo and the treatment groups.

Our results showed that XXMT treatment significantly improved neurologic deficit, quality of life and blood viscosity but not infarct volume. In our subsequent analysis of the fMRI data, we found that XXMT could improve brain resting state functional connectivity of the DMN network, mainly in the right medial frontal cortex and the left precuneus. Our results also showed that XXMT could increase the connectivity of the left opercular inferior frontal cortex and the left postcentral cortex within the frontal-parietal network, and a number of connections in the motor control network. Moreover, in the treatment group, we observed a significant association between NIHSS/SSQOL and the functional connectivity at the core regions in the aDMN, pDMN, lFP and rFP, where a significant interaction effect between time and group was observed.</p><p id="Par14">TCM has now been receiving more and more attention as an alternative treatment for various diseases, including the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. TCM has evolved into a complete medical system that has diagnosed, treated, and prevented illness and takes&#x000a0;a holistic view&#x000a0;of the human system over the past thousands of years. To some degree, this holistic intervention model could be beneficial and complementary to the single-target intervention model of modern medicine. Interestingly, many studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of TCM as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. XXMT has been widely used in the TCM clinical practice for treating ischemic stroke, cerebral thrombosis and coronary heart disease and is effective because it enhances blood circulation and removes blood stasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated that tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), the main extract of ligusticum wallichii, is a biologically active alkaloid that promotes vasodilatation, inhibits platelet aggregation and exhibits significant antioxidant effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Synergistically, the combination of Tan IIA and TMP is a widely applied therapy against ischemic stroke in TCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These biochemical findings provided support for our results.</p><p id="Par15">There are many differences between this study and our previous work (Int J Clin Exp Med 2015;8(5):7507&#x02013;7516) on the study purpose, patient diagnosis criteria, demographics, treatment period, clinic behavior assessmentscale, brain functional imaging analysis method and study results. The present study aims to investigate the effects of XXMT on neurologic deficit, quality of life and brain functional connectivity in acute ischemic stroke patients and to explore the mechanism of action of XXMT through a placebo controlled randomized study. The patients were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of AnHui College of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 1st, 2012 to December 29st, 2012. The patients meet acute ischemic stroke diagnosis criteria and received 2 weeks XXMT treatment. The study results indicated that XXMT treatment significantly improved the neurologic deficit and quality of life of acute ischemic stroke patients and that the therapeutic effect may be based on the modulation of XXMT on the functional connectivity of brain networks including default mode network, frontal-parietal network, motor control network. The purpose of our previous work &#x0201c;The therapeutic effect of Xueshuan Xinmai tablets on memory injury and brain activity in post-stroke patients: a pilot placebo controlled fMRI study&#x0201d; was to explore the effects of XXMT for the treatment of cognitive function, brain region activation in the rehabilitation period of ischemic stroke patients. The patients were recruited from eight communities from January 1st, 2012 to June 1st, 2013. The patients meet chronic ischemic stroke diagnosis criteria in the rehabilitation period (between 15 days and 6 months after the onset of symptoms) and received 3 months XXMT treatment. The results showed that XXMT treatment has a favorable mediation on episodic memory, consequently suppresses the activation of the cingulate gyrus in the rehabilitation period of ischemic stroke patients.</p><p id="Par16">NIHSS is a widely used test in strokes and is composed of language, cognitive ability, visual field defect, sensation, and reflection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In this study, we observed a significant decrease in the NIHSS score in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. As the second index we used in this study, SSQOL includes the physical function, social participation, and psychological and subjective feelings among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We also observed a significant increase of SSQOL score in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. Both indices pointed to the improvements that XXMT had on neurologic function deficits and quality of life in acute ischemic stroke patients. On the other hand, no significant effect on reducing infarct volume was observed over the two-week treatment, suggesting that the effects of XXMT are primarily functional in acute ischemic stroke. Another possibility is that the sample size is too small to detect the volumetric change of the infarct lesion.</p><p id="Par17">Regarding the brain&#x02019;s plasticity, the brain may compensate for functional impairment through reorganization of the neural networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Previous brain network studies in stroke patients mainly focused on motor-related networks and DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Park <italic>et al</italic>. found that the stroke patients showed a markedly decreased DMN functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and medial frontal cortex (MFG) one month after stroke compared with a group of healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the present study, ICA, which is a computational method for separating a multivariate signals into independent non-Gaussian signals, was used to identify DMN and FPN functional connectivity analysis. Subsequent network analysis revealed that XXMT treatment significantly increased DMN functional connectivity in the right medial prefrontal cortex and left precuneus, and also increased lFP functional connectivity in the left opercular inferior frontal cortex and left postcentral cortex in acute ischemic stroke patients. This finding demonstrated that XXMT treatment can improve cognitive impairment by increasing functional connectivity in these brain regions that are affected in acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, our findings suggest that functional connectivity evaluation of these brain regions can serve as a potential marker to assess the clinical effects of treatment on ischemic stroke patients.</p><p id="Par18">In this study, six ROIs, which are related to motor control and motor execution function, were included in pair-wise correlations in motor networks functional connectivity analysis, and a symmetric correlation matrix for each subject was obtained. XXMT treatment significantly increased functional connectivity within the motor network: between the left primary motor cortex and right primary motor cortex, between the right primary motor cortex and superior parietal cortex, between the left premotor cortex and right premotor cortex, and between the left premotor cortex and right superior parietal cortex. These brain regions all belong to the motor network, playing an important role in the recovery of motor function in acute ischemic stroke patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. While Inman <italic>et al</italic>. showed that functional connectivity of the brain regions in the motor control network, including the primary motor cortex and superior parietal cortex, significantly decreased in stroke patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that XXMT treatment can improve neurological function deficits through increasing functional connectivity of these brain regions within the motor network in acute ischemic stroke patients.</p><p id="Par19">Our analysis on the relationship between the network functional connectivity and the stroke scale&#x000a0;scores, NIHSS and SSQOL, indicated that they are significantly associated. Such an association contributes to our understanding of the neural integration mechanisms that are affected by XXMT in acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, these brain regions and functional connectivity should be further analyzed as a curative effect of the potential treatment for ischemic stroke.</p><p id="Par20">Several limitations exist in the current study and should be addressed in the future. The limitations include a small sample size, a short duration and a need for evaluation of multiple domains of cognition. Future longitudinal studies are needed and would be essential to confirm our findings.</p><p id="Par21">In summary, the present study demonstrated that XXMT treatment significantly improves the neurologic deficit and quality of life of acute ischemic stroke patients over two weeks and that this therapeutic effect may be related to the modulation of XXMT on the functional connectivity with brain networks. These results provide some insights into future treatments for acute ischemic stroke patients. Subsequent studies with a larger sample size and longer treatment duration should explore the curative effect and underlying mechanisms of action of compound TCM treatment on acute ischemic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p id="Par22">This clinical trial had been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) (registration number: ChiCTR-TRC-12003074, registration date: November 9, 2012), and the research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Hospital, Ministry of Health (approval number: 2011010).
