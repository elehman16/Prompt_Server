Forty-eight patients diagnosed with CRAO were randomly divided into a treatment group (24 cases) and a control group (24 cases). For the control group, nitroglycerin, 654-2, methazolamide, puerarin and compound anisodine were used for the treatment, along with oxygen, massage and other conventional treatments. Besides conventional therapy, the treatment group was also given intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis. Visual acuity, fundus oculi, visual field changes were taken as indicators for efficacy evaluation. It was found that the total effective rate of the control group was 70.83%, while that for the treatment group was 91.67%, and the comparative difference between the two groups was of statistical significance (p&#x0003c;0.05). The visual field defect of the control group after treatment was approximately 74.26&#x000b1;12.91%, and the visual field defect of the treatment group after treatment approximately 35.08&#x000b1;16.33%; thus, the comparative difference was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.01). The comparative difference of the original contents of fibrous protein in blood in the treatment group before and after treatment was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.01). In conclusion, the result show that intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA combined with compound anisodine is safe and effective in treating CRAO, which can significantly improve the prognosis of patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>recombinant tissue plasminogen activator</kwd><kwd>compound anisodine</kwd><kwd>intravenous thrombolysis</kwd><kwd>acute central retinal artery occlusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) refers to acute retinal ischemia and hypoxia as well as serious damage of visual function caused by disorders in retinal blood circulation, and the disorders result from retinal artery spasm, artery intimitis, or the occlusion in the fiber thrombus of blood platelets or blood vessels (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Retinal central artery occlusion is one of the emergent cases in ophthalmology that can seriously damage vision and result in unsatisfactory prognosis. Once the duration of retinal ischemia exceeds 90 min, the death of the photoreceptor becomes irreversible.</p><p>At present, conventional methods including oxygen inhalation, eyeball massage, tube expansion and anticoagulation are mostly used in clinics, and auxiliary medicine such as vitamin B and energy are administered simultaneously. The curative effects generally fail to be satisfactory (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Urokinase artery intervention thrombolysis is an emergent technology in the recent decade and is widely used in China. However, the intervention thrombolysis equipment is complex and costly, posing high demands for operations; preoperative preparation time is prolonged by 40&#x02013;60 min compared to that of intravenous thrombolysis; and hospitals with superselective thrombolysis and mechanical thrombus maceration are extremely limited in China. In addition, urokinase, a non-selective fibrinolytic agent, can enable plasminogen into thrombus and plasma to be activated leading to high-fiber hemolysis of the whole body, which causes complications such as extensive mucocutaneous hemorrhage all over the body (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). By contrast, intravenous thrombolysis is advantageous for its simplicity, safety and is easy to use. Given that the central nervous system is extremely sensitive to ischemia and hypoxia and the retina belongs to the outer reach of the cerebral central nervous system, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), a thrombolytic drug for treating acute cerebral infarction was selected. rt-PA is a kind of thrombolytic drug featured by high selection, short half-life and no antigenicity (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It has high affinity to fibrous protein in plasma, enabling the lysine in the compounds to be activated. At the same time, it can induce plasminogen to be turned into plasmin, so that insoluble fibrous protein can be decomposed into soluble fibrous protein fragments and local thrombolysis can be promotetd. However, it has little affinity to the plasminogen of the whole coagulation system and exerts inconspicuous fibrinolysis for the whole body, thus, no hemorrhage tendency occurs.</p><p>In the present study, 12 cases of CRAO patients having attacks within 24 h were treated with intravenous medicine administration with rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose being 90 mg).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>General information</title><p>Forty-eight cases (48 eyes) of acute CRAO patients (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) diagnosed at the Xiangyang Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine (Hubei, China) from June, 2009 to June, 2012 were selected and randomly divided into a treatment group including 24 cases (24 eyes) and a control group including 24 cases (24 eyes). None of the cases had received emergency treatment prior to being hospitalized. Exclusion standards for the treatment group were: i) a tendency of active hemorrhage and a known tendency of bleeding; ii) a history of cerebral infarction or myocardial infarction in recent 6 months; iii) current adoption of anticoagulation; iv) intracranial arterial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation; v) serious heart failure and dysfunction of liver and kidney; vi) the count of thrombocyte being &#x0003c;100&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/l (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); and vii) gestation and non-cooperation.

While no obvious changes were detected in the examination of fundus oculi before or after treatment for the control group. Three to four weeks after treatment, the edema on the inner layer of posterior pole retina was gradually absorbed, the nerve fiber layer of optic disk and retina partially atrophied, vascular white sheath were visible in part of the central retinal artery and veins.

As a thrombolytic drug recommended for use to treat ischemic stroke, it can be administered through arteries or veins. A number of clinical experiments proved that intravenous medication would not add bleeding complications, and Wardlaw <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) found that rt-PA was safe and effective after summarizing conditions of intra-arterial and intravenous thrombolysis in China in the recent decade. In recent years, through clinical research covering treatment of acute cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction and acute retinal central artery occlusion in China and other countries (<xref rid="b24-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), it was verified that rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis could significantly improve blood supply to acute ischemic cerebral and cardiac tissues and narrow the range of infarction so that it could reduce the disability rate and death rate caused by acute cardiac and cerebral infarction. Findings showed that rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis could improve patients' visual acuity by at least 3 lines within 24 h since the attacks of symptoms, and effectively improve as well as store their intraocular perfusion and visual function (<xref rid="b27-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In the present study, 12 cases of CRAO patients having attacks within 24 h were treated by intravenous medicine administration with rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg, the highest dosage being 90 mg). Ten percent of dosage ictus was initially administered, the remaining dosage was given by continuous intravenous drip for 1 h continuously, and warfarin anticoagulant therapy was conducted for 1 month. As a result, 10 cases (83.3%) witnessed improvement in visual acuity, with 4 cases for 8 lines and 6 cases for 2&#x02013;4 lines as well as 2 cases with no efficacy, no systematic cerebral complications occurred during the treatment. Nowak <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) reported that CRAO patients could significantly improve their central vision and alleviate macular oedema as well as timely remove embolus through intravenous application of rt-PA 4.5 h following the occurence of symptoms; no embolus was found in sclerous blood vessels during color ultrasonography of bilateral carotid arteries and retinal macular oedema basically disappeared during fundus oculi examination 10 days later. Hazin <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) maintained that rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic therapy would be taken as a feasible therapy for treating CRAO, which would benefit patients' visual acuity and fundus oculi conditions when combined with other conventional therapies. Mach and Proch&#x000e1;zka (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) treated 10 cases of patients with thrombolytic therapy. As a result, 2/3 patients significantly improved their visual acuity after thrombolysis within 12 h; some patients undergoing throbolysis after &#x0003e;30 h had their visual acuity improved temporarily despite its late decrease. Therefore, thrombolytic effects for patients with CRAO for &#x0003e;30 h would not be very good, and earlier throbolytic therapy is needed.</p><p>Compound anisodine is a kind of alkaloid separated from anisodus tanguticus, a plant of <italic>solanaceae</italic>. As a new preparation for treating ocular ischemic diseases, it is now widely used in ophthalmology clinics. Mainly composed of anisodine and procaine, it is injected intramuscularly to vegetative nerve endings under the skin beside the superficial temporal arteries. It can regulate vasomotor function and nutrition metabolism in the ocular ischemia area, ease vasospasm in the eye and increase the amount of blood flow inside the eyes, in order to improve the blood supply and oxygen supply of the optic nerves in fundus oculi and improve visual function by promoting absorption of exudation from edema. Simultaneously, it can adjust the activity of ocular vegetative nerves, resist oxidation, repress the increase of free calcium and remove oxygen radicals in the cells, prevent and alleviate the occurrence of ischemia-reperfusion injuries, control inflammation and fibroplasia; it can also protect endothelial cytomembrane, restore normal permeability of vascular walls, and promote the organization as well as absorption of edema, hemorrhage and exudation (<xref rid="b28-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>For the 48 cases of CRAO patients in the treatment and control groups, their visual acuity, fundus oculi, and visual field were improved to some extent, while the treatment group exhibited more significant changes. A comparison between the total effective rate of the clinical efficacy treatment group (91.67%) and that of the control group (70.83%) proved that the distinction was of statistical significance (p&#x0003c;0.05). The visual field defect of the control group was approximately 74.26&#x000b1;12.91% and that of the treatment group decreased to 35.08&#x000b1;16.33%, so the distinction between the two groups was of obvious statistical significance (p&#x0003c;0.01). Observation results of the cases manifested that: i) therapeutic efficacy was related to the time since the onset of the disease, the extent of visual impairment, the location of angiemphraxis, the size of occluded blood vessels and the part occluded; ii) the shorter the time since the onset of the disease, the better the remaining sight and the efficacy; iii) the shorter the time window of thrombolysis, the better the curative effects, and the efficacy was most remarkable within 6.5 h; and iv) efficacy on branch retinal artery occlusion was better than that on central retinal artery occlusion, which was in agreement with relevant research data (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The observation results proved that administration of rt-PA early-phase intravenous thrombolysis together with compound anisodine in treating CRAO could rapidly restore perfusion of ischemic retina as well as alleviate reperfusion injury caused by free radicals, so that CRAO patients' visual nerve function could be remarkably improved. The strategy of combining thrombolysis and protection of visual nerves is of significant efficacy, displaying extremely powerful protection of visual nerves. In addition, for CRAO patients with hypertension, treatment should not reduce blood pressure too quickly when reducing eye pressure, and relatively high perfusion pressure should be retained in the earlier stage to improve the amount of retinal blood flow.</p><p>As studies on evidence for rt-PA thrombolysis in treating CRAO remained insufficient, a combination treatment group (rt-pA + compound anisodine) was added in rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis to further prove the conclusion that combination therapy was better than pure conservative therapy. For high doses and long-time use of rt-PA easily add risks of hemorrhage (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), thus rt-PA thrombolysis treatment was applied for carefully selected patients in the cases of this group, and the dosage of rt-PA thrombolysis was set as 0.5 mg/kg according to previous studies (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-3681" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It was found that the difference between the contents of fibrinogen in blood for the treatment group before and after treatment was of significance (p&#x0003c;0.01), no drug withdrawal occurred due to hepatorenal function damages, allergy, shock and other adverse reactions to medicine; no serious complication or death occurred after treatment except 3 cases of gingival bleeding (12.5%). Application of rt-PA to treat CRAO was proved secure and reliable, which could significantly improve the recovery rate, the remarkably effective rate and the effective rate. Therefore, early, timely, precise and effective therapeutic methods are crucial for restoring retinal blood circulation and improving the visual function of fundus oculi.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-etm-0-0-3681"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
