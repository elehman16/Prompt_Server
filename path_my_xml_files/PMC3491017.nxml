Since 1980, smoking prevalence in women is stalling in Italy (from 19.2% in 1986 to 17.0% in 2009), in comparison to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], there is a need for gender-specific tobacco control strategies. However, these strategies have rarely been developed, except those for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The organized Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (CCSP) in Italy might represent an occasion to promote healthy lifestyles and deliver smoking cessation counselling to women aged 25&#x02013;64 years attending the Pap test examination. This primary prevention activity might be easily integrated with the ongoing routine secondary prevention practice. Moreover, smoking is an important co-factor for the development of cervical cancer, being human papilloma-virus (HPV) the principal causal factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The linkage between smoking cessation and the fear to gain weight is well documented in women. Because calorie reduction may enhance the reinforcing value of smoking cessation, clinical practice guidelines recommended physical activity (PA), rather than diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Physical activity programmes have been proposed as adjuncts to smoking cessation programmes and to relapse prevention programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, a minimal intervention strategy aimed at promoting moderate/intensity PA with advice provided by health professionals, based on the trans-theoretical model of behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], was effective in producing short-term increases in PA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, adding a PA counselling to the standard smoking cessation counselling may improve quit rates among women attending the Pap test examination.</p><p>The SPRINT study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a standard counselling intervention on smoking cessation delivered by trained midwives in a gender-specific setting (the outpatient cervical cancer screening visits), and whether the adjunct of PA counselling to the standard smoking cessation counselling might increase quit rates among women undergoing the CCSP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Details on the design of the SPRINT study, a three-arm randomized controlled trial, have been already published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and are briefly summarized here. The study recruited 1,100 smoking women aged 25&#x02013;64 years attending CCSP consulting rooms: 215 in Florence, 489 in Turin, and 396 in Mantua. Then, 363, 366, and 371 participants were randomly assigned to smoking cessation counselling [SC] arm, the smoking cessation+PA counselling [SC+PA] arm, or to the control arm, respectively (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the enrolment of women attending the National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme in Florence, Turin, and Mantua.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-12-740-1"/></fig><p>Women waiting to perform the test were asked to fill in the study questionnaire and participants provided informed consent. Questionnaire regarded demographic characteristics, lifetime and current use of cigarettes, frequency of previous quit attempts, the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], intention to quit to assess the Di Clemente-Prochaska stage of change for smoking cessation (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, 5 stages were distinguished in the questionnaire, following the Di Clemente-Prochaska stages of change for increasing PA (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Women who decided to participate handed in the filled questionnaires to the midwives before the Pap-test examination.</p><p>A self-help booklet on smoking cessation and increasing PA was provided to all study participants.</p><p>Counselling was delivered after the Pap test examination by the same midwives who performed the test. Midwives were trained to deliver counselling for smoking cessation and for increasing PA.</p><p>The smoking cessation counselling corresponds to the first two phases of the brief intervention for smoking cessation (&#x0201c;Ask&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Advice&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It was tailored according to the Di Clemente-Prochaska stage of change on smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. If participants were in the precontemplation stage of change for smoking cessation, e.g., women did not even consider quitting, and were randomized to both the SC or the SC&#x02009;+&#x02009;PA arms, midwives&#x02019; goal was to move them toward contemplation, and to help women think about quitting. If women were in the contemplation stage of change, e.g., they were thinking of quitting in the next 6 months, midwives&#x02019; goal was to tilt the balance toward cessation, and to encourage women to move towards quitting soon. If women were in the preparation stage, i.e., were planning to quit in the next month, midwives&#x02019; goal was to motivate to quit, and to help setting a quit-day.</p><p>The PA counselling was a brief intervention, designed and validated by psychologists involved in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was a stage-specific counselling, according to the Di Clemente-Prochaska stage assessment on PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. If participants were in the precontemplation stage of change for increasing PA, and were randomized to the SC&#x02009;+&#x02009;PA arm, midwives&#x02019; goal was to move them towards contemplation. If women were in the contemplation stage of change for increasing PA, midwives&#x02019; goal was to remove their ambivalence on increasing PA. If women were in the preparation stage of change, midwives&#x02019; goal was to identify barriers to do more physical exercise. Finally, if women were in the action or maintenance stages of change, e.g., they had begun to do more physical exercise in the last 6 months or for more than 6 months, respectively, midwives reinforced reasons for increasing PA.</p><p>A telephone follow-up was scheduled after six months from the intervention, in order to know how many women successfully quitted, and, among those who did not quit, how many improved their motivational stage of change for smoking cessation (e.g., from precontemplation before the intervention to contemplation or preparation after the intervention; from contemplation before the intervention to preparation afterwards), and how many reduced the number of cigarettes smoked per day.

In order to achieve the goal of including smoking cessation counselling in the daily activity of midwives in the cervical cancer screening setting, focus group were organized and midwives recommended to increase of about 1&#x02013;2 minutes per woman the expected duration of time visit for doing Pap test.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. First, even though the sample size required 430 participants per arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we recruited only 370 women per arm, because one initially enrolled study center did not conduct the study. Second, all the outcome measures on smoking cessation and PA were self-reported, even though self-reports are considered a low-cost approach to obtaining sufficiently accurate information on tobacco use and PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Third, participants were more likely to be in the preparation stage of change for smoking cessation than non-recruited smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This high prevalence of participants in the preparation stage of change could have determined a higher than expected cessation rate in the control group. In fact, cessation probabilities among Italian women aged 30&#x02013;59 years was about 3.1%-3.7% in 2000&#x02013;2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], almost the half of that recorded in the control group (about 7%). This could have determined an underestimation of the effect of the intervention. Fourth, we were not able to monitor the different intensity of counselling on PA or smoking cessation according to the motivational stages of change, even though midwives were trained in order to deliver different intensity of counseling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Smoking cessation counselling delivered by midwives to smokers in preparation and contemplation stages of change during the Pap-smear screening was effective and should be extended to all the outpatient cervical cancer screening centers, given the high number of women attending the cervical cancer screening programme in Italy. It should also be recommended that the daily number of invited women for the Pap-smear examination should be slightly lowered, in order to let midwives deliver smoking cessation counselling to smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>GG participated in the design and analysis of the study, and draft the manuscript.
