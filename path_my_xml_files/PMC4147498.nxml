Hyperlipidaemia is a term used to denote raised serum levels of cholesterol or triglycerides or both. Raised cholesterol is estimated to cause 18% of the global cerebrovascular disease and 56% of global ischemic heart disease. Overall this amounts to about 4.4 million deaths (7.9% of total) annually. Raised total cholesterol is a major cause of disease burden in both the developed and developing world as a risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Every 1% decrease in cholesterol decreases CHD risk by 2.5%.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>Randomized single group, single intervention observational study of sample size: 30. Assessment was done based on lipid profile values pre and post treatment. One tab &#x0201c;Amritadya Guggulu&#x0201d;, 475mg TID with water, after food, for a period 30 days. Follow up was taken on 31st day.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>After treatment S.Cholesterol showed an average of 21.96% decrease, On S.LDL at an average of 30.47% decrease, On S.VLDL average of 20.77% decrease, S. TRIGLYCERIDES average of 26.32% decrease at p&#x0003c;0.001 respectively. S.HDL showed an average of 1.40% increase at p&#x0003e;0.5. 60% of patients had an average increase in S.HDL by 9.27% and 28.30% decrease in other parameters, however 40% of patients had an average decrease of 8.62% and 23.01% decrease in other parameters in S.HDL.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Amritadya guggulu has given significant result on elevated lipid profile, even though it has decreased S.HDL in minority patients, the change may be corrected, subject to lifestyle changes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
