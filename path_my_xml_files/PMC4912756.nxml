We developed the CB Back Skills Training programme (BeST) and previously provided evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness in a large pragmatic trial. However, practice change is challenged by a lack of treatment guidance and training for clinicians. We aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of an online programme (iBeST) for providing training in a CB approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This mixed methods study comprised an individually randomised controlled trial of 35 physiotherapists and an interview study of 8 physiotherapists. Participants were recruited from 8 National Health Service departments in England and allocated by a computer generated randomisation list to receive iBeST (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) or a face-to-face workshop (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19). Knowledge (of a CB approach), clinical skills (unblinded assessment of CB skills in practice), self-efficacy (reported confidence in using new skills), attitudes (towards LBP management), and satisfaction were assessed after training. Engagement with iBeST was assessed with user analytics. Interviews explored acceptability and experiences with iBeST. Data sets were analysed independently and jointly interpreted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifteen (94&#x000a0;%) participants in the iBeST group and 16 (84&#x000a0;%) participants in the workshop group provided data immediately after training. We observed similar scores on knowledge (MD (95 % CI): 0.97 (&#x02212;1.33, 3.26)), and self-efficacy to deliver the majority of the programme (MD (95 % CI) 0.25 (&#x02212;1.7; 0.7)). However, the workshop group showed greater reduction in biomedical attitudes to LBP management (MD (95 % CI): &#x02212;7.43 (&#x02212;10.97, &#x02212;3.89)). Clinical skills were assessed in 5 (33&#x000a0;%) iBeST participants and 7 (38&#x000a0;%) workshop participants within 6&#x000a0;months of training and were&#x000a0;similar between groups (MD (95 % CI): 0.17(&#x02212;0.2; 0.54)). Interviews highlighted that while initially sceptical, participants found iBeST acceptable. A number of strategies were identified to enhance future versions of iBeST such as including more skills practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Combined quantitative and qualitative data indicated that online training was an acceptable and promising method for providing training in an evidence based complex intervention. With future enhancement, the potential reach of this training method may facilitate evidence-based practice through large scale upskilling of the workforce.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN82203145?q=ISRCTN82203145&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=1&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN82203145</ext-link> (registered prospectively on 03.09.2012).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12909-016-0683-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Cognitive behavioural</kwd><kwd>Online training</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Dissemination</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Mixed methods</kwd><kwd>E-learning</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based practice</kwd><kwd>Psychological</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>West Midlands Strategic Health Authority</institution></funding-source><award-id>SG/HJ/NMAHP RTF/10/03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richmond</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Oxford</institution></funding-source><award-id>n/a</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>Sarah E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the largest challenges facing public health systems in the western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cognitive behavioural (CB) approaches are recommended for the management of non-specific LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The 2009 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for non-specific LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] fell short of making strong recommendations for a CB approach due to a lack of evidence. However, since the publication of the NICE guidance an additional eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have reported effect sizes that support use of a CB approach to manage LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, it is now widely accepted that LBP should be managed with a programme that utilises a CB approach. Moreover, the UK National Spinal Taskforce has identified the provision of such programmes to be the most serious gap in current LBP service provision that should be urgently addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Implementing new evidence-based approaches to care often requires clinicians to learn new skills and change their consultation behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For allied health professionals, this means learning how to use a CB approach in clinical practice such as the optimal dosage, delivery mode, and combination of treatment components. Addressing this, the CB Back Skills Training programme (BeST) follows a set structure and provides clinicians with detailed guidance in a manual about how to deliver a group-based programme to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. BeST is underpinned by the broad CB approach literature and provides an evidence based approach in sufficient detail to allow implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the original pragmatic trial, we provided a 2-day face-to-face training workshop, along with a detailed manual and materials to support the programme sessions. We are now seeking to achieve wide-scale implementation beyond the pragmatic trial in which it was initially evaluated.</p><p>This translation and implementation of research products into the clinical setting provides a number of challenges for researchers. Research teams are often small, and providing an implementation strategy scalable to national and international demand, without the financial underpinning provided by research grants, is almost impossible. Hence, we have developed an online training programme (iBeST) to disseminate BeST materials and provide training in a CB approach. This scalable method places less demand on resources, is not geographically constrained, and offers greater flexibility to the learner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, due to a paucity of research on the use of online methods for delivering training in psychologically informed treatments to allied health professionals, the feasibility and acceptability of this method needed to be explored as part of a staged implementation plan toward providing national and international access to the BeST training and intervention materials.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim/Objectives</title><p>In line with the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s guidance for the development of complex interventions, this study aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of training physiotherapists with iBeST prior to a larger scale evaluation of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, using a face-to-face workshop as a gold-standard reference, we wanted to explore the potential effect of iBeST on learning outcomes, as well as ascertaining physiotherapists&#x02019; acceptance of and satisfaction with iBeST. Secondary objectives included examining physiotherapists&#x02019; use of and experiences with iBeST and monitoring uptake of a CB approach (BeST) in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>A mixed methods evaluation, consisting of an exploratory randomised controlled trial and individual semi-structured interviews, was conducted between May 2013 and December 2013. Ethical and governance approval was granted from the University of Warwick&#x02019;s Biomedical and Scientific Research Ethics Committee (reference number 244-10-2012).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were volunteers that responded to a substantial email request distributed through research network mailing lists and managerial staff in NHS Trusts. While the BeST programme can be delivered by nursing, allied health, and psychological professions, we concentrated on physiotherapists since they provide the majority of LBP care in the UK NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Eligible participants were NHS physiotherapists managing a LBP patient caseload, based in Warwickshire or neighbouring counties, with access to the Internet. We did not exclude participants based on any prior training or current practice behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Brief description of the BeST programme</title><p>The BeST programme is underpinned by a CB approach and consists of an initial individual session of 60&#x000a0;min, and six group sessions of 90&#x000a0;min with 5 to 10 patients per group. It uses patient-specific needs to guide goal setting and treatment planning. It provides education about persistent pain, the importance of regular exercise, the relationship between activity levels and pain, and the role of unhelpful thoughts and behaviours in the maintenance of LBP. It teaches patients a range of skills including problem solving, goal setting, baseline setting, relaxation, thought challenging, planning for flare ups, activity pacing, and activity progression. Additionally, patients collaboratively negotiate a tailored exercise programme to do at home. Each group session follows the same structure, and begins with agenda setting and a review of homework, covers 1&#x02013;2 session topics, has a 10&#x000a0;min break halfway through, and ends with homework setting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The randomised controlled trial (Current controlled trials ISRCTN82203145)</title><p>Participants giving their informed consent were randomised to receive iBeST or a face-to-face workshop according to a computer generated random number sequence that was stratified by centre. The allocation sequence was concealed in sealed opaque envelopes and was held offsite and administered by an external, independent researcher. Participant blinding was not possible due to the nature of the interventions.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Description of interventions</title><p>Apart from the mode of delivery, we took care to ensure that both training methods were the same, including: the knowledge content, skills training, and training resources (therapist manual, session narratives and crib sheets, patient workbook, and additional information sources).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Face-to-face workshop</title><p>Participants randomised to the workshop attended for two days of face-to-face training, replicated from the original BeST trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], at the University of Warwick in May 2013. In brief, the training consisted of PowerPoint presentations, video clips, role-play scenarios, discussion and feedback. Participants were issued with a training pack that contained all slides, the therapist manual, and patient workbook. They also had access to a website where they could download additional paperwork only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>iBeST</title><p>Development: iBeST content was produced in Adobe Captivate and hosted within the virtual learning environment, Moodle (Moodle.com, Perth, Australia). Constructivism, which states that learners actively construct knowledge through gaining understanding, and that new knowledge can only be built upon current understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], was the predominant theory underpinning the organisation of online content. Course features included self-directed reading, reflective practice, skill rehearsal, multiple-choice questions, formative tests with feedback, interactive exercises, a discussion forum, and multimedia. There were 10 core modules to complete.</p><p>Procedures: The course was designed to take an equivalent learning time to that of the workshop (10&#x000a0;h). Participants could pace the course to their own preference, and did not have to complete it over a set time (i.e., two days). Participants were emailed a username, password, and start-up guide. We requested that they completed the programme within 6-weeks, which was accessible 24&#x000a0;h/day. Following course completion, participants maintained programme access.</p><p>We encouraged participants in both groups to implement the BeST programme after completing the training; however, this was not enforced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Demographics</title><p>We collected baseline demographics, including gender, job title, time worked in profession, age range, degree of experience with a CB approach, and training preference before randomisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome measure timings</title><p>All outcomes, excluding the assessment of clinical skills, were collected from participants immediately after they had completed the training. For those in the workshop comparison, this meant completing questionnaires before leaving the workshop venue. For participants in the iBeST group, this meant completing the questionnaires online within one week of finishing all modules. Since an assessment of clinical skills required the participants to set-up the intervention in their clinical practice, we allowed a 6-month time frame from completing the training within which to set up the intervention. Thus, the exact time of assessment for this outcome post-training was variable for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Learning outcomes</title><p>We aimed to assess two aspects of knowledge: (i) theoretical Knowledge of CB approach and (ii) procedural knowledge of how to deliver a CB approach in clinical practice. Since no validated or specific questionnaire was available to assess this, we developed a bespoke multiple-choice questionnaire (scale 0&#x02013;31, lower score indicates lower knowledge). Questions to assess theoretical knowledge of a CB approach were derived from the background teaching of the training and focused on the CB model and its applications. To assess procedural knowledge, questions concerned how aspects of a CB approach could be delivered in relation to the BeST programme.</p><p>For participants who delivered a CB approach in clinical practice, we audio recorded a single treatment session and assessed clinical skills with the 15-item Cognitive Therapy Scale-Revised-Pain (CTS-R-Pain; scale 0&#x02013;6, lower score indicates lower skill level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This tool has been specifically modified to measure competency in the use of a CB approach among non-psychology specialists. Hansen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found the tool to have high internal consistency (Cronbachs &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99) and good inter and intra-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient for intra-rater reliability&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92 (0.79; 0.97). One rater (unblinded) with training in a CB approach (HR) scored all recordings and a senior blinded rater with comprehensive experience in a CB approach (ZH) doubly assessed 25&#x000a0;% of recordings.</p><p>In addition to assessing knowledge and clinical skills, we assessed participants&#x02019; attitudes, self-efficacy, and satisfaction as recommended in Kirkpatrick&#x02019;s training evaluation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Attitudes and beliefs towards the management of persistent LBP were assessed pre and post training with the 31-item Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT). The use of a CB approach aligns itself with psychosocial attitudes and beliefs towards the management of LBP. The PABS-PT is well validated and has two subscales: biomedical (includes 14 items) and psychosocial (includes 6 items) which are rated with a Likert scale (range 1&#x02013;5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A lower score on the biomedical scale indicates lower biomedical orientation and a lower score on the psychosocial scale indicates lower psychosocial orientation. Self-efficacy to deliver the (i) single BeST individual and (ii) six group sessions was assessed with two Likert scales (scale 0&#x02013;10, lower score indicates lower self-efficacy). The six group sessions formed the majority of the BeST programme. We assessed training satisfaction (acceptability) with a custom single-item measure (scale: 1&#x02013;5, lower score indicates lower satisfaction).</p><p>To assess therapist&#x02019;s engagement with&#x000a0;the iBeST programme we examined the number of training slides visited, the time spent on each slide, and the number of resources (links/downloads) accessed (score range: 1&#x02013;3; 3 indicated higher engagement). To interpret the scores we labelled participants who scored in the upper tertile of engagement scores as having higher engagement. Use of the BeST programme in practice was assessed by whether the participant implemented the BeST programme within a 6&#x000a0;month timeframe in their clinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample size</title><p>This study aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of iBeST. Sample sizes of 24&#x02013;50 participants have been recommended for assessing the feasibility of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we considered a sample size of 30 participants to be sufficient to explore the feasibility and the potential effect of iBeST on learning outcomes. Allowing for a 15&#x000a0;% drop out rate, a total of 35 physiotherapists were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used the equivalent of intention to treat analysis, including all eligible randomised participants who provided follow up data. For continuous outcomes, between group differences were explored using the Students <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mean change in PABS-PT scores were adjusted to account for baseline score using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Effect sizes were calculated with Hedges&#x02019; g with adjustment for small sample bias. Categorical outcomes were analysed using Fishers exact test for association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 and all effect estimates were provided with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Descriptive statistics were used to report learner analytics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Exploratory analyses</title><p>Evidence suggests that training preference may impact on user engagement and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, in a pre-specified sub group analysis we stratified our results according to training preference (received preference/had no preference versus did not receive preference). Additionally, we explored whether engagement with iBeST impacted on learning (higher engagement versus all others). Analyses were summarised descriptively (mean and standard deviation) and were not subject to statistical testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>The interview study</title><p>Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were completed with iBeST-trained physiotherapists to explore their experiences of using iBeST. We aimed to interview all participants trained with iBeST in the RCT (=16).</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>The interview guide</title><p>The initial interview guide was informed by two recent systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and a theoretical framework of online learning strategies to enhance health care professionals learning experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The guide was modified as the analysis of interviews progressed to ensure it was responsive to the data and to enable exploration of emerging themes. One researcher (HR) completed all interviews, which were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and anonymised for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Interview data analysis</title><p>Interview transcripts were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis drawing upon constructivist grounded theory (open coding and constant comparison). Open coding identified the range of concepts used by participants and resulted in categories, ensuring identified themes were grounded in the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Constant comparison and close attention to deviant cases facilitated assessment of relationships between categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Transcripts were coded by the lead author (HR) and emerging codes were discussed with a senior researcher (EW), who independently coded three transcripts.</p><p>During analysis it became apparent that data relating to theme three (training impact) were congruent with Kirkpatrick&#x02019;s training evaluation model, so we considered and contextualised this theme in relation to this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data integration</title><p>Integration of both quantitative and qualitative data is often cited as the heart of mixed methods research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Both data sets were analysed concurrently, independently of each other, and were jointly interpreted. After assessing complementarity of the data sets, qualitative data was used to illuminate and expand upon quantitative outcomes to achieve a more comprehensive and meaningful understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of iBeST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>RCT findings</title><p>A minimum of 235 health care professionals received the study advertisement through research network mailing lists (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;220), and direct contact with NHS Trust physiotherapy managers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15). From which, 58 responded and 35 were recruited into this study from 8 NHS Hospital Trusts, and were subsequently randomised to receive iBeST (16 therapists) or a face-to-face workshop (19 therapists).

Eighty-nine percent of participants completed training and provided follow up data (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31; iBeST: 15/16; workshop: 16/19). Twelve (34&#x000a0;%) therapists implemented the BeST programme in practice and thus, were able to provide data for the clinical skills assessment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Randomised controlled trial participant flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12909_2016_683_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>While the workshop group had a higher proportion of males, all remaining baseline characteristics from the randomised sample were broadly similar (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although preferences for face-to-face training were well matched across the groups, there were small differences in those with no preference and with an online preference. However, the overall small sample size makes these difficult to evaluate. Additionally, due to the small numbers in some of the cells, for example &#x02018;Training in CBT (answer: no)&#x02019;, a difference of one person between the groups makes the proportion appear higher.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of participants by allocation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Category</th><th>Workshop</th><th>iBeST</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><th>

Externally, barriers included technical difficulties in gaining access to the online training programme due to out of date web browsing software on NHS Trust computers, distractions when working in the home environment, and trying to prioritise the training over other aspects of their work load. Internal barriers included sitting for long periods, self-discipline not to skip sections and &#x02018;cheat&#x02019;, lone working without the capacity for any face-to-face discussion, concentration on a computer screen, and their openness to change. For example, participant #337 noted that you could <italic>&#x0201c;take quite a lot of shortcuts&#x0201d;</italic> with an online course, skipping the course content and <italic>&#x0201c;going straight to the test&#x0201d;</italic>.

For example, participant #337 spoke about use of a facilitative delivery style<italic>:</italic><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I think that&#x02019;s certainly made me think about it differently, starting to think, &#x0201c;Well, these are the exercises we&#x02019;d maybe like to do, but it&#x02019;s up to you to choose where to start,&#x0201d; and I like that side of it.&#x0201d;</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>Participants reported varying degrees of self-efficacy to deliver the BeST programme.

For example, discussing this topic, participant #289 said: <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;it was obvious I was rubbish at it&#x02026;and even once I knew I was wrong, I couldn&#x02019;t necessarily see why.&#x0201d;</italic></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec40"><title>Interpretation of results</title><p>This is the first study to explore an online method to build competency in physiotherapists&#x02019; use of a CB approach. Mixed methodology enabled us to not only quantify how iBeST performed across a range of learning outcomes; it also provided insight into contextual and unanticipated experiences, captured through interviews. This study did not find large or important differences in outcomes of knowledge and clinical skills, thus suggesting that iBeST may provide sufficient knowledge and skills training to deliver the BeST programme. However, we did observe large changes in attitudes towards the management of LBP among participants in the workshop group, which were not replicated by those trained with iBeST. Importantly, while participants that trained with iBeST were not as highly satisfied as those in the workshop, the majority were still satisfied and found the training method acceptable, providing evidence for the continued use of iBeST. Through integration of qualitative and quantitative methods, we identified strategies that could enhance future versions of iBeST. In particular, we identified strategies that may help to (i) improve user satisfaction and engagement, (ii) improve self-efficacy to use a CB approach, and (iii) achieve a greater change in attitudes and beliefs similar to that observed in the face-to-face workshop.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Findings in relation to the literature</title><p>The similar results on knowledge and skills between both training methods are in line with the largest systematic review to date in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which reported that online methods were equally effective to alternate forms of training for these outcomes across different health care professions and settings. Further, there has been a growing body of evidence advocating online training as a comparable, if not superior, method for delivering training to health professionals in complex interventions. For example, Dimeff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] randomised 150 psychologists to receive either a written manual, an online course, or a face-to-face workshop in Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. The online training resulted in a statistically significant greater gain in knowledge, with no other difference between the online and face-to-face training, and with both of these methods outperforming the manual. Similarly, Maloney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of online versus face-to-face training for the prescription of falls prevention exercise. They classified this as a complex intervention since it incorporated a broad range of practical skills including decision making, hands-on skills, and high-level communication. They randomised a range of health care professionals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;135) to the two training arms, and found no differences between the two groups, reporting comparable satisfaction, knowledge scores, and self-reported changes in clinical practice.</p><p>With regards to learner engagement, literature suggests that more engaged users achieve better learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our pragmatic division of engagement scores also support this basic learning principle. This study expands current knowledge concerning engagement of users, identifying barriers to engagement such as prioritising training (due to increased flexibility) and self-discipline that are applicable to all authors of online materials. In addition to the influence of these identified factors on engagement, the presence of face-to-face training itself may have influenced engagement and satisfaction with iBeST among learners perceiving the workshop to be more useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Limitations</title><p>This feasibility study is limited by its small sample, particularly for the assessment of clinical skills, and while the statistical results give an indication of potential effect, the study was not powered to determine effectiveness. Additionally, the small sample size makes it challenging to confirm that randomisation resulted in a random distribution across the groups. However, the randomisation procedure was implemented without difficulty and there was no evidence of subversion. Therefore, the quantitative results should be interpreted cautiously in the context that this feasibility study provides initial data from which to enhance and further evaluate iBeST. Another limitation is that the assessment of clinical skills from audio recordings was conducted by a unblinded rater. However, to reduce potential bias, 25&#x000a0;% of recordings were doubly assessed using a blinded rater. Similar to other learning courses, the knowledge test was bespoke and, while we assessed face validity with experts in the field, other clinometric properties are not known. Lastly, uptake of the BeST programme in clinical practice was low in both groups, indicating that both forms of training were not adequate to support use in practice in their current format. However, since implementation was not specifically targeted and was simply observed, we think it was encouraging to see at least a third of participants in both groups adopting it in clinical practice.</p><p>With respect to the interview study, we used a volunteer sample that may not have been fully representative of the whole sample as our data suggested that the included volunteers were more engaged with the online programme than those declining to take part. Additionally, all interviewees were female, reducing the representativeness of the sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Implications and future work</title><p>The results from this evaluation suggest that online learning is a feasible and acceptable method for providing training on a large scale in evidence-based complex interventions such as the BeST programme. The mixed methods employed in this study identified areas where iBeST needs to be enhanced, and a relevant user group (physiotherapists) provided information on how it could be improved. In particular, qualitative data identified that expansion of education on specific cognitive-behavioural elements and inclusion of more skills-based practice would improve therapists&#x02019; self-efficacy and satisfaction. This finding is consistent with one of the only studies to explore physiotherapists&#x02019; use of a CB approach in clinical practice, which found that despite a 4-day face-to-face workshop with ongoing mentorship, physiotherapists had difficulties adopting some cognitive behavioural aspects of a CB approach programme for patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These results highlight the need to improve upon current strategies for teaching and supporting physiotherapists to deliver a CB approach regardless of training method.</p><p>Future work should refine and further evaluate iBeST based on feedback from participants in this study. Additionally, evidence-based implementation strategies should be explored to ascertain how iBeST can be enhanced to support implementation and maximise its impact on clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This evaluation suggests that iBeST is a viable option for widespread dissemination of the BeST training and programme materials that warrants further refinement and evaluation. Using mixed methods enabled us to identify and explore key areas of iBeST that need enhancing. In recognition of the urgent need to manage LBP with CB approach, iBeST provides a promising avenue for building competency on a large scale in physiotherapists&#x02019; management of LBP to tackle this growing public health concern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CB, cognitive behavioural; CI, confidence interval; Hr, hours; LBP, low back pain; MD, mean difference; Mm, minutes; NHS, National Health Service; NICE, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence; PABS-PT, Pain, Attitudes, and Beliefs scale for Physiotherapists; RCT, randomised controlled trial; UK, United Kingdom</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec50"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12909_2016_683_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Randomised controlled trial baseline dataset.pdf.
