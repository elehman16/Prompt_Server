Concomitant daily administration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was used in chronically infected patients with lipodystrophy in an attempt to reconstitute these virus-specific T-cell responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection on HAART were enrolled on a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to receive rhGH therapy. We assessed HIV-1-specific proliferative CD4<sup>+ </sup>and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;)-producing CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses, quantified thymic output and proviral HIV-1 DNA at the following time points: baseline; after 12 weeks of rhGH therapy; at 24 weeks, after randomization into three groups [placebo weeks 12&#x02013;24 (Group A), alternate-day dosing weeks 12&#x02013;24 (Group B), and twice-per-week dosing weeks 12&#x02013;24 (Group C)]; and at 48 weeks after all patients had received HAART alone for the final 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found significant increases in both proliferative CD4<sup>+ </sup>and IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+ </sup>HIV-1-specific T-cell responses after daily administration of rhGH. This increase was focused on HIV-1 Gag-specific T-cell responses. Following subsequent randomisation into different dosing regimens, HIV-1-specific proliferative CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses declined in patients receiving less frequent dosing of rhGH, while virus-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses were maintained for longer periods of time. There was no significant change in thymic output and the cell-associated HIV-1 DNA remained stable in most patients. An increased anti-HIV-1 Nef-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell proliferative response was correlated to a decrease in proviral load, and an increased HIV-1 Gag-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell response correlated with an increase in proviral load.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The implication of these data is that daily dosing of rhGH with HAART, in addition to improving HIV-1-associated lipodystrophy, may reverse some of the T-lymphocyte dysfunction seen in most treated HIV-1-positive patients, in a dose-dependent manner. Such immune-based therapeutic strategies used in treated, chronic HIV-1 infection may enable the induction of virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells essential for the subsequent 'kick-start' and expansion of virus-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>GH in Lipoatrophy IMP22350.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Infection with HIV-1 causes a severe down-regulation of virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells that is not restored upon treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The aims of immune-based therapeutic interventions in the presence of HAART are to deplete viral burden in cellular reservoirs, to induce and maintain virus-specific responses, and to facilitate regeneration of the immune system; thereby allowing the HIV-1-infected individual to control viral replication and opportunistic pathogens in the absence of drug therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One candidate molecule to include as part of such an intervention is growth hormone (GH). GH exerts stimulatory effects on different cells of the immune system, mediated either directly or indirectly through insulin-like growth factor-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and has implications in T-lymphocyte development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This suggests a role for recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) as a possible immunomodulatory therapy, complimentary to the benefits of effective antiretroviral drug therapy, for HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, studies in both HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents with lipodystrophy show impaired GH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The use of rhGH for the treatment of HIV-1-associated wasting syndrome demonstrates its suitability for routine clinical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The generation of fully functional virus-specific peripheral CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes in treated chronic HIV-1 infection is of considerable importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and may be critical for enabling control of viral activity and retarding disease progression in persistent HIV-1 infection in the presence of, and possibly following subsequent removal of, HAART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The success of immune-based therapies will depend on full restoration of numbers and function of the CD4<sup>+ </sup>helper T lymphocytes (HTL), antigen presenting cells (APC) and CD8<sup>+ </sup>cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) at all stages of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although successful induction of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses has been observed with various immunotherapeutic approaches in the presence of HAART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the major drawback has been that such responses were transient; indicating that eradication of virus presents a difficult therapeutic goal. Generation of activated virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL, which may be preferentially targeted by HIV-1, also presents the risk of <italic>de novo </italic>infection and clonal deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore the adverse effects of HIV-1 should be taken into account when immunotherapy is used to induce such responses. Nevertheless, induction of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in HIV-1-positive individuals comparable to those observed in long-term nonprogressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], remains of paramount concern.</p><p>We assessed changes in T-lymphocyte function (proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; production), thymic output and proviral HIV-1 DNA in twelve HIV-1 infected individuals on long-term successful HAART who received rhGH therapy for lipodystrophy. Our data provide evidence that daily administration of rhGH for 12 weeks dramatically increased HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL and CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL responses. This was reflected by an expansion in HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL proliferative responses directed to Gag, as well as to the HIV-1 immunogen Remune&#x02122;, and its 'native' p24. Responses to recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs and overlapping peptides spanning the HIV-1 proteins Gag and Pol were carried out using IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot analysis to characterise HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL responses. Whilst reduction in dosing over a further 12 weeks resulted in the loss of virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL, the virus-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL responses seen at week 12 were sustained by week 24, and gradually declined by week 48. Levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and proviral DNA remained constant throughout in the majority of patients. Increases in proviral DNA were observed in only 3/12 patients. An increased anti-Nef proliferative response was correlated to a decrease in proviral load, and an increased anti-rVV Gag IFN-&#x003b3; response correlated with an increase in proviral load, suggesting that administration of rhGH with HAART may partially reverse some of the damage exerted on the immune system by HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects and samples</title><p>Blood samples were taken from twelve HIV-1 infected patients with lipodystrophy receiving HAART (9 on NNRTI and 3 on PI based regimens) for &#x0003e;4 years. Mean age &#x000b1; sem was 43.4 &#x000b1; 2.1 years, viral load was undetectable in 83% (10/12) of patients, and absolute mean &#x000b1; sem CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell counts were 478.4 &#x000b1; 55.6 cells/&#x003bc;l and 1020.0 &#x000b1; 15.6 cells/&#x003bc;l blood respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). rhGH was administered to all patients for 12 weeks at 4 mg/day (Serostim, Serono International, Geneva, Switzerland). This was followed by randomisation into three groups: (A) receiving placebo, (B) alternate-day dosing, or (C) twice-per-week dosing of rhGH which continued for a further 12 weeks (i.e. week 24 of the study); after which patients went back to receiving HAART alone (no immunotherapy). Thus samples were collected at baseline, weeks 12 and 24 of the study plus a follow up visit at week 48 from the start of the study. The patients' informed consent and Ethics Committee approval were obtained for the studies described.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma viral RNA assay</title><p>Viral load in patient plasma was measured at each time point of sample collection using the Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 branched DNA assay (lower detection limit of 50 copies/ml plasma, Siemens Healthcare, Camberley, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies, flow cytometry and lymphocyte subset quantification</title><p>Murine, anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD45 (TetraOne, Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) were used to mark lymphocyte subsets within whole blood and then evaluated using a Cytomics FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and Tetra CXP (version 2.2) software.</p></sec><sec><title>HIV-1 antigens, peptides and recombinant vaccinia vectors (rVV)</title><p>HIV-1 recombinant antigens and peptides were obtained from the Medical Research Council Centralised Facility for AIDS Reagents (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK), and used as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Cells were cultured with antigen at final concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. In addition, the inactivated, gp120 depleted, HIV-1 immunogen (Remune&#x02122;), and its constituent Gag-p24 antigen ('native' p24: clade G) (both from Immune Response Corp. Carlsbad, San Diego, CA) were used at 3 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The 22 Gag p24 peptides were 20-mers with a 10 amino acid (aa) overlap covering p24 Gag (aa 133&#x02013;363 of HIV-1 SF2, ARP 788.1-.22), and were used in a pool of 22 at a final concentration of 4 &#x003bc;g/ml each. The 110 Pol reverse transcriptase (RT) peptides were 15-mers with a 10 aa overlap covering RT (HIV-1 LAI, ARP 7010.1-.110), and were used at a final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml each in a pool of 110. The recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Rockville, MD, USA) and from the MRC AIDS reagent project (NIBSC) and encoded Gag, Pol or PB2 (influenza A virus basic polymerase 2 subunit (generous gift of G.

Antigens, mitogens and cytokines were used as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On day 5, each well was pulsed with 1 &#x003bc;Ci <sup>3</sup>H-methyl thymidine (<sup>3</sup>H-TdR; Amersham International, Amersham UK) and 16 hours later cells were harvested onto glass fibre filtermats (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Proliferation, as measured by <sup>3</sup>H-TdR incorporation, was evaluated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a 1205 Betaplate counter (Wallac). Control wells, for calculation of background activity, contained PBMC only. Results are expressed as stimulation index (SI) scores, which were evaluated as the experimental result divided by the background result. A positive response is defined as an SI score of 5 or more.</p></sec><sec><title>Overlapping-peptide based ELISpot assay for enumeration of IFN&#x003b3;-producing virus-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells</title><p>PBMC at 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well were added to 96 well polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) backed plates (MAIP S45; Millipore, Bedford, MA) that were previously coated with 100 &#x003bc;l of anti-IFN-&#x003b3; mAb 1-D1k (10 &#x003bc;g/ml; Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

We evaluated T-cell responses to HIV-1, and to other viral and recall antigens, at baseline; after 12 weeks of daily administration of rhGH therapy (4 mg/day subcutaneously); at 24 weeks after randomisation into three groups: (A) placebo (B) alternate-day dosing (C) twice-per-week dosing for weeks 12&#x02013;24; and at week 48 when all patients had received HAART alone (no immunotherapy) for the final 24 weeks of the study. Patient characteristics at baseline, weeks 12, 24 and 48 are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Baseline viral load was undetectable in 10/12 patients and mean &#x000b1; sem CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell count was 478.4 &#x000b1; 55.6 cells/&#x003bc;l of blood and throughout the study viral load remained detectable in only one patient, whilst CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell counts remained unchanged in all patients. CD4<sup>+ </sup>HIV-1-specific HTL responses were measured using the conventional lymphoproliferative assay, whilst CD8<sup>+ </sup>HIV-1-specific CTL responses were measured by ELISpot assays using pools of overlapping peptides and rVV constructs.</p><p>While patients maintained a stable population of cells, at baseline a complete lack of both CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>HIV-1-specific T-cell responses was noted in 11 of 12 individuals. After 12 weeks of daily immunotherapy with rhGH in the presence of HAART there was a significant increase in HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell proliferative responses; anti-recombinant p24 p = 0.0059, anti-native p24 p = 0.0140, anti-Remune immunogen p = 0.0090 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This increase was focused on Gag-specific and whole HIV-1 antigen (Remune)-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses which were positive in 9 of 12 of these patients. CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell counts and viral load remained statistically unchanged (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTLs were not maintained at week 24, with less frequent dosing of rhGH, and became undetectable in the majority of patients by 48-week follow up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Daily administration of rhGH immunotherapy with HAART had no effect on pre-existing CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-lymphocyte responses to Flu, CMV, PPD or Can antigens, which was illustrated by the consistent responses directed at these viral and recall antigens throughout the course of study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Lymphoproliferative responses to VZV and TTox were significantly increased upon daily administration of rhGH immunotherapy between time point 0 and 12 weeks (p = 0.0355 and p = 0.0078 respectively; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). High levels of lymphoproliferative responses to herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens were observed at baseline and week 12, which were significantly higher than the responses at week 24 where the responses in all but one patient were negative (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0059 respectively). Anti-HSV responses correlated with clinical manifestations; despite the absence of active herpetic lesions at time of admission, 9/12 patients in the cohort had previous history of herpetic manifestations/complications, accounting for the strong anti-HSV lymphocyte responses observed at baseline and week 12.

There was no significant change in thymic output, proviral load, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell count or plasma viral load as a result of daily rhGH administration in conjunction with HAART up to week 12, or throughout the entire course of the study when dosing was altered according to group. An increased anti-Nef proliferative response was correlated to a decrease in proviral load, and an increased anti-rVV Gag IFN-&#x003b3; response correlated with an increase in proviral load.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL and CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL responses have been shown to inversely correlate with viral replication and disease progression in long-term nonprogressors and protection from productive infection in HIV-1-infected and exposed seronegative individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Studies in mice have confirmed that dysfunction of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells affects the efficacy of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in controlling viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This forms the basis of understanding HIV-1 immunopathogenesis, as well as providing the rationale for the design of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at inducing virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses, in chronic HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Here we assessed the effects of rhGH therapy on the immune system of chronically HIV-1-infected individuals, in the context of long-term successful HAART. Significant increases in both CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>HIV-1-specific T-lymphocyte responses observed after 12 weeks of daily injections of rhGH, concomitantly with HAART, suggest that this combination appears to boost both immune reconstitution and HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in the absence of viral load. This dramatic effect appeared to be particularly focused on HIV-1-specific immunity, as the CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL responses to other viral and recall antigens, mitogens and IL-2 were largely unaffected. Statistically significant increases in anti-VZV and -TTox responses were observed, however only 3/12 individuals (anti-VZV) and 5/12 individuals (TTox) exhibited emergence of positive proliferative responses above threshold after receiving rhGH therapy, where the response had been negative at baseline. Significant changes in HSV responses correlate with clinical manifestations, however no significant differences were observed between baseline and week 12. We suggest that, when added to HAART, rhGH immunotherapy may target HIV-1-specific responses because these responses are defective in ways which recall responses are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Hence rhGH plays a role in resolving the specific defect restricted to HIV-1-specific T cells.</p><p>Randomisation of patients into placebo, alternate day dosing or twice weekly dosing at week 12, resulted in a decline in HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses which occurred in all patients by week 24, which was also apparent at week 48. However, increases in HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses seen at week 12 were more durable as these were maintained by week 24 regardless of randomisation, and despite the apparent disappearance of HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses. At week 48, after patients had received HAART alone (no immunotherapy) for the final 24 weeks of the study, HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses specific to Pol were still above positive threshold for most patients, whereas responses to other HIV-1 antigens had diminished and HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses remained undetectable.</p><p>TREC levels remained unchanged indicating invariable thymic output or alternatively sjTREC levels may reflect increased division rate of na&#x000ef;ve T cells as a result of rhGH-induced activation. Previous observations of lower levels of sjTRECs (per 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>PBMC) in chronic progressors may not be entirely due to a reduction in thymic function but could be affected by dilution of sjTRECs as a result of immune hyperactivation-induced proliferation in these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Assessment of both sjTRECs and &#x003b2;TRECs provides an indication of the extent of intrathymic proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], which determines the thymic output of na&#x000ef;ve T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, the analysis of ratios in these studies has confirmed that sjTREC levels are a good indication of thymic output, and are not hugely influenced by proliferation in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>These changes were accompanied by an unexpected notable increase in proviral HIV-1 DNA in 3/12 patients by week 24, which was maintained in only one of the patients tested at week 48. There was a negative correlation observed between the change in anti-Nef proliferative T-cell responses and the change in levels of proviral DNA between weeks 0 and 12. This suggests that targeting HIV-1 Nef with a proliferative T-cell response decreases the amount of proviral DNA/&#x003bc;g total DNA, reducing the number of infected cells/HIV-1 genome copy number per infected cell. A positive correlation was observed between the changes in anti-rVV Gag IFN-&#x003b3; response and change in proviral DNA levels. Increased breadth and level of anti-HIV-1 Gag IFN-&#x003b3; responses have previously been shown to be associated with a decrease in plasma viraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], however the effect of anti-Gag IFN-&#x003b3; responses on the level of proviral DNA has not yet been so comprehensively investigated. A loss of response to Nef has previously been associated with increased opportunistic infection and viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We have also observed that a proliferative response to the regulatory HIV-1 protein Nef is preserved in a cohort of HIV controllers, compared to the absence observed in chronic progressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These findings, in conjunction with the correlation presented here, suggest Nef as a feasible and potentially rewarding target for future research into effective anti-HIV-1 immune responses.</p><p>Diminution of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses after daily rhGH was discontinued suggests that these cells may require stronger and/or constant signals from rhGH to recover and provide continuous help. CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses may be maintained for a limited period without CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], but may eventually decline following withdrawal of rhGH therapy. The absence of virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses, along with a decrease in specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses by week 48, may reflect exhaustion and/or lack of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell help to facilitate the complete function of effective HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is apparent that adequate HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell help, provided via immunomodulatory therapy with rhGH has 'kick-started' the appropriate effective anti-HIV-1 CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p><p>Alternatively, the increase in fully functional HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (despite constant CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell counts) may, in some cases, result in <italic>de novo </italic>preferential infection of these cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although this may suggest a risk in the increase of the viral reservoir due to infection of newly formed CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, it might also be indicative that rhGH induces elimination of HIV-1 from its reservoirs. The possible purgative effect of rhGH on HIV-1 from latent reservoirs may result in <italic>de novo </italic>cellular infections possibly accounting for some of the transient pattern of proliferative responses observed in virus-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell responses. This would in turn explain the consistent levels of proviral DNA seen throughout the study. However other explanations cannot be excluded as it is thought that the presence of HAART should prevent or at least minimise <italic>de novo </italic>infection of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p><p>We have previously observed an increase in na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, a significant increase in memory/effector CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, as well as recovery of natural killer (NK) cell numbers and function in the same study population of patients shown here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our findings provide novel insights and extend previous observations that daily injections of rhGH for treatment of HIV-1-associated lipodystrophy result in a good outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], as well as having beneficial effects on the immune system such as inducing thymocyte differentiation, improving function of lymphocytes, increasing thymic mass and directly affecting the thymic epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>It is, however, unlikely that rhGH mediates its effect by increasing antigenic load, since the induction of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses after 12 weeks of rhGH therapy was seen in all patients, despite the unchangeable levels in proviral DNA and undetectable viraemia. When considering the established mechanisms of action of rhGH, it is suggestive that some of the beneficial effects on both the developing thymocytes and thymic stroma may lead to emergence of new CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells with anti-HIV-1 potential (i.e. a broader T-cell repertoire). A hypothetical model of the potential effects of rhGH on peripheral lymphocyte dysregulation in HIV-1 infection should, however, also be considered, as it is possible that rhGH therapy reverses some of the negative effects on peripheral responses of PBMC. In this respect, beneficial effects in the periphery may be explained by the ability of rhGH to break the HIV-1-induced T-cell dysfunction/anergy.</p><p>Once again, and in a similar fashion to other therapeutic strategies in the HAART setting (i.e. treatment interruption, IL-2 +/- therapeutic immunisation, and IL-2+GM-CSF immunotherapy), removal of immuno- or in this case endocrino-therapy results in loss of induced anti-HIV-1 CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL in chronic HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Since plasma viral loads remained below the level of detection at all time points, infection of such CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL may be the result of very low levels of viral activity undetectable using current viral load assays (&#x0003c;50 copies/ml plasma). Theoretically, effective drug therapy should protect HIV-1-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL once they are induced, but this does not seem to be the case since they appear only transiently. Ongoing viral replication in lymph nodes (sanctuary sites, and other reservoirs) may affect the required function of CD4<sup>+ </sup>HTL needed to subsequently impact on the ability of virus-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>CTL to control HIV-1.</p><p>Endocrine and cytokine feedback mechanisms may be operational and act beyond the parameters of the immune system. Nevertheless this study underlines the importance of the neuro-endocrine-immunological axis and points out the possibility that hormonal intervention with rhGH might be associated with both <italic>de novo </italic>generation of T lymphocytes (due to increased thymic output) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] as well as increased function of HIV-1-specific T cells (due to restored differentiation/maturation pathways and reversal of anergic dysfunction). In summary, growth hormone immunotherapy and/or antigenic stimulation, concomitant with HAART, may in time induce na&#x000ef;ve T cells, IL-2 production and response, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell proliferation, as well as both induction and maintenance of HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. Larger clinical studies/trials are warranted to fully prove clinical value.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is known that loss of T-cell function occurs during HIV-1 infection.
