The IONDT was a multicenter study that included randomized and non-randomized patients with newly diagnosed NAION in the study eye. At baseline, randomized eyes had visual acuity of 20/64 or worse and non-randomized eyes had visual acuity of better than 20/64 or were associated with patients refusing randomization. Visual fields were measured before treatment using the Humphrey Field Analyzer with the 24-2 program, foveal threshold, and size III stimulus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used visual fields from 189 non-IONDT eyes with NAION to develop the computerized classification system. Six neuro-ophthalmologists ("expert panel") described definitions for visual field patterns defects using 19 visual fields representing a range of pattern defect types. The expert panel then used 120 visual fields, classified using these definitions, to refine the rules, generating revised definitions for 13 visual field pattern defects and 3 levels of severity. These definitions were incorporated into a rule-based computerized classification system run on Excel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>software. The computerized classification system was used to categorize visual field defects for an additional 95 NAION visual fields, and the expert panel was asked to independently classify the new fields and subsequently whether they agreed with the computer classification. To account for test variability over time, we derived an adjustment factor from the pooled short term fluctuation. We examined change in defects with and without adjustment in visual fields of study participants who demonstrated a visual acuity decrease within 30 days of NAION onset (progressive NAION).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Despite an agreed upon set of rules, there was not good agreement among the expert panel when their independent visual classifications were compared. A majority did concur with the computer classification for 91 of 95 visual fields. Remaining classification discrepancies could not be resolved without modifying existing definitions.</p><p>Without using the adjustment factor, visual fields of 63.6% (14/22) patients with progressive NAION and no central defect, and all (7/7) patients with a paracentral defect, worsened within 30 days of NAION onset. After applying the adjustment factor, the visual fields of the same patients with no initial central defect and 5/7 of the patients with a paracentral defect were seen to worsen.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The IONDT developed a rule-based computerized system that consistently defines pattern and severity of visual fields of NAION patients for use in a research setting.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) was a randomized clinical trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS) combined with careful follow-up for treatment of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), as well as to document the natural history of NAION [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Using visual acuity as the primary outcome measure, the IONDT demonstrated that ONDS is not effective and may be harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>For NAION, characterized clinically as causing visual field loss, conclusions about treatment efficacy and natural history based on visual acuity outcomes alone may be inadequate. For this reason, change in the visual field, as measured by the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HVF), was a planned secondary outcome in the IONDT. The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Zeiss Humphrey, San Leandro, Ca, USA) provides a standardized testing environment, quantitative assessment of threshold sensitivity to spots of light at fixed points throughout the visual field, and data regarding reliability of patients' responses.</p><p>In the IONDT, we found no difference between visual fields from ONDS and careful follow-up groups at 6 months using the HVF global measure, "mean deviation" (MD). However, MD by itself may be an insufficient measure for assessment of visual fields in eyes with NAION. For example, the classical patterns of defect encountered in NAION may shift without changing average loss or there may be important changes in sensitivity within small areas of the visual field corresponding to nerve fiber bundle defects. These changes in area or size may not be detected when averaged into the MD measure, warranting a more detailed analysis of the quantitative visual field testing.</p><p>Development and validation of a system for classifying and assessing change in visual fields is complex due to the lack of "gold standards". Glaucoma trials have utilized a number of approaches for evaluating progression, but the algorithms seldom include classifications based upon the defect type. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] Although the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) investigators categorized visual field defects, they did not use strict definitions for classification and patterns of field loss were qualitatively rather than quantitatively determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite a variety of anticipated challenges, in the IONDT we set out to develop a rule-based computerized system for classifying and analyzing visual fields. Our intent was to create logic-based computer algorithms that reliably reproduced the clinical classifications of visual field defects encountered in NAION so as to evaluate the IONDT visual fields. The computer algorithm is intended for use in a clinical research setting where standardization of classification is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>IONDT protocol</title><p>We have previously described the IONDT eligibility criteria, randomization procedure, and visit protocols in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Briefly, patients aged 50 years or older were eligible for randomization into surgical or careful follow-up groups if they had symptoms and signs characteristic of NAION for 14 days or less in one eye. Patients with visual acuity of 20/64 or less in the study eye comprised the "regular entry" group, while patients otherwise eligible but with visual acuity better than 20/64 were enrolled only if visual acuity decreased to 20/64 or worse within 30 days of onset of symptoms ("late entry" group). Patients with acuity better than 20/64 and otherwise eligible and patients who refused randomization were followed as part of a non-randomized group. Institutional review boards at participating institutions approved the protocol and all participating patients provided signed informed consent.</p><p>We completed visual field testing of study and non-study eyes of all enrolled patients at baseline, for both randomized and non-randomized eyes. In the IONDT, automated perimetry was performed by trained certified visual field technicians using the HVF, 24-2 program with stimulus size III, full threshold strategy, and with foveal sensitivity measured concurrently. Visual fields for the study eye were measured before those for the non-study eye. For randomized patients, visual fields were obtained at the baseline examination; if randomization took place more than 24 hours after baseline, visual fields were re-measured. Clinical Centers measured visual fields prospectively. For randomized patients, this was at the 3, 6, and 12-month visit, at study closeout (minimum of 5 years of follow-up), and at approximately annual intervals between the 12-month and closeout visits. Visual fields for non-randomized patients were obtained at the baseline examination, at either 6 or 12-month visit or both, closeout, and at approximately one-year intervals between the 12-month and closeout visits. All patients were followed for at least 5 years. Visual field data were evaluated as a secondary outcome measure and not utilized for decision-making during the conduct of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods used to develop the computerized visual field classification system</title><sec><title>Development of classification system</title><p>In 1994, we formed a Visual Field Committee (VFC), which included an "expert panel" of six IONDT neuro-ophthalmologists (AA, SMC, SEF, LNJ, GK, SAN) with expertise in the interpretation of visual fields, five methodologists (KD, JK, PL, RWS, PDW), and a programmer (LL). The number of experts required on the panel was decided after a statistical computation determined that the chance of six experts agreeing on ten patterns by guessing would be 0.00001. A majority of the experts needed to agree to categorize a field defect as a specific pattern. The chance of this degree of concordance occurring by guessing alone was 0.01215. For any field in which the agreement among panelists was not significantly better than guessing, the field was considered 'non-classifiable'.</p><p>The VFC established the protocol for developing visual field defect categories, training and evaluation of the expert panel, developing and testing of a computerized classification system, and defining progression using this system. The Committee based the sequence of steps that would be used to develop and validate the computerized expert system (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) after Molino and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The expert panel formulated the definitions of the various types of field defects, (e.g. normal, absolute defect, diffuse depression), all of which were based solely on data available within the 24-2 visual field.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sequence of steps utilized by the Visual Field Committee to develop rules for analysis of visual field defects by the computerized system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2415-6-34-1"/></fig><p>We used 189 visual fields to develop the computer based classification system, none of which were associated with patients enrolled in the IONDT. Eighty-one visual fields were included from patients with NAION who were screened but not eligible for the IONDT. Reasons for ineligibility included refused enrollment, age &#x0003c; 50 years, onset of symptoms unknown or &#x0003e; 14 days, unable to read English, myocardial infarction within last 6 months, a visual condition precluding reliable visual acuity measurement, and current anticoagulant or corticosteroid use. One hundred eight visual fields from NAION patients not screened or enrolled in the IONDT, and seen at Doheny Eye Institute (n = 24), Emory University (n = 50), or the University of Missouri's Mason Eye Institute (n = 34) were also used to develop the computer-based system, following institutional review boards approval at each institution. All visual fields used to develop the computer-based classification system had been evaluated for reliability and had &#x0003c; 3 fixation losses, &#x0003c; 3 false positive responses, and &#x0003c; 3 false negative responses.</p><p>The expert panel first formulated initial operational definitions of visual field defects corresponding to the 52 points in the 24-2 Humphrey scale (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Global guidelines included the following rules:</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>A Schematic of a 52-point (program 24-2) Humphrey Visual Field for a left eye</bold>. The point indicator number for each point measured is shown with its position in a visual field. "bs" indicates the two points that make up the blind spot. Points for the right eye are a mirror image, i.e., points are read right to left for each row. <bold>B Example of a Humphrey Visual Field with an inferior altitudinal field defect</bold>. This example of a visual field shows the difference between the values in decibels of each point in the linear array between a single visual field and those of age-matched controls.

If a field is classified as normal or absolute (no perception of stimuli), no other classification may be made.</p><p>2. A depressed point is defined as equal to, or greater than, 4 dB loss.</p><p>3. Fields are classified even though they appear unreliable from the HVF indices (i.e., short term fluctuation).</p><p>4. Severity is based upon subjective judgment. Only the arcuate/altitudinal category may have more than one severity with a separate severity assignable to the arcuate and the altitudinal components.</p><p>Definitions were refined through an iterative process using an "evaluation set" of visual fields until consensus was reached, as follows:</p><p>The VFC director reviewed the 189 visual fields to select 19 with one or more representative defects (evaluation set), and then sent the evaluation set to each of the 6 expert panelists, along with instructions, a grading form, and proposed definitions for 13 types of defects and for levels of severity. Members of the expert panel independently reviewed the fields and definitions, and, after telephone and face-to-face meetings, agreed upon modified definitions of pattern defects.</p><p>The VFC Director used the modified pattern defect definitions to re-classify the 19 visual fields in the evaluation set. Each member of the expert panel independently reported the degree to which s/he agreed with the classification of each field, choosing from among the following choices: excellent, good, uncertain, poor, or bad. At the same time, the panelists were instructed to categorize the severity (density) of each defect as mild, moderate, severe, or absolute (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Because there was again lack of agreement among the expert panel on the classification, the group met face-to face to discuss and revise the existing definitions for a second time. Disagreements were resolved by allowing three categories of field defects: peripheral, paracentral, and central as well as a category of "other" which could be used only for visual fields that were impossible to fit into any other specific category.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Agreement between six expert panel members' and director's classification for 19 non-IONDT visual fields in the Evaluation Set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="5"><bold>Stated agreement with director</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"></td><td align="center"><bold>Excellent</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Good</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Uncertain</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Poor</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Bad</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Director's classification</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>No. (%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>No. (%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>No. (%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>No. (%)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>No. (%)</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Normal</td><td align="center">5 (83)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Absolute defect</td><td align="center">6 (100)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mild diffuse depression</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe diffuse depression</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td align="center">4 (66)</td><td></td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mild superior altitudinal</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate superior and inferior altitudinal</td><td></td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td align="center">1 (17)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe superior altitudinal</td><td align="center">6 (100)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mild inferior altitudinal</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate inferior altitudinal</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td></td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe inferior altitudinal and moderate superior arcuate</td><td align="center">5 (83)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate superior arcuate</td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe superior and inferior arcuate</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td align="center">1 (17)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mild inferior arcuate</td><td align="center">6 (100)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate inferior arcuate</td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe inferior arcuate</td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate inferior nasal step</td><td align="center">5 (83)</td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mild paracentral scotoma</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td></td><td align="center">1 (17)</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate central scotoma</td><td align="center">4 (67)</td><td align="center">2 (33)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe central scotoma</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td align="center">3 (50)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Using the revised definitions derived from the evaluation set, the VFC then sent a "training set" of 97 masked, representative, non-IONDT NAION fields to the expert panel for classification. To assess the ability of the panelists to apply the rules reliably, 11 duplicate fields from the training set and 12 fields from the evaluation set were included for a total of 120 fields.</p><p>At least five of six (83%) panelists independently agreed on the defect classification for 55 of 120 fields comprising the training set. Agreement on classification of the remaining 65 fields was achieved through a series of four interactive reconciliation meetings of the expert panel, held either by teleconference or in person. These discussions resulted in further refinement and finalization of the pattern definitions and consensus on classification of all fields in the training set.</p><p>The final classification system included "normal" and 13 different rule-based field or defect types, shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.

Quadrants were then analyzed in combination as needed to encompass definitions of all identified types of defects. The programmer translated each rule into a logical statement that could be found true or false, taking the form "if ... then". A truth table was utilized to define specific types of field defects, based upon definitions of the expert panel. Two forms of logical statements were used to identify pattern defects. The first statement was based upon <italic>average </italic>dB loss within a quadrant. If the average loss did not meet the criteria for depression (i.e., 4 dB) then the alternative statement, based on the <italic>number </italic>of disturbed points within a quadrant, was used to determine the presence of pattern defects. Thus, the number of disturbed points was used primarily to find mild defects that were missed by averaging.</p><p>For instance, if the average dB loss was greater in the periphery than in the central field by 5 dB, then an arcuate defect was defined as present in that quadrant (see definition in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). If the central dB loss was greater by 5 dB than the periphery, then a central defect was present. If no pattern defect was found by averaging, then disturbed point algorithms were used to find mild or smaller pattern defects within a quadrant or defect-appropriate combination of quadrants. A fixed predetermined number of disturbed points had to be within the boundary of a pattern defect for that defect to be considered present. For example, a superior arcuate defect is defined as four depressed points within one or both upper quadrants (see definition in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Some pattern defects were determined by the presence or absence of other defects. For example, if there were superior and inferior altitudinal defects and a central scotoma, then the pattern was defined as diffuse depression. If there was both a paracentral scotoma and a central scotoma, then the pattern was defined as a central scotoma alone.</p><p>Average dB loss within a pattern defect and number of disturbed points was used to classify a defect as mild, moderate, or severe. The severity classification of the expert panel was used to define the boundaries for each type of defect. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> shows how severity for an altitudinal defect was determined using 23 altitudinal defects in the training set identified by the expert panel. Severity for other defects was similarly determined (number and type of defect used to determine severity scores: 9 paracentral scotomas; 26 arcuate defects; 20 diffuse depression defects; and 3 nasal step defects). Classification as an absolute defect (i.e. no response to the brightest stimulus at all points tested on the 24-2 HVF) required use of actual sensitivity rather than relative sensitivity loss.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Classification of severity of 23 visual fields with altitudinal defects from training set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="4"><bold>Field parameters</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Qualitative severity </bold>(as classified by panel)</td><td align="center"><bold>n</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Average dB loss within defect</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>95% CI</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Average number points in defect</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>95% CI</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Mild</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">6.2</td><td></td><td align="center">5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Moderate</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">18.2</td><td align="center">12.9 to 23.5</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">24.3 to 25.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Severe</td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center">27.4</td><td align="center">26.3 to 28.5</td><td align="center">26</td><td align="center">25.8 to 26.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Definition of change across time</title><sec><title>Calculation of SF<sub>C</sub></title><p>To measure change in visual field defects over time (i.e., from baseline to a follow-up visits) we planned to analyze visual fields at multiple time points and compare defect type and severity. We anticipated that change in an individual's visual field could entail change in defect type, defect severity, both defect type and severity, identification of a new defect at follow-up not observed at baseline, or disappearance of a defect observed at baseline.</p><p>Because spurious changes in visual fields caused by patient learning effects or by short term fluctuation were possible, we decided to use the Humphrey global index short term fluctuation (SF), a measure of intra-test variability, as a standard by which to determine the normal variation within an individual's visual fields over a fixed time period. SF is determined by measuring the difference between two threshold measurements at 10 different points across the entire field during the same test. The average of these differences constitute the SF. Clinically, a small SF (1 to 2 dB) indicates a reliable field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

The adjustment was made in the direction that would decrease the probability of detecting a change in defect type from baseline to follow-up. The adjusted data was then reclassified. For example, if an individual had visual fields classified as having a superior arcuate defect at baseline and a superior altitudinal defect at the follow-up visit, that patient's SF<sub>C </sub>for these visits was subtracted from the points that distinguish an arcuate from an altitudinal defect in the computerized expert system, i.e., paracentral points 21 and 22, in the follow-up field. This adjusted follow-up visual field was then re-classified. If the adjusted visual field was still classified as having a superior altitudinal defect, then the superior portion of the follow-up field would be classified as having changed from baseline, from a superior arcuate to a superior altitudinal defect. On the other hand, if the adjusted follow-up visual field was classified as having a superior arcuate defect, then the follow-up visual field was classified as "not changed" with a superior arcuate defect for both visits. This general approach was used to distinguish an arcuate from an altitudinal defect, and a central from a paracentral defect.</p><p>Change in severity was also determined after applying SF<sub>C </sub>but was only evaluated in fields whose defects were classified as not changed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Validation of the classification scheme</title><p>A set of 95 non-IONDT NAION visual fields was sent to the expert panel as a "validation set"; of these, 22 were masked duplicates chosen systematically from the original training set (every fifth field listed in ID numeric order).

To date, however, full use has not been made of quantitative data for detection, characterization, or progression of visual field defects in ischemic optic neuropathy. In the IONDT, we developed and validated a reliable rule-based system. This system proved capable of consistently defining pattern and severity of visual field defects detected in eyes with NAION enrolled in the IONDT. It also allowed for evaluation of change in visual field defect and severity over time. Development of this system entailed devising definitions for visual field defects encountered in NAION patients using an iterative process and expert panel and defining progression. All decision rules were based upon the opinion of the expert panel; these rules then provided the basis by which all field classifications were made. Further testing of the system showed that this rule-based computer program is a valid method for analysis of the patterns and severities of visual field data for individuals with NAION.</p><p>Development and validation of a system for classifying visual fields is complex, given that there is no existing "gold standard" for defect classification and that experts are unable to reach agreement on defect classification, at least in this study. This type of problem is well known in medicine. For instance, studies validating the use of computer-assisted diagnosis tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] suggest that the differences between computer diagnosis and human expert diagnosis differed by about the same extent as human experts disagree among themselves. The diagnostic variability in this study was similar to performance of humans and computers in validations of other expert systems for interpretations lacking a "gold standard", for which agreement ranged from 50% to 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Given that computerized diagnosis may be no better than that of an expert panel, the principal reason for utilizing a computerized system in the context of a clinical trial is to reduce inconsistency by eliminating intra- and inter-observer variability. For example, we found that members of the expert panel often did not classify a visual field the same way they previously classified it. Thus, use of a computerized system reduces variability, although not necessarily the original bias of the expert panel in classification of visual field defects. Once incorporated into a computer system, the criteria for categorizing the pattern and severity of visual field defects are, according to Hirsbrunner and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], "explicit, obvious, and standardized." Such attributes are essential within the context of randomized clinical trials.</p><p>Development and validation of a classification system for visual fields requires several steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. First, an expert panel must achieve consensus on a set of rules for classifying defects. Second, the experts apply the rules successfully, i.e., the rate of agreement was not meaningfully different from agreement reported for similar classification systems in other medical contexts. Third, the consistent application of the rules by a computerized system produces classifications that do not disagree with the panel more than the expert panel disagrees with itself. Finally, the computerized system produces reasonable defect classifications, defined as classifications with which the expert panel rarely disagrees.</p><p>We recognized that more than one interpretation was possible for a given distribution of disturbed points on a visual field and that it was not going to be possible for all the experts to agree on a gold standard to evaluate the computerized system. Thus, we elected to accept the computerized determination given that the panel considered it to be consistent with clinical interpretation.</p><p>A quantified or computerized analysis of visual fields that approximates a human interpretation of an automated visual field faces particular challenges in three areas &#x02013; detection, progression, and characterization of the defect. Difficulties in detection of defect relate primarily to distinguishing appropriately between short-term and long-term fluctuation. This problem is further compounded in various disease states, such as glaucoma, in which the pathological process itself produces fluctuation in sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study used multiple confirmation fields to diagnose the presence or absence of a defect and provides an example of a method to deal with clinical detection of visual field defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More advanced models of visual field perturbations, such as those by De la Rosa and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], utilize an approach for rapid assessment of glaucomatous field defects based upon multiple correlations. Although the IONDT computerized system cannot distinguish between short and long-term fluctuation when detecting a defect pattern within a single field, it does use a standard set of rules for classification and detection and thus provides for consistent identification and classification of defects.</p><p>Progression of field defects is a common end-point for glaucoma studies. The issue, once again, is determining change, but from an abnormal as opposed to a normal baseline. Katz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reviewed scoring methods employed by two multicenter clinical trials, the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) and the CIGTS. These studies utilized a cumulative score (0&#x02013;20), based upon depression of adjacent points occurring within specified regions of the visual field. Depression was defined by total deviation plot on the HVF printout in the AGIS and by probability values in the CIGTS. McNaught and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] developed a linear model of point wise sensitivity values against time to identify progression in normal tension glaucoma. By any of these methods, detection and progression could be determined operationally, based on the sensitivity and reliability required in a particular study. The IONDT used change, defined as decibel loss or increased number of points within defects identified at baseline, to detect progression using the computerized classification system, after adjusting for measured within-individual variations in performance.</p><p>In contrast to detection and progression of visual field defects, characterization is a more complex task. It requires pattern recognition open to multiple interpretations and preferences (e.g., "lumping" versus "splitting"). Typically, glaucoma visual field interpretation does not address visual field characterization. In one of the few clinical trials to utilize pattern recognition as an outcome for visual field testing, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) established 15 monocular types of field defects (14 local and diffuse) of three different severities occurring in optic neuritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The Director and Associate Director of the ONTT Visual Field Reading Center reviewed visual fields separately, then together, to "reach a consensus on the final classification for each visual field." Initial agreement was noted for 76.3% of the HVF, 81.5% on the location and 74% on the shape. Complete agreement in every category was achieved in only 47.4% of 309 affected eyes. In a masked retest, the agreement on shapes was present for 76.2% of 42 cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The same investigators have recently developed a similar classification methodology for visual fields obtained in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). Complete agreement in classification among three readers was achieved in 64%&#x02013;66% of defects and majority agreement was achieved in an additional 31%&#x02013;33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Other methods have been used to characterize visual fields. For example, neural networks have been touted as providing a means for allowing computers to "learn" how to categorize visual fields correctly, even in the absence of specified rules. In the supervised class of artificial neural networks, the systems require a training set of "correctly" categorized visual fields to allow learning to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, there is a tautology in that, in the absence of rules, how is such a training set derived? Henson and associates suggest that unsupervised neural networks can be used to resolve this dilemma, as they are self-classifying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the patterns correspond to the number of nodes used in the neural network and do not necessarily correspond to clinically identified field defects.</p><p>In designing the computerized system for evaluation of IONDT visual fields, we encountered several methodological issues that could have influenced definitions of defect classification and/or change. First, fields were obtained using full threshold strategy rather than SITA, which resulted in prolonged testing times. SITA strategies were unavailable at the outset of patient recruitment and had not yet been completely validated by the study end. Second, because the IONDT did not formally train study patients on performing Humphrey visual field exams before collecting study visual field data, some observed changes may be due to learning effects over time. The importance of training was not generally recognized in 1992, when the IONDT began. However, the testing method used in the IONDT is probably generalizable, given that most patients in a clinical setting do not undergo visual field training sessions. Despite these methodological issues, the observed changes in pattern classification and severity of IONDT visual fields were remarkably consistent over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that it is unlikely that the computer system algorithms had substantial classification errors.</p><p>Another concern relating to study validity was the failure of the 6 experts to agree completely on a sizable proportion of defect classifications for the test fields during the initial validation. The number of experts we included in our testing differed substantially from those utilized in virtually all other prospective trials involving visual fields. This was a deliberate decision to ensure rigor and avoid chance agreement. The observed lack of concordance in classifying defects by the 6 experts is most likely due to the number of experts (6 experts rather than the usual 2 experts plus a tie-breaker) and independence of reviewers (experts from geographically dispersed clinical centers). Indeed, we believe members of our expert panel were more likely to manifest true independence in decision-making than experts at a single reading center.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we developed a computerized method for analyzing automated perimetric data in the IONDT. This system is a validated rule-based system capable of consistently defining pattern and severity of visual field defect encountered in NAION patient. Its primary use is in the research setting; these methods are not meant to replace clinical evaluation. Once incorporated into a computer system, the criteria for categorizing the pattern and severity of visual field defects are explicit, obvious, and standardized. Such attributes are essential within the context of randomized clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AGIS: Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study</p><p>CIGTS: Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study</p><p>HVF: Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer</p><p>IONDT: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial</p><p>MD: mean deviation, a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer global index</p><p>NAION: non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</p><p>OHTS: Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study</p><p>ONDS: optic nerve decompression surgery</p><p>ONTT: Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial</p><p>SF: short term fluctuation, a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer global index</p><p>SF<sub>C</sub>: the pooled estimate of short term fluctuation across two visits</p><p>SITA: Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm</p><p>VFC: Visual Field Committee for the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SEF conceived the computer expert system, contributed to the design of the development and validation studies, chaired the expert panel, interpreted the study findings, and contributed to writing and editing the manuscript.
