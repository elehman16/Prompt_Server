Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is associated with and/or implicated in numerous disease states, such as metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, arthritis, obesity and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. While inflammation serves as a normal and necessary response to tissue injury and infections, excessive inflammation can be pathological. Dietary components have the potential to modulate inflammatory conditions and play a role in the prevention and/or treatment of disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Intake of plant polyphenol-containing foods and products has been associated with beneficial levels of antioxidant/anti-inflammatory markers, and health promoting effects in epidemiological, <italic>in vitro, ex vivo </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is not always clear whether direct, rapid antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects, or longer-term regulatory actions are responsible. For example, high isoflavone soy protein intake over 4 weeks increases serum radical scavenging capacity based on a total antioxidant status assay; yet adding isoflavones <italic>in vitro </italic>to plasma pooled from subjects samples drawn prior to treatment had little effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The latter lack of effect occurred even if isoflavones were added well in excess of what oral intake could produce in serum samples. Similarly, a 4-week intake of an isoflavone concentrate can raise erythrocyte contents of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1, but this effect would not be expected to occur immediately after a single intake of isoflavones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In 2001, a NIH working group standardized the definition of a biomarker as "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological or pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Biomarkers can indicate a variety of health or disease characteristics including responses to various types of interventions such as diet, nutrients, or therapeutics. A biomarker can be classified as a surrogate end-point biomarker (i.e., a marker that is intended to substitute for a clinical end point). Generally, a surrogate end point is expected to <italic>predict </italic>clinical benefit, harm, or lack thereof, on the basis of epidemiological, therapeutic, pathophysiological, or other scientific evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Biomarker measurements allow investigation of food and nutritional products in human subjects over a shorter time course as compared to following gross clinical endpoints such as disease occurrence or symptom progression. It also allows researchers to avoid data interpretation and compliance-issues often associated with longer studies.</p><p>The present study examines the effect of short-term consumption of a polyphenol-rich beverage (PRB) on several biomarkers related to antioxidant/anti-inflammatory processes. The PRB utilized in this study is called SoZo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and contains numerous fruit and vegetable extracts that are described in detail in the materials and methods section. It includes coffee fruit extract as the first listed ingredient, which is rich in polyphenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The serum biomarkers that were followed during the study include 8-iso-PGF2-alpha, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide (NO), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay. These markers are further described below.</p><p>8-iso-PGF2-alpha is an isoprostane derived from arachidonic acid via lipid peroxidation <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is a potent vasoconstrictor, and is considered a gold standard for measuring oxidative stress <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Studies have shown that serum levels of this biomarker are raised under certain inflammatory conditions such as obesity, diabetes, arthritic and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>AOPPs are the products of plasma protein oxidation--especially oxidation of albumin. Because of its rapid response to changes, it is thought to be suitable for measuring short-term changes in oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Serum levels are increased in subjects with inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Increased AOPP levels also correlate with cardiovascular disease markers--they may have a causal relationship in the development of atherosclerosis, as has been shown in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous compound in the body that plays an important role in vasodilation via the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and hence in increasing circulation in the body. It also inhibits platelet aggregation and leukocyte activation. A number of plant polyphenolic compounds have been shown to modulate NO levels and/or actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>CRP is an acute phase protein that is produced mainly by hepatocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines in the body, and is hypothesized to serve as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk. Increased levels also correlate with type II diabetes, obesity and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is present at very low levels in healthy individuals, and an increased intake of foods rich in polyphenolic compounds is inversely associated with serum CRP concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>This acute single-dose investigational pilot study assesses changes in blood levels of targeted biomarkers indicative of antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The approach provides rapid results after the treatment of human subjects with tested material in comparison to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

After 40 minutes, the column was re-equilibrated to the starting conditions. The retention time of ellagic acid at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was 19.059 min as determined by co-injection with an ellagic acid standard (PhytoLab, Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.2 Total polyphenol content</title><p>Total polyphenol content was determined by spectrophotometry according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and was calibrated against gallic acid standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

The fluorescence decay curve of FL is monitored in the absence or presence of antioxidants, the area under the fluorescence decay curve (AUC) is then integrated, and the net AUC is calculated by subtracting the AUC of the blank from that of the sample antioxidant.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.3 Peroxynitrite radical absorbance capacity (NORAC) assay</title><p>The NORAC assay was performed by a modified method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Briefly, a stock solution of DHR-123 (5 mM) in dimethylformamide was purged with nitrogen and stored at -80 &#x000b0;C. A working solution with DHR-123 (f.c. 5 M) diluted from the stock solution was placed on ice in the dark immediately prior to the study. Peroxynitrite scavenging by the oxidation of DHR 123 was measured with a FL 600 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively, at room temperature. The background and final fluorescent intensities were measured 5 minutes after treatment with or without SIN-1 (f.c. 10 M) or authentic peroxynitrite (f.c. 10 M) in 0.3 N sodium hydroxide. Oxidation of DHR-123 by decomposition of SIN-1 gradually increased, whereas authentic ONOO- rapidly oxidized DHR-123 with its final fluorescent intensity being stable over time.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.4 Singlet oxygen absorbance capacity (SOAC) assay</title><p>Singlet oxygen was generated in ethanol by the molybdate-catalyzed disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 37&#x000b0;C.

Males and females between the ages of 45-55 years, with a BMI of 25-36 were recruited for the study. Other inclusion criterion included: subjects otherwise reported themselves as "healthy" (no known disease conditions), were not on any medications, were not allergic to fruits and were not experiencing any digestive problems. A total of 31 subjects were randomized into two groups; a PRB and placebo group.</p><p>PRB and placebo samples were prepared in coded tubes and refrigerated at approximately 1.5-3.5&#x000b0;C until time of serving. PRB samples were obtained from a commercially produced lot of the SoZo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>beverage. The placebo consisted of a commercially available pear juice that was freshly diluted 1:9 in water. All samples were shaken well immediately prior to administration.</p><p>All study participants were informed about study goals, study design and PRB features, and signed a consent form prior to treatment. Study participants were instructed to fast overnight and to avoid vigorous exercise for 12 hours prior to participation. All study participants were routinely asked about how they were feeling during the four hours of post-treatment, in part to identify subjects that might have been experiencing hypoglycemia, so as to avoid collection of data from subjects affected by low blood glucose levels during this acute study. Blood collection was performed by medical laboratory scientists and phlebotomists. Blood was drawn from the median cubital vein using Vacutainers (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Sample collection was initiated immediately following informed consent, and was performed on all participants at 7:00 AM (T0).</p><p>Subjects were randomly given a single 3 oz. dose of PRB or placebo immediately following the baseline blood draw (T0). Subsequent blood samples were collected at 1 (T60), 2 (T120), 3 (T180) and 4 (T240) hours following consumption. Blood was centrifuged at 2000 <italic>g </italic>for 10 minutes and the serum was transferred to fresh tubes for storage at -80&#x000b0;C. Participants were required to remain inactive during the entirety of the experiment and were allowed to drink only water. They were encouraged to write down any subjective observations due to the treatment.</p><p>Blood samples of all subjects were analyzed for 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels using Cell BioLabs assay kit #STA337 (San Diego, CA). Due to the wide range of serum 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels determined at T0 and the desire to study a population with low-grade inflammation, a subgroup of subjects from both the treatment and placebo groups (10 per group) with the highest 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels was utilized for further analysis. The subgroup's blood samples were assayed for additional biomarkers, including advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) using Cell BioLabs assay kit #STA318 (San Diego, CA); nitric oxide (NO) using Biomol/Enzo assay kit #AK-136 (Plymouth Meeting, PA); hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay using Cell Biolabs, assay kit #STA-346 (San Diego, CA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) using Hyphen BioMed assay kit #RK010A (Neuville-Sur-Oise, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Means were compared using a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

Discussion</title><p>Free radicals or reactive oxygen/nitrogen species may play a major role in many diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's and the entire aging process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The most common reactive oxygen or nitrogen species existing in the body are peroxyl (ROO), hydroxyl (HO), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, PRB showed an especially high <italic>in vitro </italic>antioxidant potential in the hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity assay.</p><p>The phenolic compounds that were found in high concentrations in PRB (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) are some of the most widely distributed plant secondary products. The ability of these compounds to act as antioxidants is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Additionally, calcium fructoborate, a water-soluble boro-carbohydrate found most notably in certain fruits, nuts, vegetables and legumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], is a component of PRB, and has been previously reported to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Acute blood biomarker testing provides a relatively quick and cost effective way to evaluate the potential efficacy of natural products in humans, and has mechanistic screening value. Acute changes in biomarker values suggest that an orally ingested substance: a) survives the chemistries of the gut and/or is converted into active components in the gut, b) is absorbed into the bloodstream, and c) is measurably bioactive, and must work, at least partly, though rapidly accessed mechanisms, rather than by mechanisms requiring repetitive dosing and/or cumulative effects.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that PRB has not only antioxidant effects <italic>in vitro</italic>, but that a single intake may impact measurements of serum biomarkers with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions in subjects with elevated BMI and 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels. When the initial evaluation of 8-iso-PGF2-alpha was performed, it was noted that despite selecting for inclusion of subjects with an elevated BMI as a way to investigate subjects experiencing an elevated degree of inflammation and/or oxidation (obesity is linked to low-grade inflammatory states) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], the levels of serum 8-iso-PGF2-alpha varied widely in subjects at T0 within both experimental groups. Normal serum levels of 8-iso-PGF2-alpha are considered to be 40-100 pg/mL (STA-337-isoprostane-assay-kit). Higher plasma levels are associated with a number of health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and inflammatory and arthritic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Chu and colleagues have shown that the plasma 8-iso-PGF2-alpha level in aged rats is 30.6-fold higher than that of young rats, reflecting the enhanced status of oxidative stress in aged animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Hence, due to the exploratory nature of the pilot study and the desire to observe effects on individuals with elevated serum 8-iso-PGF2-alpha, biomarker analysis in this study was performed on a post-hoc subgroup of the ten subjects from each group with the highest 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels. The results of post-hoc analyses are of interest and important for generating plausible hypotheses of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>As presented, PRB had statistically significant effects on blood levels of AOPP and 8-iso-PGF2-alpha during the first 60 minutes after the treatment. Additionally, there was a trend toward effects on NO and CRP levels. Both placebo and PRB groups showed a statistically significant increase in HORAC levels. These results suggest that PRB is absorbed and acts quickly in fasting subjects, and raises the possibility that repeated, regular intake could produce effects that may exceed those observed here, with unknown potential clinical benefits.</p><p>PRB showed a statistically significant effect of lowering serum 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels that was rather large; a single intake resulted in a mean reduction of 40% in 60 minutes and an average of 42% over the next 4 hours. This result suggests that the acute effect on plasma 8-iso-PGF2-alpha is both rapid and sustained during first 4 hours after treatment, and justifies further studies using specified 8-iso-PGF2-alpha levels as an inclusion criterion, to both validate this result and explore related effects, such as if PRB may reduce risk of cardiovascular conditions and/or other health problems.</p><p>The time course of specific PRB actions was not consistent across all tested markers. The PRB inhibitory effect on AOPP was rather short compared to its effect on PGF2-alpha; the 8-iso-PGF2-alpha effect persisted for at least 4 hours after the treatment, while AOPP readings tended to return to baseline between 1 and 4 hours. This result may be consistent with the literature, as AOPPs are known to respond rapidly to changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], although how rapidly they respond is unclear. It is possible that repeated intakes of PRB would lower AOPP readings for more prolonged periods. AOPPs are pro-inflammatory mediators associated with a number of inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and also directly impair HDL metabolism, and therefore could play a role in cardiovascular disease development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>A number of publications have reported that increases in nitric oxide (NO) levels are beneficial, especially for cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. NO can be destroyed by reactive oxygen species, and PRB has antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The PRB-induced increase in NO concentrations was not statistically significant, but the change was different over placebo, as placebo caused NO values to decrease. One possible explanation for the observed post-treatment NO concentrations in the PRB group is that NO values can increase and diminish throughout the day, and that PRB may have prevented one of the NO declines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>The acute effect of PRB on CRP was not statistically significant. However, the mean acute reduction of CRP at T60 by nearly 5% is nonetheless surprising since blood levels of this biomarker are considered to be rather stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The placebo group showed a 2.2% increase in CRP at the same time point. Future studies could investigate the potential anti-inflammatory potential of repeated intakes of PRB using CRP as a longer-term marker.</p><p>Since PRB was found to have a high HORAC reading during <italic>in vitro </italic>screening (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), it was of interest to determine whether ingested PRB could change HORAC blood values <italic>in vivo </italic>in the clinical study. Hydroxyl radicals play an important role in fatigue and functioning of muscles, muscle respiratory metabolism, muscle inflammation, Alzheimer's disease and DNA damage in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, some anti-inflammatory drugs work in part by reducing blood levels of hydroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>A single PRB ingestion produced a strong mean rise in HORAC values that was rapid and sustained. Surprisingly, the placebo group also showed a rise in HORAC values. Although the percent increase in the PRB group over T0 exceeded that for placebo for all but the T120 time point (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), the changes were not significantly different between the two treatment groups.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Percent change from T0 in HORAC levels in clinical study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="center" colspan="4">% Change over T0</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td align="left"><bold>T0</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>T60</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>T120</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>T180</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>T240</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>PRB</bold></td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">55.1 &#x000b1;7.19*</td><td align="left">67.5 &#x000b1;7.20*</td><td align="left">54.5 &#x000b1;6.52*</td><td align="left">75.8 &#x000b1;9.21*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Placebo</bold></td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">23.6 &#x000b1;5.38</td><td align="left">74.7 &#x000b1;5.91*</td><td align="left">44.4 &#x000b1;5.81*</td><td align="left">43.0 &#x000b1;8.47</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p &#x0003c; 0.05 as compared to T0 by paired T-test.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The unexpected rise in serum HORAC values in the placebo group raises a question as to whether extended fasting (up to 16 hours total, as was essentially experienced by subjects by the end of the observation period) may contribute to healthier antioxidant blood status. Data on AOPP, another distinct antioxidant measurement, did not show such a trend in the placebo group. It is therefore possible that only certain types of antioxidant markers change favorably due to extended fasting. Further clinical studies would be required to test this possibility.</p><p>When comparing average baseline values (T0) presented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> between placebo and PRB groups, values of 8-iso-PGF2-alpha and HORAC were statistically different in a manner that may be significant. However, average values of AOPP and CRP were not statistically different between the two experimental groups at T0. Since subjects were randomly assigned to each experimental group, this observation was unexpected. A further study using a cross-over design may clarify and substantiate further the results and unexpected observations by allowing for within-subject analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the collected data demonstrates the potential utility of acute biomarker measurements for evaluating antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects of natural products such as PRB, and quantitatively shows that a mixture of polyphenol-rich fruit and vegetable components may work acutely on specific oxidative and inflammatory markers in human blood through apparently rapidly acting, though currently unidentified, mechanisms. Results generated by this pilot study justify additional, cross-over type clinical investigations of PRB with narrower inclusion criteria to verify results and to investigate more specific health conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AOPP: advanced oxidation protein products; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AUC: area under the curve; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; BMI: body mass index; CRP: C-reactive protein; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; f.c.: final concentration; g: times gravity; GAE: gallic acid equivalents; HCl: hydrochloric acid; HORAC: hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase,; &#x003bc;mol: micromole; mL: milliliter; nm: nanometer; NO: nitric oxide; ORAC: oxygen radical absorbance capacity; NORAC: peroxynitrite radical absorbance capacity; pg: picogram; PRB: polyphenol-rich beverage; SOAC: singlet oxygen absorbance capacity; T0: zero time point; T60: 60 minute time point; T120: 120 minute time point; T240: 240 minute time point; UV: ultraviolet.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of Competing interests</title><p>BN and JH are employed by FutureCeuticals, Inc., which provided partial funding for the studies.
