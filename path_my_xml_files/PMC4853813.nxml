Verapamil is a mainstay of prophylactic therapy; however, it is not approved for this indication, and only two randomised controlled trials with level-C evidence support its use (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although other pharmacologic interventions (e.g. lithium, oral steroids, valproic acid, topiramate, ergotamine, suboccipital steroid injections) have been investigated, most lack compelling evidence to support their use (<xref rid="bibr2-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); suboccipital steroid injections have demonstrated efficacy as adjunctive prophylactic therapy for CH in patients receiving verapamil (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been investigated as adjunctive or first-line treatment for CH (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The strong parasympathetic activation that occurs during CH attacks (<xref rid="bibr10-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) supports the rationale for nVNS therapy. Early data suggested that inhibition of pain by VNS occurs by inhibition of vagal afferents to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). More recent evidence suggests that VNS may also inhibit pain by modulating inhibitory neurotransmitter release, leading to decreased TNC glutamate levels (<xref rid="bibr12-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

When applied against the neck, the device delivered a maximum of 24&#x02009;V and 60&#x02009;mA output current while allowing stimulation amplitude adjustment by the user. Two stainless steel contact surfaces and conductive gel applied by the user enabled delivery of stimulations. Mandatory nVNS prophylaxis consisted of three 2-minute stimulations (i.e. three doses) five minutes apart administered twice daily (i.e. six doses per day) to the right side of the neck (right vagal nerve). The first prophylactic treatment was administered within one hour of waking; the second was administered seven to 10 hours after the first treatment. The number, duration, frequency, and timing of doses were chosen according to previously reported nVNS dosing parameters (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Participants also had the option of acutely treating CH attacks with three additional nVNS doses at pain onset but were advised to not administer prophylactic therapy within a two-hour period after acute treatment. If the CH attack was not aborted within 15 minutes after stimulation, individuals were instructed to take abortive medications (e.g. SC sumatriptan, inhaled oxygen and intranasal zolmitriptan). Changes in SoC prophylactic medications (e.g. verapamil, lithium, topiramate and corticosteroids) were not permitted throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-0333102415607070"><title>Objectives, efficacy assessments and end points</title><p>The objective was to assess the efficacy of adjunctive prophylactic nVNS therapy in chronic CH. The primary end point was the reduction in the mean number of CH attacks per week, defined as the number of attacks during the last two weeks of the randomised phase minus the number of attacks during baseline divided by 2. Attack frequency was evaluated during the last two weeks of the four-week randomised phase to ensure sufficient time for nVNS to demonstrate its full effect. Reductions in the mean number of CH attacks per week were also evaluated during the last two weeks of the extension phase.</p><p>Secondary efficacy end points included &#x02265;50% response rate (i.e. proportion of participants with &#x02265;50% reduction in mean number of CH attacks per week), abortive medication use and duration and intensity of CH attacks that were acutely treated with nVNS. The &#x02265;50% response rate was assessed during the last two weeks of the randomised phase and the last two weeks of the extension phase.

Prophylactic therapies for CH have been established on the basis of clinical experience, with very few well-conducted randomised clinical trials providing high-level supportive evidence (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To date, PREVA is the largest prospective, randomised, controlled trial that examined the clinical benefit of prophylactic nVNS therapy in a treatment-refractory chronic CH population. This study met its primary end point by demonstrating that daily adjunctive prophylactic nVNS therapy significantly reduced the number of CH attacks per week, which presumably led to substantial reductions in abortive medication use and meaningful improvements in QoL. Compared with participants who received nVNS treatment during the randomised phase, individuals who began nVNS therapy during the extension phase had a lower response rate. Findings in the <italic>mITT population</italic> showed that people who persisted in the study continued to respond to nVNS, which is consistent with the reported effects of VNS in epilepsy (<xref rid="bibr20-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Treatment with nVNS was safe and well tolerated, with no serious device-related AEs.</p><p>Study limitations include the lack of a placebo/sham device, an open-label study design, the short treatment duration and the use of patient-reported outcomes. No placebo arm was incorporated into the study because a suitable placebo/sham device had not yet been designed. In lieu of a placebo/sham arm, SoC was deemed the most appropriate control treatment that was reflective of a real-world clinical scenario. The open-label study design and short treatment duration may have contributed to a placebo effect in both treatment groups. The 16.7% response rate in the control group during the extension phase may partially reflect a placebo response to nVNS. The initial response experienced in the control group during the randomised phase may have also impacted the capacity for a meaningful response to nVNS during the extension phase. Additionally, fewer individuals in the control arm (50%) than in the nVNS arm (64.4%) were highly adherent (&#x02265;80%) to prophylactic nVNS, which may have further confounded response rates and reductions in abortive medication use in this group. Only patients with chronic, treatment-refractory CH were included because of their stable CH attack frequency and intensity. A 2.5-month study duration was deemed sufficient to observe a treatment effect. Treatment response in favour of nVNS was consistent across <italic>ITT, mITT</italic> and <italic>per-protocol populations</italic> (<italic>per-protocol population</italic> was defined as participants in the <italic>mITT population</italic> who had &#x02265;12 days of observation in the randomised phase and no major protocol violation; data not shown). Because no CH-specific QoL instruments exist, the EQ-5D-3L and HIT-6 measures were considered most appropriate, and nVNS prophylaxis resulted in meaningful improvements for both measures. The apparent lack of effect of acute nVNS therapy on CH duration or severity is consistent with findings in the chronic CH population that were reported in a recent study of acute nVNS therapy for CH (<xref rid="bibr21-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The nVNS adherence rates in this study (50%&#x02013;64%) are consistent with those reported for prophylactic non-invasive neuromodulation in migraine (<xref rid="bibr23-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and are considered meaningful given that twice-daily nVNS requires more effort and participation than a conventional oral medication regimen.</p><p>Current prophylactic treatments for CH are limited, with verapamil and lithium being used most often. High-dose verapamil is associated with serious cardiovascular effects (e.g. arrhythmias, bradycardia, oedema) and lethargy (<xref rid="bibr24-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); AEs of lithium therapy include tremor, hypothyroidism and renal dysfunction (<xref rid="bibr19-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Thus, both therapies may necessitate close patient monitoring, which in turn may incur substantial costs. Long-term occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) has been shown to reduce attack frequency in patients with chronic CH, but its use is hampered by the invasive nature of the procedure and high incidence of AEs (<xref rid="bibr27-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr30-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

Moreover, the per-patient costs for these therapies are extremely high (<xref rid="bibr27-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation was found to be effective in the acute treatment of chronic CH; however, procedural complications, infections and other implantation-related AEs were reported (<xref rid="bibr34-0333102415607070" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Thus, the inherent risks associated with currently available implanted neuromodulation devices and the side effects of prophylactic medications for chronic CH highlight the need for alternative therapies. To this end, nVNS serves as a safe and effective non-invasive therapy that could be easily incorporated into the existing treatment regimens of patients with chronic CH.</p><p>We conclude that findings from PREVA demonstrate the clinical relevance of nVNS in patients with treatment-refractory chronic CH. Adjunctive prophylactic therapy with nVNS can safely reduce CH attack frequency and may yield clinical benefits beyond those afforded by SoC treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec19-0333102415607070"><title>PREVA Study Group</title><p>Investigators are listed by country. 1.
