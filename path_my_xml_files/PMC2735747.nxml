Fourteen men supplemented with 2224 mg EPA+2208 mg DHA and a placebo for 6 weeks in a random order, double blind cross-over design (with an 8 week washout) prior to performing a 60 minute treadmill climb using a weighted pack. Blood was collected pre and post exercise and analyzed for a variety of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers. Blood lactate, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase activity were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment with EPA/DHA resulted in a significant increase in blood levels of both EPA (18 &#x000b1; 2 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1 </sup>vs. 143 &#x000b1; 23 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>; p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and DHA (67 &#x000b1; 4 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1 </sup>vs. 157 &#x000b1; 13 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>; p &#x0003c; 0.0001), while no differences were noted for placebo. Resting levels of CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; were lower with EPA/DHA compared to placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Resting oxidative stress markers were not different (p &#x0003e; 0.05). There was a mild increase in oxidative stress in response to exercise (XO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (p &#x0003c; 0.05). No interaction effects were noted. However, a condition effect was noted for CRP and TNF-&#x003b1;, with lower values with the EPA/DHA condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>EPA/DHA supplementation increases blood levels of these fatty acids and results in decreased resting levels of inflammatory biomarkers in exercise-trained men, but does not appear necessary for exercise-induced attenuation in either inflammation or oxidative stress. This may be due to the finding that trained men exhibit a minimal increase in both inflammation and oxidative stress in response to moderate duration (60 minute) aerobic exercise.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Oxidative stress is a condition in which the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) overwhelms the body's available antioxidant defenses, possibly resulting in oxidation within susceptible tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This has been reported in response to both aerobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and anaerobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] exercise, with over 300 original investigations published over the past 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While a low level of RONS production is necessary to maintain normal physiological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], as well as to allow for exercise-induced adaptations to the endogenous antioxidant defense system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], excessive production of RONS can lead to the oxidation of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, potentially altering normal cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, acute and significant elevations in RONS may impair muscle force production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], while more prolonged RONS production (possibly resulting from exercise overtraining) may impede exercise recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Due to the association between increased RONS production and the pathogenesis of human disease, it has been an objective of some to regulate the oxidative stress response to acute exercise. Although somewhat controversial (See [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), this is often done via the use of antioxidant nutrients.</p><p>In addition to RONS production and subsequent oxidative stress resulting from strenuous exercise, an often associated finding is acute and chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In light of the relationship between RONS and inflammation, and the commonly measured biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), inflammation is often increased in response to strenuous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the short term, this appears to serve as a healing mechanism; however, <italic>chronic </italic>systemic inflammation (as with chronic systemic oxidative stress) has been associated with disease pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hence, methods of reducing systemic inflammation, such as the performance of regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the use of dietary supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have been considered.</p><p>One class of nutrients that appears to possess both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects is essential fatty acids such as the fish oils eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While some reports have noted a decrease in resting oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers with EPA and DHA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], few studies have determined the effects of such supplementation in human subjects on exercise-induced changes in these measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the few studies that have been conducted, results have been mixed, with issues such as the exercise protocol, test subjects (trained and untrained), dosage and duration of supplementation, the timing of measurement, and selection of biomarkers likely contributing to the discrepancies. Because so few studies investigating the effects of EPA/DHA supplementation have included exercise-trained individuals as research subjects, such individuals were used in the present study. This is because such dietary supplements are often promoted as being beneficial to these individuals for purposes of attenuating the oxidative stress and inflammatory response to exercise. It was our objective to determine if EPA/DHA supplementation is needed by exercise-trained individuals for these purposes.</p><p>Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to determine the effects of six weeks of EPA/DHA supplementation on resting and exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in exercise-trained men. It was hypothesized that 1) EPA/DHA would result in a lowering of resting inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, 2) that exercise would induce oxidative stress and inflammation following the use of both EPA/DHA and placebo, and 3) that EPA/DHA would attenuate the exercise-induced rise in these biomarkers, compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and screening</title><p>Only exercise-trained men were recruited to participate. Subjects were required to exercise both aerobically and anaerobically at least three days per week for a minimum of 30 minutes per session (for each type of exercise) for the past 12 months. In addition, subjects must have had an aerobic power (VO<sub>2max</sub>) of at least 40 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>.

The collection and analysis of expired gases provided further descriptive characteristics regarding participants' aerobic power (e.g., VO<sub>2max</sub>). The test continued until volitional fatigue. Before and during the GXT, heart rate was continuously monitored via electrocardiograph (ECG) tracings using a SensorMedics Max-1&#x02122; ECG unit.

A schematic of the study timeline is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The total daily dosage of EPA (2224 mg; MorEPA Mini; Minami Nutrition, Belgium) and DHA (2208 mg; MorDHA Mini; Minami Nutrition, Belgium) was provided in eight gel capsules taken twice per day (morning and evening) with meals. The placebo gel capsules (taken in the same quantities) consisted of soybean oil and were identical in appearance, texture, and taste to the EPA/DHA capsules.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study timeline to investigate the effects of EPA/DHA on resting and exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-511X-8-36-1"/></fig><p>In both conditions, capsules were distributed to subjects by research assistants every two weeks in unlabeled boxes in amounts greater than needed for supplementation. Capsule counts upon box return allowed for estimation of compliance to intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Acute exercise session</title><p>Following each six week period of EPA/DHA or placebo intake, subjects reported to the lab in the morning to perform a submaximal exercise test. Subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill while carrying a weighted backpack (weight equal to 25% of body mass) for 60 minutes. The treadmill speed and grade were altered every five minutes as outlined in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. We chose to use a strenuous aerobic exercise test protocol which would result in an increase in RONS via increased oxygen consumption, in addition to other potential pathways (e.g., prostanoid metabolism, the autooxidation of catecholoamines, and oxidase enzymatic activity (NAD(P)H oxidase, xanthine oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Rather than simply use a traditional steady state aerobic exercise protocol which would result in a moderate increase in oxygen consumption, we attempted to mimic a strenuous uphill climb, in which individuals perform intermittent exercise while carrying an excess load. The addition of the extra load would theoretically increase the amount of work performed, resulting in a greater increase in oxygen consumption and subsequent RONS generation via mitochondrial electron leakage. We chose such a protocol as many previous studies using exercise-trained individuals involved in moderate duration aerobic exercise have noted minimal increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Of course, we could have also opted to use strenuous and intermittent eccentric resistance exercise as our chosen stressor, as such exercise often results in acute and chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. However, our recent findings for this form of exercise (eccentric multi-joint) indicate only minimal increases in both oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers-when using resistance trained men as research subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, based on these findings of only minimal increase in oxidative stress and inflammation when using exercise trained subjects performing traditional aerobic or eccentric resistance exercise, we opted to use an aerobic exercise model with an exaggerated external load in the present design. Pilot testing was found to result in a significant physical stress, much more so than traditional aerobic or resistance exercise.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Exercise data from 14 exercise-trained men during 60 minutes of treadmill walking</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Ending Minute &#x02192;</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">25</td><td align="left">30</td><td align="left">35</td><td align="left">40</td><td align="left">45</td><td align="left">50</td><td align="left">55</td><td align="left">60</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Speed (mph)</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.5</td><td align="left">3.0</td><td align="left">3.0</td><td align="left">3.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Grade<break/>(%)</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">12.5</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">15</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Heart Rate (bpm)<break/><italic>EPA/DHA</italic></td><td align="left">104.09 &#x000b1;

This allowed for determination of the test duration and pack load. The specific speed and grade of each stage of testing was determined through the same consultation, in addition to pilot testing. Breath samples were collected from subjects during the last two minutes of each five minute stage throughout the exercise test for analysis of expired gases (SensorMedics Vmax 229&#x02122; metabolic system). In addition, heart rate and perceived exertion (6-20 Borg scale) were recorded. Subjects completed the identical exercise test following each six week period of EPA/DHA or placebo intake.

Blood samples were collected pre and post intervention for both EPA/DHA and placebo conditions, and analyzed for plasma EPA and DHA concentrations using Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionisation Detection (GC-FID). In relation to the exercise test, blood samples were collected pre exercise (following a 10 minute quiet rest), 0 hours post-exercise, 0.5 hours post-exercise, and 24 and 48 hours post-exercise. Following collection, blood samples were processed accordingly, and the plasma/serum was immediately stored at -80&#x000b0;C until analyzed. As markers of inflammation, CRP was analyzed in serum using an ultra-sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure as described by the manufacturer (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX) and TNF-&#x003b1; was analyzed in plasma using an ELISA procedure as described by the manufacturer (Caymen Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Antioxidant capacity was analyzed in serum using the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay using procedures outlined by the reagent provider (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO). As markers of oxidative stress, we selected a wide array of commonly studied variables in order to best characterize the system. Protein carbonyls were analyzed in plasma using an ELISA procedure as described by the manufacturer (Zenith Technologies, Dunedin, NZ). Serum titers of IgG-autoantibodies against oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) were analyzed using an ELISA procedure as described by the manufacturer (OLAB, Biomedica). Malondialdehyde was analyzed in plasma using a commercially available colorimetric assay (Northwest Life Science Specialties, Vancouver, WA), using the modified method described by Jentzsch et al.

Hydrogen peroxide and xanthine oxidase activity were analyzed in plasma using the Amplex Red reagent method as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies, Eugene, OR). Nitric oxide was estimated using the nitrate/nitrite assay procedure (Caymen Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Whole blood lactate (pre, 0 hours, 0.5 hours only) was analyzed using an automated unit (Accutrend; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).</p><p>In order to determine any degree of muscle injury, the common indirect markers of injury including creatine kinase activity and muscle soreness were chosen. Creatine kinase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using commercially available reagents (StanBio Labs, Boerne, TX). Muscle soreness was assessed using a 10 cm visual analog scale where "0" represents no pain and "10" represents intense pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

This latter finding may be due to the observation that trained men exhibit a minimal increase in both inflammation and oxidative stress in response to a moderate duration, aerobic exercise.</p><p>We chose to use an aerobic exercise protocol of moderate duration in order to mimic a type and duration of exercise commonly performed by many individuals. We included an exaggerated external load component in our protocol (use of a weighted backpack) in order to increase the metabolic demands of the exercise, which theoretically would have increased RONS production and subsequent oxidative stress. Previous studies using exercise-trained subjects performing moderate duration aerobic or anaerobic exercise bouts have largely resulted in minimal increase in oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], likely due to the upregulation in endogenous antioxidant protective mechanisms within such individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. With this knowledge, we did not want to use such an exercise protocol, with the probability of observing an oxidative stress response being minimal. Hence, we decided to include a moderate duration aerobic exercise bout with the additional load, in order to increase the metabolic demands. To our knowledge, no study to date has used such a protocol in an attempt to elicit an oxidative stress response. Our findings of a lack of such response within our sample of exercise-trained men provide additional evidence that individuals who engage in regular, strenuous exercise experience minimal oxidative stress in response to moderate duration aerobic exercise bouts, even when such bouts are strenuous in nature (as evidenced by our blood lactate, heart rate, and perceived exertion data-Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Due to these observations, we conclude that supplemental antioxidant/anti-inflammatory agents such as EPA/DHA are not necessary for such individuals, as the oxidative stress and inflammatory response is minimal. There is simply no additional need for such exogenous protection. This does not indicate, however, that use of EPA/DHA may not prove beneficial for either untrained individuals who are beginning an exercise program (whether for recreation or therapeutic reasons), or for individuals engaged in longer duration exercise involving extensive muscle injury. Such situations may lead to increased RONS formation, inflammation, and muscle injury. Under these conditions, supplemental EPA/DHA may prove beneficial-based on our findings of decreased CRP and TNF-&#x003b1;. Of course, further research is necessary to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been reported to be elevated in response to acute exercise in several investigations, although this is not always the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The findings for increased oxidative stress are relatively uniform when untrained subjects are used within the research design. Of course, the downside to such work is that the results cannot be generalized to a population of exercise-trained subjects. Considering that dietary supplements for purposes of muscle recovery following exercise are typically marketed to individuals engaged in regular exercise, studies including untrained individuals may provide little information as it relates to the target population. For this reason, trained subjects were selected for this experiment.</p><p>In contrast to the findings for increased oxidative stress in response to exercise in untrained subjects, several studies using exercise-trained individuals have reported minimal increase in exercise-induced oxidative stress, when exercise bouts are of moderate duration (= 60 minutes) and intensity (= 70% VO<sub>2max</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More consistent findings of elevated oxidative stress in exercise-trained subjects are available for long duration exercise bouts, often involving marathon or triathlon competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is possible that antioxidant/anti-inflammatory supplements may be beneficial for such individuals during these times, as some studies have reported attenuation in exercise-induced oxidative stress/inflammation with use of such agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Considering that excessive oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] has been linked to the development and progression of several chronic diseases, use of agents in an attempt to minimize (but not eliminate) increases in both oxidative stress and inflammation may be reasonable. This is especially true for individuals who are routinely involved in <italic>excessive </italic>strenuous exercise, as such an activity pattern has been associated with ill-health and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, specific data addressing this issue are certainly needed.</p><p>Considering the above, coupled with the findings of the present study, it is possible that our chosen exercise protocol was of too low an intensity and duration to promote a significant oxidative stress, in particular within our sample of exercise-trained men. The production of RONS has been reported to increase in an intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and duration dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, we may have observed a greater magnitude of increase in our chosen biomarkers if the exercise bout was extended in duration and was more intense. That being said, it should be understood that increasing either of these variables would have made it extremely difficult for subjects to complete the protocol. Most were visibly exhausted at the conclusion of testing, and commented on the extreme difficulty of the protocol. We believe that our findings confirm previous reports which indicate that even with strenuous exercise of moderate duration; individuals who are exercise-trained experience minimal increase in exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. This lack of response is likely one of the additional and often overlooked benefits of regular exercise training; that is, an upregulation in endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These findings have applicability to most individuals who include exercise as a component of their daily routine. Specifically, only a small percentage of exercise enthusiasts typically train for longer than one hour per session. Our findings have specificity towards such individuals, even when the exercise training is rather challenging.</p><p>Given that the chosen protocol was concentric in nature, the amount of muscle damage (and subsequent related RONS production) would be expected to be minimal. This was confirmed by our findings of insignificant increases in muscle soreness and creatine kinase activity in blood. Our results may have been different if using either an aerobic exercise bout involving an eccentric bias (e.g., downgrade running) or a heavy resistance exercise protocol involving a great degree of eccentric muscle actions. However, as mentioned earlier, our recent findings using trained men performing eccentric multi-joint resistance exercise indicate only a minimal increase in both oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we opted to use an aerobic exercise model with an exaggerated external load in an attempt to stimulate a further increase in RONS via increased mitochondrial electron leakage.</p><p>As with oxidative stress, prior research has shown that the exercise-induced inflammatory response is intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] dependent. In the same way that our protocol may have been of too low an intensity and duration to significantly increase oxidative stress biomarkers, this may have also been true for CRP and TNF-&#x003b1;. This is underscored by the finding of Mastaloudis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], who reported elevated CRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in athletes performing a 50 km ultra-marathon. TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 were elevated significantly as early as mid-race, while CRP reached significance in the hours following the race, peaking at 24 hours, and remaining 2 fold higher than baseline at the 6<sup>th </sup>day of recovery. These findings are in contrast to those of the present study in which CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; were not altered in a statistically significant manner, even through 48 hours into recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Supplementation with EPA/DHA increases blood levels of these fatty acids and is associated with a decrease in resting CRP and TNF-&#x003b1;. However, EPA/DHA supplementation does not appear necessary for attenuation of exercise-induced oxidative stress or inflammation in a sample of exercise-trained men. Such individuals experience a minimal increase in oxidative stress and inflammation in response to a moderate duration, aerobic exercise. Hence, EPA/DHA supplementation should not be specifically recommended for this purpose. Future studies investigating the effect of antioxidant/anti-inflammatory agents within a sample of exercise-trained subjects should consider using a protocol of longer duration, and possibly higher intensity, in order to produce a more robust oxidative stress response. This may allow for a better assessment of the effectiveness of such nutrient intervention. As our data show, EPA/DHA intake at the dosage and duration provided in the present study may serve to combat systemic inflammation in a sample of exercise-trained men. These findings may have implications for those who train intensively, as well as other individuals who are prone to inflammatory conditions, as use of EPA/DHA may prove beneficial as a non-pharmaceutical anti-inflammatory agent.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Financial support for this work was provided in part by Minami Nutrition.
