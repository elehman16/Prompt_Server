Intensive care staff prevent severe hypoxia wherever possible, but beyond this there is no consensus. Practice varies widely with age, diagnosis and treating doctor.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> This uncertainty about the optimal oxygenation target is illustrated by the variance in national guidelines in even the most common cause of acute infant respiratory distress: respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. The US American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) target&#x000a0;&#x0003e;90%, whereas the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommend SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;94%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>Oxygenation targets have become a &#x02018;hot topic&#x02019; for clinical trials because of observational data suggesting that high levels of arterial oxygenation are associated with poor outcomes in resuscitation of the newborn, adult critical illness, myocardial infarction, postcardiac arrest and possibly also in respiratory failure.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> When added to the known risks of severe hypoxia, a &#x02018;U-shaped&#x02019; relationship between arterial oxygenation and risk of death emerges.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> We have recently completed a systematic review of the paediatric literature addressing this issue, and although the data are scarce, the same pattern of increased risk and both high and low levels of arterial oxygenation has been observed.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Our recent cohort study of 7410 critically ill children also demonstrated a &#x02018;U-shaped&#x02019; relationship between admission arterial oxygen tension and survival. This pattern persists after adjustment for case-mix (including congenital cyanotic heart disease) and indicators of physiological severity. This complex relationship between oxygenation and outcome may reflect the balance between harm from hypoxia at one end of the oxygenation spectrum (low SpO<sub>2</sub>) and a combination of increased oxygen free radical damage and iatrogenic injury from more aggressive treatments at the other (high SpO<sub>2</sub>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>The lack of evidence indicating the safest oxygen level for a critically ill child needs investigation. Around 19&#x02009;000 such children are admitted to paediatric intensive care units&#x000a0;(PICUs) in the UK annually. Around 75% receive artificial support for ventilation in some form. The primary aim of this artificial ventilation is to support blood oxygen values at a safe level. However, since the optimal level is unknown, clinicians typically default to targeting physiologically normal or even supranormal values. With other variables during critical illness, this approach of &#x02018;normalisation of physiology&#x02019; is known to be either harmful or of no benefit.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref> In neonatal and critically ill adult patients, the choice of oxygen targets are known to influence survival rates, lengths of stay and costs. Three large randomised studies in extreme preterm infants compared lower (85%&#x02013;89%) with higher oxygen targets (91%&#x02013;95%).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Unexpectedly, an increased risk of death (1.45; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.84; P=0.002) was seen with the lower oxygen targets. In contrast, recent pilot data in adult critical illness demonstrate a trend towards the opposite effect: that&#x000a0;is, reduced mortality with lower oxygenation targets in the sickest patients: relative risk 0.49 (95%&#x000a0;CI 0.20 to 1.17; P=0.10).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Similarly, harmful effects of supplemental oxygen have been demonstrated in adults with ST elevation myocardial infarction.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> In October 2016, a single-centre study in adults was stopped early because of a significant survival advantage: absolute risk reduction for intensive care unit mortality (8.6%, 1.7%&#x02013;15% P=0.01) in the conservative oxygenation group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Even prior to these data, there has been a move in adult intensive care towards lower oxygen targets, for&#x000a0;example, SpO<sub>2</sub> 88%&#x02013;95%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>The only paediatric trial data&#x02014;in non-critically ill children with bronchiolitis&#x02014;demonstrate equivalent safety of a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) target of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;90%&#x02009;when compared with&#x000a0;&#x0003e;94%. Later hospital discharges were seen with the higher target (ratio of length of stay: 1.28, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.09 to 1.50, P=0.003).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>Current practice favours very liberal oxygen targets. We have conducted an analysis of around 7&#x02009;million SpO<sub>2</sub> values averaged over 5&#x02009;s in a single PICU: 30% of recorded values were 100% and&#x000a0;&#x0003e;60% were&#x000a0;&#x0003e;95%.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study aim</title><p>The overall aim of this study is to determine if it is feasible to perform a safe, adequately powered and affordable definitive randomised controlled trial in critically ill children comparing current practice of liberal targets for systemic oxygen levels with more conservative targets.

Many of these events are expected as a result of the infant/child&#x02019;s medical condition and standard treatment received in the PICU and may not be related to participation in the trial. Consequently, any AEs occurring as a result of the infant/child&#x02019;s medical condition or standard critical care treatment will not be reported. Pre-existing conditions do not qualify as AEs unless they worsen but should be documented in the infant/child&#x02019;s medical notes. AEs that occur between randomisation and PICU discharge must be recorded in the participant&#x02019;s medical notes and on the Oxy-PICU case report form. Those meeting the definition of a serious AE&#x000a0;(SAE) must, in addition, be recorded in the SAE log and reported to the Intensive Care National Audit &#x00026; Research Centre (ICNARC) Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), using the trial specific Oxy-PICU SAE Reporting Form, by fax within 24&#x02009;hours of observing or learning of the SAE.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Trial monitoring and oversight</title><p>The ICNARC CTU will conduct at least one monitoring visit to participating sites during the course of the pilot study.

Therefore, there is no primary outcome to be compared between the two groups and, hence, a usual power calculation to determine sample size is not appropriate. Instead, the sample size has been determined to be adequate to estimate critical parameters to be tested to a necessary degree of precision. Based on available data from PICANet, it is anticipated that the participating sites will recruit approximately 4&#x02013;10 children per month, providing a total of approximately 120 children in 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s2m2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the objectives of Oxy-PICU.

Inferences &#x02018;up&#x02019; from extremely premature infants or &#x02018;down&#x02019; from adults are in conflict and unlikely to be valid in children because of age-related differences in the acute physiological responses to hypoxia/hyperoxia and distinct comorbidities.</p><p>A clinical trial comparing current (liberal) targets for systemic oxygenation with lower (conservative) targets in critically ill children is therefore required. This pilot study is a crucial step to understand if this is possible and also affords the opportunity to learn more about the biological mechanisms underlying costs and benefits of oxygen therapy in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e369" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-019253.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our thanks to PICU study and clinical teams at the participating sites of Great Ormond Street Hospital, Southampton General Hospital and St Mary&#x02019;s Hospital in their efforts in both planning and study delivery.
