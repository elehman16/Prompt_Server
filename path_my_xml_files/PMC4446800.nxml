Shenfu injection, a Traditional Chinese Medicine injection, widely used in the adjuvant treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, shows some treatment effect in improving the symptoms and the quality of life, but it lacks the rigorous clinical evaluation of research reports. This paper describes the protocol for the clinical assessment of Shenfu injection loading in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This protocol adopts the design of a prospective, randomized, multicenter, blind imitation, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Shenfu injection loading in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to coronary heart disease. The research will be carried out in 12 hospitals in China and is expected to enroll 160 inpatients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to coronary heart disease (<italic>yang</italic> and <italic>qi</italic> deficiency syndrome). On the basis of the conventional therapy of western medicine, patients will be randomized to either the treatment group (100 ml 5% glucose injection + 50 ml Shenfu injection) or the control group (150 ml 5% glucose injection) for 7 &#x000b1; 1 days and follow-up for 28 &#x000b1; 3 days. The primary outcomes are New York Heart Association cardiac function classification and Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes. The secondary outcomes are left ventricular ejection fraction, brain natriuretic peptide level, Lee&#x02019;s heart failure score, 6-minute walking distance, and the incidence and readmission rate of cardiovascular events (including the emergency rate due to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will assess the effect of loading Shenfu injection in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure caused by coronary heart disease (<italic>yang-qi</italic> deficiency syndrome) on the symptoms and signs of heart failure, exercise tolerance, and other aspects, and observe its influence on the short-term prognosis with follow-up. The results of the study will provide clinical research evidence for application of Shenfu injection in the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered on 26 December 2012 at the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/cn/proj/show.aspx?proj=4073">ChiCTR-TRC-12002857</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0729-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Traditional Chinese medicine</kwd><kwd>Acute heart failure</kwd><kwd>Shenfu injection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic Heart failure (CHF) is a chronic progressive disease, the terminal stage of various cardiovascular diseases and a cardiac dysfunction syndrome. The condition of CHF patients will remain stable after treatment, but will also dramatically worsen under the influence of various factors (such as infection, rapid ventricular rate arrhythmia, and so forth) and appears as acute decompensated CHF (that is, acute exacerbation of CHF (AECHF)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The first guideline for diagnosis and treatment of acute heart failure (AHF) in China was promulgated in March 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. &#x0201c;AHF&#x0201d; referred to sudden onset or acute exacerbation of the original CHF, expanding the scope of AHF, and acute decompensation of CHF was included. <italic>The diagnosis and treatment guideline for heart failure of China in 2014</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] indicates that AHF is the main cause of hospitalization in patients whose age has exceeded 65 years, most of them with acute exacerbation based on the original CHF.</p><p>A study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] which retrospectively analyzed 10,714 hospitalized cases retrieved from 42 hospitals in China over three different time periods (the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s) showed that patients hospitalized for CHF accounted for about 16.3 to 17.9% of those with cardiovascular disease. The primary cause of CHF was coronary heart disease (CHD), most of the cardiac function of HF was grade III(42.5 to 43.7%),and the main cause of death in heart failure patients was left heart failure (59%).</p><p>The treatment for AECHF, according to the guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is the same as the treatment for AHF, includes: general treatment (such as oxygen therapy, controlling the intake and output, and so forth); medical treatment (such as diuretics which can reduce cardiac load and improve symptoms); treatment with drugs or/and non-drug therapy for the main disease and complications depending on patient&#x02019;s conditions. The symptoms of AECHF can be alleviated over a short period using simple western medicine treatment, shown by improvement in heart function, hemodynamic indices and biological indices. Presently, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment for AECHF is still secondary to western medicine, and TCM injection, such as Shenfu injection (SFI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Shenmai injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] ,are commonly used by TCM syndrome.</p><p>A retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that the main TCM syndrome of CHF was deficiency of <italic>qi</italic>, with <italic>yang</italic> or/and <italic>yin</italic>. The result of a TCM syndrome survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that CHF was divided into two types: <italic>qi-yang</italic> deficiency with blood stasis and/or phlegm retention; and <italic>qi-yin</italic> deficiency with blood stasis and/or phlegm retention. The pattern of syndrome change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was <italic>qi</italic> deficiency &#x02192; <italic>qi</italic> deficiency, <italic>qi-yin</italic> deficiency &#x02192;<italic>qi-yang</italic> deficiency with blood stasis and/or phlegm retention.</p><p>Based on the ancient prescription of Shenfu Decoction, SFI is composed of the extracts of red ginseng and Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata using modern technology. The active ingredients include Ginsenoside and Aconitine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which have the function of supplementing <italic>qi</italic>, avoiding collapse and reviving <italic>yang</italic>. SFI was an officially approved product in 1987 (approval code: certification number Z20043117; norm: 50 ml per bottle). Many clinical reports indicated that SFI was convenient for emergency use and had the advantages of rapid effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], strengthening the heart, improving heart function, protecting vascular endothelial cells, regulating immune function, anti-inflammation and improving ability of hypoxia tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this trial is to observe the influence of heart function and TCM syndrome and to assess the short-term effectiveness and safety in patients with AECHF due to CHD (<italic>yang-qi</italic> deficiency syndrome) treated with SFI loading.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, blind imitation, placebo-controlled trial.

TCM syndrome is evaluated by grading the quantitative score according to the primary symptoms and secondary symptoms.
