NEPA is a new oral fixed-dose combination of 300 mg netupitant, a highly selective NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (RA) and 0.50 mg palonosetron (PALO), a pharmacologically and clinically distinct 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA, which targets dual antiemetic pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel group phase III study (NCT01339260) in 1455 chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients receiving moderately emetogenic (anthracycline&#x02013;cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of NEPA versus a single oral dose (0.50 mg) of PALO. All patients also received oral dexamethasone (DEX) on day 1 only (12 mg in the NEPA arm and 20 mg in the PALO arm).

Combination antiemetic regimens targeting multiple molecular pathways associated with emesis have become the standard of care for prevention of CINV. This is supported by compelling clinical research and antiemetic guidelines [<xref rid="MDU101C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="MDU101C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which recommend a prophylactic combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (RA) [palonosetron (PALO) as &#x02018;preferred&#x02019;] and dexamethasone (DEX) when administering moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA, DEX and a neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) RA when administering highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC).</p><p>Anthracycline&#x02013;cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy is still considered to be moderately emetogenic according to regulatory authorities and evidence-based emetogenicity classification schemes [<xref rid="MDU101C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Patients receiving AC tend to have additional patient-related risk factors (e.g. young age, female gender) which put them at greater risk for CINV; studies have shown that the addition of a NK<sub>1</sub> RA to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA and DEX regimen is beneficial in this setting [<xref rid="MDU101C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, guidelines recommend that this group of patients also receive a triple-combination antiemetic therapy on day 1.</p><p>While data support the reputed notion that guideline conformity will improve CINV control for patients, unfortunately, adherence to antiemetic guidelines is suboptimal [<xref rid="MDU101C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, even with effective agents available, many patients still suffer from CINV, particularly nausea during the delayed (25&#x02013;120 h) phase following chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDU101C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>NEPA is an oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant (NETU), a new highly selective NK<sub>1</sub> RA and PALO, a pharmacologically distinct [<xref rid="MDU101C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and clinically superior [<xref rid="MDU101C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA. The unique pharmacological characteristics of PALO result in long-lasting inhibition of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor function. PALO has also been shown to inhibit the cross-talk between the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK<sub>1</sub> receptors and, recently, the combination of PALO with NETU has been shown to work synergistically in enhancing inhibition of the substance <italic>P</italic> response compared with either antagonist alone [<xref rid="MDU101C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These findings offer a possible explanation behind its unique efficacy during the delayed phase and also suggest the potential to enhance prevention of delayed CINV when used in combination with NETU.</p><p>In a phase II dose-ranging study [<xref rid="MDU101C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in patients receiving HEC, the NEPA combination of NETU 300 mg + PALO 0.50 mg was the most effective dose studied, with an incremental clinical benefit over lower NEPA doses for all efficacy end points. This was the basis for the selection of the fixed-dose combination in the current trial. This phase III study was designed to demonstrate the superiority of NEPA over PALO in preventing CINV in patients receiving AC-based MEC and to evaluate NEPA's safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdu101_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><sec id="mdu101_s2a"><title>study design</title><p>This was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study conducted at 177 enrolling sites in 15 countries (Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and the United States) between April 2011 and November 2012.

Patients were not to have had any serious cardiovascular disease history or predisposition to cardiac conduction abnormalities, with the exception of incomplete right bundle branch block. Because NETU is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, use of any CYP3A4 inducer within 4 weeks, use of a strong or moderate inhibitor within 1 week or scheduled to receive CYP3A4 inhibitors, inducers or certain substrates as concomitant medication was prohibited (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdu101/-/DC1">supplementary Table S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="mdu101_s2c"><title>treatment</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either NEPA (NETU 300 mg/PALO 0.50 mg) plus 12 mg DEX or PALO 0.50 mg plus 20 mg DEX on day 1 of chemotherapy. Due to the increased exposure to DEX when given in combination with NETU [<xref rid="MDU101C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the DEX dose in the NEPA group was reduced to achieve DEX exposure similar to that in the PALO group.

A single day 1 dose of NEPA along with DEX only on day 1 seems suitable for prevention of CINV through the 5 days after chemotherapy.</p><p>This large, phase III, registration study was designed to demonstrate the superiority of NEPA over PALO in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients receiving AC-based MEC. NEPA significantly improved CR rates compared with PALO during all phases after chemotherapy, with the incremental benefit being greatest during the delayed and overall phases. Regardless of the efficacy end-point, NEPA was consistently superior to PALO during the 5-day period following chemotherapy. In particular, NEPA resulted in significantly greater no emesis rates during all phases and no significant nausea and complete protection rates during the delayed and overall phases. The consistent superiority of NEPA over PALO across all end points during the delayed phase is particularly opportune, in that patients are protected during a period which has remained a challenge in most clinical settings.</p><p>Control of delayed nausea does not reach the same level of benefit as that of emesis and remains a clinical unmet need [<xref rid="MDU101C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="MDU101C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although it was a secondary end point, it is encouraging that NEPA demonstrated a delayed nausea benefit which was also seen in the phase II trial in patients receiving cisplatin-based HEC [<xref rid="MDU101C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], providing additional support of its efficacy. The utilization of the FLIE instrument confirmed that by improving control of CINV, NEPA significantly reduced the impact of CINV on patients' functioning. This was seen consistently in all domains of the FLIE assessment.</p><p>As DEX may be associated with a range of side-effects, there is particular interest in minimizing its dose/frequency, especially in patients who experience DEX-related side-effects. Consistent with the recommendation by MASCC/ESMO in the AC setting, DEX was given on day 1 only. Therefore, the complete antiemetic regimen in this study was administered just before chemotherapy. In a study in a similar population of chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve breast cancer patients, a single dose of PALO plus DEX on day 1 showed similar CR rates as PALO (day 1) plus DEX (day 1&#x02013;3) [<xref rid="MDU101C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (the recommended antiemetic regimen in AC at the time of the study). The authors speculated that the unique pharmacology of PALO may have explained the extended protection in the delayed phase, without the need for multiple day DEX. The response rates seen in the current trial were generally higher than those seen in prior NK<sub>1</sub> RA trials [<xref rid="MDU101C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] where DEX was administered on day 1 only concomitantly with an older generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA. The present result validates the guideline recommendations of a single day of DEX in patients receiving AC and provides encouraging evidence that DEX beyond day 1 is not necessary when using NEPA in patients at higher risk for CINV.</p><p>While AC are still classified by some guideline groups as chemotherapy that present a moderate emetic risk, although separately from other MEC [<xref rid="MDU101C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], other committees developing antiemetic guidelines have included AC in the high-risk category [<xref rid="MDU101C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is a simplification related to the fact that the same NK<sub>1</sub>RA/5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA/DEX treatment is recommended for both HEC and AC, while, in other MEC, the use of NK<sub>1</sub>RAs is an option which varies according to the perceived risk. There is already limited data on how NEPA performs in a non-AC MEC population [<xref rid="MDU101C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As already demonstrated in the large phase II trial, NEPA was very well tolerated with a comparable adverse event profile to PALO. There was a very low incidence of treatment-related adverse events, none of which led to discontinuation and no serious treatment-related adverse events or deaths for NEPA-treated patients. There were no cardiac safety concerns for either NEPA or PALO based on cardiac AEs/ECGs.</p><p>In conclusion, NEPA resulted in superior prevention of CINV than PALO in patients receiving MEC. As a combination agent targeting dual antiemetic pathways, a single dose of NEPA plus DEX offers convenient guideline-based prophylaxis. This provides an opportunity to overcome barriers interfering with guideline adherence and in doing so offers promise for improving control of CINV for patients.</p></sec><sec id="mdu101_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by Helsinn Healthcare, SA who provided the study drugs and the funding for this study.</p></sec><sec id="mdu101_s6"><title>disclosure</title><p>The authors have the following conflicts of interest to disclose: MA: consultant for Amgen, BMS, Celgene, GSK, Helsinn Healthcare, JnJ, Novartis, Merck, Merck Serono, Pfizer, Pierre Fabre, Roche, Sandoz, Teva and Vifor; received honoraria for symposia lectures for Amgen, Bayer Schering, Cephalon, Chugai, GSK, Helsinn Healthcare, Hospira, Ipsen, JnJ OrthoBiotech, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Pierre Fabre, Roche, Sandoz, Sanofi, Teva and Vifor.
