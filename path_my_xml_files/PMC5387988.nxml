We have demonstrated the efficacy of a brief behavioural intervention for children with ADHD in a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) and now aim to examine whether this intervention is effective in real-life clinical settings when delivered by paediatricians or psychologists. We will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Children aged 5&#x02013;12&#x02005;years with ADHD (n=320) are being recruited for this translational cluster RCT through paediatrician practices in Victoria and Queensland, Australia. Children are eligible if they meet criteria for ADHD, have a moderate/severe sleep problem and meet American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria for either chronic insomnia disorder or delayed sleep&#x02013;wake phase disorder; or are experiencing sleep-related anxiety. Clinicians are randomly allocated at the level of the paediatrician to either receive the sleep training or not. The behavioural intervention comprises 2 consultations covering sleep hygiene and standardised behavioural strategies. The primary outcome is change in the proportion of children with moderate/severe sleep problems from moderate/severe to no/mild by parent report at 3&#x02005;months postintervention. Secondary outcomes include a range of child (eg, sleep severity, ADHD symptoms, quality of life, behaviour, working memory, executive functioning, learning, academic achievement) and primary caregiver (mental health, parenting, work attendance) measures. Analyses will address clustering at the level of the paediatrician using linear mixed effect models adjusting for potential a priori confounding variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been granted. Findings will determine whether the benefits of an efficacy trial can be realised more broadly at the population level and will inform the development of clinical guidelines for managing sleep problems in this population. We will seek to publish in leading international paediatric journals, present at major conferences and through established clinician networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN50834814">ISRCTN50834814</ext-link>, Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>effectiveness</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>child</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1058827</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First translational trial to determine whether a brief, behavioural sleep intervention has benefits for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when delivered in &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; clinical settings by paediatricians and psychologists.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The inclusion of blinded teacher reports, as well as blinded direct assessment measures to minimise bias.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inclusion of economic analyses, which provide data on the cost-effectiveness of the programme.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limited generalisability to non-English-speaking families and children with ADHD presenting with serious medical conditions and/or intellectual disability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sleep problems assessed using non-blinded parent report as opposed to objective measures.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep problems are common and more persistent in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and associated with poorer child and family well-being.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> Efficacy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that sleep problems are amenable to intervention<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;10</xref> in children with ADHD, particularly behavioural interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> However, it is unknown whether the same benefits will be observed when such interventions are delivered by practitioners in &#x02018;real life&#x02019; clinical settings.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> compared with 20&#x02013;30% of children in the general population.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Sleep problems experienced by children with ADHD largely comprise difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, with the most common sleep problems being difficulty falling asleep (reported by 84% of parents of children who report a sleep problem for their child with ADHD), bedtime resistance (68%), tiredness on waking (62%) and difficulty waking in the morning (56%).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Medical conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can also affect sleep in children with ADHD, although behavioural sleep problems appear more common.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this study, we use the term sleep problems to denote those difficulties that can be addressed using behavioural intervention. Sleep problems have been associated with worse functioning for children with ADHD, including poorer quality of life (QoL), behaviour, daily functioning and working memory, as well as increased school absenteeism.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

Keshavarzi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that a 12-week sleep training programme for children with ADHD aged 10&#x02005;years (n=40) had beneficial effects for sleep and psychosocial functioning when compared with controls with ADHD who did not receive the intervention (n=20) and typically developing children (n=20). However, the professional group responsible for delivering the intervention was not reported. Corkum <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> also recently reported the beneficial effects of their distance sleep intervention delivered by paraprofessionals for childhood insomnia in a mixed sample of children with and without ADHD (n=61).

We are now testing the translation of this programme at the population level by training community paediatricians and psychologists to deliver this sleep intervention to children with ADHD and sleep problems. If this intervention can be translated successfully to the population level within existing workforces, then this would have the real potential to improve outcomes for children with ADHD and their families. If cost-effective, it could be readily incorporated into the existing health system.</p><p>Paediatricians are the main care providers for ADHD in Australia.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The paediatrician's role includes the assessment and treatment (behavioural and medication-based) of ADHD and associated comorbidities (including sleep problems, if identified). Visits to a paediatrician are subsidised by Australia's Medicare scheme; however, families may experience out-of-pocket costs for these visits. Paediatricians (and general practitioners) may also refer children to a psychologist in the community to manage comorbid behaviours.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In Australia, this referral is facilitated by the Medicare Better Access to Mental Health Scheme, which provides subsidised access to up to 10 psychology sessions in a calendar year, provided the criteria for a DSM condition are met. We have deliberately designed our sleep intervention, so that it is feasible for paediatricians and psychologists to deliver within the Australian Medicare scheme and within their typical consultation durations.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>Building on our efficacy trial, we aim to determine whether the Sleeping Sound with ADHD intervention, delivered by paediatricians or psychologists in their usual work setting, can replicate the benefits of the efficacy trial.

By signing the MOU, paediatricians agree to: (1) participate in training if randomised to the intervention arm; (2) deliver the sleep programme to intervention families <italic>or</italic> refer the child to a psychologist to deliver the sleep programme if allocated to the intervention; (3) not share the intervention materials with control group paediatricians if allocated to the intervention; and (4) allocate time for intervention session bookings.</p><p>Once paediatricians have been recruited, psychologists are invited to whom the paediatricians have indicated they refer patients. Psychologists are only recruited for the intervention arm of the project and have no contact with control participants. The research team then informs psychologists about the study via email or phone. The researchers then send psychologists who express interest in participating a follow-up email thanking them for their interest and asking them to sign an individual MOU, agreeing to: (1) participate in training; (2) deliver the sleep programme to intervention families referred by paediatricians; (3) use intervention materials only with children enrolled in the study; and (4) not share the intervention materials with any other families they see during the study period.

Common comorbidities, including internalising/externalising disorder and autism spectrum disorder, are not excluded.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parents with insufficient English language proficiency to complete study documentation and/or participate in the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participated in our original efficacy trial.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size planning is based on the primary outcome<italic>,</italic> the proportion of children for whom parents no longer report moderate/severe sleep problems at 3&#x02005;months. In the efficacy study, at 3&#x02005;months, 56% and 30% of parents in the intervention and control group, respectively, reported that their child's sleep was still a moderate/severe problem, that is, a difference of 26%. We conservatively assume a smaller difference of 20%, that is, 56% vs 36% to be observed in this trial. In order to have 80% power in detecting this difference at a two-sided type 1 error level of 5%, a group sample size of 107 individuals (total sample size n=214) is required. As this is a cluster controlled trial (clustered at the level of the paediatrician to minimise contamination), we will inflate our sample size by a design effect of 1.2 where the design effect=1+(n&#x02212;1)r with n=3 (the number of children seen by each paediatrician) and r=0.1 (the conservatively assumed intracluster correlation coefficient, based on our efficacy RCT). Allowing for 20% drop out to 3&#x02005;months and accounting for clustering, we need to recruit 160 children in each study arm (total sample size n=320). All recruitment procedures described have been used in our previous trials to achieve similar recruitment numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation occurs at the level of the paediatrician. Paediatricians are randomly allocated to either receive the sleep training or not by an independent researcher, thereby avoiding potential contamination if all paediatricians were to be trained in the programme. Randomisation is based on a pregenerated group allocation sequence from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute's Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit and is stratified by location of the paediatrician (regional or metropolitan area). The randomisation is also stratified by the predicted number of enrolled patients (&#x0003c;10 and 10 or more). Paediatricians, families and researchers are blind to group allocation at the time of recruitment.</p><p>If the paediatrician is assigned to the intervention group and has more than four patients enrolled, families are randomised to receive the intervention from either the paediatrician or psychologist. This second step of randomisation takes place after family recruitment is complete. The research team then sends the paediatrician a letter informing them of whether they will be receiving the sleep training or not. In addition, participating families are also sent a letter informing them of whether they will be receiving the sleep intervention or not.</p><p>Families of children attending a paediatrician randomised to the control group receive &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; which involves seeing their paediatrician as per usual regarding their child's ADHD. Our research has shown that this does not routinely include addressing sleep issues.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Australia, paediatricians typically see children with ADHD every 6&#x02005;months to check their height, weight, blood pressure and reissue a script for medication (valid for 6&#x02005;months), where necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Intervention training</title><p>The intervention is designed to be feasible to deliver in paediatricians' and psychologists' practice.
