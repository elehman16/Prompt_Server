Patients will be randomly allocated to Traumeel, dexamethasone or placebo in a 2:2:1 randomization. After 1&#x000a0;week screening, patients will receive 3 injections at weekly intervals (days 1, 8 and 15) with additional follow-up assessments on day 22, a telephone consultation in week 9 and a final visit at week 15. Male and female patients aged 40 to 65&#x000a0;years, inclusive, will be recruited if they have acute episodes of chronic rotator cuff syndrome and/or bursitis. Patients with calcifications in the shoulder joint or a complete rotator cuff tear will be excluded. At least 160 patients will be recruited. All subacromial injections will be performed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a common technique. The only rescue medication permitted will be paracetamol (acetaminophen), with usage recorded. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in abduction-rotation pain visual analog scale (0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mm scale, 0 corresponds to no pain and 100 to extreme pain) at day 22 (Traumeel injections versus dexamethasone injections) for active external rotation. Secondary efficacy parameters include range of motion, disability of arm, shoulder, hand score and patient&#x02019;s/investigator&#x02019;s global assessment. Clinical efficacy will be assessed as non-inferiority of Traumeel with respect to dexamethasone regarding the primary efficacy parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is hoped that the results of this trial will expand the treatment options and evidence base available for the management of rotator cuff disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01702233">NCT01702233</ext-link>.

It accounts for almost 3 million patient visits each year in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A wide range of potential pathoanatomic entities, from simple sprains to massive rotator cuff tears, can give rise to shoulder pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The majority of these conditions can be managed with conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and conservative therapy can include a number of novel treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rotator cuff dysfunction is a particularly important entity because it occurs frequently, and indicative with complete tear, may necessitate surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The shoulder has the greatest range of motion (ROM) of any joint in the human body. Size mismatch between the smaller glenoid and larger humeral head creates a risk of instability. Stability is provided both statically by the capsule and labrum, and dynamically by the rotator cuff musculature. Dysfunction of any of these structures can lead to pain, weakness, and instability.</p><p>The rotator cuff is a musculo-tendinous confluence of four muscles that initiate shoulder motion and maintain the normal relationship between the articular surfaces. The supraspinatus muscle provides abduction, the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles provide external rotation, and the subscapularis muscle provides internal rotation. In addition, the muscles of the rotator cuff balance the forces of other shoulder muscles, most importantly the deltoid muscle. Contraction of the deltoid muscle in the absence of supraspinatus function leads to superior translocation of the humeral head, making wide abduction difficult.</p><p>Non-operative treatment for shoulder pain due to rotator cuff impingement and tears generally includes appropriate physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injections, and other approaches. Meta-analyses of trials of subacromial injection of corticosteroids for rotator cuff disease have shown a beneficial effect over placebo, while evidence for other interventions is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The importance of the accuracy of injecting the subacromial bursa with corticosteroids was highlighted by a study by Henkus <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showing that despite the confidence of physicians, without guidance many subacromial injections hit surrounding structures. However, only injection directly into the subacromial bursa resulted in significant pain relief and increase in functional scores. Marder <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] further supported these findings and found that the rate of accuracy varied with route of injection, and anterior and lateral routes are more accurate than the posterior route. Due to potential variance in accuracy of subacromial injection between physicians, ultrasound-guided injections utilizing a common method have been used for this study.</p><p>Traumeel (Tr14) injection solution is a combination formula of 12 botanical and 2 mineral substances with demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous, anti-exudative properties. The exact mechanism of action of Tr14 injection solution is still to be fully understood. Various cellular and biochemical pathways appear to be modulated by the ingredients. It has been suggested that Tr14 injection solution does not inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX) or lipoxygenase enzyme pathways, as is the case with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the rat model of blood-induced inflammation, Tr14 injection solution significantly reduced hind paw induced-edema and decreased IL-6 production. The authors suggested that Tr14 injection solution seems to act by speeding up the healing process instead of blocking the development of edema from the beginning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additional basic research is currently underway to further elucidate Tr14 injection solution&#x02019;s mechanism of action.</p><p>Tr14 injection solution has been shown to be effective for hemarthrosis of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], epicondylitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and various musculoskeletal injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, no large study with Tr14 injection solution has been performed so far in patients with rotator cuff syndrome and bursitis. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Tr14 injection solution injections versus corticosteroid injections in the treatment of rotator cuff syndrome and bursitis and expand the current evidence base for the conservative treatment of the rotator cuff syndrome. It is hoped that the results of this trial will expand the treatment options available to clinicians for the treatment of rotator cuff syndrome, allowing greater patient choice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 16-week, three-arm, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Tr14 injection solution 2&#x000a0;ml injection versus dexamethasone 8&#x000a0;mg injection versus placebo (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

All investigators were trained in ultrasound-guided injection technique at an investigator&#x02019;s meeting in Ghent, Belgium, to ensure consistency of administration. The patient is placed in a supine position to reduce any risk of syncope during the procedure. Ultrasound guidance using a sagittal view (7 till 14&#x000a0;MHz) obtained over the lateral edge of the shoulder is used to guide the injection into the subacromial bursa with the ultrasound probe used in a long-axis lateral view. A narrow gauge needle should be used (22&#x02013;30 gauge). The needle is advanced until its tip penetrates the bursal cavity. Images are taken before and after injection, showing distension of the bursa following injection of the product.

However, as crystalline corticosteroids, the appearance of these products in the vial is considerably different to Tr14 injection solution. Dexamethasone was chosen as the comparator corticosteroid as visually the solution is similar to Tr14 injection solution, thus aiding blinding of those administering the injections. The dose of dexamethasone was chosen to provide equivalence to 40&#x000a0;mg methylprednisolone acetate or 40&#x000a0;mg triamcinolone acetonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This dose of dexamethasone also provided a 2&#x000a0;ml injection, which was the same as the quantity of Tr14 injection solution to be used, again assisting blinding. A once-weekly dosing interval was chosen as an appropriate time interval to allow comparison with other injection therapies. A total of three injections was chosen as, in clinical practice, if there are no signs of improvement after 3&#x000a0;weeks of injections, it is unlikely that treatment would be continued.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, dexamethasone has only been investigated in shoulder injuries on two previous occasions, first by Plafki <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using 4&#x000a0;mg dexamethasone-21-palmitat (equivalent to 2.5&#x000a0;mg dexamethasone) injected into the subacromial bursa once with ultrasound guidance for the treatment of subacromial impingement. This study was hindered by the need to stop the local anesthetic only arm of the study due to pain aggravation in some patients rendering the arm ethically unacceptable. However, results in both dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetate (10&#x000a0;mg) treatment groups were similar, suggesting that dexamethasone can provide similar results to triamcinolone acetate. The authors conclude that subacromial steroid injections could prevent the need for surgery in at least half of patients with chronic subacromial impingement syndrome.</p><p>The second study by Shibata <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was conducted in patients with full thickness rotator cuff tear, which was a specific exclusion criterion for our study, so the results, although positive, are not of relevance to our study population.</p><p>There has been some concern that subacromial corticosteroid injections could be detrimental to the recovery of the rotator cuff tendon. Animal studies have shown detrimental effects of repeated corticosteroid injections on the rotator cuff of rats. Consequent damage to the ultrastructure of collagen molecules has been shown experimentally to weaken collagen fibers and precipitate rotator cuff injuries, with authors suggesting that this could translate into humans, so caution should be exercised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a study by Bhatia <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggests that corticosteroid use in patients with subacromial impingement should not be considered a causative factor in rotator cuff tears. This retrospective, case-controlled study compared patients with subacromial impingement syndrome according to the number of subacromial corticosteroid injections they had received (less than three versus three or more). Analysis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of rotator cuff tear (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.0).</p><p>These concerns serve to highlight the potential need for an effective and safe treatment for rotator cuff syndrome that is not associated with potential detrimental effects on the rotator cuff tendon. In a previous non-randomized, observational study, Tr14 injection solution injections were found to be non-inferior to NSAID injections (mainly diclofenac) for the treatment of epicondylitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority, markedly greater improvements in pain at rest, change in extensional joint mobility and change in torsional joint mobility were observed, along with greater satisfaction and better tolerability reports from patients for Tr14 injection solution versus NSAID injections. This current study has been designed to investigate whether Tr14 injection solution could provide an effective alternative to corticosteroids with the potential for a better safety profile. This could expand the range of treatments available to clinicians for the treatment of rotator cuff syndrome, providing greater patient choice.</p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines on &#x02018;Optimizing the Management of Rotator Cuff Problems&#x02019; state that they cannot recommend for or against the use of subacromial corticosteroid injections in the treatment of rotator-cuff-related symptoms in the absence of full thickness tear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is due to a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. There is even less evidence about the efficacy of natural medications. It is hoped that the results of this trial will assist in providing more evidence to support physicians in their management of rotator cuff disease. Investigation of the efficacy and place in therapy of Tr14 injection solution is ongoing with further randomized-controlled trials underway.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>AAOS</term><def><p>American academy of orthopaedic surgeons</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMH</term><def><p>Cochran-mantel-haenszel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COX</term><def><p>Cyclo-oxygenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COX-2</term><def><p>Cyclo-oxygenase type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASH</term><def><p>Disability of arm: shoulder: hand</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>European union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMP</term><def><p>Good manufacturing practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA<sub>1c</sub></term><def><p>Glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International conference on harmonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IUD</term><def><p>Intrauterine device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>Last observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDRA</term><def><p>Medical dictionary for regulatory activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROM</term><def><p>Range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TENS</term><def><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tr14</term><def><p>Traumeel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WMA</term><def><p>World medical assembly</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Luc Vanden Bossche (LVB) is a consultant/advisor to the Traumeel Scientific Advisory Board for Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH.
