Overall, 19% (1,181/6,361) of children had a surgical need and 62% (738/1,181) of these children had at least one unmet need. Based on these estimates, the number of children living with a surgical need in these four LMICs is estimated at 3.7 million (95% CI: 3.4, 4.0 million). The highest percentage of unmet surgical conditions included head, face, and neck conditions, followed by conditions in the extremities.

Many pediatric conditions requiring surgery carry the risk of life-long disability or higher risk of mortality given that the conditions arise during the years of critical development[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, children represent a population with unique surgical needs, including anesthetic, perioperative, and postoperative capacity requirements.</p><p>While recent attention to global surgery has been expanding, the burden of conditions requiring surgery among the highly vulnerable pediatric age group is relatively unknown, particularly within LMICs. Although children make up approximately 50% of the total population in LMICs, there is little focus on childhood surgical conditions and attention has instead been on infectious diseases and obstetric care[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although these efforts aimed on reducing infectious diseases and increasing obstetric care are certainly notable, approximately 85% of children in LMICs will have a surgically-treatable condition by the age of 15[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], thus highlighting the immense need for research and interventions aimed at reducing these burdens and providing quality surgical care when needed.</p><p>In the recent landmark publication, Lancet Global Surgery 2030[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], researchers outlined a goal of providing safe, affordable surgical and anesthetic care in LMICs. Precise and accurate identification of the burden of pediatric surgical need is essential to attain this goal and can assist healthcare workers and policy makers in identifying areas with the most need. Likewise, quantification of the pediatric burden will inform targeted and tailored interventions in LMICs. Previous attempts at quantifying pediatric surgical burden have been done within healthcare systems[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which neglect to include those without access to the healthcare system. Only 6.3% of surgical procedures conducted worldwide occurred in LMICs. Thus, hospital-based estimates of children in need of surgical care likely underestimates the needs for the population as a whole since many children never reach the hospital for care. A community-based estimate would provide a more refined and accurate estimate of the global pediatric surgical burden.</p><p>The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) tool was developed to provide a population-based household survey assessing the prevalence of surgically treatable conditions in LMICs and has been conducted in Nepal, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Uganda. We evaluated the surveys within these countries to quantify the pediatric surgical need and identify predictors of treated surgical conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data was collected by the SOSAS survey, a validated cross-sectional, cluster-based population survey in four countries: Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The survey was administered in Rwanda in 2011, Sierra Leone in 2012, Nepal in 2014, and Uganda in 2014. Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are low-income countries with vastly different child health indicators than the United States (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170968.t001">Table 1</xref>). Life expectancy is lower than the United States by 29 years in Sierra Leone, 19 years in Uganda, 16 years in Rwanda, and 10 years in Nepal. The percentage of the population under the poverty line is much higher in all 4 countries, with the highest percentage in Sierra Leone (53%) followed by Rwanda (23%). Neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality rates per 1,000 live births are 5 to 17 times higher than the US rates. Compared to the US population where 19% is under the age of 15, 34% to 48% of the 4 LMIC populations are under 15.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0170968.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0170968.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Child health indicators and surgery providers in 4 low- and middle-income countries compared to US.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0170968.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0170968.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nepal</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rwanda</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sierra Leone</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Uganda</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">United States</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life expectancy at birth (years)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (%)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neonatal mortality rate (per 1000 live births)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infant mortality rate (per 1000 live births)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live births)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Population under 15 years of age (%)<sup>12</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surgical physician density (per 100,000 population)<sup>15</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.73</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pediatric surgeons (number)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,150[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>NA: data not available.</p></fn><fn id="t001fn002"><p>*Personal communications with local surgical partners.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Modifications to the SOSAS survey within each country were minimal with the exception of language adaptations and the addition of a physical examination in the Nepalese survey for validation of the survey[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Survey clusters were randomly selected in a two-stage process with a probability adjustment for population size and geographic stratification into rural and urban populations. Physicians, medical interns, and students from medical, nursing, and public health schools (Rwanda, Nepal, and Sierra Leone) or experienced data collectors (Uganda) were trained to administer the survey to separate households within the 4 countries. During the study period, collected data was reviewed by field supervisors to ensure quality of data and identify any data collection inconsistencies between interviewers. The survey contained components capturing household level characteristics, such as household demographics and information on deaths within the household during the previous 12 months, individual level characteristics, such as the presence of surgical conditions, clinical characteristics of surgical conditions, healthcare seeking behavior, and area level characteristics, such as availability of treatment facilities.</p><p>Children were defined as persons between the ages of 0 to 18 years. The head of household and each individual participant prior to initiating the survey provided informed consent. A parent or guardian provided consent for all participants younger than 18 years old, and children ages 8 to 18 provided assent. For the majority of children, parents answered questions about their children. For older children, who were asked to answer sensitive reproductive health questions, parents assisted in answering questions if the child assented to having a parent present for the interview.</p><p>A surgical need was self-reported (with the assistance of parents when necessary) by the survey respondents and included all cases that were considered to need a surgical consultation. Healthcare facilities were defined as primary (a facility without a functioning operating room), secondary (a facility with a functioning operating room), and tertiary (a facility with a functioning operating room and a minimum of a surgical specialist, such as a general surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, gynecologist, or urologist). Care provided at a healthcare facility by a physician or a nurse was defined as modern healthcare, while care provided by a traditional healer outside of a healthcare facility was defined as traditional health care. A minor surgical procedure was defined as a procedure that required no anesthesia or local anesthesia and major surgical procedure was defined as a procedure requiring regional or general anesthesia. Met need covered any surgically-treatable condition that was reported as having had surgical care, minor or major, in the past. Unmet need refers to any condition that is surgically treatable, and the respondent did not seek healthcare, sought healthcare but could not receive surgical care, or had persistent, untreated complications/sequela from receiving surgical care. Transportation costs in Rwandan francs, Sierra Leonean leones, Nepalese rupees, and Ugandan shillings were converted to US dollars and set to equivalent 2016 value.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Demographic data, clinical characteristics of surgical needs, and healthcare seeking behavior variables were compared between the 4 countries, using a weighted model to account of sampling biases and cluster sampling design within each country. Significance testing was achieved by &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> or ANOVA and set at p&#x0003c;0.05. Predictors of having a met surgical condition were analyzed through a multivariate logistic regression model with reported odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Research ethics approval was obtained from the scientific review boards of each country, as well as the collaborating institutions for each country.

In this study, wounds, burns, and extremity conditions were more likely to be treated compared to congenital deformities, abdominal conditions, or head and neck conditions. General practitioners can meet much of the pediatric surgical need including burns, wound debridement, and suturing. However, conditions requiring more specialized care, such as congenital deformities, intra-abdominal tumors, and hydrocephalus require a specialized pediatric surgeon.</p><p>There is a large deficiency in providers trained in pediatric surgical care in areas of great need, with many countries lacking any providers[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our study, unmet pediatric surgical needs were highest in Sierra Leone, a country with no pediatric surgeons and a surgical physician density of 0.18 per 100,000 people[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, 17% of children in Uganda had a surgical need but reside in a country with 4 practicing pediatric surgeons and a surgical physician density of 0.73 surgeon physicians per 100,000 people. Similar conclusions can be drawn for Nepal and Rwanda, countries with fewer than 1 surgical physician or pediatric surgeon per 100,000 people. In addition to provider shortages, there is also a maldistribution of the surgical workforce with most of the doctors concentrated in urban areas[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This contributes to a lack of access to surgical care for children due to lengthy travel and poor road conditions. In our study, 78% of children lived in rural areas, highlighting the great need to increase access in remote areas throughout LMICs.</p><p>This study has several limitations. As previously discussed[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the SOSAS survey is a household based survey that relies on self-reported symptoms and patient recollection of medical care. There is a lack of specificity to surgical disease descriptions, which does not allow for specifically identifying types of surgical disease. The SOSAS survey is able to identify need for surgical consultation but cannot provide accurate and specific enough data to clearly identify how many pediatric surgeons would be adequate to meet the need in low-income countries. Although reliance on self-reporting is a criticism of population-based health assessment methodologies, the SOSAS assessment was compared with a visual examination by a physician with agreement in 94.6% of cases[<xref rid="pone.0170968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The pediatric population is growing in low-income countries where over 50% of the population is less than 15 years of age. As such, progress in delivery of surgical care will require specifically targeting delivery of pediatric surgical care. This analysis of the SOSAS survey in four low-income countries is a starting point to identify that there is a large unmet need and investments must be made to increase surgical capacity, decrease barriers to care, and develop innovative solutions to provide pediatric surgical care in these resource limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec009"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170968.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Survey_English_SOSAS 2014 04 20.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170968.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledgments the following members of the SOSAS 4 Country Research Group: Shailvi Gupta, MD, MPH, Joseph Canner, MHS, Tu M.
