Despite these advantages, the focus on decreasing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with T1DM also presents the risk of increased rates of hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, leading to impaired hypoglycaemia awareness <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> affecting many aspects of patient well-being that can reduce treatment adherence and lead to suboptimal glycaemic control <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia can impair quality of sleep, increase fatigue and cause morning headaches <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Moreover, people with T1DM have impaired plasma epinephrine responses to hypoglycaemia, with an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia, especially during sleep <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Basal insulin analogues have been developed to provide a long duration of action to cover insulin requirements over an extended period of time while providing a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Insulin detemir (IDet) and insulin glargine (IGlar) are basal insulin analogues that have shown a longer duration of action and a decreased risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly nocturnal, compared to neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. IDet and IGlar have similar time&#x02013;action profiles <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and produce similar levels of glycaemic control <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, but IDet is associated with less variability in plasma glucose (PG) than both IGlar and NPH insulin <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a novel basal insulin with an ultra-long, flat and stable action profile. Upon subcutaneous injection, IDeg forms soluble multihexamers that slowly and steadily dissociate and release insulin monomers into the circulation. This results in a stable and consistent glucose-lowering effect of &#x0003e;42 h at steady state <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and lower rates of hypoglycaemia than IGlar <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In this BEGIN Basal&#x02013;bolus Type 1 trial being part of the phase 3a programme for IDeg, we compared the efficacy and safety of IDeg with IDet, both administered once daily (OD) in a basal&#x02013;bolus regimen with rapid-acting insulin aspart (IAsp) as mealtime insulin in participants with T1DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design and Participants</title><p>This 26-week randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial was conducted between 22 February 2010 and 8 December 2010 and included participants from clinical sites in Brazil, Finland, India, Italy, Japan, Macedonia and the UK. Adults (&#x02265;18 years or &#x02265;20 years for Japan) diagnosed with T1DM for &#x02265;12 months, currently treated with any basal&#x02013;bolus insulin regimen for &#x02265;12 months prior to screening and with HbA1c &#x02264; 10.0% (85.8 mmol/mol) and body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;35.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at time of screening were eligible for participation. Exclusion criteria included clinically significant concomitant diseases, including impaired renal and hepatic function; a history of recurrent major hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic unawareness; and cardiovascular disease within the previous 6 months prior to the trial. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Signed informed consent was obtained from each participant before any trial-related activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Interventions</title><p>Eligible participants were randomized 2 : 1 to either OD IDeg (Tresiba&#x000ae;, 100 U/ml) or OD IDet (Levemir&#x000ae;, 100 U/ml) as basal insulin, both in combination with mealtime IAsp (NovoRapid&#x000ae; 100 U/ml) (all Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark). Insulin products were injected subcutaneously using a 3-ml FlexPen&#x000ae; (Novo Nordisk). For randomization, an interactive voice/web response system with centralized block randomization was used. While participants and investigators in this open-label trial were unblinded to trial treatment, due to the different appearance of the IDeg and IDet FlexPen&#x000ae;, all personnel working with assessment, handling and evaluation of trial data were blinded from trial drug allocation until the data were locked for statistical analysis.</p><p>Participants were transferred from their pre-trial insulin treatment to their randomized trial treatment on a 1 : 1 unit basis. If basal insulin was taken in a OD regimen prior to the trial, the same number of units OD was prescribed. If basal insulin was taken more than OD prior to the trial, the total daily basal dose was calculated and transferred 1 : 1 as the OD starting dose for both IDeg and IDet. The starting dose of IDeg and IDet could be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. On the basis of pre-breakfast self-measured blood glucose measurements (mean value from 3 consecutive days), IDeg and IDet were titrated individually once a week to a PG of 3.9&#x02013;4.9 mmol/l using a titration algorithm (Table S1, Supporting Information). Basal insulin was administered between the start of the evening meal and bedtime. In the IDet group, a second dose of IDet could be added if there was inadequate glycaemic control after &#x02265;8 weeks of treatment. Inadequate glycaemic control was defined as &#x0003c;0.5% point improvement in HbA1c [participants with baseline HbA1c &#x02265; 8.0% (63.9 mmol/mol)] or any deterioration of HbA1c [participants with baseline HbA1c &#x0003c; 8.0% (63.9 mmol/mol)] in conjunction with a mean pre-dinner PG &#x0003e; 6.0 mmol/l and no diagnosis of a treatable concurrent disease causing hyperglycaemia. Participants were to continue on an equivalent dose of IAsp to their pre-trial mealtime insulin dose. IAsp was administered immediately prior to breakfast, lunch and dinner, and an additional dose was permitted to cover an additional meal/snack. The dose of IAsp was adjusted weekly based on the mean of three self-measured pre-prandial PG values (Table S1). Optimization of basal insulin dose was to be prioritized over changes to the mealtime insulin dose during the first 8 weeks. At the end of the trial (26 weeks), participants were switched from IDeg and IDet to twice daily (BID) NPH insulin in combination with IAsp for 1 week, to minimize interference with antibody measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary assessment was change in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment. Secondary efficacy assessments included laboratory measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 9-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles and doses of basal and mealtime insulin. Safety variables included number of hypoglycaemic episodes, adverse events (AEs), body weight, standard clinical and laboratory assessments (including insulin antibodies), electrocardiogram (ECG), fundoscopy/fundus photography and injection-site reactions. Confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as PG &#x0003c; 3.1 mmol/l, regardless of symptoms or severe episodes (requiring assistance from another person). Nocturnal episodes were confirmed episodes with onset between 00:01 and 05:59 hours and confirmed episodes with onset between 06:00 and 00:00 hours were classified as diurnal. Laboratory analyses (except antibody analyses) were performed by Quintiles Laboratories (West Lothian, UK and Mumbai, India), Medca Japan (Tenjin, Japan) and Diagn&#x000f3;sticos da America (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). Antibodies were analysed at Celerion Switzerland AG (Fehraltorf, Switzerland), via a subtraction radioimmunoassay method <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. An independent external event adjudication committee (EAC) performed adjudication, standardization and assessment of cardiovascular events in accordance with pre-defined classifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The primary objective was to confirm non-inferiority of IDeg to IDet as assessed by mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was analysed using an <sc>anova</sc> with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors, and age and baseline HbA1c as covariates. Non-inferiority was confirmed if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was &#x02264;0.4% points in HbA1c. Assuming a standard deviation (s.d.) of 1.1% for the primary endpoint, the trial had 90% power with 360 participants randomized 2 : 1. A hierarchical (fixed-sequence) testing procedure was used to control the type I error rate for selected endpoints in the following order: change in HbA1c, number of nocturnal and overall confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes, change in laboratory measured FPG and within-participant variability in pre-breakfast SMPG (data for the latter not presented) (Figure S1). The number of overall confirmed, diurnal confirmed (<italic>post hoc</italic> analysis), nocturnal confirmed and severe hypoglycaemic episodes was analysed using a negative binomial regression model which included treatment, antidiabetes therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors and age as covariate. Change from baseline in mean FPG after 26 weeks of treatment was analysed using an <sc>anova</sc> similar to that used for the primary endpoint. Variability in the 9-point SMPG profile (defined as the integrated absolute distance from mean profile value divided by measurement time) was log transformed and analysed using an <sc>anova</sc> similar to that used for the primary endpoint. Statistical analysis was performed on the full analysis set (FAS) for efficacy endpoints including hypoglycaemia and safety endpoints were summarized using the safety analysis set (SAS). Missing values were imputed using last observation carried forward <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Non-rounded HbA1c (%) values was converted to HbA1c (mmol/mol) using the following formula: HbA1c (mmol/mol) = [HbA1c (%) &#x000d7; 10.93] &#x02013; 23.5. The trial was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. number NCT01074268.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 512 participants screened, 456 were randomized (2 : 1) to IDeg (303) or IDet (153). Three (3) randomized participants were withdrawn before exposure to trial treatment (IDeg: 2, IDet: 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). One (1) of these participants randomized to IDeg was withdrawn because the participant was randomized in error in spite of being a screening failure. Therefore, 456 participants were randomized and 455 participants were included in the FAS. A similar proportion of participants completed the trial in the IDeg (93.4%) and IDet (90.2%) groups. Participant withdrawal was evenly spread throughout the trial with no specific clustering of withdrawal reasons in either treatment group. Trial participants had a mean (s.d.) baseline HbA1c of 8.0% (0.9) [63.8 mmol/mol (10.3)] and a mean (s.d.) diabetes duration of 13.9 years (10.3). At screening, all participants were in treatment with basal insulin (mainly IDet or IGlar) and mealtime insulin (mainly IAsp or insulin lispro) (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In addition, 34.8% of the participants randomized to IDeg had come from a greater than or equal to BID dose of basal insulin compared to 24.2% of participants treated with IDet.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial flow diagram.

The level of overall glycaemic control (HbA1c) obtained with IDeg and IDet in this trial was comparable to that achieved in previous treat-to-target trials with IDet at a similar treatment regimen <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>It was notable that the reduction of laboratory measured FPG in the present trial was greater with IDeg than IDet. This is in line with previous, similar trials reporting a lower mean FPG with IDeg versus IGlar in participants with T1DM <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The greater reduction in FPG with IDeg did not translate into a lower HbA1c level compared to IDet and the areas under the curve of the 9-point SMPG profiles were similar with IDeg and IDet. When interpreting this, it should be considered that HbA1c is influenced by various factors including FPG, post-prandial PG and hypoglycaemia. Moreover, variability in insulin action could influence the frequency and duration of low blood glucose values which in turn (despite not meeting the definition of hypoglycaemia of &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/l) impacts the HbA1c result. It could be speculated that the higher FPG concentration seen in the morning with IDet to a certain extent may have been counterbalanced by longer periods at lower glucose levels during the night, as reflected by the statistically higher rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, the lower PG concentration at 04:00 hours with IDet than IDeg seen on the 9-point SMPG profile could support this argument.</p><p>At the end of the trial, 32.9% of participants received IDet BID, as allowed per protocol, which is similar to what has been reported for IGlar in people with T1DM <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. The mean daily basal insulin dose, the total daily bolus insulin doses and the total insulin dose were numerically lower in the IDeg group than in the IDet group. This indicates that a lower dose of IDeg was required to achieve similar levels of overall group glycaemic control in the present population. In the light of similar observations of a lower bolus dose in a basal&#x02013;bolus trial comparing IDeg with IGlar <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, one could consider the need and opportunity to optimize individual patient treatment regarding the use of bolus insulin, which could lower the risk of bolus-induced hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Severe hypoglycaemia rates were low and comparable between groups. The rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was similar with IDeg and IDet throughout this trial whereas the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was significantly lower with IDeg. This mirrors the results from a comparison of IDeg and IGlar in participants with T1DM <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. However, the transfer from pre-trial dose to baseline dose was performed differently than in the current trial. For participants receiving basal insulin BID prior to the trial, the dose was transferred 1 : 1 for IDeg but reduced 20&#x02013;30% for IGlar according to approved labelling. This resulted in a lower starting dose for IGlar than IDeg, which during the first 4 weeks seemed to have an impact on hypoglycaemia, resulting in a non-significant 7% higher rate of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia with IDeg than IGlar at the end of the trial. The small imbalance in starting doses in that trial was not observed in the current trial where pre-trial basal insulin doses were switched on a 1 : 1 basis for both IDeg and IDet.</p><p>The lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia associated with IDeg compared to IDet and IGlar could be explained by the more consistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of IDeg, namely the longer duration of action as well as lower day-to-day and hour-to-hour pharmacodynamic variability <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. From a clinician&#x02018;s perspective, the differences seen in the rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in this trial means that to avoid one nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episode one would need to treat 1 patient for 7 months with IDeg or if 100 patients are treated for 1 year with IDeg there would be 179 fewer confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes than with IDet as the comparator.</p><p>In general, AE and SAE profiles were similar between treatment groups. Body weight increased slightly in both treatment groups as expected from intensive basal&#x02013;bolus insulin therapy but the increase was numerically lower with IDet than IDeg.

However, the percentage of participants experiencing injection-site reactions was &#x0003c;5% in both treatment groups, with no serious episodes. For both groups, insulin-specific antibodies were low at baseline and remained low throughout the trial.</p><p>A general limitation of this trial, as in any open-label trial, is the risk of an underlying reporting bias. In general, it can be anticipated that investigators, as well as participants, are likely to be more alert when administering new insulin products such as IDeg. This could influence insulin titration and dose optimization as investigators may tend to be more cautious when initiating and adjusting doses of IDeg.</p><p>In conclusion, IDeg administered OD as part of basal&#x02013;bolus therapy effectively improves long-term glycaemic control in participants with T1DM and is associated with a significantly lower risk of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia in conjunction with a significantly larger reduction in mean FPG than basal&#x02013;bolus therapy with IDet. IDeg was well tolerated and switching from other insulin regimens to IDeg and IAsp as basal&#x02013;bolus therapy was safe. However, treatment should always be adjusted according to individual patient needs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The trial was sponsored by Novo Nordisk (Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark).
