In addition, they show anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the potential effect of sphinganine on prolonging the hair anagen rate and improving the overall hair quality and scalp health. The inhibitory potential of sphinganine toward 5-&#x003b1;-reductase was studied using an in vitro assay. The stimulation of the antimicrobial peptide HBD2 by sphinganine was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. Sphinganine bioavailability was studied ex vivo using a pig skin model. A placebo-controlled, double-blind study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of sphinganine on hair loss and hair/scalp quality in vivo. In vitro results showed that sphinganine is a potent inhibitor of 5-&#x003b1;-reductase type I that prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a key factor of androgenetic male baldness. In vivo results demonstrated efficacy in reducing non-illness-related hair loss among males. In terms of expert rating, all hair quality and scalp parameters improved after application of sphinganine. Improved scalp health might be linked to the observed increase of the antimicrobial peptide HBD2. Thus, sphinganine is well suited as a topical alternative for the improvement of scalp health and hair quality and anti-hair loss application.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>sphinganine</kwd><kwd>5-&#x003b1;-reductase inhibition</kwd><kwd>HBD2</kwd><kwd>hair loss</kwd><kwd>anagen rate</kwd><kwd>TrichoScan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphinganine is a naturally occurring, skin-identical sphingoid base, a representative of the class of amino alcohols, or long chain bases (LCBs). Sphingoid bases can be synthesized chemically in a complex and cost-intensive way. An alternative process is based on the fermentation of yeast<xref rid="b1-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and ensures the distinct stereochemical configuration of the two asymmetrical carbon atoms of the molecule, which is also found in nature and in human skin.</p><p>LCBs are stereochemically complex molecules, also called sphingolipids, which are found in the membranes of nearly all eukaryotic cells. A sphingoid base amidated with a fatty acid makes up a ceramide. The structures and functions of sphingolipids and their ceramide derivatives are extremely diverse, ranging from being essential components of membranes to ensure cellular integrity, to acting as second messengers in signaling.<xref rid="b2-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It could be demonstrated in a confluence-induced differentiation model of normal human keratinocytes that several LCBs are potent promoters of keratinocyte differentiation as judged by transcriptome analyses,<xref rid="b3-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and are able to induce ceramide production.<xref rid="b4-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> They have also shown evidence of anti-inflammatory<xref rid="b5-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as well as antimicrobial activities.<xref rid="b6-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Based on the assumption that such keratinocyte stimulation also takes place in the hair matrix keratinocytes, which causes the formation of the different epithelial layers forming the mature hair, it was reasoned that sphinganine application could potentially affect hair fiber production. In particular, the stimulation of differentiation and ceramide production might influence cuticle formation. The cuticle, like the stratum corneum, has a protective function and determines the surface properties of the hair.<xref rid="b9-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Considering also its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, sphinganine stimulation could eventually lead to improvements in hair quality.</p><p>These aspects were the subject of investigation of the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>dl-Erythro-sphinganine produced by fermentation of the yeast <italic>Wickerhamomyces cifferii</italic> was provided by Evonik Nutrition &#x00026; Care GmbH (Essen, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>5-&#x003b1;-reductase type I cell-free inhibition assay</title><p>5-&#x003b1;-reductase assays were conducted by Vivacell Biotechnology GmbH (Denzlingen, Germany).

On day (D) 0, D2, D5, and D6, 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> of the formulations was applied topically and spread evenly using a small spatula. Control explants did not receive any treatment except medium renewal. Explants were sampled on D0 and on D7. Explants were cut into two parts.

The first pilot study was carried out on 32 healthy test subjects of both sexes (male/female and verum/placebo, ratio 1:1) testing a concentration of 0.2% sphinganine. In addition, a follow-up study was done on a total of 80 male test subjects divided into three treatment groups (sphinganine concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%) and one control group.</p><p>The subjects were selected according to the inclusion criteria: healthy male or female with non-illness-related, light, diffuse hair loss, and fine and lifeless hair. Exclusion criteria were the evidence of skin diseases of the scalp, history of allergic reactions to shampoo, perfumes, or topically applied hair care products, medication affecting the skin response such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, pregnancy or breast-feeding, short hair (&#x0003c;5 cm), and the use of substances promoting hair growth during a period of 3 months before the start of the study. All participating test subjects were informed about the objectives and scope of the study and gave written informed consent prior to the study. They accepted not to alter their haircut, style or dye their hair, and not to use any other topical treatment products, oral products, or any nutritional supplementation aiming at improving hair status during the course of the study.</p><p>Furthermore, at the end of the follow-up study, three selected test subjects of each group were asked to participate in the study for a further 9 months.

A five-point scale was used for evaluation of the hair quality parameters shine, volume, and strength, and for the scalp health parameters, dryness, scaling, and general scalp health. Results were expressed as the change between pre- and posttreatment scores.</p><p>To objectively measure the responsiveness to hair tonic treatment, a photographic documentation was used. Color photographs of the head were taken of both sides, the front, back, and top using Fotofinder dermascope (Fotofinder Systems GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany) under identical environmental conditions, as well as identical conditions of hair color and hairstyling.</p><p>For TrichoScan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and the expert assessment, the groups were analyzed statistically.

To address this possibility, we first analyzed the influence of sphinganine treatment on <italic>HBD2</italic> gene expression in an in vitro keratinocyte culture model. Primary HNKs were treated with 0.00002% sphinganine before cells were harvested, and regulation of <italic>HBD2</italic> gene expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis. <italic>HBD2</italic> gene expression was readily induced by a factor of 5.3 (mean &#x000b1;0.57 standard error) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-9-191">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed HBD2 protein induction by sphinganine treatment on human living skin explants, representing a skin model far closer to the in vivo situation compared to a monolayer cell culture. A solution containing 0.1% sphinganine was repeatedly applied on the explants for a period of 7 days. Subsequently, explants were collected and incubated with an anti-HBD2 antibody followed by microscopical immunofluorescence analysis. Representative photos are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ccid-9-191">Figure 2</xref>. HBD2 protein was markedly induced by sphinganine compared to vehicle treatment. Semiquantitative assessment of HBD2-staining intensities by expert grading revealed a quite clear expression (grade 7) of sphinganine-treated skin compared to weak expression in the vehicle control (grade 3) on a 13-grade scale.

At the 8-week follow-up, mean anagen rate in the female verum group was increased by 3.6% (mean value 77.9%) and in week 16 by 2.7% (mean value 77.2%) compared to the baseline.

In the 0.1% sphinganine group, the anagen rate was increased, but not statistically significant, by 1.7% from an anagen rate of 71.0% at baseline to 72.2% after 8 weeks of usage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ccid-9-191">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-9-191">2</xref>). At end point, no further improvement was achieved. In the 0.2% sphinganine group, the anagen rate was increased by ~3%, from an anagen rate of 72.5% at baseline to 74.0% and 74.4% after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. Analysis of the pre&#x02013;post difference showed no statistical improvement after 8 and 16 weeks. Application of 0.5% sphinganine resulted in an increased anagen rate of 4%, from 67.1% at baseline to 69.8% after 8 and 16 weeks. A statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatment was observed after 8 weeks (<italic>P</italic>=0.0266), whereas statistical significance was narrowly missed after 16 weeks (<italic>P</italic>=0.0708). In contrast, the mean anagen hair rate in the placebo group was decreased by ~2% during the course of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ccid-9-191">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-9-191">2</xref>). Analysis of the change of the mean anagen rate in the verum groups and the placebo group after 8 weeks showed a statistically significant result in favor of the 0.2% sphinganine group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0421) and of the 0.5% sphinganine group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0148).

In the 0.1% sphinganine group, the anagen rate peak was reached after 4 months (73.3%), and in the 0.2% and 0.5% sphinganine group, after 6 months (74.5% and 65.3%, respectively). In the following 6&#x02013;8 months, the values fluctuated slightly around this peak value but were constantly higher than at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ccid-9-191">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the mean anagen rate was lowest in the placebo group after 4&#x02013;6 months (56%) and did not reach baseline values at study end.

Expressed in percentage, 40%&#x02013;46% of the test subjects in the sphinganine groups were rated by the investigator as having improved hair volume. A deterioration of the hair volume was seen by no more than 5% of the test subjects in the 0.1% and 0.5% sphinganine test group. In contrast, in the placebo group, only 14% of the subjects showed an increase in hair volume, whereas 25% of test subjects showed reduced hair volume. There was a statistically significant improvement in hair volume with all sphinganine concentrations (0.1% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0049; 0.2% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0004; 0.5% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0087) compared to the placebo.</p><p>Expert evaluation scores for changes from baseline to week 16 for the parameter hair strength were also significantly improved for all sphinganine groups (0.1% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0131; 0.2% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0345; 0.5% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0253) compared to the placebo. Thus, half of the test subjects in the verum groups were assessed as having more hair strength. A deterioration of the hair strength by only ~5% was observed in the 0.1% and 0.2% sphinganine group. In the placebo group, however, only 21% of the test subjects were found to have improved hair strength.</p><p>In addition, the use of 0.2% and 0.5% sphinganine was also associated with statistically improved hair shine (0.2% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0343; 0.5% sphinganine, <italic>P</italic>=0.0158) compared to the placebo group. In 36%&#x02013;45% of the test subjects, more hair shine was noticed, and none of the test subjects showed any deterioration. In contrast, only 14% of the test subjects in the placebo group were assessed as having an improved hair shine, with 7% of the test subjects showing deterioration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ccid-9-191">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expert assessment on efficacy of scalp health</title><p>Before application of hair tonic, between 20% and 30% of the test subjects in the individual sphinganine groups and 40% of test subjects in the placebo group were suffering from dandruff (subjects with scores &#x0003e;1). Despite the relatively low number of cases with dandruff, a change in the mean score between 0.21 and 0.40 toward fewer scales was observed in the individual sphinganine groups, while in the placebo group, the status of dandruff only changed slightly (pre&#x02013;post scoring: &#x02212;0.07).</p><p>With regard to the parameter scalp dryness, the expert noticed that before application of hair tonic, 25%&#x02013;43% of the test subjects in each sphinganine test group and 50% of the test subjects in the placebo group were suffering from dry scalp (subjects with scores &#x0003e;1). An improvement was observed in the 0.1% (pre&#x02013;post difference: &#x02212;0.32) and 0.5% sphinganine test group (pre&#x02013;post difference: &#x02212;0.30). However, dryness of the scalp was only slightly improved in the 0.2% sphinganine group (pre&#x02013;post difference: &#x02212;0.04), and worsened in the placebo group (pre&#x02013;post difference: 0.07).</p><p>In addition, the general scalp health was assessed by the expert. In 7%&#x02013;20% of the test subjects in the individual sphinganine groups and 18% of the test subjects in the placebo group, there was moderate-to-very poor scalp health at baseline (subjects with scores &#x0003e;2). After 16 weeks, an improved general scalp health was especially observed in the 0.2% (pre&#x02013;post difference: &#x02212;0.36) and 0.5% sphinganine group (pre&#x02013;post difference: &#x02212;0.20), while in the placebo group, a deterioration was seen (pre&#x02013;post difference: 0.14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ccid-9-191">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Skin compatibility</title><p>None of the participating test subjects prematurely terminated the study due to undesirable effects. In the placebo group, four test subjects (11.1%) complained about burning, itching, redness desquamation, formation of pimples and/or redness, and desquamation around the eyes. The undesirable effects were mostly of very slight-to-light severity and lasted for the first 4&#x02013;8 weeks. In the verum groups, one test subject (1.5%) experienced slight itching of the skin, a moderate burning around the eyes, and strong burning of the eyes as well as watery eyes.

The underlying processes are complex and not yet fully understood with the most important mechanisms being androgen signaling, a lack of cellular communication, and insufficient stem cell activity within the hair follicle.<xref rid="b20-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Available pharmaceutical anti-hair loss treatments include Minoxidil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, an oral drug that decreases blood pressure. However, topical application stimulates blood microcirculation in the scalp presumably leading to increased hair growth.<xref rid="b21-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Another drug for increasing hair growth is finasteride, which after oral uptake blocks the 5-&#x003b1;-reductase, an important enzyme that plays a key role in the context of the balding scalp.<xref rid="b18-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Nevertheless, finasteride has also shown certain detrimental side effects like anxiety, depression, and infertility.<xref rid="b23-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The data presented in this study show that sphinganine is a potent inhibitor of 5-&#x003b1;-reductase. These data fit well with the observed efficacy of sphinganine in males. 5-&#x003b1;-reductase enzyme acts as a catalyst to convert testosterone into DHT. DHT has a high affinity for androgen receptors, binds to them, and thus initiates a process of follicular miniaturization. Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone, whereas females have testosterone only in trace amounts. This fact might explain the superior efficacy of topical sphinganine on male compared to female subjects.</p><p>However, the biological context as to why a sphingoid base inhibits androgen signaling remains to be clarified. Even if sphinganine has an enzyme inhibition potency which is ten times lower than that of finasteride, due to a topical application, it might well be suited as a cosmetic alternative positively influencing the hair growth cycle by reducing DHT levels in the dermal papilla. This would delay transition into the catagen phase and attenuate follicle miniaturization,<xref rid="b25-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> particularly sex-specific among males.</p><p>It was also shown that topically applied sphinganine is efficiently absorbed by the skin out of a cosmetic formulation, which is a mandatory prerequisite to in vivo efficacy. Staining of sphinganine in a histological sample containing part of the hair follicle indicated a penetration into the hair follicle (data not shown). But even though a distinction between an epidermal and follicular penetration route of absorption is not possible,<xref rid="b14-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the activity data indicate bioavailability which is a prerequisite for the observed in vivo efficacy of sphinganine in reducing non-illness-related hair loss among males. The positive activity was already observed 8 weeks after start of the treatment and remained constant for up to 1 year. The increase in anagen hair rates in the individual treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ccid-9-191">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ccid-9-191">Figure 4A and B</xref>) can be expressed as an increase in total number of hairs caused by reduced hair loss. Thus, 4-month application of different concentrations of sphinganine leads to a dose-dependent increase of 4.0&#x02013;6.0 hairs/cm<sup>2</sup> relative to placebo. Even higher efficacies have been reported for the pharmaceutical ingredient Minoxidil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; an increase of 16.2 hairs/cm<sup>2</sup> was reported relative to placebo within 4 months.<xref rid="b26-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> An improvement of scalp blood microcirculation, which is one of the described mechanisms for Minoxidil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, has not been observed with sphinganine (data not shown). Whether a combination of both actives might lead to an additive or synergistic effect shall be subjected to further research.</p><p>It was previously shown that sphinganine has antimicrobial properties,<xref rid="b6-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> is a potent inducer of keratinocyte differentiation, and can serve as a precursor for the biosynthesis of barrier lipids.<xref rid="b3-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, the formation of the skin barrier also involves the induction of antimicrobial peptides, in particular HBD2. This peptide is known to play an important role in the cutaneous innate immune response.<xref rid="b27-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In the context of the present research, it was confirmed in primary HNKs by quantitative RT-PCR that the application of sphinganine resulted in a statistically significant upregulation of <italic>HBD2</italic> mRNA compared to control. This finding was confirmed at protein level using ex vivo skin. Together with its role as last common ancestor of all skin ceramides, sphinganine might play a key dual role in scalp biology. On the one hand, it is strengthening the barrier formation via induction of differentiation and antimicrobial response, and on the other hand, it is reducing sebum production, which is a main nutrient of the scalp microbiome, via inhibition of 5-&#x003b1;-reductase. If this hypothetical mechanism is solely controlled by the amount of sphinganine or if there is a functional antagonist remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In the context of the clinical evaluation, it was found that sphinganine also improves the hair quality parameters, hair volume, hair strength, as well as hair shine. It is well known that sphinganine-derived ceramide binds to the hair, strengthens the cohesion between the cuticular cells of the hair, and protects it from weakening.<xref rid="b28-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This might be one reason for the observed improved hair quality parameters. Secondly, direct absorption of sphinganine by the scalp might strengthen the hair follicle and rebuild the hair from inside. Moreover, a first positive trend toward a reduction of dandruff and dryness as well as an improvement of general scalp health was seen after application of sphinganine.</p><p>Dandruff is, among other factors, associated with a heightened secretion of sebum and increased colonialization with the fungus <italic>Malassezia</italic>. We demonstrated that the induction of the antimicrobial peptide HBD2 that is thought to contribute to fungal containment<xref rid="b29-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> is mediated by sphinganine. Both effects, sebum reduction and HBD2 induction by sphinganine, could play a role in the reduction of dandruff. However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.</p><p>It is also described in the literature that altered levels of sphingoid bases correlate with skin dryness and disturbed skin barrier function.<xref rid="b31-ccid-9-191" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These findings fit well to the improvement of general scalp health and reduction of scalp dryness.</p><p>Altogether, the reported findings suggest that sphinganine might play a central role in the biology of scalp health and the hair growth cycle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Evonik Nutrition &#x00026; Care GmbH for providing the dl-erythro-sphinganine.
