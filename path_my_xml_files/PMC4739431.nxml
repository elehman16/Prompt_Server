The primary objective of this study was to test three competing strategies on how to implement a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for out-patients with GAD (i.e., comparison of one compensation vs. two capitalization models).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>For our three-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (implementation of CBT for GAD [IMPLEMENT]), we recruited adults with GAD using advertisements in high-circulation newspapers to participate in a 14-session cognitive behavioral treatment (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry, MAW-packet). We randomly assigned eligible patients using a full randomization procedure (1:1:1) to three different conditions of implementation: <italic>adherence priming</italic> (compensation model), which had a systematized focus on patients' individual GAD symptoms and how to compensate for these symptoms within the MAW-packet, and <italic>resource priming</italic> and <italic>supportive resource priming</italic> (capitalization model), which had systematized focuses on patients' strengths and abilities and how these strengths can be capitalized within the same packet. In the intention-to-treat population an outcome composite of primary and secondary symptoms-related self-report questionnaires was analyzed based on a hierarchical linear growth model from intake to 6-month follow-up assessment. This trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0005">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02039193" id="ir0010">NCT02039193</ext-link>) and is closed to new participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>From June 2012 to Nov. 2014, from 411 participants that were screened, 57 eligible participants were recruited and randomly assigned to three conditions. Forty-nine patients (86%) provided outcome data at post-assessment (14% dropout rate). All three conditions showed a highly significant reduction of symptoms over time. However, compared with the adherence priming condition, both resource priming conditions indicated faster symptom reduction. The observer ratings of a sub-sample of recorded videos (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) showed that the therapists in the resource priming conditions conducted more strength-oriented interventions in comparison with the adherence priming condition. No patients died or attempted suicide.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial that focuses on capitalization and compensation models during the implementation of one prescriptive treatment packet for GAD. We have shown that GAD related symptoms were significantly faster reduced by the resource priming conditions, although the limitations of our study included a well-educated population. If replicated, our results suggest that therapists who implement a mental health treatment for GAD might profit from a systematized focus on capitalization models.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source id="gts0005">Swiss Science National Foundation</funding-source> (SNSF-Nr.

Uncontrollable worrying as a primary symptom of GAD leads to a maladaptive cognitive strategy to avoid experiencing anxiety (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Borkovec et al., 2004</xref>) and emotional states in general (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Roemer et al., 2005</xref>). Individuals with GAD show deficits in detecting and regulating emotional states, which may accelerate a positive feedback circuit between general stress symptoms and pathological worrying (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Mennin et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, experiential avoidance may lead to a restriction in proactive behaviors as individuals become focused on avoiding events and situations rather than pursuing activities that are consistent with their personal values (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Michelson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Psychological treatment that intends to be fully therapeutic conducted by trained professionals (bona fide psychotherapy) is an effective treatment for GAD compared to no treatment and treatment as usual (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hanrahan, F, et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cuijers, P, et al., 2014</xref>) but also is more generally an effective treatment for individuals who suffer from any type of anxiety and/or depression (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger et al., 2014</xref>). There are a number of treatment protocols for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that include interventions such as psycho education, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring of (meta-) cognitions, (imagery-) exposure, and in vivo confrontation that primarily reference standard techniques to correct and compensate for GAD symptoms (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barlow, DH, et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Zinbarg, RE, et al., 2006</xref>). In spite of the empirical evidence of the overall efficacy of the protocols, there is a systematic lack of knowledge regarding how therapists should implement these overall protocols and how they can create productive levels of competent adherence to treatment protocols (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Webb, CA, et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Owen, J and Hilsenroth, MJ, 2014</xref>). From a broader perspective, psychotherapy dialogues could be observed as highly interactive and responsive treatments through which therapists and patients work together to achieve well-specified treatment goals that consider the patient's entire living environment (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Norcross, JC, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wampold, BE and Imel, ZE, 2014</xref>). Patients are likely not uniformly skilled, and therapists might respond to these skills differentially. Pre-existing and/or immediately activated strengths and deficits in targeted domains could be used in individualizing treatment either by building new behaviors against relative deficits (i.e., compensation model) or by building upon relative strengths in the target areas (i.e., capitalization model). According to the compensation model, treatments will be more successful in so far as the therapists target the patient's disorder-relevant individual deficits and vulnerabilities. In contrast, the capitalization model would lead one to expect treatments to be more successful insofar as the therapist targets the patient's relative strengths and resources (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cheavens, JS, et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger, C and Grosse Holtforth, M, 2008</xref>). Even the separation into compensation and capitalization models is probably a false dichotomy, as therapists often simultaneously respond to the participants' targeted weaknesses as well as strengths. Indeed, there is a broad tradition in balancing capitalization as well as compensation strategies in many psychotherapeutic orientations (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Scheel et al., 2013</xref>). However, during the sessions, therapists performing such treatments might have a particular pull into one or the other model in general (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gassmann &#x00026; Grawe, 2006</xref>) and also more specifically in GAD (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger et al., 2013</xref>). According to Rosenhan's lasting posit helpers might have to actively construct their clinical realities not only on insane but also on sane perspectives independently of the underlying treatment orientation (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Rosenhan, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Rather than creating increasing numbers of new overall treatment packets, an additional approach to investigating clinical research designs may be to increase the understanding of already effective psychotherapies. The present study experimentally examined three ways of conducting a CBT protocol and their relation to treatment efficacy and therapist competence.</p><sec id="s0010"><label>1.1</label><title>Aims of the Trial</title><p>This trial investigates three different ways of how to implement a bona fide psychotherapy based on a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol using peer dyad supervision (primings). The participants are randomly assigned to three priming conditions: (a) adherence priming (compensation model), (b) resource priming (capitalization model) or (c) supportive resource priming (capitalization model). The main research questions are as follows: Are the different priming conditions related to differences in the efficacy of GAD outcomes, general outcomes and dropout rates? More specifically, we expect that resource priming in particular fosters therapist skills and flexibility in in-session strengths-orientation that might lead to better treatment outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0020"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial with three active treatment arms.

Prescribed medications for anxiety or depressive disorders did not exclude participants from the study, if the dosage had remained constant for at least one month.

The therapist recruitment was focused on learning how to conduct the &#x0201c;original&#x0201d; MAW-packet (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Zinbarg, RE, et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Craske, MG and Barlow, DH, 2006</xref>) attracted by an initial 16-hour workshop presented by the (co-)developer of this cognitive behavioral treatment manual (RZ). The majority of the therapists had considerable experience as study therapists in a prior randomized controlled trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0025">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01012856" id="ir0030">NCT01012856</ext-link>). To clarify formal study questions, the therapists had 1-hour study meetings in small groups on a monthly basis. These study meetings were conducted for all three priming conditions together. To emphasize the external validity of the implementation study, CBT-supervisors were self-selected by each therapist. All therapists had individualized CBT-supervisions on a 14-day basis, which is included in their regular postgraduate training protocol (within the 200&#x000a0;hour requirement to obtain a psychotherapy license in Switzerland). This supervision was based on a list of approximately 30 accredited CBT-supervisors for postgraduate CBT-trainings.</p><p>The assignment of a priming condition to a therapist was conducted by a joint face-to-face meeting at the very beginning of the study. To respect and coordinate the therapists' preferences (i.e., preferences in terms of working days and time schedules), the therapists first selected their priming partners and second, they selected a priming condition. Six groups were made (five groups with two therapists, one group with three therapists) and each group had to choose a priming condition (two groups per condition). Five groups had a preference to a specific condition. Only one group had none and was assigned to the adherence priming condition. In an anonymous retrospective evaluation, all therapists answered the following dichotomous question with no: &#x0201c;In retrospect, I would prefer to have selected another priming condition.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.3</label><title>GAD Treatment Protocol</title><sec id="s0055"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry Guidelines (MAW-Packet)</title><p>The MAW-packet encompasses CBT interventions introduced by Craske and Barlow (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Zinbarg, RE, et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Craske, MG and Barlow, DH, 2006</xref>). This internationally well-known standard CBT packet for GAD typically consists of psycho-education on generalized anxiety disorder, relaxation training (RT), cognitive restructuring (CR) and in vivo situational exposure for patients with overt behavioral avoidance. Furthermore, imagery exposure as a GAD-specific form of in sensu exposure was applied to reduce subtle experiential avoidance behaviors. The manualized therapy followed a treatment format of 14 50-minute sessions and a booster session after 6&#x000a0;months (15 sessions in total) based on the MAW-workbook that was delivered for every patient. The MAW-workshop was focused on how to appropriately adapt the duration and timing of the various standard CBT interventions to the patients' individual behaviors. At the start of every therapy, the interviewer who runs the structured interview for DSM summarized the results of the intake assessments in a two-page case vignette to facilitate the exchange of information between the intake assessment and the therapists that conducted the MAW-packet.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Peer Dyadic Supervision (Priming)</title><p>To systematically investigate various strategies of how to implement a standard CBT protocol, all therapists were tutored in peer dyads. On days of sessions 1 to 5, the therapists were required to contact their peer partner face-to-face or on the phone to discuss the upcoming session in a 5- to 10-minute brief conversation based on a standardized style-sheet (primings; for a comparable procedure, see <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger and Grosse Holtforth (2008)</xref>. The primings operationalize different models on how to involve the patient into the treatment. There were three priming conditions:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0005"><label>(1)</label><p>Adherence priming (compensation model): Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, a therapist conducted a 5-minute conversation with the tutoring partner about how to implement the disorder-specific interventions that were described in the treatment protocol. These communications were focused on patient individual GAD symptoms and any related comorbidities and how those individual sufferings could be adequately compensated for in the prescriptive treatment protocol based on a standardized style-sheet (see online Appendix). These style-sheets were filled out by the therapist prior to the first therapy session using all of the intake assessment data, including the video recordings of the structured interview for DSM. Based on the patients' individual sufferings, adherence priming intended to operationalize a common straightforward strategy of how therapists can involve patients in the treatment protocol (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Whisman, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item id="o0010"><label>(2)</label><p>Resource priming (capitalization model): Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, a therapist conducted a 5-minute conversation about the potential strengths and abilities of the patient and how these immediately activated strengths could be capitalized to conduct the treatment protocol based on a standardized style-sheet (see Appendix) (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger et al., 2010</xref>). These style-sheets were filled out by the therapist prior to the first therapy session using all of the intake assessment data, including the video-recordings of the structured interview for DSM. Resource priming intended to operationalize an explicit matching strategy of how therapists respond to patients' strengths and weaknesses to involve patients in the treatment protocol. According to the therapist-guide of the MAW-manual, every therapy session should include basic capitalization strategies such as an emphasis on positive changes during the past week or reinforcement of progress during the sessions (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Zinbarg et al., 2006</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>(3)</label><p>Supportive resource priming (capitalization model): The supportive resource priming condition used the very same style-sheet and form of peer dyads as the resource priming condition. The only difference in this condition was a slightly higher flexibility in the treatment protocol. More specifically, the therapists in consultation with their patients were allowed to invite a helpful significant person from the patient's entourage (such as a partner or best friend) to participate to sessions 1 (introduction of the GAD-rationale) and 7 (after intermediate assessment). In addition the therapists tried to find ways; this helpful person could support the patient in their treatment plan (capitalization of supportive others) (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Zinbarg et al., 2007</xref>). In case the patient or the supportive other person did not consent to direct therapy participation (in 4 cases), therapists were encouraged to find indirect ways for patients to involve the significant other to support the patient in their treatment plan.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>2.4</label><title>Measures</title><sec id="s0070"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM</title><p>At intake, the GAD diagnosis and its core symptomatology were identified by trained interviewers according to the structured interview section for GAD [DIPS] (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Margraf et al., 1991</xref>).

Disorder-specific (primary) outcomes: The Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI] (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1988</xref>) is a 21-item measure for general anxiety symptoms (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92 in the present sample). The Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ] (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1990</xref>) is a 16-item measure of the frequency and intensity of worry. It has considerable internal consistency (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.86 in the present sample). Secondary outcomes: The Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI-II] (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1996</xref>) is a 21-item measure for depressive symptoms (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92 in the present sample).

The short version of the Resource Self-Report Questionnaire [RES] (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Troesken &#x00026; Grawe, 2004</xref>) measures various domains of individual and interpersonal strengths (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92 in the present sample).

Observers were two master's students in clinical psychology who participated in the initial MAW workshop. For the observer-based measure, a sub-sample of the first 25 completed therapies was video-analyzed in sessions 2, 5, 8 and 11 and randomly assigned to one of the two reviewers (a total of 100 sessions; 32 sessions in the adherence priming condition, 32 sessions in the resource priming condition and 36 sessions in the supportive priming condition).

The 57 eligible participants gave informed consent and were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions (19 participants in each condition, <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The number of attended sessions per subject was 13.4 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.2). Fifty-one (89.5%) participants attended the full allocated intervention of 14 sessions, and 49 (86.0%) participants completed post-assessments (2 participants who had attended the 14 sessions decided not to participate to the post-assessment). From the 57 subjects that started the treatment, the adherence priming group had a higher rate of missing post-assessments (5 patients, 26.3%) in comparison with the other two conditions (1 patient, 5.3%/2 patients, 10.5%; X<sup>2</sup>[2]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.8, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.08). However, this trend disappeared at the follow-up assessment with 45 participants (with overall 12 participants [21.5%] who missed follow-up assessments).</p><p>Comparable to other psychotherapy studies with GAD patients, all three groups showed a high number of comorbidities and the mean age was approximately 40&#x000a0;years (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In comparison with the general Swiss population, there was a slight tendency toward a higher percentage of graduate occupations and bilingual people from an international background; this might be due to a research-oriented population of out-patients that indicated interest in participating in a university-based clinical trial. The majority of participants were female, and full randomization produced a higher percentage of women in the resource priming condition. However, there was no indication that this randomly produced unequal distribution was outcome-relevant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.11 for all outcomes). Therapists were approximately 30&#x000a0;years old on average and were all Swiss-German-speaking female psychologists with considerable knowledge and practice on conducting psychotherapies under RCT conditions (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Therapists reported that the preparation of the style-sheets at the beginning of the therapies took 29&#x000a0;min on average (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20.9).

A total of 84.4% of the primings were conducted in the peer-format, and 16.5% were conducted by the therapists themselves (because of a conflicting schedule of the peer-partner).

The multivariate analyses indicated differences between the three priming conditions (Pillai's Trace: F [6/42]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21.0, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.76).

The present implementation study indicated that both resource priming conditions lead to a faster reduction of symptom-related outcomes in comparison with the adherence priming condition apparent at the post-assessments. Based on the in-session observer ratings, both resource priming conditions indicated higher strengths-orientation (&#x0201c;resource activation&#x0201d;) in comparison with the adherence priming condition. The implementation of an evidence-based treatment is largely principle-based, allowing considerable therapeutic flexibility in the determination and timing of different treatment aspects (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Norcross, JC, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cheavens, JS, et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Castonguay, LG and Beutler, LE, 2006</xref>). Therefore, therapists using these treatments must make decisions about these different treatment aspects.</p><p>There are several theoretical considerations that might or might not explain these efficacy differences alone or in combination with each other. As a final common pathway, individuals who suffer from GAD might show restrictions in proactive behaviors as they become focused on avoiding events rather than approaching activities with personal values. The capitalization model might sensitize the therapists for productive proactive patient behaviors in generalized anxiety (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Roemer, L, et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000fc;ckiger, C, et al., 2013</xref>) and also in humans more generally (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bohart, AC and Tallman, K, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Padesky, CA and Mooney, KA, 2012</xref>); and vice versa, the adherence priming condition might tend to make therapists maintain the restricted focus on avoiding negative events (e.g., get out of GAD) and rigid information processing (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Newman &#x00026; Llera, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the resource priming condition indicated higher in-session and general therapeutic competences in comparison with the supportive priming condition and the adherence priming condition. Although meta-analytic findings and our study results do not support that the general a priori defined (cognitive behavioral) therapist competences are generally correlated with treatment outcomes (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2010</xref>), our results indicate a somewhat paradoxical picture that therapists who were straightforwardly focused on a common strategy to get competent adherence to the treatment protocol did not achieve higher competence scores than those therapists who did not have such an explicit focus. Nonetheless, these findings are in line with the results that therapists' adherence flexibility (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Owen &#x00026; Hilsenroth, 2014</xref>) and further aspects of therapists' flexibility in general might impact therapist-patient in-session interactions as well as treatment outcomes (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wampold, BE and Imel, ZE, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Ackerman, SJ and Hilsenroth, MJ, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Grawe, K., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In designing the present study, we considered possible alternative explanations for potential efficacy differences: <italic>First</italic>, <italic>patient preferences.</italic> In human treatments where patients and treatment providers closely work together, patients might have preferences for a certain treatment protocol (such as e.g. a psychodynamic or a cognitive behavioral therapy) and therefore might explicitly contact a specialized provider. Patients are usually informed about the specific treatment approach or modality and are therefore able to detect the specified randomized condition of their treatment (e.g., group vs. single setting; treatment tradition). Because this trial did not contrast distinctive overall treatment protocols, patients were not informed about any randomization procedure at any stage of the study implementation. However, the patients were informed about the overall treatment protocol (MAW-packet), and within this packet, the patient's preferences for specific interventions and procedures might well be a careful advisement in all three priming conditions. <italic>Second</italic>, <italic>therapists</italic>' <italic>preferences.</italic> Therapists were recruited to learn a specific treatment protocol of a neglected disorder in the mental health system (GAD). At the recruitment, they were not informed about the major research interest in the three randomized priming conditions. However, as in many randomized clinical intervention studies, therapists were not randomized for the conditions, and the therapists' preferences for committing to a priming partner, a priming condition and the supervisors were taken into account. In the adherence of priming condition there was a peer dyad that had no preference to a specific priming condition, which resulted in concerns from the research team that these therapists might tend to be slightly more flexible or alternatively less allegiant to this condition. However, therapists' preferences for emphasizing a specific intervention component such as in vivo situational exposure or cognitive restructuring within the MAW-packet might be well considered in all three conditions. <italic>Third</italic>, <italic>researcher allegiance</italic>. Researcher's interests might impact the performance of therapists and the study conduction more generally, for example, the therapists might have believed that the supportive resource priming condition was preferred by the research team (e.g. GB as CBT-couple therapist and head of the department where this trial was conducted) and therefore had extraordinary engagement in this condition. However, when arranging the research team, the three senior researchers had three different theoretical backgrounds and were themselves divided in their predictions, with each having contrary expectations about the relative efficacy of the three conditions. Furthermore, the design of three treatment arms was selected to enable study replication for potential effects in favor of capitalization models. Nonetheless, researcher allegiance may have impacted the present study results even though the authors intended to minimize such effects (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wampold &#x00026; Imel, 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are several substantial limitations that merit consideration. First, the careful selection process of individuals who suffer from GAD limited the sample size, as is a common phenomenon in all randomized clinical trials on GAD. The meta-analysis of Hanrahan, for example, indicated a mean intent-to-treat sample size of 48 participants for each study. Second, the study enrolment might have tended to select well-educated individuals who suffer from GAD. Although the comorbidity rates and the prior psychotherapies indicate lasting distress and suffering in these individuals, this study population might also tend to be well skilled in other functional areas. It might be true that the individuals in this population were especially encouraged and attracted by the capitalization model. Third, the (on average) 30-year-old female therapists with considerable experience in participating in randomized controlled trials were highly intrinsically motivated to learn the present treatment protocol initiated, e.g., by the initial workshop. This might limit the generalizability of the present implementation study to settings with less dedicated therapists. Forth, because the individuals that suffer from GAD probably are the most direct source of information to evaluate their worrying, the outcomes were assessed by self-report measures. However, other sources of information e.g. rated by observer might provide a broader picture of treatment outcomes. Fifth, the observer-ratings were focused on competence ratings of selected sessions. More comprehensive analyses of all sessions may provide a much more precise picture of competence and adherence ratings over the whole therapy.</p><p>Clearly, before further replications, the present promising but preliminary data should be interpreted cautiously.</p><p>Beyond replication, future research with larger samples of patients as well as therapists might examine more precise pathways along common processes through which the capitalization model may outperform the compensation model. For example, therapists' dedicated engagement in a therapy and/or a patient might represent a shared aspect of capitalization models and therapist/researcher allegiance concepts (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wampold &#x00026; Imel, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, future trials should not only be designed to investigate priming effects between conditions, but should also be designed to investigate potential priming effects within therapists using crossed-therapist designs (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin &#x00026; Imel, 2013</xref>). In respect to patient populations, capitalization and compensation models should be tested in other populations to examine if and how the patients might benefit from or be harmed by capitalization models (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Wingate et al., 2005</xref>). The present trial shows the promise of theoretically driven systematic strategies of how to implement an overall treatment packet. It highlights the empirically slightly disregarded practical issue of &#x0201c;how to implement&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;what to implement&#x0201d; under rigorous randomized controlled study conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Contributors</title><p>CF, RZ and GB designed the trial.
