One widely cited reason is lack of classification consistency, largely due to failure to maintain performance from study to study. This failure is widely attributed to variability in data collected for the same phenotype among disparate studies, due to technical factors unrelated to phenotypes (e.g., laboratory settings resulting in &#x0201c;batch-effects&#x0201d;) and non-phenotype-associated biological variation in the underlying populations. These sources of variability persist in new data collection technologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here we quantify the impact of these combined &#x0201c;study-effects&#x0201d; on a disease signature&#x02019;s predictive performance by comparing two types of validation methods: ordinary randomized cross-validation (RCV), which extracts random subsets of samples for testing, and inter-study validation (ISV), which excludes an entire study for testing. Whereas RCV hardwires an assumption of training and testing on identically distributed data, this key property is lost in ISV, yielding systematic decreases in performance estimates relative to RCV. Measuring the RCV-ISV difference as a function of number of studies quantifies influence of study-effects on performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As a case study, we gathered publicly available gene expression data from 1,470 microarray samples of 6 lung phenotypes from 26 independent experimental studies and 769 RNA-seq samples of 2 lung phenotypes from 4 independent studies. We find that the RCV-ISV performance discrepancy is greater in phenotypes with few studies, and that the ISV performance converges toward RCV performance as data from additional studies are incorporated into classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show that by examining how fast ISV performance approaches RCV as the number of studies is increased, one can estimate when &#x0201c;sufficient&#x0201d; diversity has been achieved for learning a molecular signature likely to translate without significant loss of accuracy to new clinical settings.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors disclose the following funding sources: a National Institutes of Health-National Cancer Institute Howard Temin Pathway to Independence Award in Cancer Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/cancertraining/funding/K99">http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/cancertraining/funding/K99</ext-link>, grant number 4R00CA126184), the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg-Institute for Systems Biology Consortium, the Camille Dreyfus Teacher- Scholar program (NDP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dreyfus.org/awards/camille_dreyfus_teacher_award.shtml">http://www.dreyfus.org/awards/camille_dreyfus_teacher_award.shtml</ext-link>), a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (SM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">http://www.nsfgrfp.org/</ext-link>, grant number DGE-1144245), and a Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (JS, NRF-2012R1A1A2008925).

Although many reports have shown high performance estimates for predictive disease classification, identifying molecular signatures that give consistent results across multiple trials remains a challenge <xref rid="pone.0110840-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Sung2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This discrepancy between high reported performance estimates and the relative paucity of robust omics-based tests delivered to the clinic was the subject of a recent in-depth study by the United States Institute of Medicine <xref rid="pone.0110840-XX1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While the general issues discussed exist across all omics data platforms, herein we will focus on large repositories of transcriptomics data because of broad availability from many studies, especially those conducted on Affymetrix microarrays (the most abundant source), as well as recent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.</p><p>A major factor hindering the consistency of identified disease classifiers and their performances stems from variability in omics data attributed to technical and biological influences that are unrelated to the specific phenotypic differences under study. Gathering gene expression data from different batches-processed at a specific experimental site and time&#x02013;introduces technical variability, termed &#x0201c;batch-effects&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0110840-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, diversity among studies is present and often significant even in the absence of batch-effects because of intrinsic biological variation, including geographic differences in patient subpopulations due to disease heterogeneity <xref rid="pone.0110840-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Irizarry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Cahan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110840-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Both batch-effects and intrinsic biological variation introduce site-specific variability that can bias the selection of classifiers by obscuring the phenotype-specific molecular signal.</p><p>We use the term <italic>study-effects</italic> herein to describe the joint variability that stems from both technical variation introduced by batch-effects and the biological variation associated with population heterogeneity. Importantly, the presence of these study-effects is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of the laboratories or experimental studies; rather, they emphasize that measured gene expression is sensitive to a broad range of influences.

Our approach to measuring the influence of study-effects on classification involves assessing classification performance with a study-centric validation strategy. In <italic>inter-study validation</italic> (ISV), we identify phenotype-specific classifiers based on data pooled from all studies except for one, and then evaluate the predictive performance on the excluded study. This process is repeated for all studies, leaving each one out for testing and training a predictor on the data combined from all others. This differs from randomized cross-validation (RCV), the standard in machine learning, wherein a random subset of the pooled data, for example ten percent in ten-fold RCV, is set aside for testing, and the predictor is identified from the pooled data excluding this subset. This process is then repeated, for example ten times. The critical difference between these validation strategies is that RCV (and other methods that split data randomly) estimates classification error under a condition (namely random sampling) in which the training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. In other words, the assumption is made, at least implicitly, that future samples from other studies encountered by the classifier will display the same statistical properties as the training data&#x02013;a condition that is often violated in real world settings. Hence, randomized sampling obscures systematic differences in expression distributions associated with study-effects. In contrast, ISV is sensitive to study-effects because it preserves the variation among studies (i.e. the training and test sets are not necessarily identically distributed). Consequently, estimates of classifier performance derived using ISV are often low when there are expression patterns that vary substantially between studies within phenotypes. Therefore, the magnitude of discrepancies between performance estimates from ISV and RCV reflects the extent of study-effects. We refer to the comparison of ISV and RCV performance estimates as <italic>comparative cross-validation analysis</italic> (CCVA). CCVA can be applied in subsets of study comparisons in various ways, for example as a measure of how well controlled a multi-site clinical trial is performing in terms of cross-site variation.</p><p>In this study, we use comparative cross-validation analysis to gauge the extent to which study-effects confound gene expression-based disease classification performance. We find that including data from more studies improves representation of biological heterogeneity during the disease signature learning process, which mitigates the influence of study-effects. By tracking the difference between the ISV and RCV performance, we measure the extent to which introducing heterogeneity into the training data alleviates the influence of study-effects on disease classification and can thereby estimate when sufficient data has been incorporated to generate classifiers that are robust to study-specific biases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data Preprocessing</title><p>For the microarray data, we download the raw.CEL files of each microarray experiment, either from the Gene Expression Omnibus <xref rid="pone.0110840-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, ArrayExpress <xref rid="pone.0110840-Parkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, or from files kindly provided by the original authors of the experiments.

For each method, classification performance metric we use is the phenotype-specific <italic>sensitivity</italic>, defined as the fraction of samples of that phenotype that are correctly identified by the learned molecular signature.</p><p>In ISV, the expression data from each experimental study is excluded from the training set used to find diagnostic classifiers. Data from the remaining studies is used to train a classifier using an algorithm of choice. The data from the excluded study acts as a test set to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. This ISV is repeated for every study included in the analysis, and the sensitivity for each phenotype evaluated on each excluded study is reported. To mitigate sample number bias in training, we implemented a stratified training loop (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110840.s002">Text S1</xref> for details).</p><p>We implement ten-fold RCV, in which one-tenth of the samples combined from all studies for each phenotype is randomly excluded from the training set in each iteration of validation. Classifier training is executed on the remaining nine-tenths of the data, and the excluded tenth of the data is used to evaluate predictive sensitivity. The process is iterated ten times so that each excluded test set is disjoint. The average sensitivity across all ten iterations for each phenotype is reported.</p><p>For each phenotype, we compare the average of the ISV sensitivities across all studies of that phenotype against the phenotype-specific sensitivity obtained by ten-fold RCV. This approach is implemented in MATLAB (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://price.systemsbiology.net/measuring-effect-inter-study-variability-estimating-prediction-error">https://price.systemsbiology.net/measuring-effect-inter-study-variability-estimating-prediction-error</ext-link> for code).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cumulative CCVA</title><p>We also investigate the effect of including different numbers of studies in the considered dataset on ISV and RCV outcomes. In this cumulative CCVA, we focus on the three phenotypes with greater than five independent studies: ADC, SCC, and NORM.

We examine data from non-diseased tissue (NORM) and from five common lung disease phenotypes: three types of non-small-cell lung cancers (adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC)) as well as two non-cancer diseases (asthma (AST) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). These studies were performed by laboratories that sampled geographically distinct patient populations; used different protocols for tissue sample collection and preparation; measured gene expression using different Affymetrix microarray platforms; and utilized different data preprocessing methods to yield gene expression values from hybridization intensities measured by the microarrays. We restrict ourselves to microarray platforms developed by Affymetrix to eliminate additional sources of variability associated with microarray technology, which have been covered elsewhere in the literature <xref rid="pone.0110840-Irizarry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

We observe a significant negative correlation between the difference of ISV and RCV sensitivity across all studies for a phenotype and the number of studies belonging to that phenotype (Spearman&#x02019;s rho&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.93, p&#x0003c;0.05 for SVM and ISSAC).

In contrast, phenotypes with data from few studies independent studies (AST, 3 studies; LCLC, 4 studies; COPD, 4 studies) have low ISV sensitivities even when the corresponding sensitivities from RCV are high, resulting in greater gaps between RCV and ISV performance (RCV - ISV of AST&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.76, LCLC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.13, and COPD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.32 for SVM; RCV- ISV of AST&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.69, LCLC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20, and COPD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.35 for ISSAC).</p><p>Besides yielding improved ISV performance relative to RCV, phenotypes with more studies achieve more consistent ISV results. We quantify ISV consistency by the coefficient of variation (CoVar), which is equal to the standard deviation of ISV sensitivities across studies belonging to a particular phenotype divided by the average. Lower CoVar values translate to higher consistency. Phenotypes with fewer studies, such as AST and COPD, have low consistency (CoVar<sub>AST</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.7, CoVar<sub>COPD</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.1 for SVM; CoVar<sub>AST</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.54, CoVar<sub>COPD</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0 for ISSAC), whereas SCC and ADC have higher consistency (CoVar<sub>SCC</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.30, CoVar<sub>ADC</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17 for SVM; CoVar<sub>SCC</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.12, CoVar<sub>ADC</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11 for ISSAC).</p><p>To measure the extent to which the number of studies affects CCVA performance, we calculate ISV and RCV while varying the number of studies included in each phenotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110840-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the phenotype-averaged ISV and RCV sensitivities for ADC, SCC, and NORM, as the number of studies considered in CCVA is varied based on SVM and ISSAC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110840.s002">Text S1</xref> for plot of ISV sensitivities as a function of the training set sample sizes).

Each phenotype achieves higher sensitivity when data from a greater number of studies are used for signature learning (Spearman&#x02019;s rho&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.65 for SVM, rho&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.57 for ISSAC; p&#x0003c;0.05 for both methods correlating mean ISV sensitivity with the number of phenotype-specific studies included over all three phenotypes). Moreover, we observe a converging of ISV sensitivity toward the corresponding RCV sensitivity as additional studies are added, although the rates of convergence differ between phenotypes. As the ISV sensitivity approaches RCV sensitivity, the incremental improvement of average ISV sensitivity drops with the addition of further studies. We also observe a significant negative correlation between the CoVar and the corresponding ISV sensitivity (Spearman&#x02019;s rho&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.64 for SVM, rho&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.78 for ISSAC; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for both methods correlating over all three phenotypes), indicating enhanced signature performance and consistency with the addition of data from different studies. Further analysis shows that the trends of ISV performance are reflected in large-scale differences in the expression profiles that can be visualized by principal component analysis, and that these performance trends also have association with consistency of selected gene signatures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110840.s002">Text S1</xref>). These results demonstrate that integrating gene expression data across diverse studies can strengthen phenotype-associated signal that translates into new study contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Study-effects similarly impact classification performance in RNA-seq data</title><p>Advances in sequencing technologies have recently enabled large-scale RNA-seq studies to measure gene expression for disease classification <xref rid="pone.0110840-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

To evaluate the extent that the CCVA results from microarray data also apply to RNA-seq, we examined RNA-seq data collected from four independent studies consisting of ADC and NORM data: GSE37764 (11 ADC, 12 NORM samples) <xref rid="pone.0110840-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, ERP001058 (90 ADC samples and 76 NORM samples) <xref rid="pone.0110840-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, TCGA (448 ADC samples) <xref rid="pone.0110840-XX3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and dbGaP (132 NORM samples) <xref rid="pone.0110840-Mailman1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Correlation and classification analysis based on study label on data from GSE37764 and ERP001058 confirm that study-effects are also influencing these RNA-seq datasets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110840.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>The CCVA results on data from these four studies indicate two key results. First, the gap between RCV and ISV performance is smaller for ADC when the RNA-seq studies are analyzed (RCV-ISV difference of 0.10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110840-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) than when the same number of ADC microarray studies is analyzed (difference of 0.26). This suggests that ADC classification based on RNA-seq data from three independent studies is not significantly impacted by study-effects (an improvement over ADC classification based on the same number of microarray studies). To substantiate this result, we further estimated classification performance when only one study was used to train a classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110840-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The bars represent classification sensitivities achieved on the studies excluded from training, whereas the square points represent RCV sensitivities on the training studies. ADC sensitivity on studies excluded from training (0.94&#x000b1;0.05) remains high and close to the RCV sensitivity (0.96&#x000b1;0.04) even when only one study is used to train.</p><fig id="pone-0110840-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0110840.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Inter-study validation performance in RNA-seq data based on SVM.</title><p>(A) The colored bars report ISV sensitivities achieved by validating performance on the study designated in the horizontal axis.

For example, ISV sensitivity calculated from NORM RNA-seq data (0.68&#x000b1;0.21) is significantly lower than corresponding RCV sensitivity (0.98&#x000b1;0.03) (p&#x0003c;0.05, Wilcoxon ranksum test), indicating that NORM sensitivity is indeed compromised by study-effects. Notably, we find that NORM ISV sensitivity, which is achieved by learning a molecular signature from two NORM training studies (0.68&#x000b1;0.21), is greater than the sensitivity achieved when only one NORM study was used to learn a molecular signature (0.56&#x000b1;0.26). Increasing the number of RNA-seq studies included in training improves NORM classification performance on untrained studies and does not significantly change ADC performance on untrained studies, suggesting that greater benefit in classification can be gained by the integration of data from additional NORM RNA-seq studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Generating molecular signatures that yield consistently high predictive capability in diagnostic tests remains a critical challenge in omics-based biomarker discovery. We find that study-effects stemming from both technical and biological variability substantially decrease predictive performance and consistency when data from only a few studies are considered in learning molecular signatures. However, our results show that incorporating data from additional independent studies mitigates the impact of study-effects, thereby reducing the predictive error. The qualitative trends of our study-effects results remained consistent across microarray and RNA-seq datasets. Given that study-effects also account for intrinsic biological heterogeneity, the trends associated with study-effects are relevant to classification even with improved technologies.</p><p>A significant source of variability arises not from technical batch-effects but rather is an inevitable consequence of the inherent heterogeneity of many disease phenotypes. Given that study-effects associated with disease heterogeneity are biological, they can best be accommodated by collecting data from multiple sources. The key point is that the diversity represented in the training and test set needs to reflect the range of diversity expected in the clinical setting. Subpopulations from different studies have different underlying distributions of expression, so sampling data from multiple independent studies improves the approximation of the global distribution across multiple sites &#x02013; even when sample sizes are held constant &#x02013; which aids the identification of consistent classifiers. Therefore, the improvement in classification performance that results from training classifiers on larger numbers of studies highlights the need to incorporate more population heterogeneity in future biomarker discovery studies by integrating data from multiple sites, including additional sites in test validation.</p><p>Comparative cross-validation analysis provides a quantitative basis for prioritizing strategies for improving classification of different phenotypes. For example, our CCVA results highlight phenotypes for which diagnostic reproducibility was most greatly affected by study-effects. These phenotypes are the most suitable candidates for further data gathering and analysis to immediately yield better classification outcomes. In contrast, in phenotypes with average ISV sensitivities that approach RCV sensitivities, our results suggest that, because of the difficulty of the gene expression-based classification problem, simply gathering more gene expression data and using the same algorithms would not likely substantially improve performance. In these cases, leveraging other strategies for classification, including redefinitions of molecular phenotypes, integration of multi-omic data, and contextualization with biological networks, may be more beneficial to finding classifiers with more consistent performance. By measuring the improvement in classification once study-effects have been mitigated, CCVA can be used to guide future data gathering efforts.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we quantify the degree of impact of technical and biological &#x0201c;study-effects&#x0201d; on disease classification performance. We find that learning diagnostic signatures on larger numbers of studies compensates for study-effects and results in marked improvements in classification performance. Moreover, we can estimate when &#x0201c;sufficient&#x0201d; diversity has been achieved for learning classifiers that are likely to translate effectively to new clinical settings. These results are relevant to phenotype prediction using data across measurement technologies. Our finding that study-effects can be quantifiably mitigated by introducing data collected from additional studies has applicability to disease classification study design strategies. It has clear implications for study design because diversity of samples in the training set (e.g. from multiple sites) shows markedly better consistency in predictive accuracy when taken to new clinical sites, as is a needed step on the path to clinical use. This underscores the need to incorporate more population heterogeneity in future classification studies by integrating data from multiple sources. Additionally, we find that different phenotypes require different degrees of training heterogeneity to mitigate study-effects. Applying comparative cross-validation analysis, we can discriminate between phenotypes that would benefit from for further data gathering to increase training heterogeneity from the phenotypes may require different analysis strategies to reduce predictive error. Therefore, our approach provides a computational tool for prioritizing strategies to improve disease classification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110840.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
