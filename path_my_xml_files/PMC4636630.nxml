More women in arm A also changed their preference towards treatment when the terminology was switched from &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019; to &#x02018;pre-invasive breast cancer cells&#x02019; compared to arm B. In arm A, 18% of women changed their preference to treatment while only 6% changed to watchful waiting (p=0.008).

Since the onset of organised breast screening, its incidence has rapidly increased, with DCIS representing approximately 20% of screen-detected cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the USA, approximately 50&#x02005;000 women are diagnosed with DCIS each year<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and in Australia, around 1600 women are diagnosed annually.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although DCIS is divided into three grades with different rates of progression (suggested estimates range between 14% and 53% and are uncertain);<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> it is almost always treated as if it were invasive cancer, with most women receiving either a mastectomy (20&#x02005;000/year in the USA)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or a lumpectomy, often combined with radiation therapy. A recent review by the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> concluded that there is sizeable overdiagnosis and overtreatment of screen-detected breast lesions including DCIS. Although the review did not separate DCIS and invasive breast cancer in the overdiagnosis estimates (19% as a proportion of cancers diagnosed during the screening period, or 11% of breast cancer incidence during screening and for the remainder of the woman's lifetime), it is widely appreciated that the proportion of overdiagnosis is likely greater among DCIS cases. Accordingly, watchful waiting has been proposed as a potentially appropriate alternative treatment strategy for DCIS.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>It is well recognised that DCIS is challenging to define and explain, with clinicians and health-care professionals divided in opinion and practice about how to communicate it to patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> The common terms used to describe DCIS include pre-cancer, carcinoma, intraductal breast cancer, stage 0 cancer and non-invasive cancer; this terminology has been suggested as a potential driver of both confusion about the meaning of diagnosis, and distinction between DCIS and invasive cancer,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and a desire for more invasive treatments.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Experts have recently suggested that the terms cancer or carcinoma should be removed from the label and instead be reserved for conditions that are likely to progress if left untreated.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Alternative terminologies removing the cancer label have been suggested,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

Arms A and B differed based on the order of terms used to describe the DCIS condition. Participants in arm A first received the term &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019;, while participants in arm B received the term &#x02018;pre-invasive breast cancer cells&#x02019;. Measures of concern and treatment preference for the hypothetical diagnosis were taken at this time point (time 1). Participants in both arms were then asked to imagine the same scenario with the alternative term used to describe DCIS and were again asked to indicate their level of concern and treatment preference (time 2). By switching the term within the arms, we were able to analyse the effect of changing the terminology both between participants and within participants.

Changes in level of concern and treatment preferences were observed when terms with and without the word cancer were alternated. Women who received the &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019; terminology first reported being significantly more concerned when given the alternative terminology (&#x02018;pre-invasive breast cancer cells&#x02019;) at time 2. Women also indicated increased preferences for treatment when terminology was switched from &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019; to &#x02018;pre-invasive breast cancer cells&#x02019;. This pattern was not observed when women were presented the terminology in the opposite order (cancer term first then &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019; second). Overall, these findings suggest that terminology including the word cancer in a hypothetical scenario can influence level of concern and treatment preferences.</p><p>Although it has recently been stated that removal of the term cancer may reduce anxiety and desire for more invasive treatments,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref> we could find only one research letter directly addressing this issue.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> That study of 394 women without breast cancer also found that women were more likely to choose surgery for treatment of DCIS when a cancer term (<italic>non-invasive cancer</italic>) was used compared with non-cancer terms <italic>breast lesion or abnormal cells.</italic> Forty-seven per cent of the women opted for surgery when the cancer term was used compared to 34% and 31% when the terms breast lesion and abnormal cells were used, respectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In contrast to Omer, we did not find a difference in initial treatment preferences between the cancer and non-cancer terms; however, our study has important advantages in that it assessed the use of alternative terms within the same individuals and found a significant effect on both a psychological outcome (concern) and treatment preferences. Our study was conducted among a national community sample with a high proportion of older women from lower educational backgrounds. It is unclear how women in Omer's study were recruited, the response rate and whether they were a clinic or convenience sample. Their sample also included a higher proportion of adults with tertiary education and, indeed, high numeracy was found to be a predictor of treatment preferences in the study.</p><p>Women in our sample demonstrated higher levels of interest in watchful waiting. In addition to the demographic differences already described, this finding may be explained in part by different treatment options presented in each study: treatment (including medication) versus watchful waiting in our study in contrast to surgery, medication or active surveillance presented by Omer <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>The overall level of concern to a hypothetical DCIS diagnosis was, not surprisingly, high. However, we had not anticipated the high level of interest in watchful waiting: 64% (initial treatment preference overall). The term watchful waiting was used in our questions to participants and it was also described as &#x02018;close monitoring by doctors&#x02019;. Importantly, the questions were explicitly predicated on the statement, &#x02018;if research showed it to be a safe and effective option&#x02019;, as has been shown in treatment for early stage prostate cancer<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> and is currently being trialled for DCIS.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, it was clearly stated that the woman diagnosed could proceed to treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, medical management) in the future if needed, as would be the case in clinical practice. This was included following results from research by Gavaruzzi <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which indicated greater endorsement for active treatment when watchful waiting excluded possible treatment in the future.</p><p>There were strengths as well as limitations to our study. First, our sample was a national community sample of women, which included a comparatively high proportion of women with lower levels of education (48%), that is, they either did not complete high school or had no post-high school qualifications (age 18&#x02005;years). Women of all ages were included in the study since it is possible (although rare) for women outside the screening age to receive a diagnosis of DCIS. Our sample, however, did include a higher proportion of older women of screening age.</p><p>The study was limited by its hypothetical design as women facing a real diagnosis of DCIS may respond differently to participants in our survey. However, the experimental design allowed us to include participants who were unbiased by previous knowledge and information about DCIS, and enabled the use of standardised scenarios that could be directly compared. It is currently extremely difficult to test different terminologies among women diagnosed with DCIS (outside a clinical trial of watchful waiting for DCIS) since this needs to be a treatment option supported by clinicians. This may not be the case until rates of progression of DCIS to invasive cancer and the impact of watchful waiting is better established and understood through randomised controlled trials of this strategy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Testing women who have already received a diagnosis would not be meaningful since responses would be biased by their previous treatment decisions and the previous terminology used by clinicians. We also note that we gave participants an estimated population average for the risk of progression from DCIS to invasive cancer to ensure clarity and comprehension of the scenario. In practice, risk of progression is likely to vary according to age, tumour grade and other factors, and more individually tailored information would be given to patients. Furthermore, we note that the significant difference observed in arm A when terms were switched from non-cancer to cancer is unlikely to be a result of demand characteristics from the study design (with women feeling obliged to change their response). If this were the case, the same pattern would be expected in both randomised arms, but it was not observed in arm B. In addition, the changes we observed in arm A were in the same direction and consistent for both outcomes; concern and treatment preference.</p><p>There is growing concern about the problem of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of inconsequential disease. One strategy to mitigate this problem may be to change the terminology currently used to describe cancer-related conditions that have low malignant potential,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> such as DCIS. This could potentially encourage clinicians and patients to both opt for more conservative treatment strategies such as watchful waiting, although it would have to be part of a broader effort to support conservative treatment. Our research shows that a national sample of women demonstrated high levels of interest in watchful waiting, which has not previously been reported and supports the need for the two trials currently underway on this topic.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Switching terminology from &#x02018;abnormal cells&#x02019; to &#x02018;pre-invasive breast cancer&#x02019; influenced women's concern and treatment preferences at least in a hypothetical setting. Together, the findings provide evidence that further investigation of the effects of changing DCIS terminology is needed in clinical populations as removing the cancer term may reduce concern and overtreatment, as proposed by Esserman <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> At minimum it shows that language is a powerful tool that has the potential to shape both understanding and actions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants in our survey and the Social Research Centre (Kim Borg and Shane Compton).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Kirsten McCaffery <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/KirstenMcCaffer">@KirstenMcCaffer</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KM contributed to study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, drafting and revising the manuscript.
