Evidence suggests that enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to increased large-scale brain connectivity. Our hypothesis is that acute alcohol intake would increase the functional connectivity of the human brain resting-state network (RSN). To test our hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements were recorded from healthy social drinkers at rest, during eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions, after administering to them an alcoholic beverage or placebo respectively. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the inebriation and stress levels. By calculating Magnitude Square Coherence (MSC) on standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) solutions, we formed cortical networks over several frequency bands, which were then analyzed in the context of functional connectivity and graph theory. MSC was increased (p&#x0003c;0.05, corrected with False Discovery Rate, FDR corrected) in alpha, beta (eyes-open) and theta bands (eyes-closed) following acute alcohol intake. Graph parameters were accordingly altered in these bands quantifying the effect of alcohol on the structure of brain networks; global efficiency and density were higher and path length was lower during alcohol (vs. placebo, p&#x0003c;0.05). Salivary alcohol concentration was positively correlated with the density of the network in beta band. The degree of specific nodes was elevated following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our findings support the hypothesis that short-term inebriation considerably increases large-scale connectivity in the RSN. The increased baseline functional connectivity can -at least partially- be attributed to the alcohol-induced disruption of the delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences. Thus, it is suggested that short-term inebriation is associated, as expected, to increased GABA transmission and functional connectivity, while long-term alcohol consumption may be linked to exactly the opposite effect.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been partially funded by the Committee for Biomedical Research, Central Health Council of the Greek Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity (project 83785).

It is therefore essential to study the effects of inebriation in healthy, non-dependent individuals, given the frequency of abuse and binge drinking.

It is responsible for the attention deficit observed even in low or moderate levels of inebriation <xref rid="pone.0048641-Curtin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048641-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048641-Maylor1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which alcohol acts on the brain modifying behavior have received much attention from scientists especially during the last few decades. However, they are still poorly understood.</p><p>An important finding is that short-term alcohol consumption disrupts the delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences <xref rid="pone.0048641-Lovinger1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048641-Valenzuela1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Inhibitory neurotransmitters transiently decrease the responsiveness of other neurons to further stimuli, whereas excitatory neurotransmitters produce the opposite effect. Evidence suggests that alcohol can acts by increasing inhibitory neurotransmission, by decreasing excitatory neurotransmission, or through a combination of both <xref rid="pone.0048641-Valenzuela1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The general consensus is that acute alcohol intake facilitates the GABAergic transmission, and inhibits glutamatergic function <xref rid="pone.0048641-Nevo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The transmission and function of other neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and opiates is also affected.</p><p>Alcohol's effect on neurotransmitters may, at least partially, explain some of the complex behavioral manifestations of intoxication in both animals and humans. GABA induction has been associated with the observed sedation effects <xref rid="pone.0048641-Volkow1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048641-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> of alcohol, the reinforcement of dopaminergic <xref rid="pone.0048641-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and opiate pathways <xref rid="pone.0048641-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> are responsible for the excitement following alcohol administration, and the inhibition of the glutamate activity <xref rid="pone.0048641-Koob1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> is linked to difficulty in the formation of new memories and muscular coordination <xref rid="pone.0048641-Kapasova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The GABA neurotransmission is of particular interest in alcohol intoxication, since (i) it has been associated with a person's susceptibility to develop alcohol abuse or dependence <xref rid="pone.0048641-Volkow2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, (ii) it is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain, and (iii) its receptors are the most common in the mammalian nervous system <xref rid="pone.0048641-Kuffler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Alcohol inhibits the activity of signal-receiving neurons by interacting with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor embedded in their cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0048641-Mihic1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. When GABA molecules bind to the receptor and activate it, the latter temporarily opens and allows the entrance of negatively charged molecules, such as chloride ions. Alcohol enhances the ions flow into cells thereby enhancing neuronal inhibition.</p><p>The disrupted balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission at the microscopic level caused by alcohol intoxication, may be reflected at the macroscopic level in the brain activity recorded even from outside the human scalp. Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) findings suggest that neurotransmission inhibition, induced by GABAergic agonist lorazepam, can cause a widespread increase in the inter-area functional connectivity and an increase in the strength of functional long-range and inter-hemispheric connections <xref rid="pone.0048641-Fingelkurts1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, it was proposed that enhanced inhibition is an efficient mechanism for the synchronization of large neuronal populations in the human brain. The neural synchronization is regarded as a candidate neurophysiological mechanism to explain the dynamic interaction between spatially distributed regions (<xref rid="pone.0048641-Schoffelen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, see <xref rid="pone.0048641-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> for a review on this topic).</p><p>Since alcohol admission affects significantly the inhibitory function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and enhanced inhibition increases the inter-area functional connectivity, we hypothesize that short-term alcohol consumption will increase the functional connectivity of the human brain at rest. We expect the enhancement of the GABA inhibition activity to potentially affect the brain as a whole system rather than specific brain regions in particular, since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are widely distributed in the human brain.</p><p>In the current piece of work, we examine how acute alcohol intake modulates the human brain functional coupling of the resting-state network (RSN). The study of RSN is of particular importance for studying the GABA neurotransmission mechanism, since GABA concentration in specific regions has been recently found to be positively correlated with their activation at rest <xref rid="pone.0048641-Braskie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048641-Northoff1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To test our hypothesis, EEG data were recorded from non-addicted young individuals at rest after they have been administered with an alcoholic beverage or a placebo. Magnitude Square Coherence (MSC) was used to measure the functional connectivity between cortical sources estimated with standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) <xref rid="pone.0048641-PascualMarqui1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Since we expect large-scale brain connectivity to be affected, the global structural characteristics of the brain functional network should be studied. This kind of information is not available by routine functional connectivity analysis. Thus, as suggested in previous literature <xref rid="pone.0048641-Sporns1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048641-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> as well, graph theory was employed for this analysis and the parameters that quantify the topological characteristics of the brain functional networks were estimated. Their modulation by alcohol was statistically tested to reveal information about the changes in the nature of brain networks due to short-term consumption of alcohol. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the inebriation and stress levels accordingly. The correlation of parameters of the brain functional network to the salivary alcohol and cortisol concentration were also tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-six healthy right-handed individuals (12 females, 14 males), with a mean age of 26.1&#x000b1;1.8 (mean &#x000b1; SD), and free of any neurological or hepatic disorders, participated in the study. Female participants were in the first half of their menstrual cycle. All participants were free of any medication and completed a questionnaire on their drinking habits.

Their Body Mass Index (BMI) was 21.8&#x000b1;3.1 (mean &#x000b1; SD). Participants were asked to refrain from alcohol consumption for at least 48 hours prior to recordings, as well as from smoking, caffeine, and food for at least 3 hours prior to recordings. The experimental procedure was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. All volunteers provided written informed consent prior to experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Each participant was tested in two experimental sessions and received a real alcohol dose (alcohol session) and a placebo beverage (placebo session). The order of the sessions was counterbalanced, while the doses were administered double-blindly. Thus, half of the participants had an alcoholic beverage in the first session and a non-alcoholic placebo beverage in the second, while the order was reversed for the other half. The two sessions were performed at least six weeks apart to ascertain that the participants had no clear memory of the first session inebriation level. All experiments started at the same time of the day (16.00) in order to simulate as close as possible real life situations (people consume alcohol usually late in the afternoon and/or evening) and to avoid differences in the circadian rhythm. EEG and electrooculography (EOG) were collected for five minutes during an eyes-open as well as an eyes-closed session. During eyes-open session participants were asked to fixate on a white cross on a black screen placed 80 cm in front of their eyes, relax, and refrain from blinking and moving their eyes to the extent possible. They were also advised to keep their head still and refrain from falling asleep.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Beverage manipulation</title><p>During the alcohol session, participants drank a mixture of two parts of orange beverage and one part of vodka (vol 37.5%).

Saliva samples were then stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.

The scalp electrodes were placed on a cap (EASYCAP) according to the 10/10 system. The electrodes were commonly referenced to the average of the two linked mastoid electrodes. EOG signals were also recorded simultaneously by means of four electrodes placed around the eyes (one above and one below the right eye, and another two placed at the outer canthi of each eye). The vertical EOG (VEOG) was calculated as the difference between the two signals recorded above and below the right eye, while the horizontal EOG (HEOG) as the difference between the signals recorded from the left and the right electrodes respectively. EEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 90 Hz, while EOG signals between 0.5 and 8 Hz.

On the contrary, they exhibit higher global and local efficiency, which are both characteristics of small-world networks. High global efficiency means efficient communication in the brain network, enhancing interactions between distant cortical sites. Local efficiency, on the other hand, is similar to the clustering coefficient, describing the efficient communication in functionally segregated brain regions.

A recent fMRI study examined alcohol-induced variances in regional GABA<sub>A</sub> binding potentials in humans <xref rid="pone.0048641-KhaliliMahani1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Alcohol affected mostly the connectivity of the visual cortex, the cerebellum, the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and the brainstem in relation to somatosensory and sensorimotor areas, with the most extensive effect observed in the connectivity between the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and the auditory and somatosensory areas. Moreover, in alcoholics, an increased synchrony in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was observed at rest in an attempt to remap the brain to compensate for alcohol-induced impairments <xref rid="pone.0048641-Chanraud1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Thus, despite the effect of alcohol on large-scale connectivity mainly attributed to enhanced GABA transmission, there is also evidence for the modulation of certain functional networks in the human brain.</p><p>Following our findings on increased large-scale connectivity, the degree of specific nodes was higher following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our hypothesis for increased connectivity was reflected on the higher strength of connections, which in turn resulted to a larger number of connections on specific nodes. During eyes-open this was the case for nodes located on the frontal and medial sites in alpha band, while during eyes-closed this effect was observed for nodes located mainly on medial and posterior sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048641-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Our hypothesis, based on the effects of alcohol on GABA neurotransmission is supported by our findings. However, since EEG does not allow measuring the expected alcohol-induced alteration on the concentration of GABA in the brain, we cannot safely deduce a causality relationship between the observed pronounced functional connectivity and the neurotransmission effects. Moreover, alcohol studies face the problem of individual susceptibility and tolerance developed to the effects of alcohol. This effect can be critical when studying the intoxication process <xref rid="pone.0048641-Bartholow1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To overcome this problem, we used a sufficiently large sample (26 participants) and each participant served as his/her own control during the placebo sessions. Alcohol effects appear to be dose-dependent. Having administered a dose of 0.48 g/kg (0.38 g/kg) alcohol to male (female) participants, our findings are limited to moderate-dose alcohol effects.</p><p>Since individual MRI structural scans were not available, we used a BEM model in a standard brain for all EEG reconstructions. Combined with the inherently low spatial resolution of EEG, we cannot make detailed inferences on the anatomical origin of the recorded oscillations. The ideal experimental design for this study would also need the recording of the individual subject's MRIs and/or additionally magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings at rest. MEG, as a technique, fundamentally avoids the limitations of EEG in functional connectivity analysis (i.e. possible leakage due to common reference for all channels) thereby providing also very good localization accuracy for the active sources <xref rid="pone.0048641-Papadelis1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048641-Papadelis2" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Coregistration of the inverse solutions, derived either from EEG or MEG data, with the individual subjects anatomies would provide crucial information about the exact anatomical location of the active sources, rather than the rough topological estimation provided herein. It would be also interesting, apart from the resting-state, to examine how short-term inebriation may affect the human brain functional connectivity during cognitive tasks or emotional perception.</p><p>Regarding the connectivity methodology, different methods have been proposed to select the threshold to be applied on weighted AMs to convert them into binary ones. We followed the approach of arbitrary threshold to test if the significant results were preserved across multiple connection densities. There is still a lot of debate around this issue and, as a consequence, there is no optimal method for the selection of the threshold to construct graphs, although different approaches have been suggested (see <xref rid="pone.0048641-vanWijk1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> for a review).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study provides evidence that acute moderate alcohol doses in healthy young social drinkers increases the functional connectivity of the RSN. Such increase is evident in terms of MSC values and it is also reflected on graph parameters that describe its internal organization and structure. Interestingly, the inebriation level was positively correlated with the RSN density. The findings support our hypothesis for increased large-scale connectivity due to the GABAergic inhibition induced by alcohol. The elevated connectivity is pronounced in alpha, beta and theta bands in line with the distinct role of these frequencies at rest. Thus, it is suggested that despite the fact that reduced GABA transmission is linked to reduced functional connectivity in alcoholics, facilitated GABAergic inhibition following short-term inebriation is associated to pronounced brain functional connectivity. Finally, all networks under study exhibited small-world properties and differed significantly from &#x02018;random&#x02019; ones computationally produced with the same characteristics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully thank Anastasia Semertzidou and Christos Frantzidis for the data collection, Domniki Fragou for the SAC analysis and Kalli Tzioti for participants' recruitment.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0048641-Sayette1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
