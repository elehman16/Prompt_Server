CAPD patients have many risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal glucose metabolism. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in ESRD population.</p><p>Despite many improvements in care of ESRD patients, however, only 51% of dialysis patients, and 82% of those who receive a preemptive transplant, are still alive 3 years after the start of ESRD therapy &#x02013; numbers that help illustrate the extreme vulnerability of these patients when compared to the general population. Among dialysis patients aged 65 years and older, for example, mortality is twice as for patients in the general population suffering diabetes, cancer, congestive heart failure, cerebro-vascular accident, or acute myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Cold water fish is the main source of eicossapantonoic and docosahexanoic acids the two major bioactive omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may have therapeutic beneficial effect such as decreasing triglyceride level, uremic pruritus and oxidative stress and improving dialysis access patency in dialysis patients through altering cell membrane structure and function and the synthesis of lipid mediation such as eicosanoids.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Epidemiological studies in the last 40 years suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke and their complications. The beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids include effects on lipids, blood pressure (BP), cardiac and vascular function, coagulation and immunological responses, systemic inflammations, endothelial function, reduction of pro-inflammatory responses and cardiac rhythm. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are associated with plasma biomarker levels, reflecting lower levels of inflammation and endothelial activation in cardiovascular disease and other chronic and acute diseases, including chronic renal disease, sepsis, and acute pancreatitis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Data on the use of omega-3 as a drug is limited in ESRD patients, and only few studies in CAPD patients are available testing its beneficial effects. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 on BP and serum lipid level of our CAPD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, we evaluated the effect of omega-3 on BP and lipid level in CAPD patients during April and May 2012. All patients (170 patients) in two CAPD centers in two university hospitals, were evaluated for inclusion criteria as: Age 18 years old or more, at least 3 months on CAPD, has hypertension stage one according to JNC 7 or normal BP with antihypertensive treatment and has read and signed the informed consent and excluded who has history of steatorrhea, malignancy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count [Plt] &#x0003c;100,000), abnormal coagulation profile or need anticoagulation treatment and psychosomatic disorders. All patients dialyzed with glucose-based CAPD solutions. Dialysate glucose concentrations (1.35, 2.25, and 3.75%), number of daily dialysis exchanges, and antihypertensive medications selected according to the responsible physician decision.</p><p>This study has been conducted by Isfahan Kidney Diseases Research Center (project No. 290370) as a sub-special thesis, funded by the Vice-Chancellery for Research and Technology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and approved by Ethical Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Isfahan, Iran. The study was registered by Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT; registration number: IRCT201501112417N16).</p><p>Ninety patients were fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and randomly assigned by computer-based simple randomization in omega-3 group and placebo groups (each 45 patients). Demographic characteristics including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and cause of renal failure, time on dialysis and CAPD characteristics including number of daily dialysis exchange, glucose concentration of dialysis solutions, antihypertensive medications, erythropoietin dosage, and urine output were recorded. Dialysis adequacy (based on Kt/V) was calculated at the baseline and after completion of the study by a standard method using PD Adequest Software, Baxter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Biochemistry analysis including triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), white blood cell count (WBC), Plt, hemoglobin (Hb), and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin tests was measured by autoanalyzer at baseline and after 8 weeks. Patients in both groups were advised to be on low salt, high protein (1.3 g/kg) diet.</p><p>At the baseline BP was measured after 5 min rest in sitting position by digital sphygmomanometer from both arms (if possible) and recorded the higher one by CAPD nurses and repeated after 8 weeks. A 3-g fish-oil capsules (omega-3, Zahravi Pharmaceutical co. Tabriz, Iran) in which every gram contains 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid was given to omega-3 group patients and corresponding placebo given to placebo group.</p><p>Qualitative and quantitative variables between two groups were analyzed with Chi-square test and independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test respectively. For comparing the effect of the intervention on BP and lipid profile within each group we used paired <italic>t</italic>-test.
