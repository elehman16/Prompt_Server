Aripiprazole, a recently introduced second-generation antipsychotic, are thought to account for its low propensity for weight gain, metabolic disturbances and sedation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of risperidone versus aripiprazole in the treatment of acute mania.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Fifty patients with acute episodes of mania were enrolled in this study, and they were randomly assigned into a risperidone group of 24 cases and an aripiprazole group of 26 cases.

The average dose of aripiprazole was 27 mg/day, and the average dose of risperidone was 6 mg/day. The effects of each drug for the treatment of acute mania were assessed on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of admission and on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after therapy using the young mania rating scale (YMRS) and at the baseline and on weeks 3 and 6 after admission using the clinical global impression (CGI) scale.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the group of risperidone was 34 &#x000b1; 8.6 years and in a group of aripiprazole it was 34 &#x000b1; 9.1 years (<italic>P</italic> = 0.83).

Evaluation of mean YMRS scores in two groups indicated that both drugs are effective in the treatment of acute mania, but aripiprazole was significantly more effective than risperidone at day 8, at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment, but there was no statistically significant difference in mean YMRS scores at days 2, 4, 6 and at week 6 of admission. The mean difference in YMRS scores at baseline compared with days 2, 4, 6, 8 and weeks 2, 4, 6 was significant in both groups that demonstrate that both drugs are effective in the treatment of acute mania but aripiprazole has advantages over risperidone in terms of efficacy and rapid response onset. The primary efficacy measures are defined as a reduction in total mean YMRS scores from baseline to study end point. Both drugs showed significant improvement on the primary efficacy measures</p><p>The Secondary efficacy measures are defined as &#x02265;50% decrease in baseline YMRS scores. After 4 weeks of therapy, in the group of aripiprazole, secondary efficacy was observed in 88.5% of patients. The number of patients was increased to 92.3% at the end of week 6 of treatment. In the group of risperidone, secondary efficacy was observed in (75%) after 4 weeks of therapy and the number of patients who effectively responded to treatment remained unchanged at the end of week 6 of treatment. Mean CGI-I and CGI-S scores improved over the course of treatment in both the aripiprazole group and the risperidone group. Greater reduction in CGI-S scores after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of therapy and greater reduction in CGI-I scores after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of therapy, occurred with aripiprazole compared with risperidone. Our findings are similar to those reported by Fountoulakis and Vieta.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In our study, the patients in the group of Aripiprazole were treated with 5 mg/day up to 30 mg/day aripiprazole with an average dose of 27 mg/day and all patients tolerated the course of therapy and completed the study. The average dose of risperidone was 6 mg. Keck <italic>et al</italic>., have shown that aripiprazole with a dose of 27.9 mg/day up to 30 mg/day is well-tolerated in 31% of patients with acute mania. aripiprazole group showed significantly higher improvement on the total mean YMRS score compared with placebo. After 3 weeks of therapy, the mean reduction in YMRS scores was 8.2 in patients treated with aripiprazole and 3.4 in the placebo.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In our study, the mean reduction in YMRS score after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of therapy were 22.26, 23.13 and 24.57 respectively. These differences may partially be due to the fact that we did not measure the mean differences in YMRS scores after 3 weeks of therapy, or they may be due to higher clinical response rate to aripiprazole in Iranian population. In another study, aripiprazole was successfully used for treatment of acute mania or mixed episode. The mean reduction in YMRS score after a course of 3 weeks of aripiprazole therapy was 12.5.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Fountoulakis <italic>et al</italic>., have shown that aripiprazole is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for acute mania.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In another study, aripiprazole was compared with lithium and placebo for the treatment of acute mania. aripiprazole had significantly more improvement in mean YMRS total score compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Similar findings have been reported by Young <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The above studies demonstrate the effectiveness of aripiprazole in the treatment of acute mania. In some studies, Response to therapy started as early as days 2-4.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In our study, mean total YMRS score at baseline and day 2 were 39.4 &#x000b1; 6.8 and 31.1 &#x000b1; 8.6 respectively that demonstrates the rapid onset of drug effect. In the present study, severity of illness was evaluated at three time points, at baseline and at weeks 3 and 6, using the CGI scale. In both groups, the mean CGI-S score progressively decreased that confirms the effectiveness of both drugs in the treatment of acute mania. These findings are compatible with that found by evaluation of mean YMRS scores. Greater reduction in CGI-S scores after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of therapy and in CGI-I scores after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of therapy occurred with aripiprazole compared with risperidone. Similar findings have been reported by Sachs <italic>et al</italic>. and Keck <italic>et al</italic>. In their studies, aripiprazole significantly reduced the CGI score for mania.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Collectively, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of risperidone versus aripiprazole in the treatment of acute mania. A 6-weeks randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted. There was a statistically significant difference in YMRS scores between risperidone and aripiprazole. There was also a statistically significant difference in CGI-Severity scale score and in CGI-Improvement scale score.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the aripiprazole, which is readily available in our market could be considered more effective than risperidone in the treatment of acute mania. By considering the limitations of our study include the small sample size and the relatively short length of study duration, more studies needs to be done to clarify the effectiveness of aripiprazole compared with risperidone in the treatment of acute mania.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>AAR, conducting the study and agreed for all aspects of the work.
