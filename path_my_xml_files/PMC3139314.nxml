Therefore, development of improved postoperative modalities for arthroscopic shoulder surgery pain control is important. One commonly used modality is interscalene block. This technique has been shown to be effective in several recent investigations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, although complications of interscalene block are rare, such complications can be devastating.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In addition, it is not uncommon to achieve an incomplete nerve block,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] which may incompletely control postoperative pain and which may be insufficient if regional anesthesia was planned.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 0.1% bupivacaine <italic>vs</italic> a 0.2% bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining ethics committee approval and patient consent, 40 adult patients (ASA I or II) scheduled to undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery were recruited to this double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients aged 23 years or older undergoing unilateral shoulder arthroscopy with rotator cuff and bankart lesion repairs were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included a history of shoulder injury, daily pain medication for problems not associated with the shoulder, medical contraindications to regional anesthesia, and any motor or sensory defect. Participants were randomized into two groups (each 20 patients). For randomization, patients drew a sealed opaque envelope from a shuffled deck containing a card representing one of the treatment groups. Patients were not informed of their treatment group. In addition, the surgeon was not informed as to which concentration patients received.</p><p>Upon arrival of patients to the operation room, an 18 G venous cannula was inserted and patients connected to standard monitoring, O<sub>2</sub> face mask 5 l/min, 2 mg midazolam i.v.</p><p>One anesthesiologist experienced in regional anesthesia administered the blocks preoperatively using a standard protocol, also all cases done by one surgeon.</p><p>Patients were positioned in the supine position with the neck extended in the contralateral side to facilitate performance of US interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB). After sterile skin preparation with povidone-iodine and skin infiltration with lidocaine 1%, US ISBPB was performed. An 18-G, 2-inch insulated needle (B. Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) was inserted into the middle scalene muscle immediately, superior to and out of plane with the transducer. L38 &#x000d7; 10-5 MHz, linear array, 9 cm scan depth probe was used to visualize the brachial plexus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] using SonoSite M-Turbo ultrasound machine (Bothell, WA, USA). At the middle portion of the scalene muscle, the needle was redirected anteriorly and advanced toward the interscalene space. Normal saline (1&#x02013;2 ml) was injected in increments at the anterior border of the middle scalene muscle to expand the fascial plane between the brachial plexus and the middle scalene muscle. While intermittently aspirating, and under direct ultrasound visualization, 10 ml bupivacaine was injected into the interscalene space. The catheter 20 G was then inserted through the thin-walled needle to a depth of 10 cm into the skin. Before placement of a clear adhesive dressing, to locate the catheter position, 0.5 ml of air was injected after negative aspiration while imaging the interscalene space. The ultrasound image clearly demonstrated echogenic contrast entering within the interscalene space, confirming appropriate position of the catheter [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Brachial plexus components in the interscalene groove.

In group 2, patients received 10 ml bupivacaine 0.2% as bolus, then infusion at a rate of 5 ml/h through the interscalene catheter.</p><p>After the performance of ISBPB and initial assessment, patients were taken to the operating theatre where they were given a general anesthetic using a standardized protocol, consisting fentanyl 1 ug/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and tracheal intubation is facilitated with rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg and maintained with 1 MAC sevoflurane. Patients were given further intraoperative i.v. fentanyl 25 ug if heart rate or arterial pressure increased more than 25% above preinduction baseline values. No intra-articular local anesthetics were injected. At the end of surgery, reversal of muscle relaxant (atropine/neostigmine) was given in standard dosages and the trachea extubated. All patients were transferred to the recovery room for further assessment. PCA morphine 1 mg/ml with 6-minute lock-out time was used for patients as rescue analgesia. Data collection included numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain assessment, sensory and motor block assessed baseline, 20 minute after block, postoperatively in recovery room, and at postoperative 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. Sensation of the upper extremity was assessed by pinprick using a 23-G needle testing from C5 to T1 dermatomes and scored as full sensation = 1 and loss of sensation to touch or pinprick = 0. Motor power assessment of the finger flexion (median), finger extension (radial), and finger abduction (ulnar) was scored as movement present = 1 and no movement present = 0. Patient and surgeon satisfaction and the analgesic consumption of morphine were assessed in the first 24 hours.</p><p>At the time of discharge, patients were given a prescription for Tylenol 3, 2 Tablets orally every 6 hours PRN.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed to compare between the two groups, 0.1 and 0.2%, for nominal variables (gender, ASA, patient satisfaction, number of patients received intra operative analgesia and sensation and movement present) which used Fisher's exact test and Chi-square test. A Student <italic>t</italic>-test was also used to compare the two groups, 0.1 and 0.2%, for Measurable variables (age, weight, height, and surgery time). A nonparametric Mann-Whitney was used to compare between the two groups for NRS, morphine consumption in different time, where this data do not follow normal distribution.
