Dementia is among the leading causes of disability and death in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is no cure for dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the on-going degeneration of brain tissue in older adults with neurodegenerative dementia disorders eventually leads to a loss of cognitive and physical functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. About 80&#x000a0;% of nursing home residents in Norway suffer from dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and it is the most common main diagnosis in the nursing home population in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Individuals with dementia have higher levels of functional dependence than others and are therefore more likely to require assistance in activities of daily living (ADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to impaired cognition, reduced ADL function and changed behaviour, dementia normally affects balance, mobility, and gait performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Reduced balance increases the risk of falling, and falls and fractures are common among nursing home residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. People with dementia have a two-fold increased risk of falls compared with non-demented elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Fear of falling itself is a risk factor for inactivity and can create a vicious circle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, improvements in balance may potentially reduce the risk of falling and increase mobility through increased confidence.</p><p>As dementia progresses, cognitive and functional impairments are followed by neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Studies show that more than 80&#x000a0;% of persons with dementia in nursing homes have at least one clinically significant NPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and behavioural symptoms are one of the main reasons for institutionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The most prevalent symptoms in patients with dementia in nursing homes are agitation, apathy and affective symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These symptoms cause discomfort and reduced quality of life for people with dementia and they are predictors of fall for nursing home patients, causing considerable morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. NPS also give distress to family and carers .</p><p>The effect of exercise on mental health is well established in other groups, however in the population of nursing home residents with dementia, most studies focus on the impact of exercise on physical functioning and mobility, rather than neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition. Therefore research on the effect of exercise on agitation in dementia is scarce. In a systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for agitation in dementia from 2009, no exercise interventions were included due to low methodological quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Historically, these symptoms have been managed with anxiolytic and antipsychotic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although potentially effective, such medication has been used too widely and may be associated with serious adverse side effects and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. According to Ballard et al., 2006, over prescribing has become a major problem, especially in residential and nursing home environments. It is reported that 42&#x02013;66&#x000a0;% of people with dementia are taking antipsychotic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], often inappropriately and usually with little monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Antipsychotic drugs have substantial adverse effects such as increased risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate non-pharmacological therapies for behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Reviews have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity on function, cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms and depression in older people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Difficulties with measurements and instructions and lack of compliance have led the majority of studies on physical exercise to exclude people with dementia. In a previous study we demonstrated the effect of high intensity functional exercises on balance, strength and apathy in nursing home residents with mild and moderate dementia, as measured after a 12&#x000a0;weeks program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Muscle strength gains induced by resistance training programs are lost after short detraining period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and there are reasons to believe that this will happen even more rapidly in nursing home residents due to the sedentary lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The detraining effect on balance is less investigated, but it seems that the balance function as well declines abruptly after completion of an exercise program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There are several reasons as to why it is important to investigate the detraining period. First of all, elderly people are more prone to interrupt exercise program due to ill health, and information about what happens to the exercise effects and when, is important to optimize quality of care. Research studies often have a rather short intervention period, e.g. 12&#x000a0;weeks and some have shown that the immediate effect of exercise can be different from the effect weeks later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It has been suggested that different types of exercise, intensity and age may also influence detraining effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and this needs to be investigated. From an economic point of view, it can be interesting to find out how little you can &#x0201c;get away&#x0201d; with.</p><p>As demonstrated above, randomized, controlled trials with physical exercise among nursing home residents with dementia are limited and knowledge about long-term effects are lacking. In a previously published article we investigated the immediate effect of a 12&#x000a0;weeks exercise program on physical function and mental health in nursing home residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. An effect of exercise on balance, the primary outcome, was demonstrated. In this paper we would like to study the long-term effect of this exercise program. Is there still a significant difference in balance function between the two groups 3&#x000a0;months after exercise cessation? We aimed to investigate the change in physical function and mental health from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months follow-up and during the detraining period, in the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>Exercise and dementia &#x02013; EXDEM &#x02013; was a 12-week single blinded parallel multi centre randomized controlled trial, followed by a 12&#x000a0;weeks detraining period, conducted among nursing home residents with dementia. Participants in 18 different nursing homes were randomly allocated to two groups: physical exercise and control activity. We used a block randomization procedure with six to 12 participants from each nursing home. Due to great heterogeneity between the nursing homes regarding residents&#x02019; demographics, care staff awareness concerning importance of physical activity and physical activity-opportunities, we considered it to be most appropriate to use block randomization.</p><p>Identifier at ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02262104, registered November 2013.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>The study took part in 18 nursing homes in Oslo city areas in Norway between May 2012 and September 2013. Each nursing home was given the opportunity to recruit up to 12 participants each, which gives a total of 216 possible participants. Inclusion criteria were: being above 55&#x000a0;years of age, having dementia of mild or moderate degree as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR 1 or 2), being competent to consent to participation, being able to stand up alone or by the help of one person and being able to walk six meters with or without walking aid. Exclusion criteria: patients being medically unstable, psychotic or having severe communication problems.</p><p>In total, 182 persons (84&#x000a0;%) agreed to participate. Twelve persons (6.6&#x000a0;%) dropped out of the study before the first assessment and randomization was carried out: eight withdrew and four were excluded because the inclusion criteria were not met (See flowchart Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, the study population consisted of 170 participants. A further 16 participants were lost to follow up at 12&#x000a0;weeks (3 died, 7 withdrew, 4 moved to another nursing home and 2 became seriously ill). At 24&#x000a0;weeks follow-up a further 14 were lost (3 died, 3 withdrew, 1 moved and 7 became seriously ill). See Flowchart, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Following completion of the pre-intervention assessments the participants from each nursing home were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group by picking name from a container. The randomization codes were kept in sealed envelopes with consecutive numbering by the trial secretary and blinded to those who assessed the patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Physical exercise program</title><p>Three to six participants at each nursing home exercised twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks with physiotherapists (1 physiotherapist per 3 participants). The exercise program was the High Intensity Functional Exercises (HIFE) &#x02013;program developed in Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The exercise sessions lasted 50&#x02013;60 min and consisted of: 5&#x000a0;min warm-up, at least two strengthening exercises for the muscles of lower limb and two balance exercises. All exercises were individually tailored, instructed and supervised. The intensity of strengthening exercises aimed to be 12 repetitions maximum (RM). The balance exercises intended to be &#x0201c;highly challenging&#x0201d;. The physiotherapists kept detailed records of all exercise sessions and reported the type and number of exercises performed, the intensity (low, moderate or high) and any adverse occurrences. For more information about HIFE and the exercise sessions, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] Local physiotherapists (i.e. employed at the nursing home) were used wherever possible. Nine nursing homes (50&#x000a0;%) received help from one (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) or two (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) external physiotherapists to be able to participate in the study. In total, 27 physiotherapists were involved in the intervention program and all of them had attended a course to learn about the HIFE-program. The course lasted three hours and included practical exercises. The importance of targeting high intensity was emphasized. Adjustable weighted belts (0.5&#x02013;12 k) were made available to all participating nursing homes. The project leader kept in touch with all physiotherapists during the intervention period through meetings (one obligatory), observation of exercise sessions (often in conjunction with the obligatory meeting), and by phone and email. This was done to optimize quality, high intensity and uniform execution in all nursing homes</p><p>The participants were not blinded after assignments to intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Control program</title><p>The control participants met in groups twice a week for 50&#x02013;60 min and the activities were led by occupational therapists (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11), nursing staff (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), volunteers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) or activity-leader (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).

No specific advice about physical activity during the detraining period was given, except that there should be no difference between the participants of the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Assessments</title><p>After enrolment, but before randomization, all 170 participants were assessed. A member of the nursing staff, who knew the participant well and was in regular contact with him/ her, filled in the Case Record Form. Nursing staff members that were not familiar with the questionnaires were encouraged to contact the project leader with any questions. An occupational therapist or specially trained nurse performed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Four physiotherapists from the research team without knowledge of group allocation (blinded) performed all physical tests. Information about the testers training can be found in a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The assessment procedure was repeated after 12&#x000a0;weeks (intervention completion) and 6&#x000a0;months and was carried out December 2012 to September 2013.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Instruments</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Physical function-tests</title><p>The primary outcome was <italic>balance</italic> measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The test assesses performance on a 5-level scale from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal performance) on 14 different tasks involving functional balance control, including transfer, turning and stepping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The six-meter walking test at comfortable speed with or without a walking aid tested <italic>mobility</italic> in the participants. The time in seconds was recorded and calculated as meters per second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. <italic>Muscle strength</italic> was measured by the 30-s chair stand test (CST). The score equals the number of rises from the chair in 30&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The physical tests used in this study were tested for inter-tester reliability in 33 of the participants. The tests were found to have high inter-tester reliability (ICC &#x02265;&#x02009;0.97 on BBS, CST and NWS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. To measure the patients&#x02019; dependence in the <italic>ADL,</italic> we employed the Barthel Index (BI), a widely used measure of the activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The BI consists of 10 activities focusing on the patient&#x02019;s level of dependence on aid. The scores range from 0 (completely dependent) to 20 (independent). Professional caregivers filled out the BI-questionnaire based on their observations of the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Dementia, cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms</title><p>The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to measure <italic>cognition</italic>. We used the CDR to validate the dementia diagnosis of the patients. CDR is a six-point scale used to assess six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and related dementias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

The MMSE was used to assess global cognition and consists of 20 items concerning orientation, word registration and recall, attention, naming, reading, writing, following commands and figure copying. It can be scored between zero and 30, where a higher score indicates better performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to assess the presence and severity of <italic>behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms</italic> common in dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The scale consists of 10 items. Each item represents a symptom and is rated as present or not (zero). If present, the severity is graded as mild (1) , moderate (2) or severe (3). Thus the minimum score is 0 (no symptoms at all) and the maximum score is 30. We also used sub- scales of the NPI-Q in the analyses, based on a previous large principal component analysis conducted with data from Norwegian nursing home patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The subscales were: 1) agitation: consisting of the items agitation/ aggression, irritability, and disinhibition (range: 0&#x02013;9) 2) affective: consisting of the items depression and anxiety (range 0&#x02013;6), and 3) apathy: The symptom apathy was analysed on its own.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Depression and quality of life</title><p>Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] was used to assess <italic>depression</italic> in the participants.

The minimum score is thus zero and maximum score is 38. According to a Norwegian nursing home study, a Cornell scale score of more than 7 points signifies depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. &#x0201c;The quality of life in late-stage dementia scale&#x0201d;, QUALID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] a proxy-rated scale was used to measure the QoL. The informants were professional caregivers who knew the patient well and had spent at least three of the last seven days with the patient. The scale consists of 11 items with a possible score of one to five on each item, which gives a total possible score range from 11 to 55.

The intervention and the control group were similar at baseline. The characteristics of the 16 participants who were not included in the ITT analyses were not significantly different from the final ITT population. The average age of the participants was 86.9&#x000a0;years (7.4) and almost three out of four were women. Thirty-one percent was able to walk independently without walking aid and less than 10&#x000a0;% used a wheel chair. The average score on Berg Balance Scale was 35 points points and two thirds scored less than 45 at baseline, which means they are at increased risk of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Ninety-four percent of the participants walked slower than 0.8 m per second, which means an increased risk of frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].

Balance was the predetermined primary outcome. An effect of exercise on balance function was also found immediately after 12&#x000a0;weeks of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The change in BBS from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months follow-up was 2.7 points in the exercise group. To the authors knowledge, clinically meaningful change has not been determined for BBS, however minimal detectable change for dependent institutionalized elderly has been reported to be 7.7 points in a Swedish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This means that due to intra-person variability of balance function from one day to another, a change in BBS score should be at least 8 or higher in dependent nursing home residents to represent a true change. Even though the EG had a slight improvement in lower limb strength (CST) and the CG deteriorated during the 24&#x000a0;weeks, the difference in change between the groups was not significant and both groups declined during detraining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The deterioration in strength after exercise cessation has been demonstrated in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. An RCT using the HIFE-programme in a population of 191 nursing home residents including 50&#x000a0;% patients with dementia demonstrated long-term effect on walking speed, balance (BBS) and lower limb strength (1RM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The exercise group improved on both balance and strength during the detraining period while the control group improved in balance and declined in strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In contrast to our study, the design of the study by Rosendahl et al., 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], included continuous encouragement of the participants to do tasks to maintain physical function for another three months after the intervention period. This could explain their positive long-term effects. In our study, the withdrawal of intervention might have led to a disappointment for some of the EG-participants, they may have lost interest and become inactive which led to the decline in balance and strength after exercise cessation. It is however interesting to notice that, even though both EG and CG deteriorated on almost all variables during detraining period, the CG decline was of greater extent, indicating that even terminated exercise has some effect. Preservation of effect from functional exercises has also been demonstrated in community-dwelling elderly women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. DeVreede et al., 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], found that the group who did functional exercises scored better than resistance-training group and inactive control group on Assessment of Daily Activity Performance (ADAP) six months after training ended. The ADAP provides a total score and five physical domain scores: upper body strength, lower body strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance and coordination. It is likely that the effect is easier to maintain due to the functional nature of these exercises which means that they are repeated throughout the day even when not exercising.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Long-term effect on mental health</title><p>From baseline to 6&#x000a0;months assessment, the EG improved on the NPI sum score and all sub-scores while the CG deteriorated on these scores. The differences between groups were significant for the agitation sub-score. An effect of exercise on apathy was found at 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but at 6&#x000a0;months there was no longer a statistically difference between groups. High quality RCTs are lacking, however smaller uncontrolled and observational studies suggest effect on agitation of walking in groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and continuous program activities including physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. A pilot study with chair-exercises did not demonstrate any effect on agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], but this might be due to too low intensity. A review of effect of exercise on behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia states that exercise appear to be beneficial in reducing depressed mood, agitation and wandering, however the review emphasizes that the methodological shortcomings of work in this area are substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The results from our study show that it is possible to influence on neuropsychiatric symptoms by other means than medication and this is important due to the overuse of antipsychotics to treat behavioural problems in persons with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The modest effect of these drugs coupled with the increase in risk of adverse effects argues for a shift towards other treatment modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Encouragement and stimulation to be physically active is of great importance, and access to rehabilitation staff seems crucial to achieve improvements in function among nursing home residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Nursing home residents are a frail group that often has difficulty carrying out physical training on their own. In order to maintain positive results physical training should be an on-going activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>There are limitations in the present study. First of all our inclusion criteria restrict our findings to nursing home residents with the ability to rise from a chair with the maximum help from one person and being able to walk for 6 m with or without walking aid. This means that the frailest residents have not been included, even though some of the participants used electrical wheel chairs and managed to move six meters only with great help from support walkers.</p><p>The recruitment through meetings and direct invitations may also introduce some bias in generalizations. Each nursing home was asked to recruit up to 12 participants. This may have led to recruitment of only the healthiest. However only three out of 18 nursing homes managed to recruit 12 participants, so it is unlikely that this strategy has influenced the characteristics of the population. It is difficult to ensure homogeneity of the intervention since a total of 27 physiotherapists were involved in the execution of the intervention and 18 professional caregivers carried out the control activity.</p><p>The amount of formal tests is high in this study and, since this could lead to alpha inflation, the secondary endpoints should be interpreted as descriptive statistics and not formal probabilities. One way to adjust for the high number of variables is to use the Bonferroni correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. According to Bonferroni the modified <italic>p</italic>-value at 95&#x000a0;% confidence when testing 11 variables is 0.0045. At this significance level the results from the current study are not statistically significant, however there are strong indications of effect of exercise on neuropsychiatric symptoms that should be investigated further as a primary outcome.</p><p>The frequency of training sessions and the long period of intervention (12&#x000a0;weeks) strengthened the study, but it may be questioned whether three months of intervention is a sufficient time period for optimal benefit. We did not gather information about the habitual physical activity of our participants, thus we cannot control for whether the level of physical activity in addition to the exercise contributed to the results. The physical outcome measures may have been affected by the reduced amount of motivation and/ or understanding in some participants. It is also a limitation of the study that some of the questionnaires may have been filled out by nursing staff with limited knowledge and experience with the different instruments. Assistance was offered, but it is not certain that all involved felt comfortable to contact project leader to attain wanted information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>Strengths of the study are factors such as blinding of testers, randomization and analysis by intention to treat. The linear mixed model for repeated measurements is effective in accommodating missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. However, a complete case analysis demonstrated the same results as presented, and this indicates that the effect of missing was minimal. In each group, data from T1 or T2, or both, were missing for 15 participants. The participants with missing data were slightly older, scored higher on MMSE and lower on Cornell scale, but the differences were not statistically significant. The high attendance and low dropout rate is a strength of the study, and so is the use of simple and inexpensive equipment. In addition, by employing local physiotherapists, we have demonstrated that effect can be achieved at most nursing homes with access to basic gym equipment and physiotherapy recourses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results indicate long-time positive effects of a high intensity functional exercise program on balance. A possible effect of exercise on agitation is demonstrated after an intervention period of 12&#x000a0;weeks followed by a detraining period of 12&#x000a0;weeks. Future research should focus on exploring the effect of exercise on mental health in the population of nursing home residents with mild and moderate dementia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>KE and AB have made substantial contributions to conception and design of the study.
