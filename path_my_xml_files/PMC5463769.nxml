The selected children were randomly divided into the study and control group comprising of 20 each. In the control group, initial oral examination and dental
treatment (oral prophylaxis and class I restoration) were performed without the use of dental sign language. In the study group, the dental sign language specific
to dental treatment was educated and during their subsequent visit to the dental clinic after dental sign language reinforcement, oral prophylaxis and class I restoration were done.
Subjective and objective measurements of anxiety were recorded for both groups using facial image scale (FIS), pulse oximeter and electronic blood pressure apparatus
to compare for correlation. The obtained data were subjected to statistical analysis using unpaired t-test.

both their social and working life.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Communication is the biggest barrier deaf children face as it is a two-way process. Patients with
hearing loss need to be helped to understand as well as possible and also need to know how to communicate in the best way.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Many methods of communication are available to help the hearing-impaired children to function in a normal way (hearing aids, cochlear implants, video phone/relay, phone relay, interpreters).
However, most of the techniques are either expensive or not readily available, few are not useful because of the severity of hearing impairment, and others are practical difficulties during
treatment. Sign language is the sensible answer for improving communication with hearing impaired children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Dental anxiety is a common problem that affects people belonging to all ages and appears to develop mostly in childhood and adolescence. Dental anxiety can prevent patients
from cooperating totally during dental treatment. Dentists need to understand the anxiety and its repercussions in dental care so that a relationship of trust may be
established with the patient for the implementation of strategies aimed at reducing the anxiety caused by dental treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Anxiety
reducing strategies are further compromised in hearing impaired children because of their problem in communicating with others. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate
the applicability of dental sign language in hearing impaired children for relieving anxiety during dental treatment by improving their means of communication.
</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Method</title><p>This study was performed in the Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry Department, St. Joseph Dental College, India. This randomized clinical trial comprised of 40 children who were equally divided into the study and control group. Both groups had an equal distribution of males and females. Children who had moderate to severe hearing impairment with moderate to poor oral health requiring restoration for a class I dental lesion and with no previous dental experience were selected for the study. The selected children age ranged between 6-12 years with mean age of 8.4&#x000b1;3.4 years. The protocol of the study was approved and ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from parents/guardians of the selected children participating in the study.
</p><p>In the control group, oral prophylaxis and class I restorations were done without the explanation of the treatment procedure. During treatment, there were no means of communication used between the operating dentist and the child.
</p><p>In the study group, 20 children were divided into groups of 10 each, for convenience to effectively educate dental sign language. The dental sign language specific to dental treatment was educated by trained professionals using visual aids. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JDS-18-112-g001.tif">Figure 1</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JDS-18-112-g002.tif">Figure 2</xref>) During their visit to the dental clinic, a quick review of dental sign language using the visual aids was given before the treatment, which acted as reinforcement. All treatment procedures and instructions to be followed were explained using the dental sign language by the operating dentist. During the procedure, use of dental sign language was repeated for giving instructions and also for reassurance to patients, which acted as a means of communication.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="Discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Deaf people have a problem in learning health recommendations. Limited knowledge of deaf people makes their health care more complicated, due to
their communication problems.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The hearing-impaired children may have special accessibility problems
in health care because the health system does not meet their special needs for communication. Healthcare staffs are often not aware of the
barriers faced by the hearing impaired. Many hearing-impaired patients complain that they were not properly informed about the disease they had, treatment and prognosis.
Hearing-impaired patients have the same rights to full information as other patients. Inadequate communication may create problems for the professional if the patient does
not follow treatment instructions properly.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Communication is the process of exchanging messages or information between two or more parties. The basic forms of communication are of two types such as verbal and non-verbal communication.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]
There has been little consideration of dental care for children with hearing impairments. Till date, there are no studies reported in the literature comparing the efficacy of sign language
described specifically for dentistry in relieving anxiety for hearing impaired children.
</p><p>Dental fear has been ranked fourth among common fears. Anxious individuals are generally uncooperative during their dental visits, tend to cancel more dental appointments,
and develop decreased pain threshold.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The main causes of dental fear and anxiety reported by the children were fear of pain
and fear of unknown.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p> In the present study, the mean values of subjective and objective measurements of anxiety were higher in girls compared to boys. This is similar to the
observations in the studies conducted by Berge M et al[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Chellappah NK et al.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Literature indicates a shortage of information on the prevalence of dental fear in special children. This study demonstrated that a high proportion of hearing impaired
children suffered from dental anxiety, thus requiring measures to overcome them. Dental sign language is a sign-language system specially designed for dentistry,
explaining the various dental equipment, procedures, and techniques. Hearing impaired children cannot verbalize their concerns and fears during the dental treatment.
Dental sign language can help in restoring trust in a dentist-patient relationship. In the present study, fear of the unknown was eliminated by explaining the procedure
to children using the dental sign language. Raymond Cadden was the creator of the eight-sign method (Dentisign) that was designed to reduce the anxiety levels during dental
treatment. But these 8 dental signs were not sufficient to communica-te effectively with the disabled children.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hence,
in combination with Dentisign additional signs specific to dentistry[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were used to explain the procedure. 
</p><p>In the present study, there was a statistically significant difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure before the initiation of treatment,
with higher values in the study group. Once the treatment was initiated there was a marked reduction in the blood pressure values in the study group, which was statistically significant. 
</p><p>With respect to the values of FIS and pulse rate, there was no statistically significant difference between the study and the control group before
the initiation of treatment. With the initiation of treatment, there was a statistically significant difference between the study and control groups
with higher values in the control group. Similarly, after completion of treatment, there was a statistically significant difference between the study
and control groups with higher values in the control group. These findings indicate that with the use of sign language designed specifically for dental
treatment a statistically significant reduction in the anxiety levels was observed in the hearing impaired children. 
</p><p>Champion et al.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] evaluated difficulties experienced by hearing-impaired children in accessing dental care and/or
in receiving dental treatment. Major issues raised by respondents were lack of deaf awareness, lack of specific calling systems, need to learn and to use basic
sign language, using explanatory videos/books, dentist not pulling the mask down to speak to, not facing child to communicate, and lack of positive attitude of
dentist in handling hearing impaired children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In our study, most of the issues raised by the hearing-impaired children respondents were overcome by utilizing the dental sign language.
Children were able to express their thoughts and feelings with the dentist during the procedure using the signs such as stop, suction, pain and so on.
This shows that an element of control and also means of communication were provided for the hearing impaired children which may explain the reason
for decreased anxiety in the study group. Children were able to learn dental sign language within 20 minutes and used learned signs effectively during
dental treatment which proves that the dental sign language was easy to learn, remember and implement. 
</p><p>The limitation of the present study is the sample size, further studies with a larger sample size that include more children in each gender and
with different age groups are recommended. Moreover, further studies can be pursued by comparing sign language with other means of communication
in children having differing levels of hearing impairment. In this study, the blood pressure was different before the procedure which may cause an error,
but this was a variable that could not be controlled. Since even an eye-to-eye communication may impact the anxiety of a patient, there might be a bias
in the selection of the study group. The effectiveness of sign language could have been further proved by including a third control group that only receives a simple communication like holding the hands.

By learning these simple signs, dentists can help in developing a positive attitude and make hearing impaired children dental visits more pleasant.
