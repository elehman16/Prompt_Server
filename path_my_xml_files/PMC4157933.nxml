For this research, 139 adults for the K-DTVP-2 and 192 adults for the VMI-3R, from a total of 283 participants, were randomly and separately recruited in province, Korea. The present study showed that the mean score of the K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R in 10-yr age increments significantly decreased as age increased (K-DTVP-2, F= 41.120, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; VMI-3R, F= 16.583, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). The mean score of the VMI-3R and K-DTVP-2 were significantly decreased in participants in their 50s compared to those in their 20s (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Age (t= &#x02212;9.130, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), gender (t= 3.029, <italic>P</italic>= 0.003), and the presence of diseases (t= &#x02212;2.504, <italic>P</italic>= 0.013) were the significant factors affecting K-DTVP-2 score. On the other hand, age (t= &#x02212;6.300, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) was the only significant factor affecting VMI-3R score. K-DTVP-2 score (Standardized <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>= &#x02212;0.611) decreased more sensitively with aging than VMI-3R (Standardized <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>= &#x02212;0.467). The two measurements had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.855, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). In conclusion, it can be suggested that VP and VMI should be regularly checked from an individual&#x02019;s 50s, which is a critical period for detecting cognitive decline by aging. Both the K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R could be used for determining the level of cognitive deficit by aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Cognitive function</kwd><kwd>Visual function</kwd><kwd>Visual perception</kwd><kwd>Visual motor integration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The increase in the older population is a worldwide phenomenon. Korea is one of the countries where it has been progressing most quickly (<xref rid="b19-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Statistics Korea, 2011</xref>). Along with the population aging, the incidence of several age-related neural diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis has been constantly increasing (<xref rid="b18-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Sole, 2010</xref>). In particular, cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is very common in older adults, and it frequently converts into dementia within 6 yr (<xref rid="b12-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b16-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Many previous studies have shown that cognitive decline is closely associated with visual dysfunctions such as in visual perception (VP) and visual-motor integration (VMI). <xref rid="b10-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Owsley (2003)</xref> reported that changes in visual functions are the earliest remarkable signs of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and <xref rid="b13-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Malloy et al. (2003)</xref> suggested that testing VMI is effective in discriminating whether elderly individuals have cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease or mild cognitive impairment. In addition, recent studies have shown that changes in visuospatial perception could be a potential biomarker to detect the early stages of cognitive decline. Visuospatial dysfunction has been found in mild cognitive impairment from children to older adults (<xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Elliott, 2011</xref>; Graewe et al., 2012; <xref rid="b14-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Mandal et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that VMI was lower in older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with those without DM (<xref rid="b21-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2011</xref>) and that it has a retrograde association with age, thus suggesting effective methods to detect cognitive changes (<xref rid="b11-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, there are still only relatively few studies to demonstrate the utility of VP and VMI for the detection of cognitive decline in older adults and there is no time-guideline on the measurement of cognitive decline for older adults.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed 1) to investigate the changes of VP and VMI caused by aging in Korean adults in order to determine whether they can be used to detect cognitive decline, and what the critical period for cognitive decline might be; 2) to find out the main influencing factors on VP and VMI in older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study was an explanatory survey research to explore the differences between VMI-3R and K-DTVP-2 with comparing the results measured by them and investigate more appropriate measurement for the changes of visual perception and visual-motor integration by aging in Korean adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>On condition that the number of groups 6, one-way ANOVA, effect size 0.40, statistical power 80%, and significance level 0.05, the total sample size for this study calculated by G-Power 3.1 is 90. Total participants of this study were separately 192 adults for VMI-3R and 139 for K-DTVP-2. The study was carried out from April to August in 2011 and participants were randomly recruited in Daegu and Gyeongbuk in Korea. The inclusion criteria were 1) adults from 20 to 79 yr old who could communicate, understand the purpose of the research, and give their consent for the participation of the study, 2) no visual difficulties, the defect of the visual field and motor disturbance that could affect response, 3) no history and medication for psychological problem, and 4) the completion of the survey.</p><p>The characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref rid="t1-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The total number of participants in this study was 283. The range of age was between 20 and 79 yr old. All participants were measured gender, height, weight, BMI, the presence of diseases, and exercise patterns. The mean BMI of the participants aged 40 yr and older were above 23 meaning overweight. The weight and the presence of diseases were increased with aging (<xref rid="t1-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>K-DTVP-2</title><p>DTVP was initially designed to measure children&#x02019;s visual perceptual characteristics by Frostig in 1961. After that, it was revised into DTVP-2 that classified as 2 sub-items, Motor-Reduced Visual Perception (MRP) and Visual-Motor Integration (VMI). K-DTVP-2 is the Korean version of DTVP-2 to measure 4 to 8 yr old children&#x02019;s visual perceptual ability and helps to identify concrete visual-perceptual disability in developmental stages (<xref rid="b15-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>K-DTVP-2 consist of 8 sub-tests, 1) eye-hand coordination, 2) position in space, 3) copying, 4) figure-ground, 5) spatial relations, 6) visual closure, 7) visual-motor speed, and 8) form constancy. <xref rid="b15-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al. (2003)</xref> have proposed that the original total score of each sub-item must be converted to the standard score to compare and interpret because the upper limits of them are respectively different. The General Visual Perception Quotients (GVPQ) converted sum of standard scores of sub-items into with an average of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 is the most reliable DTVP-2 score. It includes Motor-Reduced Visual Perception Quotients (MRPQ) and Visual-Motor Integration Quotients (VMIQ). GVPQ &#x0003c;70 means very low-grade, 70&#x02013;79 low, 80&#x02013;89 below the average, 90&#x02013;110 on the average, 111&#x02013;120 above the average, 121&#x02013;130 high, and &#x0003e;130 very high-grade.

This study intended to investigate the changes of visual functions caused by aging in Korean adults with the K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R tests.</p><p>Primary results in this study showed that the mean scores of the K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R continuously decreased with age. Among the 10-yr age groups, from the 20s to 70s, the youngest population had the highest mean score, and the oldest had the lowest on both measurements. In both tests, the scores for VP and VMI had decreased in the 50s group compared to the 20s. Even though age-groups with the highest mean score for visual function in each measurement are different, the main results of previous studies - the visual deficits are caused by aging - are consistent with the present result (<xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Elliott, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b4-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brockmole and Logie, 2013</xref>). It has been reported that visual working memory (VWM) develops until the age of 20 and then declines continuously with age. The mean VWM score of a 55 yr old is lower than that of 8 and 9 yr olds (<xref rid="b4-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brockmole and Logie, 2013</xref>). <xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Elliott (2011)</xref> also reported that VP constantly develops until the age of 39 and then gradually deteriorates. Together with the previous studies, the present study supports the idea that cognitive functions included in VP and VMI decline by aging, and suggests that individuals in their 50s could be in a critical period to start to decrease in cognitive function. Until now, there have been few longitudinal studies for age-related cognitive changes because of their cost and time (<xref rid="b18-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Sole, 2010</xref>). Therefore, whether the regular screening of VP and VMI is needed from age 50 in order to detect cognitive declines caused by aging should be considered.</p><p>In this study, we also investigated main factors affecting changes of the scores of the VP and VMI measurements. Age, gender, BMI, the presence of diseases, and exercise patterns were examined as predictors in both measurements. Age, gender, and presence of diseases had an influence on the decrease of the K-DTVP-2 score, and age alone had an influence on the decrease of the VMI-3R score. Many studies demonstrate that visual function is changed by aging. <xref rid="b7-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al. (2001)</xref> proposes that age directly affects changes of visual function, and <xref rid="b9-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Herrera-Guzm&#x000e1;n et al. (2004)</xref> have reported that age is an influencing factor of VP in healthy older adults aged 50 to 80. Recently, <xref rid="b11-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2013)</xref> showed that VP and VMI are affected by age. On the other hand, gender and the presence of diseases had an influence only on the score of the K-DTVP-2 in this study. The present result showed that females and individuals with some diseases had lower K-DTVP-2 scores compared to men and healthy individuals, respectively. Several studies on cognitive function, including VP and VMI, support the present results with regard to gender (<xref rid="b9-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Herrera-Guzm&#x000e1;n et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b11-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b17-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Pauls et al., 2013</xref>) and some diseases including diabetes, depression, and neurological impairment (<xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b21-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2011</xref>;). In contrast, <xref rid="b20-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Tekok-Kili&#x000c7; et al. (2010)</xref> reported that there is no sex difference in VMI in children aged 6 to 15 yr old. Therefore, it could be suggested that the most determinate factor on VP and VMI is age. Other factors such as gender, education, and smoking could be additionally considered in further studies.</p><p>In the present study, K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R were positively correlated with one another. This result indicates that both measurements for cognitive function could be supposed to detect cognitive decline by aging. Several studies have demonstrated that cognitive decline is related to visual perceptual dysfunction (<xref rid="b1-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b10-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Owsley, 2003</xref>), visual perception (<xref rid="b5-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Elliott, 2011</xref>), and visual dysfunctions (<xref rid="b10-jer-10-4-245" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Owsley, 2003</xref>). Comparing standardized coefficients, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, and explanatory power between the two measurements, the K-DTVP-2 seems to be more strongly affected by age than the VMI-3R. However, the K-DTVP-2 is more sensitive other factors such as gender and disease. In addition, the K-DTVP-2 covers more cognitive fields, such as both VP and VMI at the same time. On the other hand, VMI is more easily checked in participants, and in less time. Therefore, it could not yet be determined which measurement is the most reliable and sensitive to detect cognitive decline by aging.</p><p>In conclusion, the present results show that VP and VMI had declined steadily with aging and had significantly decreased by the time participants were in their 50s, compared to participants in their 20s. The main influencing factor on both VP and VMI is age, and the changes of K-DTVP-2 score were affected by age, gender, and the presence of diseases. Related to the measurement, K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R had a strong correlation with each other and K-DTVP-2 changed more sensitively than VMI-3R by age because K-DTVP-2 is inherently more sensitive and covers more cognitive fields. Based on these results, it can be suggested that VP and VMI should be checked regularly from at least the 50s, which is a critical period for detecting cognitive decline by aging, Both K-DTVP-2 and VMI-3R could be used for determining the level of cognitive deficits induced by aging. Further study is needed to review the effect of VMI on detecting cognitive decline in the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold></p><p>No potential conflict
