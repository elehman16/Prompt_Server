If the goal of elimination is to be achieved, additional control measures including an effective and durable vaccine will be required. Studies utilising the prime-boost approach to deliver viral vectors encoding the pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) have shown promising safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in sporozoite challenge studies. More recently, a study in Kenyan adults, similar to that reported here, showed substantial efficacy against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection. One hundred and twenty healthy male volunteers, living in a malaria endemic area of Senegal were randomised to receive either the Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) ME-TRAP as prime vaccination, followed eight weeks later by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) also encoding ME-TRAP as booster, or two doses of anti-rabies vaccine as a comparator. Prior to follow-up, antimalarials were administered to clear parasitaemia and then participants were monitored by PCR for malaria infection for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was time-to-infection with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria, determined by two consecutive positive PCR results. Secondary endpoints included adverse event reporting, measures of cellular and humoral immunogenicity and a meta-analysis of combined vaccine efficacy with the parallel study in Kenyan adults.We show that this pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine is safe and induces significant immunogenicity, with a peak T-cell response at seven days after boosting of 932 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/10<sup>6</sup> Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMC) compared to 57 SFC/ 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs in the control group. However, a vaccine efficacy was not observed: 12 of 57 ME-TRAP vaccinees became PCR positive during the intensive monitoring period as compared to 13 of the 58 controls (P = 0.80). This trial confirms that vaccine efficacy against malaria infection in adults may be rapidly assessed using this efficient and cost-effective clinical trial design. Further efficacy evaluation of this vectored candidate vaccine approach in other malaria transmission settings and age-de-escalation into the main target age groups for a malaria vaccine is in progress.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001713</institution-id><institution>European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IP.2008.31100.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><string-name>MVVC Group</string-name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by an award from the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) and was performed by the Malaria Vectored Vaccines Consortium (MVVC), an integrated project funded by EDCTP (grant number IP.2008.31100.001).

Elimination and subsequent eradication of malaria has been the subject of discourse for several years [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, if the goal of eradication is to be achieved, additional control measures including effective and durable vaccines will be required.</p><p>The pre-erythocytic malaria vaccine RTS, S targeting the circumsporozoite protein, is the most advanced vaccine in clinical development. In the recently published Phase III clinical trial in over 15,000 infants and children in several African countries, the efficacy of RTS, S, with AS01 as adjuvant, in young children was about 50% during the first year [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but lower at 34&#x02013;36% over 4 years [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Efficacy declines with time and was much lower against severe malaria after 3 years of follow-up in younger infants (10&#x02013;17%)[<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This partial efficacy necessitates the development of other candidate vaccines, which could be used alone or in combination with RTS, S. Studies in multiple disease areas show that vectored vaccines induce more potent T cell responses that can provide significant efficacy. Heterologous prime-boost immunisation with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccines is a vaccination strategy recently shown to induce cell-mediated responses against several <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria antigens [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. ChAd63-MVA expressing the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope string thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) is one of the most advanced malaria vaccine candidates, capable of inducing sterile protection in 21% of malaria na&#x000ef;ve adults following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)[<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Recently in Sukuta, The Gambia and Kilifi, Kenya, two phase Ib dose-escalation clinical trials were undertaken to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this approach in 46 healthy malaria-exposed adults as previously, immunogenicity had only been described in predominantly Caucasian, malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults. These two studies showed encouraging results, with both vaccines shown to be safe and well tolerated, with high-level T cell responses induced (median &#x0003e; 1300 Spot Forming Cells/million Peripheral Blood Monuclear Cells [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The T cell responses appeared to be the most potent reported in Africa for any vaccine type and were therefore consistent with the growing evidence that ChAd63 and MVA were promising vectors for clinical use. In Kilifi in Eastern Kenya, malaria is endemic with two transmission seasons (April-June and October-December) while in Senegal the transmission is made of one short and intense transmission season (July to August-November). It was therefore useful to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate vaccine in semi-immune West African adults exposed to different malaria transmission conditions.</p><p>The use of PCR detection has been found to be feasible and cost-effective in studies conducted in The Gambia and more recently in Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These clinical efficacy trials measure time to PCR-detected infection after drug clearance of parasites. Efficacy against infection is measured over an 8-week follow-up period starting 14 days after the final vaccination (7 days after drug clearance). In a Phase IIb trial of vaccine efficacy in 120 Kenyan adults, efficacy against infection was 67% (95%CI 33% to 83%), p = 0.002, over 8 weeks of follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Using malaria infection detected by PCR as an endpoint for efficacy, we assessed the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of priming with the same vaccines and doses, ChAd63 ME-TRAP (5 x 10<sup>5</sup> vp) vaccine and boosting with MVA ME-TRAP (2 x 10<sup>8</sup> pfu), 8 weeks apart in healthy adult volunteers in Senegal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Registration:</bold> Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (Ref: PACTR 201-303-000-499-409); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/">http://www.pactr.org</ext-link></p><sec id="sec003"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted in the peri-urban area of Dakar in Senegal, West Africa, in one of the Universit&#x000e9; Cheikh Anta Diop&#x02019;s (UCAD) sites located in the Roi Baudoin Hospital in Gu&#x000e9;diawaye from June 2012 to March 2013. Gu&#x000e9;diawaye is a small town situated on the coastal shoreline in the Dakar region, bordered to the East and the South by the town of Pikine and to the West by the city of Dakar, specifically by the municipal district of Parcelles Assainies [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is located approximately 10 km from the capital, and covers an area of 30 km<sup>2</sup>. Its population is estimated at 452,168 inhabitants and the average annual rainfall amounts to approximately 600 mm.

There are several reasons that account for the resurgence of malaria in the Dakar suburbs: (i) a high population density, (ii) cyclic flooding in lowland areas since the year 2000, (iii) the lack of a drainage system, and (iv) the existence of several wetland areas (containment basins, marshland, etc.)</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design and interventions</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the &#x0201c;<italic>Conseil National d&#x02019;Ethique pour la Recherche en Sant&#x000e9;&#x0201d;</italic> (CNERS) of Senegal as well as the &#x0201c;Direction de la Pharmacie et des M&#x000e9;dicaments&#x0201d; (DPM), the Senegalese regulatory authority, and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC).

The recombinant vectors have been previously described in detail [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Eligible study participants were randomised to receive either the ChAd63 ME-TRAP (5x10<sup>5</sup> vp) as prime vaccination, followed eight weeks later by MVA ME-TRAP (2x10<sup>8</sup> pfu) as booster or two doses of anti-rabies vaccine (0.5ml) as comparator at the same interval. All vaccines were administered intramuscularly.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial participants</title><p>Healthy men aged 18&#x02013;50 years old were screened and 120 eligible volunteers were selected to participate in this trial. Prior to the commencement of the study, local community sensitisation (collective and individual) meetings were held to introduce to members of the community the purpose and nature of the clinical trial. Screening of eligible volunteers commenced after signed informed consent was obtained. Volunteers enrolled into the study were required to be in good health, within the age range, and residing in the study area for the duration of the study. Exclusion of volunteers occurred if there was any physical, haematological or biochemical evidence of ill health. In order to maintain confidentiality, anonymised HIV test were conducted using the standard rapid diagnostic kits and testing algorithm used by the Senegalese Ministry of Health and Prevention. A trained counsellor provided pre-test counseling. Eligible volunteers who participated in the trial met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of safety and reactogenicity</title><p>Volunteers were observed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination. A number of volunteers were assigned to each of the 12 field workers who visited them at home on day one post-vaccination and were assessed in the clinic on day 14 and 7 after the first and second vaccinations respectively. The local solicited adverse events (AEs) were; pain, discoloration, swelling, warmth, itch, scaling or blistering at the injection site. Systemic solicited AEs were; headache, malaise, arthralgia, reported fever, nausea, myalgia and documented fever (temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C). Using pre-determined criteria, the intensity of AEs was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded during the whole study period.

The immunogenicity was determined at D0, D14 (2 weeks post vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP), D63 (7 days post vaccination with MVA-ME-TRAP) and D161. While ME-TRAP ELISpots were performed on samples from all volunteers at D63 (the peak time-point for vaccine-induced cellular immunity), due to the high cost and staff requirement of the immunology analysis, we did a second randomization to allocate measurement of ELISpot responses at D0, D14 and D161 to 30 volunteers only. Fresh PBMCs were isolated from 40 ml of heparinized blood using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd). ELISA and ELISpot assays were performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An AID ELISPOT plate reader with software v7 was used to count the spots. The mean of the negative control wells, containing cells and medium only, was subtracted from the mean of all the other duplicate wells for each volunteer. The mean response of all ME-TRAP peptide pool wells were then summed and expressed as SFC per million PBMC. Peptide pools are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167951.s003">S3 Table</xref>. The maximum permitted value of the negative control well was 80 SFC, while the minimum for the positive well was 800 SFC.

The study achieved a good completion rate with 114 volunteers out of 120 completing the trial and no vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. The adverse events reported were mostly mild to moderate, in line with data from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and overall ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP was found to be well tolerated.</p><p>ELISpot responses to TRAP peptides were detected at all-time points (baseline, day14, day 63 and day 161) in both groups, with baseline responses comparable to those observed in previous studies in Kenyan, Gambian and UK adults. [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] As expected, T cell immunogenicity in these malaria-exposed young Senegalese men peaked at one week after the MVA booster dose, at mean level of 923 SFC per million PBMCs. As previously observed in both malaria-na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune vaccinees, immunisation with the ME-TRAP construct induced responses to several epitopes spanning the length of the antigen, indicating that peptides are recognized through a number of different MHC alleles. These responses were however lower than those reported in Kenya at each time point, where the immune response peaked at 1421 SFC [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as lower than in UK studies where the mean response exceeded 2000 [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The surprising difference in immunogenicity found between Kenya and Senegal may partially be explained by several reasons including the lower immunogenicity at baseline in Senegal (60 SFC in Gu&#x000e9;diawaye compared with 112 SFC in Kilifi) The ChAd63 ME-TRAP priming in Kilifi may have acted as a booster dose to naturally acquired immunity. The absence of malaria exposure in the first weeks of follow up in Senegal may have pushed the rate ratio towards 1 and obscured any genuine protective efficacy. In other words, with the absence of malaria risk in both study groups in the first two weeks of the trial, the rate ratio at day 14 was still 1 and vaccine efficacy (1-RR) = 0. This period of zero vaccine efficacy pulls down the overall efficacy for all eight weeks. Malaria transmission is nearly perennial in Kenya with two different transmission seasons, while the transmission pattern in Senegal is very different. There is a long dry (minimal transmission) season of about 9 months followed by a wet season of 3 months. Malaria is actually transmitted only during part of the wet season. Transmission is therefore intense and short. Outside this transmission window, there may be a total absence of exposure.</p><p>Among 205 adults from another Senegalese population (Keur Soc&#x000e9; in Central Senegal), serum samples tested for anti-ChAd63 neutralizing antibodies indicated that all had previous exposure to ChAd63 or a related adenovirus. Such results have been observed in other populations [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and are most likely due to varying degrees of cross reactivity with related adenoviruses to which volunteers had been exposed. Importantly, this relatively low level of anti-vector &#x02018;s immunity, is found even in European populations (i.e. UK) and have been shown not to associate with any reduced immunogenicity of the ChAd63 ME-TRAP vector [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], most likely because the dose of ChAd63 used is sufficient to overcome the modest levels of neutralizing antibodies to ChAd vectors found in unimmunized humans. A previous malaria efficacy study evaluating a DNA prime and human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) vector for boosting did demonstrate a modest effect of pre-existing anti-vector immunogenicity on ELISA responses to the AMA1 antigen and trends for association with ELISPOT responses to CSP and AMA1[<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. None of the participants in this study that had high anti-AdHu5 neutralising antibodies prior to vaccination were protected against CHMI; however there was no statistical association between anti-vector immunity and efficacy. Therefore, the low prevalence of serum ChAd63-neutralizing antibodies in Gu&#x000e9;diawaye and the excellent immune responses generated even in the presence of detectable <italic>in vitro</italic> vector-neutralizing immunity [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] make ChAd63 a promising vaccine vector.</p><p>Vaccine efficacy against the primary endpoint (parasitaemia&#x0003e;0) was significantly different than that observed in the parallel study in Kenya where a vaccine efficacy of 67% was observed. A pre-specified pooled analysis of the data from both studies using Cox regression showed an overall vaccine efficacy in the two populations of 50% (95% confidence interval 17&#x02013;70%, p = 0.009) for time to first PCR positivity.</p><p>Although the unadjusted confidence intervals of the efficacy estimates in the two sites were overlapping, there was a significant interaction between the effects of site and vaccination (p = 0.009) but not with time since vaccination (p = 0.13). This provides statistical evidence from pooled Senegalese and Kenya datasets that there was variation in efficacy between the two studies rather than variation in efficacy over time since vaccination.</p><p>Several parasitological differences between the two sites that may be relevant to the apparent different vaccine efficacy are noteworthy:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>PCR positivity was more prevalent before monitoring commenced in Kenya compared to Senegal;</p></list-item><list-item><p>After antimalarial treatment, the incidence of PCR positivity was higher in Kenya yielding more power to detect efficacy than in the Senegalese study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The PCR data showed higher density parasitaemia in the trial in Senegal compared with the one in Kilifi, Kenya, representing a potentially more stringent challenge for the vaccine in the presence of less background malaria immunity. However, this likely reflects lower malaria transmission in the Senegalese population where the study was done, so that bites are less frequent and PCR positivity is less frequent; but when an infection occurs because prior exposure has been lower there is less blood stage immunity and therefore a higher peak parasitaemia is reached. The PCRs became positive in Kilifi only for a two-week period after anti-malarial treatment with no positives appearing later. In our Senegal study in contrast, the emergence of infections was evenly distributed throughout the follow-up period so that if vaccine efficacy falls very quickly lower efficacy could be seen in Senegal. However, the lack of significant interaction between site and time since vaccination in the combined model (above, p = 0.13) does not support this possibility.</p></list-item></list><p>It should be noted that in both sites examples of brief PCR positivity, without sustained parasite growth was observed, likely reflecting blood-stage immunity. Microscopy along with the qPCR was not performed after Atovaquone/Proguanil treatment.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the lack of vaccine efficacy in Senegal simply relates to lower vaccine immunogenicity. In UK CHMI studies a level of &#x0003e; 2000 SFU / million PBMCs was induced consistently by the ChAd-MVA regime [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and this was associated with significant efficacy that correlated with T cell numbers. Notably the ChAd63 vaccine alone induced about 864 SFU / million PBMCs and no sterile protection or delay to patency was observed. The Kenyan response level was a geometric mean of 1694 SFU, closer to the UK ChAd63-MVA level. Hence, the reduction in T cell immunogenicity in Senegal to levels close to that seen with the non-protective ChAd63 only vaccination in the UK might in part explain lower efficacy. If so, this would highlight the need to use vaccine regimes and doses that consistently induce high-level T cell responses in every population.</p><p>In addition to enhancing cellular immune responses to TRAP, vaccine efficacy might potentially be improved by including additional liver-stage antigens, such as PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2. These antigens have recently been shown to induce sterile efficacy against transgenic parasites in a murine model of malaria and are progressing to clinical evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another promising strategy is a combination approach harnessing the ability of viral vectors to induce potent cellular immunity in combination with a protein-in-adjuvant approach to inducing high antibody titres. We have recently reported high efficacy of such an approach combining the leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S with ChAd63 and MVA ME-TRAP [<xref rid="pone.0167951.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the results of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the ChAd63-MVA vaccination strategy in Kenyan and Senegalese young men gave encouraging results and provide, to our knowledge, the first indication of potential field efficacy of any vaccine designed to induce protective cellular immunity. It is now important that protective efficacy be assessed in younger populations, especially young children and infants, and these trials are underway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Criteria used to determine grade of solicited local adverse events.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Criteria used to Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Peptide Pooling Scheme used for ELISPOT Assays</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Trial profile</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s005"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Protocol</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s006"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 Checklist</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167951.s007"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Malaria positivity dataset.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167951.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Roi Baudouin Hospital team and the volunteers for their patience and cooperation; the internal monitor All&#x000e9; Baba Dieng, the members of the Data safety Monitoring Board (Prof G.
