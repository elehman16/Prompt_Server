Multiple long-acting psychostimulant formulations are available for use in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD (Thomas et al. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Briars and Todd <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, prescribers sometimes supplement existing long-acting psychostimulants with an immediate-release psychostimulant later to potentially extend symptom coverage and maintain after-school activities in children and adolescents with ADHD (Briars and Todd <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Requiring individuals to take medication multiple times a day can lead to challenges in adherence in individuals with ADHD (Steinhoff <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), suggesting that once-daily dosing is an important aspect of ADHD pharmacotherapy. In support of the importance of once-daily dosing, in a discrete choice experiment assessing preferred medication attributes, the number of administrations per day was reported as an important attribute in adolescents with ADHD (Glenngard et al. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>SHP465 mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) is a once-daily, extended-release, single-entity MAS product for oral administration approved for use in the United States for the treatment of ADHD in patients 13 years and older. SHP465 MAS contains equal amounts (by weight) of four salts: dextroamphetamine sulfate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, and amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. This results in a 3:1 mixture of dextro- to levoamphetamine base equivalent. SHP465 MAS capsules contain three types of drug-releasing beads, an immediate-release bead and two different types of delayed-release (DR) beads (Ermer et al. <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The first DR bead releases amphetamine at pH 5.5 and the other DR bead releases amphetamine at pH 7.0.</p><p>The short-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SHP465 MAS in adults with ADHD have been investigated in several phase 3 clinical trials. In a 7-week study, dose-optimized SHP465 MAS (12.5&#x02013;75&#x02009;mg) exhibited superiority over placebo in reducing ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score (the primary efficacy endpoint) (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In a 6-week study, forced-dose SHP465 MAS (25, 50, or 75&#x02009;mg) also produced significantly greater reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total score than placebo (Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Across these short-term phase 3 clinical studies, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in &#x02265;10% of participants taking SHP465 MAS were insomnia, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headache, and decreased weight (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>To date, there are no published phase 3 clinical studies on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SHP465 MAS in children (aged 6&#x02013;12 years) and adolescents (aged 13&#x02013;17 years) with ADHD. As such, this report is the first to describe a phase 3 clinical study of SHP465 MAS in children and adolescents with ADHD. The objectives were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SHP465 MAS versus placebo in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-optimization study (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri>: NCT02466425). The study was conducted at 36 sites in the United States between June 18, 2015, and February 16, 2016. The study protocol, protocol amendments, final informed consent document, and relevant supporting information were submitted to and approved by an Institutional Review Board and regulatory agency before study initiation. This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice, principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and local ethical and legal requirements. Written informed consent was obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures; consent and assent were documented by the dated signature of the participant and the participant's parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s).</p><p>The study consisted of four periods: a screening and washout period, a dose-optimization period of 2 weeks, a dose-maintenance period of 2 weeks, and a safety follow-up period. Participants were randomized 1:1 to placebo or dose-optimized SHP465 MAS (12.5 or 25&#x02009;mg) after the screening and washout period, which allowed for carryover effects of previous medications to abate. Randomization was stratified by age group (children vs. adolescents) to facilitate balance of treatment allocation. Treatment allocation was automatically assigned using interactive response technology; to protect study blinding, placebo capsules were indistinguishable from SHP465 MAS capsules.</p><p>The doses chosen for use in this study were determined based primarily on results from an unpublished phase 2 study in adolescents with ADHD. This study evaluated the safety and duration of effect of SHP465 MAS and demonstrated that 25&#x02009;mg SHP465 MAS in adolescents with ADHD provided the target duration of effect and exhibited an overall safety and tolerability profile that was similar to that seen in other studies of MAS. Although no clinical data were available on the use of SHP465 MAS in children aged 6&#x02013;12 years at the time the study was designed, it was speculated that the potential benefit&#x02013;risk ratio of SHP465 MAS in children was similar to that of adolescents. Given the tolerability and efficacy of 25&#x02009;mg SHP465 MAS in adolescents with ADHD and the relatively lower body weight of children compared with adolescents, 12.5&#x02009;mg SHP465 MAS was selected as an initial dose in this dose-optimization study.</p><p>During dose optimization, all participants randomized to SHP465 MAS initiated treatment at a dose of 12.5&#x02009;mg. Participants were titrated to 25&#x02009;mg SHP465 MAS by the investigator, based on symptom response and tolerability, at the week 1 visit. The investigator categorized participant response into one of three conditions (intolerable response, ineffective response, and acceptable response), with acceptable response defined as the participant having achieved &#x02265;30% ADHD-RS-IV total score reduction from baseline, having a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and the dose being well tolerated. A single dose reduction was permitted during the dose-optimization period, with the last dose change allowed at the week 2 visit; those unable to tolerate SHP465 MAS were discontinued. During dose maintenance, participants were maintained on the optimized dose of SHP465 MAS established during the dose-optimization period. Throughout the study, study medication was to be taken at 7 AM (&#x000b1;2 hours).</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>Participants</title><p>Males or nonpregnant nonlactating females (aged 6&#x02013;17 years at the time of consent) with a primary ADHD diagnosis based on <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)</italic> criteria and baseline ADHD-RS-IV total scores &#x02265;28 were eligible to participate. Participants were also required to have a satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant abnormalities and to be functioning at an age-appropriate intellectual level. Individuals were also required to be untreated or not to be completely satisfied with their current ADHD medication; those who were satisfied with their current treatment were not eligible for study participation.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria included having a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis with significant symptoms/symptomatic manifestations that could contraindicate treatment or confound efficacy or safety assessments or a concurrent condition that could confound safety assessments or increase participant risk; a history of a chronic tic disorder, a current tic disorder, a history of tics that were judged by the investigator to be exclusionary, or a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome; being considered a suicide risk, or having had a previous suicide attempt, or demonstrating active suicidal ideation; being underweight (body mass index [BMI] &#x0003c;3rd percentile) or overweight (BMI &#x0003e;97th percentile) at screening based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's age- and sex-specific values; having blood pressure exceeding the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height at screening and baseline; having hypertension; having symptomatic cardiovascular disease, cardiac issues, a clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG), or a family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia; having a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamine or excipients in SHP465 MAS; having failed to respond to a previous course of amphetamine therapy; having a history of suspected substance abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine) based on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria; or taking a prohibited medication that was excluded or had not been appropriately washed out.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p>Efficacy assessments were completed by clinicians experienced in the evaluation of ADHD in children and adolescents. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to week 4. The ADHD-RS-IV was developed to assess ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents based on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria (Dupaul et al. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). It consists of 18 items designed to reflect current ADHD symptoms, with items scored on 4-point scales (0 [no symptoms] to 3 [severe symptoms]). Total scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Subscale scores can also be calculated by summing responses to the even-numbered items (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale) or odd-numbered items (inattentiveness subscale). The ADHD-RS-IV was administered at baseline and all postbaseline visits through week 4/early termination (ET).</p><p>The key secondary endpoint was the score on the CGI-I scale at week 4. The CGI-I measures global functioning improvement on a 7-point scale (1 [very much improved] to 7 [very much worse]; 0 indicates not assessed) (Guy <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>), with improvement measured against baseline CGI-Severity (CGI-S) scores. Other secondary efficacy assessments included ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscale score changes from baseline to week 4 and global functioning improvement based on the dichotomized CGI-I.</p></sec><sec id="s006"><title>Safety and tolerability endpoints</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) were collected from the time of informed consent and at every study visit until the defined follow-up period. TEAEs were defined as AEs that started after the first study drug dose or that started before the first study drug dose, but increased in severity after the first study drug dose. TEAEs were categorized based on severity, relatedness to treatment, and seriousness.</p><p>Vital signs and weight were assessed at all visits. Vital signs were measured after &#x0223c;3 minutes of rest while the participant was seated and consisted of three assessments taken at &#x0223c;2-minute intervals. The 12-lead ECG was assessed at screening, baseline, week 2, and week 4/ET after 3 minutes of rest; the baseline assessment consisted of three recordings taken at 3-minute intervals.</p><p>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner et al. <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) was used at baseline and each study visit by an individual who was medically responsible for the participant. The C-SSRS is a semistructured interview designed to capture the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s007"><title>Data presentation and statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size was determined using nQuery Advisor 7.0 (Statistical Solutions, Ltd., Cork, Ireland). To detect an assumed treatment difference (SHP465 MAS&#x02013;placebo) of 6.0, with an assumed common standard deviation (SD) of 10.0 for ADHD-RS-IV total score change, 60 participants/group were required to provide 90% power for a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). Taking into account an expected 20% postrandomization dropout rate, at least 150 participants needed to be randomized. A blinded interim sample size reestimation was performed when &#x0223c;75% of randomized participants had either completed or discontinued from the study, among which 118 were in the full analysis set (FAS; randomized participants taking &#x02265;1 study drug dose and having &#x02265;1 postdose primary efficacy assessment) and 107 had completed the study. Based on the pooled SD of 13.66, the recalculated sample size was 110 participants/group (220 in total) without changing the original statistical assumptions (90% power; treatment difference of 6.0; two-sided significance level of 0.05). Taking into account an expected 20% postrandomization dropout rate for those not in the interim cohort, the overall randomization target was 264.</p><p>Efficacy analyses were performed in the FAS; all statistical tests were two-sided and performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The primary efficacy endpoint, change in ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to week 4, was analyzed using the linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, visit, age group (6&#x02013;12 years vs. 13&#x02013;17 years), and the interaction of treatment&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;visit as factors; baseline ADHD-RS-IV total score as a covariate; and the interaction of baseline ADHD-RS-IV total score&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;visit adjusted in the model. Treatment comparisons were based on least squares (LS) mean treatment differences (SHP465 MAS&#x02013;placebo), with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and <italic>p</italic>-value; effect size was also determined. Two sensitivity analyses (placebo multiple imputation and multiple imputations with penalties applied to dropouts) were used to examine the robustness of the primary MMRM analysis. Change from baseline at week 4 on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales was also analyzed using the MMRM model described for the primary efficacy endpoint.</p><p>Assessment of the key secondary efficacy endpoint, CGI-I score at week 4, was assessed using the MMRM method described for the primary efficacy analysis. The analysis accounted for baseline CGI-S as a covariate and adjusted for the interaction of baseline CGI-S&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;visit. A supportive analysis of the CGI-I was based on dichotomized improvement (improved vs. not improved) at the final on-treatment assessment. Participants were categorized as improved if the CGI-I score was 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) and as not improved if the CGI-I score was 3 (minimally improved) through 7 (very much worse). Statistical assessment of the dichotomized CGI-I consisted of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group and baseline CGI-S.</p><p>To preserve study-wide type I error (two-sided &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) across the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed-sequence test procedure was applied. For this procedure, hypotheses were tested in order (first the primary endpoint and then the secondary endpoint). The secondary endpoint could only attain significance if the primary endpoint was significant at the two-sided 0.05 significance level. For analyses not included in the fixed-sequence test procedure (dichotomized CGI-I and ADHD-RS-IV subscale score changes), reported <italic>p</italic>-values are nominal (unadjusted) and are reported for descriptive purposes only.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were analyzed in the safety analysis set (randomized participants taking &#x02265;1 study drug dose). All safety and tolerability data are presented using descriptive statistics. For each endpoint, baseline was assessed as the last value collected before the first dose of the double-blind study drug and the final on-treatment assessment was defined as the last valid assessment obtained after baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s008"><title>Results</title><sec id="s009"><title>Participant disposition and demographics</title><p>Participant disposition is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.

The superiority of SHP465 MAS was supported by sensitivity analyses for ADHD-RS-IV total score and CGI-I score and by improvement on other secondary efficacy endpoints (ADHD-RS-IV subscale score reductions and dichotomized improvement on the CGI-I). These findings suggest that SHP465 MAS, which contains three types of drug-releasing beads&#x02014;an immediate-release bead and two different types of DR beads, is an efficacious treatment option in children and adolescents with ADHD. The efficacy of SHP465 MAS in children and adolescents with ADHD that was observed in this study is consistent with findings in adults with ADHD (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and for other long-acting psychostimulants in children and adolescents with ADHD (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Maneeton et al. <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Storebo et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of treatment effect with SHP465 MAS observed in this study cannot be directly compared with psychostimulant effects reported in other studies due to differences in study design (including patient enrollment criteria, drug dose, and treatment length). However, the magnitude of ADHD-RS-IV total score reductions with SHP465 MAS in this study, which occurred after 2 weeks of dose maintenance, was within a range observed for other long-acting psychostimulants from individual studies (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Biederman et al. <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Newcorn et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Findling et al. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Stein et al. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Coghill et al. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and the treatment difference versus placebo was within ranges reported in systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (Maneeton et al. <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Storebo et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The overall safety and tolerability profile of SHP465 MAS in this study was consistent with that of SHP465 MAS in adults with ADHD (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and with that of other long-acting psychostimulants in children and adolescents (Biederman et al. <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Spencer et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Newcorn et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Findling et al. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Coghill et al. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

Rates of insomnia-related TEAEs have been reported to range from 9% to 24.7% with lisdexamfetamine (Biederman et al. <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Findling et al. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Coghill et al. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), from 13% to 14.4% with OROS methylphenidate (Newcorn et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Coghill et al. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and from 8.9% to 17.5% with extended-release MAS (Biederman et al. <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Spencer et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the overall frequency of insomnia as a TEAE was lower in this study (16.7% overall) than in the two SHP465 MAS studies on adults with ADHD (41.7% and 29.2% overall) (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), possibly because of the lower SHP465 MAS doses used in this study. Compared with placebo, SHP465 MAS was associated with increases in pulse and blood pressure and with decreases in body weight. A similar pattern of changes in vital signs and weight has been reported with SHP465 MAS in adults with ADHD (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Frick et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and with other long-acting psychostimulants in children and/or adolescents with ADHD (Spencer et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Newcorn et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Findling et al. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Coghill et al. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s015"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study population was primarily male and white. As such, it is unknown how these data would generalize to a more diverse treatment population. Although the study was not powered to compare subgroup differences, exploratory analyses suggested that the primary efficacy findings by race and gender were generally in agreement with the overall results. Findings for the secondary efficacy endpoints (dichotomized CGI-I and ADHD-RS-IV subscales) and from the exploratory analyses should be interpreted in light of the fact that they were not included in the testing hierarchy. Therefore, the reported <italic>p</italic>-values for these endpoints are nominal (unadjusted) and provided for descriptive purposes only. In addition, the long-term safety and tolerability of SHP465 MAS cannot be determined from these data given the short 4-week duration of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>SHP465 MAS demonstrated superiority over placebo in improving ADHD core symptoms and global functioning in children and adolescents with ADHD. The safety and tolerability profile of SHP465 MAS was similar to that observed in adults and of other long-acting psychostimulants. Based on this study, the SHP465 MAS starting dose in pediatric patients (aged 13&#x02013;17 years) is suggested to be 12.5&#x02009;mg once daily in the morning. The dosage may be adjusted in increments of 12.5&#x02009;mg no sooner than weekly up to the maximum dose of 25&#x02009;mg per day based on efficacy, tolerability, and safety. SHP465 MAS is not approved for use in children aged 12 years and younger.</p></sec><sec id="s017"><title>Clinical Significance</title><p>Some prescribers may supplement a long-acting psychostimulant with an immediate-release short-acting psychostimulant later in the day for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Therefore, there is a need for once-daily psychostimulant medications. SHP465 mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) is a long-acting psychostimulant for the treatment of ADHD. The findings of this study indicate that SHP465 MAS is superior over placebo in improving ADHD symptoms and global functioning in children and adolescents with ADHD, with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with that of other long-acting psychostimulants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1883" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1888" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s018" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Under the direction of the authors, writing assistance was provided by Madhura Mehta, PhD, and Craig Slawecki, PhD, employees of Complete Healthcare Communications, LLC (West Chester, PA).
