In the United States, the prevalence of renal colic has increased from 5.2% during 1994-1998 to 8.8% in 2007-2010 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). </p><p>One of the major duties of emergency department (ED) is reducing patients&#x02019; pain and suffering before taking any treatment or surgical measures. </p><p>Recently, using alpha blockers such as intravenous (IV) lidocaine, nifedipine and nerve blockers in the intercostal area has been deemed effective in reducing renal colic pain (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). </p><p>When narcotic drugs lack the required effectiveness and lead to undesirable side effects, lidocaine can be a good choice. IV lidocaine has been deemed effective in controlling neuropathic pains such as diabetic neuropathy, post-surgery pains, bone fracture pain, headache and nervous system malignancies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Continuous infusion of IV lidocaine during and after abdominal surgery has accelerated patient recovery and reduced length of hospital stay (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). </p><p>Using opioids has some dangers due to reasons such as inhibition of respiratory center in medulla region and activation of vomiting center (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These drugs are used as an appropriate analgesic in ED either alone or along with midazolam (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). </p><p>Finding an effective analgesic with minimal side effects has been continuously desired by the physicians involved with these patients. Therefore, the current study was designed with the aim of evaluating the efficiency of IV lidocaine in comparison to IV fentanyl in pain management of patients with renal colic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>
<bold><italic>Study design and setting</italic></bold>
</p><p>In this double blind clinical trial, the effectiveness of IV lidocaine and IV fentanyl was evaluated and compared in pain management of patients with renal colic admitted to ED of Golestan Hospital, Ahwaz, Iran, in 2015. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Ahwaz University of Medical Sciences under the number &#x0201c;ajums.REC.1392.324&#x0201d; and the researchers adhered to all the principles stated in the declaration of Helsinki regarding ethical practice and confidentiality of patient data. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants for taking part in the study. All the expenses of patients&#x02019; treatment were covered by the project executive and no additional fees were inflicted upon the patients. This study was registered on the Iranian registry of clinical trials under the number IRCT2017081415446N12.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Participants</italic></bold>
</p><p>Patients in the 18-65 years age range that had presented to the ED with colicky flank pain and lacked histories such as: cardiac dysrhythmia and ischemia, parenchymal tissue problems in liver and kidney, and history of using mono amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitor drugs in the last 2 weeks, were included in the study. In addition, patients with a history of allergy to morphine or other opiates, definite or possible pregnancy, lactating women, addiction to opiates, and receiving analgesics in the last 6 hours were excluded from the study. To confirm absence of dysrhythmia or underlying ischemic disease, electrocardiogram was used on admission. All the clinical examinations were done by 2 physicians, one senior resident of emergency medicine and one senior resident of urology.</p><p>Clinical diagnoses were confirmed by performing ultrasonography or spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, or presence of hematuria in urinalysis after management of the patient&#x02019;s pain and those who did not have definitive evidence of stone in evaluations were excluded from the study.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Intervention</italic></bold>
</p><p>Patients were allocated to a group receiving either lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) or fentanyl (1.5 &#x000b5;g/kg) via block randomization. Drug prescriptions were as IV infusion during 2 minutes while patients were under cardiac monitoring. For patients who still had moderate to severe pain 30 minutes after injection, morphine sulfate with the standard dose of 0.1 mg/kg was prescribed as additional analgesic. The physician prescribing the drug and the patient were blind to the prescribed drug. Drugs were prepared by a nurse in syringes with the same volume and color in the absence of the physician and were then given to the physician.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Outcome</italic></bold>
</p><p>The primary outcome of this study was evaluating the pain score of patients based on visual analog pain scale (VAS) 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after injection. 3 points pain reduction based on VAS was considered as clinically significant pain reduction. Therefore, lack of 3 points pain reduction 15 and 30 minutes after injection were considered as treatment failure.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Data gathering</italic></bold>
</p><p>Demographic data (age, sex, weight) and data regarding pain severity on admission to ED and 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after injection were gathered using a checklist. The senior emergency medicine resident was responsible for data gathering and was blind to the drug received by the patient.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Statistical analysis</italic></bold>
</p><p>Sample size was estimated to be 40 for each group considering 95% confidence interval and type 2 error of 0.2% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Data analysis was done using SPSS 21 software. Quantitative data were reported based on mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and qualitative ones based on frequency and percentage. Chi square test, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and t-test were used for comparisons. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>
