Also, therapeutic lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated in benign intracranial hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>LP is routinely carried out with the patient in the supine or lateral decubitus position using two techniques. Traditional technique uses Tuffier's line (an imaginary line connecting both iliac crests) to determine the level of the puncture site. This line crosses L4-L5 space. LP is usually performed in this space or 1 level over this, on the L3-L4 space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Although this technique has high success rate it depends on personal expertise to find interspinous space. Inability to find the proper space is associated with repetitive painful attempts and high possibility of traumatized tap.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>An alternate method to surface landmark guided LP is ultrasound (US) guidance. For many years, US has been used to facilitate this procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The use of US to find puncture site was first described 40 years ago in a medical journal in Russian language.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>In this technique vertebral column and surrounding structures can be shown. By placing US probe vertically and horizontally on spinous process of vertebras, subdural space would be seen as a dark space inside the spinal column. To find the most appropriate point for needle insertion, the examiner must be able to determine five structures by US: Spinous process, ligamentum flavum, dura, epidural, and subarachnoid spaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Ten years later some anesthesiologists used US for better visualization of epidural and subarachnoid spaces for instillation of anesthetic drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Also, in a series of studies, researchers showed that US could increase successful attempts and easiness of the procedure especially in obese patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Interestingly, primary training of US-guided LP could improve expertise of physicians to identify pertinent landmarks to facilitate the procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Although US-guided LP is not a new technique, the same studies in the field of emergency medicine are limited, especially in some residents with short training program of sonography.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and feasibility of US-guided LP with traditional method in patients admitted to ED. We also assessed the performance of US-guided LP regarding to body mass index (BMI) of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial that was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials by code number of IRCT201008172337N4.

In the US group, insertion point determined at the L3-L4 inter-vertebral space by use of a 7.5-10 MHz linear probe. For deeper penetration in used. Sonographic landmarks were spinous processes, dura mater, ligamentum flavum, and epidural space [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ultrasound image of lumbar vertebra</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-18-303-g002"/></fig><p>In the control group, puncture level was determined by palpation of external landmarks, anterior superior iliac spines, and the spinous process of lumbar vertebrae L3, L4, and L5 which was performed by the study physicians. LPs were performed in a sterile manner with the patient in lateral decubitus fetal position.</p><p>Three PG-3 (post-graduate year) emergency medicine residents who underwent 2 h training on US to learn relevant spinal landmarks performed the procedures by supervision of a board-certified emergency medicine attending physician.</p><p>Before starting the study, all three residents performed some practice scans in healthy volunteers to ensure that they could capture the best possible image.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Measurements</title><p>Demographic characteristics, pain score using numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, number of attempts (needle insertion), procedure time (time to obtain the best scan possible until emersion of cerebrospinal fluid), and number of traumatic LP (needle-induced blood in the cerebrospinal fluid) were recorded by another observing emergency medicine resident. BMI was defined as the individual's body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of his or her height (in meters). According to BMI, patients were categorized into three groups: Normal, less than 25; overweight, 25-29; obese, more than 29.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Sample size and statistic analysis</title><p>Sample size was estimated in 80 cases (40 cases in each group) by applying Altman's Nomogram.

The two different methods to find the insertion site are blind surface landmark guidance and US-guided techniques. Surface landmark guided LP has been shown to have high success rate in determining puncture site, but it may be difficult in some patients such as those with high BMI. Recently, US imaging of the spinal column has been proposed to facilitate identification of the pertinent landmarks for appropriate intervertebral space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Anesthesiologists have affirmed the use of US to find appropriate point of insertion for anesthetic catheters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Coley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] showed that US can diagnose the cause of unsuccessful LP. Moreover, they concluded that US can help determine whether or not to try further. In this study all of the procedures in both groups were successfully carried out (zero failure rates). Indeed, there is no relation between selections of each method. But we found a marked reduction in time need for performing procedure in US group. Besides, number of attempts and pain score in US group was significantly lower than control group especially, in patients with BMI more than 29.</p><p>On 2004, Peterson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] concluded that use of US to guide LP had great benefit as a time-saving tool in ED. He showed that attending emergency physicians could easily perform US-guided LP when blind technique of needle insertion using surface landmark guidance was difficult or unsuccessful.</p><p>In the present study the number of traumatic LP in US group was significantly lower than control group (5 vs. 18). On 2007, a team of emergency physicians designed a study to compare the success rate and ease of performing LP in obese patients, with US-guided assistance or palpation of surface landmarks. They reported that using US could facilitate the procedure but there were no statistical differences in the number of attempts, patient comfort, traumatic LPs, or procedure time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Because that was the only study that compared the rate of traumatic taps between two techniques, it seemed that further prospective randomized controlled studies should be planned to determine this probable benefit of US-guided LP.</p><p>In the current study, we found that patients with BMI more than 29 had significantly better outcome in terms of pain score, procedure time, number of attempts, and traumatic taps. Stiffler[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] compared the pain scores in patients with different BMI who underwent LP. He concluded that US-guided LP may be helpful in identifying pertinent landmarks in obese patients with BMI more than 30. These results have been reaffirmed in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The current study evaluated the outcome of performing LP by PG-3 emergency medicine residents with two different methods. We recommend that future studies compare these methods in residents of other specialties such as neurology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and anesthesiology.</p><p>Notwithstanding the obvious benefits of US in determining proper insertion site in anesthetic blocks, there are few studies about the same profits for LP in EDs, so further studies in this area are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The current study showed that US-guided LP has better results in comparison with surface landmark guided method. These benefits are more apparent in patients who had BMI more than 29.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
