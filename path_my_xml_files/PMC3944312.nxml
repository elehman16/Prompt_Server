and balance ability in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke patients
were randomly divided into a hippotherapy group and a treadmill group and they conducted
exercise for eight weeks. [Results] Berg Balance Scale score, gait velocity, and step
length asymmetry ratio were significantly improved in the group receiving hippotherapy
training. However, in the group receiving treadmill training, only step length asymmetry
ratio was significantly improved. In the comparison between the hippotherapy group and
treadmill group, there was no significant difference in Berg Balance Scale score, but a
significant difference was found in gait velocity and step length asymmetry ratio.
[Conclusion] The results of this study indicated that hippotherapy is a helpful treatment
for stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Hippotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, one of the leading causes of death, results in neurological deficits such as
hemiparesis. Hemiparetic patients generally show balance impairments, and the impairments
lead to other problems: increased risk of fall, decreased activities of daily living (ADL),
and limited mobility<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with stroke are
also characterized by a disability with respect to independent walking, and all of these
problems limit patients&#x02019; quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical therapy can be an effective method for solving these problems<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hippotherapy, also known as horseback riding therapy, is a
form of physical therapy strategy that uses equine movement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The concept of
hippotherapy is to use a horse as a therapeutic tool, and it is based on similarities in
gait between the human and horse<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
horse&#x02019;s gait provides patients having motor disabilities with rhythmic and repetitive
movements similar to human walking, thereby giving them training opportunities to improve
posture, balance, and strength.</p><p>Most research concerning hippotherapy has been confined to children with cerebral palsy up
to now<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it has been suggested
that more studies related to hippotherapy on adult patients with other disorders such as
brain injury need to be carried out. Because hippotherapy is able to have positive
influences on balance or gait ability, it may be helpful in improving the motor abilities of
stroke patients. For these reasons, the present study investigated about effects of
hippotherapy on gait and balance ability in patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 30 stroke patients receiving exercise therapy at H

to walk independently or more than 10 meters with walking aid, cognitive impairment defined
as a Korean mini-mental state examination (MMSE-K) score of more than 24, spasticity in a
paretic lower extremity defined as a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) grade of less than 2, no
orthopedic problem able to obstruct performance of training programs, and ability to perform
training for more than 30 minutes. All included participants provide written informed
consent in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All subjects were divided into 2 groups: a hippotherapy group (n=15) and a treadmill group
(n=15). Each training intervention was conducted in 30-minutes sessions administered 3 days
per week for 8 weeks. During each hippotherapy session, the horse walked around a circle
with a diameter of 30 meters 30 times clockwise and 30 times counterclockwise over the
course of 30 minutes. Treadmill training began with the minimum speed 0.1&#x02005;km/hour, and then
subjects maintained their individual maximum speed for 30 minutes.</p><p>In the present study, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was measured for an assessment of
balance ability, and gait velocity and step length asymmetry ratio (%) were also measured by
AP1105 to assess gait ability. All measured values were reported as the mean&#x000b1;standard
deviation. SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was used to analyze the data of the present
study. The paired t-test was used to examine differences between before and after
intervention, and the independent t-test was used to examine differences between the groups.

is growing longer. Among various stroke sequelae, the high risk of falling is considered as
a remarkable concern for the health of hemiparetic patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients with balance impairments have limitations in their
gait ability, and the limited gait performance might lead to an increase in fall risk<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The problems with respect to gait ability
result in reduced gait speed, which is related to step length asymmetry<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Step length asymmetry, a phenomenon resulting from
hemiparesis, which is defined as a difference in step length between the paretic and
non-paretic lower extremity<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The changes in gait speed and step length might provide
stroke patients with stability, but they are compensatory movements resulting from increased
fall risk<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to return a
compensatory gait to a normal gait, studies with regard to treatment methods able to improve
gait and balance ability of stroke patients should be conducted.</p><p>In the present study, the step length asymmetry ratio was significantly decreased in both
the treadmill group and the hippotherapy group after each training intervention. In
addition, the hippotherapy training group showed a significant increase in gait speed as
well as BBS score. These results demonstrated that hippotherapy not only increases gait
velocity and step length, but also improves balance ability. Espy et al. suggested that
there is a direct relationship between decreased gait velocity and increased risk of
falling<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Judging from this statement,
hippotherapy might have positive influences on the reduction of fall risk through increasing
gait velocity and step length. Furthermore, Hsiao-Wecksler and Robinovitch reported that
balance recovery is much more difficult to achieve in elderly people compared with young
people because gait velocity and step length are reduced in elderly people<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the results of the present study, it
is suggested that hippotherapy might improve balance ability of stroke patients through
enhancement of both gait velocity and step length.</p><p>Although the step length asymmetry ratio was significantly decreased in the treadmill group
after training, the result value attained by applying treadmill training was higher than
that attained by hippotherapy training. The present study showed that both balance ability
and gait velocity increased in the treadmill group, but the differences were not
significant. In the comparison of the treadmill group and the hippotherapy group, there was
no significant difference in BBS score. A significant difference between the two
experimental groups was found in gait velocity as well as step length asymmetry ratio. From
all results, it is suggested that hippotherapy training might have more powerful effects on
improvements of balance ability, gait velocity, and step length asymmetry ratio than
treadmill training. Hippotherapy provides patients with thousands of repetitive stimulations
for postural challenge. The movements of the horse make patients experience new information
from the vestibular and proprioceptive senses, and patients might achieve recovery of
postural balance through adaptation to this information<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of all of these
advantages and the similarity to human gait, the present study suggests that hippotherapy
might have more considerable effects on gait and balance performance than treadmill
training.</p><p>In conclusion, hippotherapy is a helpful treatment method for stroke patients. There are
several limitations in the present study. Both the treadmill training and hippotherapy
training were conducted for only 8 weeks, so further study is necessary to examine how long
effects of hippotherapy can last. Also, additional assessment tools for gait or balance
should be included to demonstrate obvious results. In terms of these limitations, the
present study suggests that further study should be carried out to provide stroke patients
with efficient hippotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ivey</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hafer-Macko</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Macko</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Task-oriented treadmill exercise training in chronic
