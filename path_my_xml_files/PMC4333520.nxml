Current treatment of a migraine headache consists of multiple medications for control and prevention of recurrent attacks. Global emergence of alternative medicine led us to examine the efficacy of cupping therapy plus serkangabin syrup in the treatment of migraine headaches.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled, open-label, comparative efficacy trial. We randomly assigned patients with migraine into cupping therapy plus serkangabin group (30 patients) and conventional treatment group (30 patients). An investigator assessed the severity of headache, frequency of attacks in a week and duration of attacks per hour in 5 visits (at the end of 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months). Generalized estimating equations approach was used to analyze repeated measures data to compare outcomes in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Average age for cupping therapy group and conventional treatment group were 31.7 (&#x000b1;7.6) and 32.6 (&#x000b1;12.7) years, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.45).

Migraine is one of the top 20 causes of disability in the world.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Migraine causes morbidity and bed rest in more than half of affected people. It causes a decrease in the quality of life, increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work. It also increases healthcare costs.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Migraine attack is usually managed by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, 5HT<sub>1</sub> agonists including ergots and triptans, dopamine antagonists and sometimes opioid analgesics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Different medications such as &#x003b2;-blockers, flunarizine, valproic acid, topiramate, amitriptyline, venlafaxine, gabapentin, naproxen, butterbur root, Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and magnesium are recommended for migraine prophylaxis; however, efficacy and adverse effects are still controversial.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Many diseases especially chronic ones are neither curable nor well palliated. Existing treatments can impose serious adverse reactions and provision of care is fragmented and impersonal.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) approach is frequently used today. More than 30% of Americans use CAM.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Over the past few decades, thousands of studies have been performed via various CAM approaches. Migraine patients seek and explore both conventional and CAM approaches.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Wet cupping is an ancient medical technique used in several contemporary societies in East Asia and the Middle East[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and it is frequently used for controlling pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Types of cupping include retained cupping, flash cupping, moving cupping, wet cupping, medicinal cupping, and needling cupping.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Wet cupping is a common method. In order to perform this procedure, a glass cup is placed on the skin and a vacuum is created inside it. After a few minutes, a superficial incision is placed in the area to suck the blood into the cup. This is repeated several times.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>It is being used in the management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, headaches, renal, and biliary stones and for maintaining health. Little experimental studies have been devoted to test its efficacy to treat migraine headache. Some studies stated that wet cupping have clinical benefits on pain conditions.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Some studies have assessed the pain killing effect of wet cup and have found some advantages;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] nevertheless, there are few studies about the effects of cupping on migraine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Serkangabin is a traditional drink which is frequently used for headache in Iran. In traditional Iranian medicine (TIM) it is believed that serkangabin has therapeutic effects in many diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, migraine and cerebrovascular diseases. According to the Iranian traditional literature, serkangabin can cause blood dilution and is easier to make compared with cupping procedure.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Serkangabin from the words (serke, &#x0201c;vinegar&#x0201d;) and (angobin, &#x0201c;honey&#x0201d;) is a drink which is traditionally produced in Iran. We did not find any studies on the effect of serkangabin in the literature. The mixture of these two methods (wet cupping plus serkangabin) may lead to therapeutic synergy. Therefore, this study evaluated therapeutic and prophylactic effects of cupping and serkangabin and compares it with conventional migraine therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Researchers of the CAM Research Center of Birjand University of Medical Sciences (BUMS) designed and conducted this randomized, controlled, open-label, comparative efficacy trial of cupping therapy and serkangabin versus conventional therapy in 2012.

Sample size was calculated 29 patients in each groups according these assumptions: Alpha error of 5%, power of 85%, mean of headache severity after 2 weeks treatment in the conventional methods equal to 5.1 (&#x000b1;1.1) and in the serkangabin group 4.2 (&#x000b1;1.4). Then 391 headache patients were examined, and 76 confirmed migraine cases were divided into two study groups by simple randomization using random number table. Totally, 16 cases were excluded, and finally 60 cases were included in the study (41 were women and 19 men).</p><p>Then the study group completed a 6 months study program. 30 patients were treated with cupping and serkangabin and 30 patients with conventional migraine treatment protocols.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Instruments and drugs</title><p>All patients examined by a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis of a migraine headache. The study involved 5 visits (at the end of 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment). The patients provided either conventional medical treatment or cupping therapy plus serkangabin. History and physical examination were done by one physician. A researcher assessed severity of headache by visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 10 = very severe pain) and frequency of attacks in a weak and duration of attacks per hour. The history was taken from patients by one medical doctor investigator. In conventional treatment group, standard treatment conducted by a neurologist that lasted for 6 months including migraine attack control and prophylactic medications. Medications used for a migraine attack were as follows:</p><p>

The prophylactic treatments were nortriptyline or propranolol.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We tried to maximize the efficacy and tolerability of &#x003b2;-blocker and tricyclic antidepressant treatment by using a flexible target dose. Treatment was started with one 10 mg tablet of propranolol hydrochloride USP (Tolidarou Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran) 3 times daily which increased as tolerated to 40 mg 3 times daily at week 4. Participants, who did not tolerate 3 times daily dose of 20 mg and were unimproved according to the neurologist view, were switched to nortriptyline hydrochloride USP (Loghman Pharmaceutical and Hygienic Co.) 25 mg nightly, which increased to 50 mg nightly at week 2.

In this trial, treatment of migraine with either cupping plus serkangabin or conventional treatment resulted in similar outcomes. Severity of headaches, duration and frequency of attacks were similar in two treatment groups during 6 months of study. The results of our study showed that an alternative therapy by cupping plus serkangabin was an effective approach to headache treatment and prophylaxis in patients with migraine.</p><p>The findings of our study is congruent with those of other studies and indicate that cupping therapy is a promising CAM treatment method for migraine headache and other painful conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), low back pain, and fibromyalgia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Ahmadi, <italic>et al</italic>. in their study on cupping therapy in chronic headaches compared headache severity, frequency of headache days in month and medication consumption before and 3 months after cupping.

In 93% of patients, it had positive therapeutic effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Lauche <italic>et al</italic>. in their study of cupping in neck pain concluded that cupping appeared to be effective in relieving chronic nonspecific pain which had an influence on pain processing.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Cao, <italic>et al</italic>. showed reduction in fibromyalgia pain and number of tender points in their study of cupping therapy.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Lee, <italic>et al</italic>. in their assessment of systematic reviews of cupping effectiveness, stated that it was effective in reducing pain.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Cao, <italic>et al</italic>. in their systematic review stated that the majority of studies on cupping show potential benefit on pain conditions.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Michalsen, <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized clinical trial on effects of cupping in CTS concluded that it may be effective in relieving pain and other symptoms related to CTS.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Farhadi <italic>et al</italic>. in their randomized controlled study on wet cupping for nonspecific low back pain concluded that it was safe and acceptable to patients and more effective than usual care.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>There are very few studies in the literature that might provide clues about mechanism of wet-cupping.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] It has been suggested that wet-cupping analgesia is similar to the effect of acupuncture and occurs via segmental, extra-segmental and central regulatory action.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Cupping and serkangabin can adjust some neurotransmitter like serotonin, dopamine, endorphin, calcitonin-gene related peptide and acetylcholine which are connected to headaches. In addition, they can adjust hematocrit and immune system through bleeding and local inflammation. Local inflammation activates complementary immune system and increases the level of immune products.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, the mechanism is still unknown[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and needs further studies.</p><p>Serkangabin is made from honey, peppermint water, and vinegar. Therefore, some pain relief effects of this drink may be originated from the therapeutic effects of these herbal drugs.</p><p>Limitations in our study include: For the reason that it was a new treatment protocol, there were no similar studies to assist us with the study sample size. The study had longer follow-ups and includes other factors like cost, side effects, patient's preference and compliance. However, relapse after treatment may suggest revised approaches. Moreover, in our study the advantages are due to both wet cupping plus serkangabin and further studies are required to distinguish the effects. The other limitation was the open-labeled design of our study. There might be a supposed psychological effects related to cupping that is effective in reducing pain by itself. This effect, in case of being accurate, could be considered as an advantage of cupping procedure. Consequently, authors recommend re-evaluation of periodic wet cupping biannually in prevention of migraine relapse after prophylactic treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study suggests that cupping plus serkangabin therapy is effective parallel to that of conventional therapy in management and prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
