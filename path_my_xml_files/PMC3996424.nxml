affected by doing different types of warm up exercises. In particular, the research is
focused on the difference in the effect on dynamic Balance of warming up in water versus
on the ground. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty healthy adults were the subjects of this
study, with 10 people assigned each to two groups, one warming up in water and another
warming up on the ground. The dynamic balance was measured for all subjects before the
warming up. The group warming up on the ground conducted active stretching on the ground,
and the group warming up in water conducted stretching in water by using water as
resistance. [Results] The results indicate that warming up in water has a more powerful
effect on a subject&#x02019;s dynamic balance than warming up on the ground. [Conclusion] The
group warming up in water, who made use of the viscosity and flow of the water, showed
better balance than the group warming up on the ground. Warming up in water, which entails
an element of resistance, should be implemented in warm-up routines in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>In water</kwd><kwd>Warming up</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Warming up is a necessary element that should be performed not only to minimize
sports-related injuries but also to promote an appropriate response to physical activity,
for training, and for competition<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stretching is well known as a part of these warming up processes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching is conducted traditionally by athletes for its
three benefits such as reduction of injury risk, reduction of muscle pain after exercise,
and enhancement of athletic performance ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, active stretching is suggested enhance exercise conducted
after it through temperature-related benefits that help optimize the physical body for
participation in exercise tasks. It is well known that there are many benefits of the
&#x0201c;active&#x0201d; elements of stretching, which are designed to prepare the physical body for the
increase in body core temperature and blood flow and for the exercise<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As examples of these proposed benefits, there are not only
the psychological effects but also the increase in neurological conductivity rate, the
decrease in resistance of joints and muscles, the reaction speed of metabolism, the increase
in blood flow in muscle, and the post-activation potentiation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stretching is closely related to balance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and balance is a necessary ability to maintain the physical body in
equilibrium in every movement of daily life. Maintenance of balance refers to the ability to
maintain the center of gravity (COG) on the base of support (BOS) during static and dynamic
movements, and the ability to adjust to the change in center of gravity in any movement is
needed to control continuous postures. Maintenance of balance refers to the ability to
respond to any small change by correcting the tension of the whole body. Furthermore,
balance is a complex exercise control task that includes the integration of sensory
information, the response of the nervous system. Postural reaction is the process that work
cooperatively by synergism of muscles between legs and body. In controlling balance, a
sensory process is progressed through interaction between inputs that enter from the
somatosensory system, visual system, and vestibular system including the proprioceptive
senses<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When exercise is done in water, it can be done safely due to buoyancy, as there exists a
reduction in joint impact and weight burden. When the center of buoyancy does not coincide
with the center of gravity, the body is inclined, and by using this inclination, the balance
training can be performed through movements to maintain an upright posture. Resistance, such
as viscosity and flow, which are water characteristics, can be used for all directions of
the body as it moves in water, and this resistance can be adjusted to an individual&#x02019;s
physical strength. The resistance in water has an effect that improves the sense of
balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, there is a lack of research concerning the effect on the balance of warming up in
water and the difference compared with warming up on the ground. Therefore, the present
research was conducted to find out how warming up in water versus on the ground may affect
the change in dynamic balance ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This research was conducted by randomly assigning 10 people each to two groups, a group
warming up on the ground and a group warming up in water; in total, 20 healthy adults who
were attending K University in Korea volunteered as subjects after receiving an explanation
of the experiment.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they were taking medications had any neurological damage, had
skin sensory problems, or had abnormal conditions in the joints or musculoskeletal system.
For precise measurement, all personal possessions such as jewelry and accessories were
removed, as they might affect the experiments.</p><p>This research was conducted after receiving the approval of all matters related to the
reaearch procedures, safety, and ethics from the Research Ethics Committee at Kyungbuk
College. After giving an explanation to all participating subjects about the research and
receiving written agreement from those who agreed to participate, the experiment was
conducted with these subjects from September 10, 2012, to September 11, 2012.</p><p>The experiment was performed by measuring on the dynamic balance of the recruited subjects
with a Good-Balance system (Metitur, Finland) before the experiment. For warming up, the
group warming up on the ground conducted stretching on the ground, and the group warming up
in water conducted stretching in the water. The water reached as high as a point between the
navel and xiphoid process of the subjects. The stretching motion was conducted for 15
minutes within the range that people felt no pain but felt extension.</p><p>After warming up, the time required to balance and the body posture lengths of the
left/right (X axis) and front/back (Y axis) were measured to determine dynamic balance. SPSS
for Windows 12.0 was used for data analysis in this research, and to determine differences
by group, the independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test were used to compare before
and after warming up. The level of significance was set as p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the participating subjects were as follows: the subjects in

dynamic balance resulting from warming up in water versus on the ground. Warming up was
conducted before the subjects performed their main exercise for the purposes of injury
prevention and enhancement of athletic performance during the main exercise. Warming up
before performing your main exercise increases the blood flow in the heart and skeletal
muscles and raises the body temperature to reduce stress on joints and muscles, and help to
reduce the burden on the heart.</p><p>In general, it is well known that the warming up is effective for reducing the risk of
injuries that may occur during intense physical activity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic balance ability consists of the interaction of automatic
posture reaction and voluntary movement. On an unstable surface, since the central nervous
system restricts the proactive posture control, voluntary changes in the posture of the body
and movement of all four limbs (arms and legs) play a more important role<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to enhance this kind of balance ability, in water exercise that makes use of the
viscosity, buoyancy, and resistance of water is frequently used. The flow and buoyancy of
water in the underwater environment were shown to enhance balance function by stimulation of
muscle proprioception, which prevented injury in individuals due to falls resulting from
loss of balance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the
results of in water resistance training in menopausal women reported by Sattar et al. (2013)
and others, psychosocial state and physical function were enhanced compared with a
comparison group not subjected to the intervention<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Behm et al. reported that a significant difference was found in
balance ability after stretching in 16 normal adult subjects<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The group warming up in water in this research also showed
enhancement in dynamic balance ability. These subjects, it showed a significant difference
in front/back body posture length, which decreased from 1103.0&#x000b1;365.7 to 812.4&#x000b1;217.0 mm, and
left/right body posture length which decreased from 475.9&#x000b1;126.6 to 374.2&#x000b1;73.7&#x02005;mm. However,
in the group warming up on the ground, the front/back body posture length showed no
significant difference, increasing from 1337.5&#x000b1;440.1 to 1667.2&#x000b1;666.7 mm, and the left/right
body posture length also showed no a significant difference, decreasing from 499.1&#x000b1;103.9 to
566.8&#x000b1;120.7&#x02005;mm.</p><p>In this research, it is believed that the reason why balance ability was enhanced by more
after warming up in water than after warming up on the ground was that the stimulation by
proprioceptive organs was more vigorous in water than that caused by the gravity on the
ground, because more of a strategy of biomechanical movement was used to maintain the
postural balance during stretching, which is affected by the flow and buoyancy of water and
because of the greater need for rotational movement of the head and body to recover a normal
posture when in an unstable posture. In addition, we believe better mechanical skills for
balancing are obtained through functional improvement of muscles and joints in such areas as
the quadriceps, hamstring, tibialis anterior, and calf.</p><p>In comparison of the group warming up in water and the group warming up on the ground, the
front/back body posture length showed significant differences of &#x02212;101.6&#x000b1;126.7 and 67.6&#x000b1;153.4
mm, respectively, and the left/right body posture length showed significant differences of
&#x02212;290.5&#x000b1;394.4 and 329.7&#x000b1;475.1 mm, respectively. Movement of an object through liquid with
viscosity like water can produce more somatosensory input than the movement through air,
which has relatively low viscosity, and the resistance against the movement causes expansion
or extension of skin to induce stimulation, which helps mechanoreceptors adapt quickly, and
to contribute to proprioception; also, the effects of the buoyancy and resistance of water
can enhance the function of the proprioceptors of whole body parts. In addition, open
kinetic chain exercise and closed kinetic chain exercise can be applied more easily in water
than on the ground, which can maintain various postures through the rotational control of
head<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. If this kind of body posture is
induced by the interaction of buoyancy and gravity resulting from the movement in water, the
proprioceptive mechanoreceptor is stimulated actively in order to recover the body posture.
Considering the previous research stating that the water pressure acting on the body during
exercise in water can help maintain balance by inducing stimulation of proprioceptors<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
it can be interpreted as a result that the characteristics of water and movement in water
more actively stimulated proprioceptors than in the case of warming up on the ground.</p><p>Therefore, it is believed that the use of water as resistance for warming up before a
person performs their main exercise is effective for enhancement of dynamic balance ability
in the main exercise. In the future, research to compare the effects of warming up using
other forms of resistance should continue.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yaicharoen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallman</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Morton</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of warm-up on intermittent sprint performance
