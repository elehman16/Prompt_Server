This study evaluated the safety of CA4P when combined with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with advanced nonsquamous, non-small-cell lung cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Adult subjects with confirmed American Joint Committee on Cancer six stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1 were randomized to receive six cycles (treatment phase) of paclitaxel (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), carboplatin (area under the concentration versus time curve 6), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1 and repeated every 21 days, or this regimen plus CA4P (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on days 7, 14, and 21 of each cycle. Subjects could then receive additional maintenance treatment (excluding carboplatin and paclitaxel) for up to 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-three subjects were randomized, 31 to control and 32 to CA4P, and 19 (61.3%) and 17 (53.1%), respectively, completed the treatment phase. Exposure to study treatment and dose modifications were comparable between the randomized groups. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between groups, with increased neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypertension in the CA4P group. Deaths, serious adverse events, and early discontinuations from treatment were comparable between the randomized treatment groups. The overall tumor response rate with CA4P was 50% versus 32% in controls. Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CA4P plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab appears to be a tolerable regimen with an acceptable toxicity profile in subjects with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CA4P</kwd><kwd>bevacizumab</kwd><kwd>paclitaxel</kwd><kwd>carboplatin</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer was responsible for more than a quarter (~160,000) of all cancer-related deaths in 2015, and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US.<xref rid="b1-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 1% in those with metastatic disease, accounted for ~85% of the total.<xref rid="b2-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While there have recently been important therapeutic advances in the field for patients with relapsed nonsquamous NSCLC &#x02013; including recent approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors<xref rid="b3-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> in previously treated patients &#x02013; and patients with abnormalities in epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase receive frontline targeted therapy,<xref rid="b5-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> first-line treatment for metastatic disease in the great majority of patients has remained unchanged for years, and new therapies are needed.</p><p>Bevacizumab, an antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibits new tumor vasculature formation by binding VEGF.<xref rid="b7-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the E4599 trial, adding bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel-carboplatin alone significantly improved the response rate (RR; 35% vs 15%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); progression-free survival (PFS; 6.2 vs 4.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); and overall survival (OS; 12.3 vs 10.3 months; HR, 0.79; <italic>P</italic>=0.003).<xref rid="b8-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> More recently, subjects with stage IV NSCLC who experienced progression on a platinum-based doublet and received second-line treatment with the VEGF receptor 2-directed antibody, ramucirumab, plus docetaxel had significantly improved RR (23% vs 14%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), PFS (4.5 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.76; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and OS (10.5 vs 9.1 months; HR, 0.86; <italic>P</italic>=0.023),<xref rid="b9-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> leading to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the ramucirumab&#x02013;docetaxel combination for treatment of patients with previously treated NSCLC.<xref rid="b10-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Because tumors ultimately overcome the inhibition of angiogenesis produced by anti-VEGF antibodies, clinical trials have studied the simultaneous targeting of the VEGF pathway, looking to achieve additive or synergistic outcomes with the combination of bevacizumab with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of CA4P when combined with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab compared with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab alone. Additional objectives were to assess RR, PFS, and OS in both arms. The study was designed to assess the potential treatment effect size and was not powered to be a superiority study. The sample size was planned using a confidence interval (CI) approach, based on the assumption that the 6-month PFS rate would be ~50% for the control group and for the CA4P arm would be within the 95% CIs of 50%&#x000b1;17.9%. All subjects randomized constituted the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.</p><p>The safety population included all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. The assessment of safety was based on AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examination findings, ECG results, and vital signs. AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 10.1, and were summarized by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group.</p><p>Efficacy endpoints were assessed for the ITT population, and analyzed to determine if further study of this quadruplet combination was warranted. Tumor response and PFS were evaluated using RECIST 1.0 criteria. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates were used to analyze PFS and OS.

Hypertension was reported in 17/31 (54.8%) subjects in the CA4P arm compared with 13/29 (44.8%) subjects in the control arm. Among subjects who experienced hypertension on CA4P, increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were seen from 30 minutes post-dose through 2 hours post-dose and returned to baseline by 4 hours post-dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival and response</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the randomized treatment groups in RR, PFS, or OS. The overall best confirmed objective RR was 50% in the CA4P group compared with 32% in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ott-9-7275">Table 4</xref>). Median PFS in the CA4P group was 8.6 months versus 9.3 months for the control group (HR 1.04; 95% CI, 0.56&#x02013;1.91) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-9-7275">Figure 2A</xref>), and median OS in the CA4P group was 13.6 months versus 16.2 months in the control group (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.55&#x02013;2.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-9-7275">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Multiple post hoc analyses were performed. Trends were seen toward longer survival in subjects treated with CA4P when the baseline tumors measured more than 10 cm (14.2 vs 11.0 months, HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.26, 1.70) and when subjects were anemic at baseline (12.0 vs 6.3 months, HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.18, 1.65).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a VDA in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in adult subjects with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC. Based on evidence that CA4P is well tolerated in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, and that CA4P and bevacizumab may have synergistic effects on tumor vasculature, this randomized, multicenter, controlled, open-label, Phase II clinical trial explored the safety and potential benefit of adding CA4P to triple-combination therapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC.</p><p>Dose reductions and/or delays were infrequent in the CA4P and control groups. Dose adjustments of bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin due to neutropenia or leukopenia occurred more frequently in the control group compared with the CA4P group. CA4P dose modifications due to neutropenia or leukopenia were reported in approximately one-third of subjects.</p><p>The most common TEAEs were neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypertension, all of which had an increased incidence with CA4P versus controls. CA4P postinfusion blood pressure increase has been shown to be controllable in animal models with nitrates or calcium channel blockers.<xref rid="b32-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> One study in a hypertensive rat model examined the potential for cardiotoxicity with CA4P using serum troponin I levels 24 hours postadministration. Pretreatment with an antihypertensive effectively blocked both the CA4P-induced blood pressure increase and cardiac damage.</p><p>Both subjects who experienced the three episodes of myocardial ischemia, events that were not associated with any evidence of infarction, had a history of hypertension. Of interest, one occurrence coincided with an episode of CA4P postinfusion blood pressure increase, which was not pretreated with an antihypertensive agent, while another occurred during the bevacizumab infusion, 24 hours post-CA4P infusion. The incidence of treatment-related serious AEs was similar between the treatment groups.</p><p>The numerical difference between the treatment groups in overall tumor response should be interpreted cautiously because of a relatively small sample size. Interpretation of PFS data is further confounded by the high number of subjects who discontinued prior to disease progression. This study was not adequately powered to assess efficacy, and the 95% CI for the HR for the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS includes the possibility that either arm is nearly twice as effective as its comparator. Larger studies are necessary to provide enough power to analyze this regimen for efficacy. It should also be noted that, as testing for many of the currently known markers were not standard at the time the study was conducted, there was no attempt to correlate clinical outcome with tumor tissue; as a result, these outcomes should be considered in light of the absence of correlative data. In light of recent advances in the management of advanced NSCLC, development of chemotherapy plus an antiangio-genic agent and a VDA should be considered in other settings in which antiangiogenic therapy is currently indicated and initial evidence of efficacy of the combination has been seen, such as recurrent ovarian cancer,<xref rid="b22-ott-9-7275" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> prior to further evaluation in advanced NSCLC.</p><p>In conclusion, data from the current study showed that CA4P combined with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab had an acceptable toxicity profile in subjects with NSCLC. The difference in RR also suggested evidence of activity in NSCLC. It is hoped that these results might serve as a guide for the development of protocols for future studies in other cancer types where combination vascular targeted therapy with an antiangiogenic and VDA might enhance patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the participating patients and their families; James A.
