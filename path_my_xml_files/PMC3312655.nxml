Many modalities of treatments have been used but none of them proved to be uniformly effective. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is a well-known keratolytic agent with many dermatological uses.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective:</title><p>To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topical KOH solution in the treatment of plane warts.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 250 patients with plane warts, consulting the department of Dermatology and Venereology of Basra Teaching Hospital between March 2008 and October 2009, were enrolled in this opened therapeutic trial study. Patients were divided into two age and sex cross-matched equal groups; patients in group (A) were treated with topical 5% KOH solution once at night, while patients in group (B) were treated with topical 10% KOH solution once nightly. Only 107 patients from group (A) and 95 patients from group (B) completed the study, while the remainders were defaulted for unknown reasons.

There are many modalities of therapy, reflecting that none is uniformly effective or directly antiviral.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Whatever method is used in the treatment of warts, there will be failures and recurrences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The present study aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of topical KOH solution for treatment of plane warts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the world that has dealt with such therapy for plane warts. The study showed that topical KOH solution in 5% and 10% concentrations is an effective treatment of plane warts as it induced cure rate of 80.3% and 82.1% respectively. The mechanism by which KOH solution is supposed to act is mostly related to its keratolytic effect that leads to destruction of virus-infected cells and also probably attributed to its irritating effect that induce inflammatory response and inflammatory reactions, so causing resolution of warts. In this study, it has been also shown that topical 5% KOH solution showed a slower action in comparison with 10% KOH solution, which was clearly noted from the high significant difference in the rate of complete response at the end of second week of treatment, but large number of patients (77 patients (71.9%)) who used 5% KOH showed partial response, which means that they needed additional time to show complete disappearance of the treated warts which was actually achieved at the end of fourth week with a cure rate (80.3%) that is slightly lower than that induced by using 10% concentration (cure rate = 82.1%), but statistically, the difference between both groups is insignificant. In addition, it has been shown that patients with smaller number of warts responded better to KOH solution than patients with larger number, which may be attributed to the relatively better immunity in this group in comparison with those with larger number of warts where the immunity is supposed to be suppressed or could be due to better patient's compliance when the number of warts is small.</p><p>Many side effects were reported among patients using topical KOH solution in this study, but they were significantly lower among patients using 5% KOH solution in comparison with those using 10% KOH, which can be attributed to variation in the activity that is weaker with lower concentration. Meanwhile, side effects can be reported even with spontaneous resolution.</p><p>Furthermore, the recurrence rates of warts among patients showing complete response were 5.8% in group (A) vs 5.1% in group (B). This recurrence rate is lower than that reported when 5% KOH solution was used for the treatment of genital wart where the warts were recurred in 9.3%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The relatively high recurrence rate among treated genital warts is probably attributed to the fact that up to 70% of genital warts are subclinical or latent infection; so, it can be clinically apparent at any time rather than due to true recurrence of the treated wart itself.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Topical KOH solution was found as an effective and safe treatment of plane warts, beside that, 5% KOH solution is as effective as 10% KOH solution with fewer side effects, but it required longer period of treatment in comparison with 10% KOH solution.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
