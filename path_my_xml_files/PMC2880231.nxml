A commonly used method to achieve awareness is the development of guidelines for clinical practice. In recent years, many such guidelines have been published. However, approximately 30&#x02013;40% of patients do not receive care according to present scientific evidence, and about 20&#x02013;25% of care provided is not needed or is potentially harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At present, little is known about effective strategies for the implementation of new guidelines in multidisciplinary teams of second-line medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Lynch syndrome, previously referred to as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], is the most common type of hereditary CRC and is caused by germ line inactivation of one of four DNA mismatch repair genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although Lynch syndrome only accounts for up to 5% of CRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], identifying Lynch syndrome is highly relevant because surveillance substantially reduces morbidity and mortality in family members carrying a mismatch repair gene mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The identification of Lynch syndrome starts with the recognition of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome. Traditionally, this is done by the occurrence of CRC in the family. However, by using family history, only a small proportion of the expected number of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome is identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is due to small families, unawareness by the patients of their own family history and suboptimal registration of family history of cancer by surgeons and gastroenterologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recognising patients at risk for Lynch syndrome can effectively be improved by an additional procedure using a molecular genetic test on tumour DNA of a CRC, the so-called microsatellite instability (MSI) testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MSI is a hallmark of a defective mismatch repair system, which results in differences in length of stretches of simple repeat sequences, called microsatellites, between normal and tumour DNA. In Lynch syndrome, virtually all CRCs show MSI. Although MSI may also occur in sporadic CRC diagnosed at relatively high age, in the group of patients suspected for Lynch syndrome, the MSI is predominantly due to genetic susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Once patients at risk are identified, this will lead to identification of more patients with Lynch syndrome in a highly cost-effective way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A new guideline was developed using MSI testing to improve recognition of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome by a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, pathologists and clinical geneticists. In this MSI-testing-indicated-by-a-pathologist (MIPA) procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], pathologists initiate MSI testing in a selection of recently diagnosed patients with one of the following criteria: (1) CRC diagnosed before age 50, (2) second CRC before age 70, (3) CRC and a Lynch syndrome associated cancer before age 70 or (4) a colorectal adenoma with high-grade dysplasia before the age of 40&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Pathologists report the MSI test result to the surgeon with the advice to consider referral for genetic counselling in an outpatient clinic for hereditary cancer when the MSI test was positive or the family history remained suspicious for hereditary CRC.</p><p>This guideline was proven to be feasible and cost-effective, includes modern molecular techniques for pathologists and requires more communication between surgeons, pathologists and clinical geneticists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To introduce the MIPA procedure in community hospitals, an implementation strategy was developed, tailored to barriers found in a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects and costs of this implementation. The secondary aim was to determine which elements of the implementation were particularly successful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The MIPA study was a cluster-randomised controlled trial in 12 pathology laboratories and the 29 community hospitals in their catchment area, examining the effectiveness of a tailored implementation strategy for the MIPA procedure compared to standard implementation.

Selection criteria for MSI testing, the MIPA criteria, were derived from the internationally used Bethesda guidelines as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The following tumours were included as associated with Lynch syndrome: carcinomas of endometrium, ovary, small bowel, stomach, biliary tract, upper urinary tract and sebaceous gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The nationwide electronic registry for pathology in the Netherlands, PALGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], was used for the identification of tumours that fulfilled the selection criteria. After closing the study, 279 patients turned out to have been eligible for inclusion between September 2005 and December 2006.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was done at the level of the pathology laboratories (clusters).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>All surgeons and pathologists received written information on the new procedure for recognition of Lynch syndrome, as published articles and a guideline. In the intervention group, pathologists were also provided with electronic patient inclusion reminders (monthly), feedback on inclusion (every 3&#x000a0;month) and supporting materials such as small cards with the selection criteria, a list to register MSI-positive tumours and a folder to save information of MSI applications. Surgeons received a 1-h interactive small-scale education session with a lecture and discussion concerning how and when to tell a patient about a positive MSI test result. Surgeons also received reminders in the patient record, consisting of a sticker with a checklist of three items: (a) MSI result (positive or negative), (b) test result discussed with patient (yes or no) and (c) patient referred to cancer genetics clinic (yes or no).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients recognised to be at risk for Lynch syndrome. Recognition was defined as (1) patients with a positive MSI result who were referred to genetic counselling, or (2) patients with a negative MSI result, or (3) patients who were referred to genetic counselling without prior MSI application by a pathologist. The secondary outcome measures were the effectiveness of the elements directed to pathologists and surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Costs of implementation strategy</title><p>To gather data about the costs of the elements of the implementation strategy, surgeons, pathologists and the research team provided time estimates. These volumes were multiplied by standardised unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Because these unit costs were established in 2003, they were adjusted to 2007 by using the Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Netherlands (StatLine, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statline.cbs.nl">www.statline.cbs.nl</ext-link>). Overhead costs were calculated as 32% of the direct costs to approximate overhead in health care. All costs were measured on a per patient basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are reported according to guidelines for reporting cluster-randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To guarantee that the laboratories and their hospitals in the intervention group did not differ in pre-randomisation performance from the laboratories and hospitals in the control group regarding the outcome measure, we retrospectively analysed in both groups &#x02018;the percentage of patients who were referred to genetic counselling without prior MSI application by a pathologist&#x02019;. This concerned patients who were recently diagnosed with CRC in the participating pathology laboratories between April and December 2004. We measured only this part of the primary outcome measure because MSI testing was not initiated by the pathologists before the start of the intervention. To examine the rate of patients referred to genetic counselling, all Dutch cancer genetics clinics were asked to check whether the patients selected by PALGA had visited their hospital. The percentage of patients who received genetic counselling was 30.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.5&#x02013;41.8%) in the intervention and 30.4% (95% CI 17.9&#x02013;42.8%) in the control group, so the pre-randomisation performance of both groups was very comparable. To ascertain successful elements of the implementation strategy, the experiences of pathologists and surgeons with the elements scored on a six-point Likert scale were dichotomised into positive or negative experience. Odds ratios were calculated to describe univariate associations between each element of the implementation strategy and the secondary outcome measure. Statistical significance was set at 5%. Analyses were performed with the SAS system for Windows V8.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Characteristics of clusters and participants</title><p>Two hundred seventy-nine patients were eligible for recognition at risk for Lynch syndrome.

Surgeons from the intervention arm referred as many patients with an MSI-positive tumour to genetic counselling as those in the control arm: 14 out of 19 (74%) patients and 7 out of 11 (64%) patients, respectively, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6 (95% CI 0.09&#x02013;7.9).

The pathologist who scored our electronic reminders as not effective used a self-developed electronic patient inclusion reminder system and actually meant that receiving our electronic reminders was not of additional value. Furthermore, it appeared that two pathology laboratories of the control arm had developed a reminder system very similar to the one provided in the intervention arm by themselves. The availability of an electronic patient inclusion reminder system was highly associated with the detection of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome: 156 out of 204 (76%) and 29 out of 62 (47%) with and without an electronic patient inclusion reminder system, respectively (clustering adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.2 (95% CI 1.7&#x02013;10.1)). All pathologists agreed with the need for a reminder system because only a small subset (about 13%) of patients with CRC fulfils the criteria for MSI testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and therefore referring a case for MSI testing can easily be forgotten. Nevertheless, MSI testing was applied in only 75% of eligible tumours from pathology laboratories with an electronic reminder system. According to interviews with the pathologists, barriers to application of MSI testing were time constraints and absence of the pathologist who was primarily responsible for application of MSI testing. Because the intervention directed to surgeons was not significantly effective, it was not possible to determine successful elements at this level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Costs of implementation strategy</title><p>The costs of the elements of the intervention are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

With surprisingly little effort and at low costs, multidisciplinary implementation of an entirely novel practice role for pathologists was improved. The efficiency of counselling by a clinical geneticist is greatly enhanced when patients with an MSI-high CRC are being referred for Lynch syndrome. This is due to the fact that especially patients with a positive MSI test are at very high risk to be mutation carriers, whereas a clinical geneticist has little to offer to a young patient with an MSI-negative CRC, unless the presence of polyposis or a positive family history clearly points at a hereditary defect. Our results may have a larger impact on health care because use of an electronic reminder system can increase adherence to guidelines of other hereditary diseases too.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study of an implementation strategy designed to improve the recognition of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome by tumour testing. One year before the introduction of the MIPA procedure, only 30% of the patients at risk for Lynch syndrome was recognised as such by the traditional procedure based on signalling familial occurrence of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This low number is in line with other studies showing that family history is insufficient for recognising patients at risk for Lynch syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. After introduction of the MIPA procedure in multidisciplinary teams including surgeons and pathologists by written materials, the recognition of patients at risk for Lynch syndrome was substantially higher, namely 59%. In the tailored implementation group, this recognition was even 77%. This difference between control and intervention group is relatively large. In a review including 235 controlled studies, Grimshaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] studied the effectiveness of strategies to implement clinical guidelines. Overall, the majority of studies observed modest improvements in care of only 5&#x02013;10%.</p><p>In the present study, the pathologists in the intervention arm obtained an overview of eligible patients only once a month. It is expected that the MSI analysis would be applied even more often, when the pathologist would get a pop-up with the possibility to initiate MSI testing at the moment of authorising the pathology report.</p><p>The surgeon-directed intervention led to 74% referrals of patients with an MSI-positive tumour. This was not significantly larger than in the control group (64%) probably because of small numbers. It is plausible that a referral rate of 74% is fairly optimal because not all patients with an MSI-positive tumour are capable or willing to receive genetic counselling at the time colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated. Our results are in line with previous data showing that 78% of patients with CRC would accept genetic counselling shortly after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Based on the Bethesda criteria, originally four MIPA criteria have been defined. However, only two of these criteria appeared to be fulfilled within our study. Therefore, we suggest restricting the MIPA criteria to the following two criteria: (1) CRC diagnosed before age 50 and (2) second CRC before age 70.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that the patient&#x02019;s visit to a cancer genetics clinic for genetic counselling was measured until 6&#x000a0;months after the CRC diagnosis of the last patient. It is possible that more patients will receive genetic counselling in the near future. However, as it is unlikely that this effect differs between the two groups, this will not affect the conclusion that the intervention leads to a higher rate of adherence to the guideline.</p><p>Our findings indicate that a surprisingly simple and cheap electronic patient inclusion reminder system for medical specialists is effective for adherence to a complex multidisciplinary procedure for recognition of Lynch syndrome. The implications for health care can be substantially and are of course not restricted to patients at risk for Lynch syndrome.
