occupation-centered activity program for dementia patients living in a local community,
and examined the effects of the occupation-centered activity program on their cognitive
functions, fall-related factors, and quality of life. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty
subjects were divided into two groups: the experiment group (n=15) and the control group
(n=15). The occupation-centered activity program was then applied to dementia patients for
60 minutes, 5 times/week for 12 weeks. To identify their cognitive functions before and
after the intervention occupation-centered activity program, Mini-Mental State
Examination-Korea (MMSE-K) and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were used. To assess
fall-related factors, Korean Falls Efficacy Scale for the Elderly (FES-K) was used and leg
strength, agility, and balance of the participants was measured. To examine quality of
life, the Korean version of Quality of Life-Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Scale (KQOL-AD) was used.
[Results] The results of the intervention showed that although cognitive function improved
in both the experimental and control groups, fall-related factors and the quality of life
significantly improved only in the experimental group. [Conclusion] This indicates that
the occupation-centered activity program had a positive effect on dementia patients&#x02019;
cognitive functions, fall-related factors, and quality of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fall-related factors</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Dementia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The elderly population with dementia in Korea accounts for 9.18% of the population, or
540,000 individuals, as of December 2012<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These numbers are expected to increase to 1.27 million by 2020, and to double every 20
years<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elderly with dementia show
impaired cognitive function and damaged motor functions because of an overall damage to
their cerebral cortex<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A decrease in
balance arising from damaged motor functions leads to an overall decline in their gross
motor functions and gradually increases their fall risk<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A high fall risk is a serious problem because it restricts the
activities of daily life and social activities of the patients, subsequently reducing their
quality of life, and ultimately causing various complications, potentially including
death<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In regard to the fall risk of
elderly patients with dementia, it is necessary to consider both psychological (fall
efficacy)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and physical factors (leg
strength, agility, and balance)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fall
prevention programs include exercise programs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and balance and muscle exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, adjusting the difficulty level of such programs is
challenging, and therefore its application for elderly with dementia is limited. In addition
to fall risks, by the nature of senile dementia, these patients are also likely to have
other problems, such as cognitive impairments. Hence, it is necessary to develop and
implement a combined intervention program that considers all of these problems. Studies that
have developed and implemented a program that considers the characteristics of dementia
patients and includes activities related to fall risks are scarce, and no study has
investigated the effects of such programs on the quality of life, which is an important goal
of rehabilitation.</p><p>In this regard, this study aimed to i) develop and implement an occupation-centered
activity program that contains activities specific to dementia, ii) examine the efficacy of
the occupation-centered activity program in regard to fall-related factors and quality of
life of the patients, and iii) contribute to improving the design of future programs
targeted for providing therapy for dementia patients to alleviate their symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 30 dementia patients admitted to daytime care center in Jeolla
Province. This study conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
of the subjects were diagnosed with dementia by neuropsychiatrists, and this study obtained
written approval from the subjects under the cooperation of the dementia business operator
and the head of the institution (Kaya IRB-163). While the experimental group (n=15) took
part in the occupation-centered activity program and took medications for their dementia
symptoms, the control group (n=15) did not participate in the occupation-centered activity
program, but continued taking medications for their dementia symptoms. This study applied
the occupation-centered activity program 5 times per week for a total of 24 sessions for
approximately 60 minutes per session. The program included physical activities, cognitive
activities, daily life activities, instrumental daily life activities, handicraft,
traditional Korean music activities, and other music activities. This program included
calibrated activities appropriate and meaningful for dementia patients based on Oh and Kim&#x02019;s
convergent occupational therapy program<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
Song et al.&#x02019;s group music therapy program<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
and an exercise program<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The occupation-centered activity program was performed 5
times per week for a total of 24 sessions for around 60 minutes per session. This study used
the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea (MMSE-K)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> to assess cognitive functions. For fall-related factors,
this study used the Korean Falls Efficacy Scale for the Elderly (FES-K), Chair Stand and
244&#x02005;cm Up and Go tests, suggested by the Senior Fitness Test<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and fall efficacy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> to measure leg strength and agility and applied Richard et al.&#x02019;s
one leg standing test (1984)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> to measure
balance. For assessing quality of life, the Korean version of the Quality of
Life-Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Scale (KQOL-AD)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> was used. For the subjects&#x02019; general information, each question was
converted into numerical scores and was analyzed statistically. All of the measures were
analyzed using the SPSS/WIN statistical program 21.0. Their general characteristics were
analyzed by descriptive statistics. A paired t-test was conducted to identify whether any
difference was significant in fall-related factors before and after the implementation of
the occupation-centered activity program and for the quality of life before and after the
occupation-centered activity program. The statistical significance level was established at
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the study subjects are described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects (N=30)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Categories</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Items</th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">Experimental group</th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">Control group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">82.0 &#x000b1; 4.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">80.9 &#x000b1; 3.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vascular dementia</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Education (years)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.

at a daytime care center in Jeolla Province; identified the program&#x02019;s effect on their
cognition, fall-related factors, and quality of life; and intended to put forward the
theoretical basis for various therapeutic approaches of occupational therapy. The results of
this study showed that there was a positive effect on the cognitive function, fall-related
factors, and quality of life of the experimental group who were administered occupational
therapy along with medications for 12 weeks. Such results are similar to those of Cho&#x02019;s
study<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, where cognitive functions
improved when a cognitive-enhancement group training program was performed in dementia
patients for 8 weeks. These results showed that when cognitive occupational therapy was
implemented, dementia patients used their hands and stimulated their brain, which in turn
strengthened their brain function and improved their cognitive function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, traditional Korean music and other music
activities used in this study showed similar results to those of Song et al.&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> where traditional Korean music therapy
provided to those aged between 69 and 92&#x02005;years of age, once to twice per week for 15
sessions of 50 minutes each resulted in improved cognitive functions. Those results
demonstrate that traditional Korean music activities resulted in improved ability to recall
the past and ultimately enhanced cognitive function. In other words, if music familiar to
the elderly, such as traditional Korean music, is provided, it could have a positive effect
towards improving the cognitive functions and quality of life of elderly patients with
dementia. Physical activities used in this study, including yoga, were also found to have a
positive impact on fall efficacy. These results were consistent with those of Tiedemann et
al.&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which a yoga program
was applied to 54 elderly individuals living in a local community for 12 weeks. The yoga
group&#x02019;s fall efficacy and fall-related factors improved more than those of the control
group. These results demonstrate that a physical activity program can have a positive effect
on the fall efficacy of elderly patients, both with and without dementia.</p><p>The occupation-centered activity program applied in this study included physical,
cognitive, and instrumental daily life activities, and showed a positive effect on dementia
patients&#x02019; cognitive and physical functions. These results were similar to those of Lee et
al.&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, which applied a combined
intervention providing physical activities, cognitive training, and social interaction at
the same time, and showed a positive effect on dementia patients&#x02019; quality of life and
cognitive functions. Such results demonstrate that enhancing dementia patients&#x02019;
participation and activity changed brain plasticity, which led to changes in their cognitive
function, improvements in their emotional fall efficacy, and ultimately had a positive
effect on their quality of life<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
other words, these are similar to the goal of occupational therapy on dementia patients,
which aims to facilitate their participation in various activities during the therapy
period. Therefore, we conclude that therapeutic interventions for patients with dementia
should consider various factors specific to dementia patients, including physical,
cognitive, and daily life activities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ministry of Health and Welfare:
