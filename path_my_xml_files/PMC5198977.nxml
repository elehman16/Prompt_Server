The aim was to investigate whether AA can reduce exam anxiety as compared to placebo and no intervention. Forty-four medical students were randomized to receive AA, placebo, or no intervention in a crossover manner and subsequently completed three comparable oral anatomy exams with an interval of 1 month between the exams/interventions. AA was applied using indwelling fixed needles bilaterally at points MA-IC1, MA-TF1, MA-SC, MA-AT1 and MA-TG one day prior to each exam. Placebo needles were used as control. Levels of anxiety were measured using a visual analogue scale before and after each intervention as well as before each exam. Additional measures included the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory, duration of sleep at night, blood pressure, heart rate and the extent of participant blinding. All included participants finished the study. Anxiety levels were reduced after AA and placebo intervention compared to baseline and the no intervention condition (p &#x0003c; 0.003). AA was better at reducing anxiety than placebo in the evening before the exam (p = 0.018). Participants were able to distinguish between AA and placebo intervention. Both AA and placebo interventions reduced exam anxiety in medical students. The superiority of AA over placebo may be due to insufficient blinding of participants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.

Various mindfulness-based behavioral interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing exam anxiety and stress among university students [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some of these methods (e.g. expressive writing) have even been claimed to improve academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, all of these methods are time consuming, which makes the routine use of cognitive and behavioural interventions in the treatment of anxiety immediately before an upcoming exam difficult [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Auricular acupuncture (AA) is a complementary medicine technique, which is physiologically based on the mechanical stimulation of cranial nerves [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Since this study did not provide sufficient information for further research, we tested the methodology of the AA intervention as well as the outcome assessment in treatment of pre-exam anxiety using a preliminary pilot investigation [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

The participants were recruited via announcement in March 2012 before the first anatomy exam in April according to the following eligibility criteria: undergraduate medical students in their first year of study with no fundamental knowledge about and experiences with acupuncture, undergoing three oral anatomy exams within one month, without any history of alcohol abuse or use of opioid or psychotropic medication and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score of I-II. None of the students were taking any medications or recreational drugs at the time of the study and all of them were paid for their participation. The follow-up was finished on the day of the last anatomy exam in July 2012.</p><p>The research project was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University Medicine of Greifswald (reference no.

The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration number NCT02920164) after the enrollment of the participants was started since initially the authors regarded the project as an experimental investigation. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered. The written informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the study procedures was explained. As all students took three comparable anatomy exams with an interval of one month, each of them was randomly assigned to the AA, placebo or no intervention condition at the evening prior to a scheduled exam by drawing slips of paper with the numbers 1, 2 or 3 out of a hat. Each number corresponded to an intervention, as determined a priori: 1 = AA, 2 = placebo, 3 = no intervention before the first exam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168338.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0168338.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0168338.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow of the study.</title><p>First randomization (R1) was performed by drawing wrapped pieces of paper with hidden numbers ranging from 1 to 3 before the first exam.

These results are in line with the findings of Brockmeyer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exam anxiety decreased by up to 20% from baseline after AA in comparison to placebo procedure and no intervention. The largest effect size of AA over placebo procedure and no intervention was measured using VAS-100 in the evening after the intervention on the day before the exam. The effect size observed in the present study is comparable to the findings of our pilot investigation [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and other previous studies of AA and situational anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, Karst et al. [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that state anxiety scores decreased by about 18% from baseline to after AA treatment of dental anxiety in 19 patients. Likewise, Michalek-Sauberer et al [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated a reduction in STAI state anxiety levels by about 15% from baseline to after AA in 61 patients for dental procedures. However, both investigations failed to find the difference between verum AA and placebo procedures.</p><p>In our investigation, placebo procedure was found to reduce exam anxiety in comparison to no intervention in medical students as well, although this effect was not as strong as the reduction of pre-exam anxiety through AA. Even if the majority of participants could distinguish between verum and placebo procedure, we are hesitant to say that the difference between AA and placebo occurred due to a bias of potential &#x0201c;unblinding&#x0201d; because of two aspects: i) due to &#x0201c;unblinding&#x0201d;, the placebo effect should have disappeared, however there was sustained effect of placebo over the no intervention condition, as measured by both VAS-100 and STAI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0168338.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168338.g003">Fig 3</xref>); ii) questioning about the opinion on the allocation to the study condition took place at the end of the study after the exam, meaning that the exact time of potential &#x0201c;unblinding&#x0201d; is unclear. We could not determine the time of &#x0201c;unblinding&#x0201d; in this study and this fact remains the main limitation of our investigation. Moreover, since the participants were instructed to stimulate the needles in case they start to feel anxious only before the AA condition, this action could not be controlled in the placebo condition and may have diminished the difference between AA and placebo due to the weak physiological effect of acupressure applied to 'New Pyonex' placebo needles [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, on the day before the exam, 3 participants did not document their anxiety levels. They reported to have forgotten about it because of their high stress levels immediately before the exam.</p><p>As expected, STAI trait anxiety scores did not change during the course of the investigation. This is unsurprising as they are thought to reflect a stable personal characteristic that remains constant over time and between events [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mean value of trait anxiety in the study group significantly exceeded the mean found in the general female population aged between 15 and 29 years [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is in agreement with previous findings about increased anxiety levels and lower self-confidence among female medical students [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and explains the &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; selection of predominantly anxious females that volunteered to participate in our study.</p><p>Despite the expectations based on previous results [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we could not observe the beneficial effect of AA or placebo on quality and duration of sleep as well as exam performance in participants of our study. The stability of hemodynamic parameters and the absence of side effects and complications confirm the respective findings of previous investigations [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>This trial followed the CONSORT guidelines for specific requirements of acupuncture studies [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The randomized crossover design and the use of a formulaic auricular acupuncture (constant pattern of cranial nerves stimulation) rather than individualized acupuncture have minimized potential biases. The dropout rate of 9% was low.</p><p>Regarding the above-mentioned limitations of the present investigation we suggest that future studies should examine larger samples to compensate for dropout rates and incomplete data. The &#x0201c;parallel arms&#x0201d; approach might be considered in order to prevent any exchange of participant experiences and intra-individual &#x0201c;carry-over&#x0201d; experience, which may have contributed to the potential &#x0201c;unblinding&#x0201d; in our investigation. Also the number of participants, who have stimulated the needles by pressing, if they felt anxious, should be verified in future investigations, since the stimulation (or not stimulation of the needles) might have caused the effect bias. Furthermore, the measurement of non-invasive stress biomarkers as salivary cortisol, salivary &#x003b1;-amylase or catecholamines in urine might strengthen the findings of any future investigations, giving further insights into the biological mechanisms of AA.</p><p>In order to evaluate the clinical significance of the AA effect, this technique should be compared with methods that are commonly used for treatment of exam anxiety, such as relaxation techniques, biofeedback and systematic desensitization [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168338.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, after appropriate investigations, AA might be used to treat pre-operative anxiety in surgical patients, constituting serious alternative for benzodiazepines, commonly used for this purpose in clinical practice [<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168338.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, both auricular acupuncture and placebo procedure were shown to be effective in reducing levels of exam anxiety in medical students. The superiority of verum AA over placebo AA and no intervention is considered to be due to stimulation of cranial nerves, but may have been increased in effect by insufficient participant blinding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec009"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168338.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Blood pressure and heart rate during the study conditions given as mean (SD).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168338.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168338.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Ethics commission application.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168338.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168338.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Pilot investigation.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168338.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168338.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Study Data.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168338.s004.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168338.s005"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168338.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Bianca Leutzow for her assistance in organization of the study, Franziska Miller for re-checking the manuscript for mistakes and the students who participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0168338.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Speer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mental health in American colleges and universities: variation across student subgroups and across campuses</article-title>. <source><italic>J Nerv Ment Dis</italic></source>
