Because of the small number of eligible patients, it can prove difficult to enroll a sufficient number of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In such small studies, several problems can arise; firstly the validity of the results may be questionable. Secondly, there is a risk of not being able to demonstrate an effect in trials with complex patient populations which are more prone to variability and statistical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Additionally, rare diseases are frequently life-threatening and no treatments are available, giving rise to ethical issues related to assigning patients to a placebo treatment. Finally, the interpretation is complicated due to the heterogeneous and unpredictable presentation of the rare diseases and the use of surrogate endpoints, while demonstration of clinically relevant effectiveness may be only evident after many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In some cases, the use of an orphan medicinal product has been well established in clinical practice. For example, zinc has been used in the treatment of Wilson&#x02019;s disease since 1958 and its effectiveness has been extensively documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In other cases, the level of clinical evidence is questionable. Joppi <italic>et al</italic>. expressed concerns about the general lack of efficacy data of orphan medicinal products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Kesselheim <italic>et al.</italic> compared pivotal studies used to authorize non-orphan cancer drugs to those of orphan cancer drugs and found that the latter are more likely to be smaller, nonrandomized, unblinded and using surrogate end points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Putzeist <italic>et al.</italic> found that for three out of four licensed OMPs approval was based on robust randomized studies and endpoints that were considered clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, a Belgian study argued that the clinical evidence presented at the time of reimbursement is poor for most orphan medicinal products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>At the moment, it is questionable whether timely access to new OMPs can be reconciled with quality of clinical evidence. This also leads to difficult reimbursement decisions as member states have different strategies for implementation of OMPs after central EU authorization. Indeed, local reimbursement agencies sometimes tend to attribute a special status to OMPs, in which reimbursement is granted, in spite of high prices and undemonstrated effectiveness. Other agencies ask for additional (cost-) effectiveness studies at a national level. Several authors have argued that the prioritization of rare diseases is not based on scientific evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. At the time of marketing authorization, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) can deal with incomplete clinical evidence by granting conditional marketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. Recent debate on the long-term effectiveness of some OMPs, led us to wonder whether the initial standards for clinical evidence for OMPs, set by EMA at the time of marketing authorization, are too low. For example, the authors of a Cochrane review concluded that six poor quality controlled studies provide no evidence for the use of both agalsidase alfa and beta to treat Fabry disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Long term effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry disease, in combination with supportive care, lowers the risks of developing complications, but does not prevent disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the characteristics and quality of clinical evidence that is presented for OMPs authorised in the EU up to 1<sup>st</sup> July 2012 using the new and validated COMPASS tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>COMPASS-Clinical evidence of orphan medicinal products-an assessment tool</title><p>The development and validation of the COMPASS tool is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Briefly, the tool consists of three parts and is to be completed based on information provided on the Orphanet website and in European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) and/or the Scientific Discussion (SD) document prepared by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the EMA. The first part collects general descriptive information about the OMP and its marketing authorization. The second part focuses on the assessment of the methodological quality (i.e. specifically related to study design, patient and study population, control arm, blinding, randomization and allocation, outcomes, adherence and statistical analysis) of the pivotal clinical study. The last part assesses quality of reporting as shortcomings in the reporting can complicate the interpretation of the methodological quality. The tool itself does not attempt to score or rank the quality of clinical evidence, but rather to give an outline of various, key elements with respect to quality of clinical evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Data source</title><p>We included all OMPs (n = 64) that were listed as authorized on the website of the EMA on July 1<sup>st</sup> 2012 (i.e. centrally approved OMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The same data sources, as used during the development of the tool, were consulted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Again, the study was restricted to studies that were described as 'pivotal&#x02019; or 'main&#x02019; clinical studies. The analyses were performed per study, as opposed to per orphan medicinal product, due to possible methodological differences between the studies. For practical and privacy reasons, we did not have access to the original documents submitted to EMA. However, we anticipated that the publicly EPARs sufficiently reflect these original documents. Additionally, we did not consult publications due to unsystematic reporting and publication bias. The power of a study was defined as the probability of reaching a true positive conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>One rater (E.P.) completed the template for all OMPs (n = 64), whereas another rater (S.S.) analysed a random sample of OMPs (n = 29). The raters completed the tool independently and once-only. Additionally, raters were blinded with respect to results of others. The same information was available to all raters. All disagreements between two raters were resolved upon consensus. Additionally, a third rater (D.C.) (i.e. a physician) specifically answered the question &#x0201c;Is the duration of the trial relevant to the natural history of the disease?&#x0201d; for all OMPs. Upon disagreement between the raters, the assessment of D.C. was considered decisive. After data collection, E.P. was responsible for comparison of the results. With a view to increasing content validity, two physicians with an expertise in metabolic disorders (C.H.) and hematology (J.M.) examined and commented on the results obtained for respectively three enzyme replacement therapies (agalsidase alfa, agalsidase beta, laronidase) and three hematological medicines (ofatumumab, clofarabine, cladribine).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using MS Office Excel 2010.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of the indications</title><p>We included 64 OMPs in the analysis of which 46 received a normal marketing authorization, three obtained conditional marketing authorization and 15 were authorized under exceptional circumstances.

To a lesser extent, the lack of dose finding studies is also worrisome from a safety perspective. Additionally, there are important shortcomings in the reporting of those studies, which further complicates the interpretation of the clinical evidence.</p><sec><title>Analysis of the indications</title><p>Despite the fact that protocol assistance appears to be positively associated with success of marketing authorization, we found that for just one in four indications, protocol assistance was requested by the sponsor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For only 55% of the indications, a dose-finding study was performed prior to the pivotal study(/ies). This number is on the rise according to Joppi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the characteristics of the pivotal studies</title><p>Surrogate endpoints were used in a large majority of the studies. Indeed, if a hard endpoint (such as overall survival) is used, it is more difficult to demonstrate an effect given the small sample size and the limited duration of the majority of the studies. Also, fewer patients are required to show a change in a continuous variable (i.e. a surrogate endpoint such as a biomarker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Additionally, surrogate endpoints can provide guidance for adequate dose selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The use of these surrogate endpoints seems to have contributed significantly to the rise in numbers of new OMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The clinical importance of those surrogate endpoints has however been questioned, as there is not always a strong relationship with clinical meaningful endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Still, obtaining marketing authorization based solely on hard endpoints is not always feasible and could jeopardize early access to the market. Therefore, we argue strongly in favour of using at least one hard endpoint in a post-marketing phase IV study. Also, in order to sufficiently capture what is valued by patients, it is recommended to consult with patient(s) (organizations) in an early stage on what endpoints should be considered.</p><p>The pivotal studies supporting the marketing authorization of OMPs included between 7 and 976 patients. In a similar study, the small number of patients was also deemed not justifiable for a number of OMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Yet, most rare diseases have a prevalence of less than 1 in 10 000 individuals. Given the difficulties to recruit patients for clinical studies, registries of prospectively enrolled patients can be a powerful tool to collect more data. Additionally, those registries can improve our understanding of the natural course of a disease and its relevant biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Registration of clinical studies on EUdraCT is mandatory for all interventional clinical studies in the European Union from 2004 onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similarly, ClinicalTrials.gov offers an overview of publicly and privately supported international clinical studies, but not all studies are required by law to be registered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This implies that not all studies are registered on one or both databases. It is more worrisome that accordance with GCP guidelines was not reported for all studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the methodological quality of the pivotal studies</title><p>We found that for the majority of the studies the allocation was randomized and/or a control arm was used in the study design. These findings are consistent with another study that reported more use of randomization in the last years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Also, just half of the studies applied some type of blinding. It has been shown that un-blinded studies are more likely to show clinical improvement than blinded studies. Randomized and double blind designs reduce bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In general, it is assumed that evidence obtained by randomized studies is better than non-randomized. Nonetheless, results from non-randomized studies can still be of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Bayesian statistical methods have been developed to form prior probability distributions based on non-randomized studies, which can then be combined with randomized evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Additionally, well-understood adaptive designs can offer the necessary flexibility and efficiency, if used with due caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Clearly, these small study populations and/or adaptive study designs can impose a statistical challenge, which is illustrated by the observation that in most studies the statistics are unclear and lacking in detail (i.e. lack of p-values, use of Last Observation Carried Forward to deal with missing data, no correction for baseline imbalances between groups, etc.).</p><p>We found that in less than half of the studies, an adequate number of patients, as suggested by a priori power calculations, was included. Performing underpowered studies has been regarded as unethical, because study participants are unable to contribute to improved care for future patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Also, the appropriateness of the study population is a cause for concern. For example, including patients with minimal symptoms (so called &#x0201c;atypical cases&#x0201d;), while excluding children, females, patients with severe end-organ damage etc. can skew the population and affect the interpretation. Furthermore, the characteristics of the study population should be reflected in the choice of endpoints (and not vice versa). For example, no small children were included in the pivotal study for galsulfase, because the primary endpoint was a 12 minute walking test.</p><p>Even though QoL is a highly relevant outcome in the evaluation of chronic and debilitating diseases, only a minority of the studies included a QoL-related endpoint. Additionally, an improvement in QoL was obtained in just ten studies. Disease-specific QoL measures, although preferred because of their responsiveness to changes in the condition caused by treatment, are not available for all rare diseases. Yet, the use of validated generic QoL measures has become widely accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Even for children, there are a few generic Qol measures both proxy and/or self-complete available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Higher quality efficacy data could possibly be attained by imposing the use of Quality-of-Life (QoL) related endpoints.</p><p>The duration of the study was considered too short, relative to the disease, for approximately a fifth of all studies. Similarly, the duration and the length of follow-up were considered to be too short in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In some cases, the duration of a study was sufficient to demonstrate a treatment effect based on the predefined endpoints. But, the validity of some (surrogate) endpoints has been questioned, as some do not translate into clinical benefit nor are in line with the natural course of a disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For example, the pain endpoint used in a study for agalsidase alfa has been refused by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also, the pattern of expected prognosis may also change over time as diagnosis improves and background of standard of care improves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the quality of reporting of the pivotal studies in the EPAR</title><p>The assessment of the methodology quality also depends on the information available in the EPARs. The conciseness of the information in the EPAR made the analysis of nine pivotal studies impossible. Additionally, we found that some items, such as a description of the patients, the point estimates and measures of variability for all endpoints and the actual probability variables are not reported for all studies. With a view to interpreting the results, these elements, together with the appropriate probability values, are indispensable. Unlike journal articles, EPARs are not subject to space constraints. Therefore lack of information could lead to the false assumption that a study was methodologically deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In order to set up more uniform requirements for reporting, a checklist was drawn up, following actions agreed upon by EUnetHTA and EMA, for the EPAR improvement project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>This study has several strengths and weaknesses. It provides a quantitative evaluation of the level of clinical evidence presented in all pivotal studies for all OMPs. Additionally, the results were validated by clinical experts. However, the study is limited to the EPAR and/or SD documents and it therefore subject to bias by the quality of reporting in these documents. As such, it does not take into consideration the (possibly relevant) evidence that was generated after obtaining marketing authorization and/or in publications (which may contain more details on for example inclusion criteria and would thus allow for quality control of the included data). For example, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted for agalsidase alfa after marketing authorization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Also, we did not categorize our results based on the type of marketing authorization (ie normal, conditional, under exceptional circumstances), but opted to show aggregate data. Finally, we did not include non-OMPs in the analysis; as such it remains unclear whether similar issues apply to non-OMPs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the pivotal studies that are the basis for marketing authorization of OMPs are a cause for concern. Considering that these products have a substantial impact on the health care budget, it is clear that a balance must be struck between stimulating marketing authorization and requesting more and higher-quality efficacy data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Requests for better evidence for OMPs can be acceded to through new adaptive study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Additionally, the creation of European registries for each OMP, as a post-marketing commitment, could prove to be beneficial in collecting long-term clinical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A more demanding regulatory process for OMPs is needed to guide evidence-based clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>COMPASS: Clinical evidence of Orphan Medicinal Products-an ASSessment tool; OMP: Orphan medicinal product; EU: European Union; QoL: Quality-of-life; EPAR: European Public Assessment Report; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; SD: Scientific Discussion; CHMP: Committee for Human Medicinal Products; EMA: European Medicines Agency.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>EP, DC, JAM and SS declare that they have no competing interests.
