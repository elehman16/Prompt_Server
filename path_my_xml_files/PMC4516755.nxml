<bold>Study Design</bold>&#x02003;Randomized controlled trial.</p><p>
<bold>Objective</bold>&#x02003;Despite a large number of publications of outcomes after spinal fusion surgery, there is still no consensus on the efficacy of the several different fusion methods. The aim of this study was to determine whether transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) results in an improved clinical outcome compared with uninstrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) in the surgical treatment for chronic low back pain.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>&#x02003;This study included 135 patients with degenerative disk disease (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;96) or postdiskectomy syndrome (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39). Inclusion criteria were at least 1&#x02009;year of back pain with or without leg pain in patients aged 20 to 65 with one- or two-level disease. Exclusion criteria were sequestration of disk hernia, psychosocial instability, isthmic spondylolisthesis, drug abuse, and previous spine surgery other than diskectomy. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale (pain index). Functional disability was quantified by the disability rating index and Oswestry Disability Index. The global outcome was assessed by the patient and classified as much better, better, unchanged, or worse. The patients were randomized to conventional uninstrumented PLF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;67) or TLIF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68). PLF was performed in a standardized fashion using autograft. TLIF was performed with pedicle titanium screw fixation and a porous tantalum interbody spacer with interbody and posterolateral autograft. The clinical outcome measurements were obtained preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. The 2-year follow-up rate was 98%.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>&#x02003;The two treatment groups improved significantly from preoperatively to 2 years' follow-up. At final follow-up, the results in the TLIF group were significantly superior to those in the PLF group in pain index (2.0 versus 3.9, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) and in disability rating index (22 versus 36, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). The Oswestry Disability Index was better in the TLIF group (20 versus 28, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.110, not significant). The global assessment was clearly superior in the TLIF group: 63% of patients scored &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; in the TLIF group as compared with 48% in the PLF group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>&#x02003;The results of the current study support the use of TLIF rather than uninstrumented PLF in the surgical treatment of the degenerative lumbar spine. The less optimal outcome after uninstrumented PLF may be explained by the much higher reoperation rate.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion</kwd><kwd>posterolateral noninstrumented fusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Degenerative disk disease (DDD) and postdiskectomy syndrome (PDS) may cause severe and chronic low back pain. There are still controversies about the role of surgical treatment in these disorders. Although the evidence-based medicine (EBM) situation in DDD is unclear, fusion has been shown to be superior to conservative treatment in one of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DDD.<xref rid="JR1400159-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In PDS, the EBM situation is even more unclear with no RCT at all comparing fusion to conservative treatment. Adding to the controversy, the type of fusion has not convincingly been shown to affect the clinical outcome, although the fusion rate seems to vary with the technique used. In a recent review,<xref rid="JR1400159-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Babu et al concluded that there is level 1 data supporting that lumbar instrumentation improves fusion rates, but with no clear evidence of a consistent correlation between fusion rate and patient outcome. The rationale behind fusion is to eliminate motion in the pathologic motion segment,<xref rid="JR1400159-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> eliminating nociceptive afferent signals from disk and apophyseal joints.<xref rid="JR1400159-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="JR1400159-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> On theoretical grounds, interbody fusion has been suggested to result in an improved outcome compared with posterolateral fusion (PLF), because 80% of the mechanical load on the spine is anterior and the disk is probably an important pain generator. In addition, interbody fusion has an increased fusion rate, increased lordosis in short fusions, and direct or indirect foraminal decompression.<xref rid="JR1400159-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the 1990s, Harms and Varga introduced and popularized TLIF in treatment of degenerative disorders in the lumbar spine.<xref rid="JR1400159-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The data to support an improved outcome with interbody fusion as compared with PLF is scarce. H&#x000f8;y et al recently reported no difference in the outcome between TLIF and instrumented PLF in a mixed group of patients including not only DDD but also spinal stenosis and isthmic spondylolisthesis.<xref rid="JR1400159-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, a previous Danish study by Videbaek et al<xref rid="JR1400159-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> showed superior data in surgery with 360-degree fusion as compared with PLF with fixation at 5 to 9 years' follow-up. TLIF has several reported advantages compared with posterolateral lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF; i.e., only unilateral approach to the spinal canal with less canal violation, less canal fibrosis, less dura- and nerve retraction, reduced incidence of dural tear, less bleeding, and shorter operative time). Stand-alone anterior interbody fusion without screw fixation is today largely abandoned because of its high pseudarthrosis rates.<xref rid="JR1400159-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The 360-degree fusion as shown to be a method fulfilling the demands described above, but is more time-consuming as compared with TLIF.</p><p>In view of the similar outcomes observed in most RCTs comparing modern fusion techniques with traditional noninstrumented PLF, we decided to compare the simplest method, noninstrumented PLF, with TLIF, a recent addition to fusion methods in the degenerative lumbar spine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2001 and 2005, 135 patients were included in the study, 74 men and 61 women with a mean age of 44.5 years.

Patients aged 20 to 65 years with at least 1-year duration of low back pain with or without leg pain were included. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging showing either DDD with or without disk hernia or a history of previous diskectomy with a clinical and radiological picture of PDS. The study was restricted to one- or two-level disease. Patients with sequestration of disk hernia, psychosocial instability, isthmic spondylolisthesis, drug abuse, and previous spine surgery other than diskectomy were excluded. In all patients, low back pain was the dominant symptom, with additional leg pain in 84% of the patients. Seventy-three percent of all included patients were on sick leave because of low back problems. Ninety-one patients (67%) were treated with one-level fusion and 44 (33%) patients with two-level fusion.</p><table-wrap id="TB1400159-1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Patients demographics and characteristics</title></caption><table rules="all"><colgroup align="left" span="3"><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left"/><th valign="bottom" align="left">TLIF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68)</th><th valign="bottom" align="left">PLF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;67)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Age, y (range)</td><td valign="top" align="left">44 (25&#x02013;62)</td><td valign="top" align="left">45 (27&#x02013;65)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Gender, M/F (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left">53/47</td><td valign="top" align="left">57/43</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="3">Diagnosis, <italic>n</italic> (%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;Degenerative disk disease</td><td valign="top" align="left">46 (67)</td><td valign="top" align="left">50 (75)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;Postdiskectomy syndrome</td><td valign="top" align="left">22 (33)</td><td valign="top" align="left">17 (25)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Weight (mean kg)</td><td valign="top" align="left">79</td><td valign="top" align="left">80</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Height (mean cm)</td><td valign="top" align="left">175</td><td valign="top" align="left">174</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">On sick leave (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left">74</td><td valign="top" align="left">71</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="3">Exercise level (%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;None</td><td valign="top" align="left">31</td><td valign="top" align="left">37</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;Once a week</td><td valign="top" align="left">32</td><td valign="top" align="left">36</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;More than once a week</td><td valign="top" align="left">34</td><td valign="top" align="left">25</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="3">Education (%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;Elementary only</td><td valign="top" align="left">19</td><td valign="top" align="left">31</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;College</td><td valign="top" align="left">50</td><td valign="top" align="left">48</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">&#x02003;University</td><td valign="top" align="left">24</td><td valign="top" align="left">9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="FN1400159-1"><p>Abbreviations: PLF, posterolateral fusion; TLIF, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Randomization was performed by the nurse attending the outpatient clinic after inclusion of the patients into the study by the surgeon.

The strength of the study is the randomized design, the use of multiple validated outcome measurements, including return to work and high follow-up rate. A possible drawback was the relatively limited number of patients. The power analysis, however, indicated that 98 patients were sufficient to detect a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) set at 10 points in the ODI with 90% power at significance level 0.05, a much smaller number than the actual number of patients (135) in the current study. Furthermore, although the ODI improved more in the TLIF group, the difference was not significant and far below the MCID. Similarly, the proportion of patients working at follow-up was not different between the groups.</p><p>Notwithstanding these limitations and problems in interpretation of the results, the clinical outcome of the TLIF group must be considered as clearly superior compared with the PLF group, particularly in view of the substantial difference in global assessment with 63% &#x0201c;much better&#x0201d; after TLIF, compared with 48% after PLF. In addition, in the literature generally much better rates have been reported after spinal fusion, usually 29 to 55%,<xref rid="JR1400159-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="JR1400159-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> compared with our results. The global assessment has the disadvantage of possible recall bias. However, in the comparison between the groups, this problem does not invalidate the main finding of a superior outcome in the TLIF group. An improved outcome with TLIF was further supported by significantly better scores in the PI and DRI. The observed difference between the groups in the PI (19 mm) was the same as the reported MCID (18 to 19 mm) by H&#x000e4;gg et al but lower than the MCID reported by Glassman et al (25 mm).<xref rid="JR1400159-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="JR1400159-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The finding of a larger improvement in the DRI than in the ODI confirms a previous observation after fusion in adult spondylolisthesis, suggesting the DRI to be more sensitive to change than the ODI.<xref rid="JR1400159-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It may be that the DRI is a more disease-specific questionnaire on lumbar spine functional disability compared with the ODI, which includes more general aspects such as social and sexual function as well as pain.</p><p>Although the difference in improvement between the groups were less than suggested, as seen in the MCID levels for the PI and ODI, the substantial difference in global assessment between the groups strongly suggest an improved outcome with TLIF. The concept of the MCID is controversial, and there is no consensus on either the appropriate levels or the general usefulness of the concept.<xref rid="JR1400159-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

</p><p>The results in our study are somewhat in contrast to the randomized studies by Fritzell et al and by Ekman et al showing a similar outcome between PLF and PLIF.<xref rid="JR1400159-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="JR1400159-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, our study is also in contrast to the findings of H&#x000f8;y et al (i.e., no difference in the outcome between TLIF and instrumented PLF). An obvious possible explanation for this difference is the fact that our control group had uninstrumented PLF.<xref rid="JR1400159-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> On the other hand, Videbaek et al concluded that circumferentially fused patients had a significantly improved outcome compared with those treated by means of PLF.<xref rid="JR1400159-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In contrast to other reports on interbody fusion using interbody cages, we used an interbody spacer made of porous tantalum with a low modulus of elasticity minimizing stress shielding and with the possibility of bony ingrowth through the implant,<xref rid="JR1400159-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> thus increasing the total possible interbody fusion surface, as compared with other devices. Whether this has affected fusion rate and ultimately clinical outcome is difficult to ascertain. Several clinical studies of TLIF have reported high fusion rates and good clinical outcomes, and with a lower rate of complications than the PLIF procedure.<xref rid="JR1400159-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="JR1400159-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p><p>Complications and fusion rates for TLIF have recently been described in a meta-analysis by Wu et al,<xref rid="JR1400159-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showing a fusion rate from 16 studies of 91% and a complication rate of 12.6%. Our fusion rate in PLF is typical of what is reported in the literature.<xref rid="JR1400159-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>In our study, we found four complications (6%) in the TLIF group related to the procedure, all with radicular pain, one of which needed reoperation. The rest recovered spontaneously from their leg pain. In the PLF group, there were only complications unrelated to the procedure. Cutting of the L5 nerve root had no consequence, probably because of multiple innervations of the leg muscles.</p><p>The randomization resulted in a skewed distribution of number of levels fused in the TLIF compared with the PLF group. This was an unfortunate event of the random allocation of patients. The effect on the outcome cannot be ascertained; on one hand, the more levels fused in the TLIF group may reflect a more severe disorder, but on the other hand, more levels fused may in fact increase the chances of a good outcome. Overall, it seems more likely that the fact that more levels were fused reflects a more severe disorder in the TLIF group, not invalidating the conclusion that TLIF seems to be a more efficient fusion technique in the degenerative spine.</p><p>Noninstrumented PLF was used as a control group because several studies have shown a similar outcome for PLFs with and without instrumentation, even at long-term follow-up.<xref rid="JR1400159-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="JR1400159-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> One can argue that the worse outcome with PLF was an effect of a much higher reoperation rate because of pseudarthrosis: 17.9% versus 0% in PLF and TLIF, respectively. This difference in the reoperation rate because of pseudarthrosis is in contrast to the fact that formal analysis of fusion rate, performed by an experienced spinal surgeon not involved with the treatment, showed no significant difference in fusion rate. However, one must be aware of the well-known difficulties to assess fusion based on standard radiographs,<xref rid="JR1400159-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as in the present study. Furthermore, there is contradicting data in trials regarding the clinical benefits of higher fusion rates. Some authors have found that despite higher fusion rates, there is no corresponding increase in the clinical outcome,<xref rid="JR1400159-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
