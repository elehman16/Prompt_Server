These positive effects can be maintained well if the exercise training is continued at home after initial intensive PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, in severe COPD patients, PR may be difficult to perform, and effects may be less maintainable at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for additive therapies enhancing the effectiveness of PR, especially in patients with severe COPD.</p><p>We recently showed that the addition of 3-month nocturnal noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation program improves the outcomes of PR in severe COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Three other studies have also investigated noninvasive ventilation in combination with PR, but assessed short-term effects only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A few studies showed conflicting results of long-term effects of NIPPV in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, these studies did not add NIPPV to PR and ventilator settings used were probably too low to provide beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The present study explores whether the initial positive effects of 3-month NIPPV in addition to PR, with the use of sufficient ventilator settings, can be maintained over 2-year home-based follow-up in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Outcome parameters were HRQoL, mood state, dyspnea scores, gas exchange, functional status, pulmonary function, and exacerbation frequency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with COPD GOLD stage III or IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/forced vital capacity &#x0003c; 70% and FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003c; 50% predicted), aged between 40 and 76 years, in stable clinical condition (no exacerbation in the four weeks prior to study participation together with a pH&#x0003e;7.35); and with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (an arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003e; 6.0 kPa at rest while breathing room air) were included. Exclusion criteria were: cardiac or neuromuscular diseases limiting exercise tolerance; previous exposure to a pulmonary rehabilitation program during the previous 18 months or previous exposure to chronic NIPPV ever; or an apnea/hypopnea index &#x02265; 10/hour. An overnight polygraphy (Embletta pds, Medcare Automation BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was performed in all patients with a body mass index &#x02265; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and in patients who snored or had complaints of disrupted sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, or morning headache. The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen and was registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov (ID NCT00135538). All participants gave written informed consent to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The study design was randomized controlled with parallel-groups. Patients were assigned to nocturnal NIPPV in addition to rehabilitation (NIPPV + PR) or to rehabilitation alone (PR).

In the current manuscript results of the home-based period are presented; results of the multidisciplinary in-hospital program have been reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The home-based program consisted of physiotherapy at a community practice 1-2 times a week during the whole study period, with or without home NIPPV. Most patients visited the physiotherapist two times a week. A few patients (both from the NIPPV + PR group and the PR group) visited the physiotherapist once a week because the distance to travel to the physiotherapy practice was too long. All participating physiotherapists in the study were members of the Northern COPD physiotherapists group, which means that the physiotherapists were regularly taught in COPD exercise programs, and work in a well-equipped environment for COPD patients.</p><p>Each session consisted of 30-minute periods of cycling exercises, walking, and inspiratory muscle training each. The cycling protocol consisted of intervals of one minute loaded cycling (aimed at 140% of a patient's initial peak work rate on cycle ergometry), and one minute unloaded cycling, during 30 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inspiratory muscle training was performed on an inspiratory threshold device at an interval basis (two minutes of loaded breathing, followed by one minute rest), starting with the threshold resistance on 30% of baseline maximal inspiratory pressure (P<sub>I</sub>max), increasing the resistance with 5-10% per session until 70% P<sub>I</sub>max was reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In patients with low fat free mass, strength training was added. Patients were also instructed to stay as active as possible at home, they were stimulated to walk at least each day and to train with their inspiratory device. All sessions were noted in a diary in order to monitor the progress and attendances to the program. Furthermore, there was regular contact with the physiotherapists participating in this study. If patients did not show up without a good reason for a longer period they were regarded as drop-outs (3 patients in the PR group and 1 patient in the NIPPV + PR group). Oxygen was used during training to maintain arterial oxygen saturation &#x0003e;90%.</p></sec><sec><title>NIPPV</title><p>In the NIPPV + PR group, patients were instituted on nocturnal bilevel NIPPV. Noninvasive ventilation was supplied through a pressure cycled ventilator, applying both inspiratory and expiratory pressure (BiPAP; Synchrony, Respironics, INC., Murrysville, PA, USA). A nasal or full face mask (Mirage mask, ResMed Ltd, UK) of the proper size was used. The ventilator was set in a spontaneous/timed mode (S/T), with a backup frequency. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was increased up to maximal tolerated pressure and titrated towards an optimal correction of nocturnal arterial blood gases (PaCO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;6.0 kPa and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003e;8.0 kPa). Effectiveness of NIPPV was initially monitored by means of arterial blood gas measurements during the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], during the home based period NIPPV effectiveness was monitored by means of transcutaneous O<sub>2</sub>-saturation and PCO<sub>2</sub>tc measurements performed with the TOSCA<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Type TOSCA<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>500, Linde Medical Sensors AG, Basel, Switzerland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Ventilator compliance was determined from the ventilator counter readings. A specialized nurse from our department of home mechanical ventilation supervised the home mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcome measures of the home-based period were performed just before the start of this period (after 3 months in-hospital rehabilitation), and then after 6, 12, 18, and after 24 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The primary outcome was predefined to be HRQoL, assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additionally, HRQoL was measured with the Maugeri Respiratory Failure questionnaire (MRF-28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire (SRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The rehabilitation group had an average decline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>of 83 ml/yr, while in the NIPPV + PR group this was 17 ml/yr. Except for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and, in some studies, the use of inhaled corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], no interventions have been shown to slow down FEV<sub>1 </sub>decline in COPD. Notably, effects found with smoking cessation and inhaled corticosteroids were smaller compared to the difference found in our study of 66 ml/year, which is a large effect in these severe COPD patients. We speculate that NIPPV stabilizes FEV<sub>1 </sub>either by volume expansion and/or a decrease in airflow obstruction. We were unable to show volume expansion, as we did not show significant changes in vital capacity, lung volumes or hyperinflation. However, lung volumes were measured until 12 months, so that volume expansion could still have occurred during the last year. Independently from changes in lung volumes, FEV<sub>1 </sub>stabilization is probably caused by a decrease in airflow obstruction. We speculate that a reduction in hypercapnia achieved with NIPPV reduces salt and water retention thereby reducing air wall edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although speculative, reduced air wall edema might also exhibit a positive effect on airway wall remodeling by reducing inflammation when muscle fibers become less overstretched. An increase of FEV<sub>1 </sub>at short-term has been previously reported in studies using high inflation pressures with significant reductions in hypercapnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The high pressures might be of essential importance to improve of lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>This is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate that NIPPV is effective in improving daytime arterial blood gases at the longer term. This requires that effective ventilation during the night was achieved. Although it is obvious that effective ventilation is the first condition that should be met with NIPPV, it appears that in most NIPPV studies rather low positive pressure were used, so that outcomes have often been difficult to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We believe that close monitoring during the night is essential in improving gas exchange and that higher pressures are important to achieve good compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and effective ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. High compliance as we achieved is essential. This all will have contributed to the positive clinical effects we found.</p><p>Exercise tolerance remained stable in the NIPPV + PR group, while it deteriorated in the PR group. A gradual loss of exercise tolerance at long term has been shown before in moderate to severe COPD patients, despite a out-of-hospital maintenance rehabilitation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Probably, positive effects of NIPPV on arterial blood gases give patients a more favorable condition to train and thus prevent deterioration in their physical condition, thus stressing the importance of additional therapies in COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure at long term.</p><p>Although these outcomes are promising, we have to notify that the results of our primary outcome, HRQoL, showed uncertain results, with the primary endpoint, CRQ, not showing any improvement. However, in hindsight, we have debated whether the CRQ is the optimal instrument to assess HRQoL in patients with chronic respiratory failure. By contrast, the MRF-28 and SRI were especially developed for patients with chronic respiratory failure improved, and are therefore probably more responsive in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed improvements in dyspnea scores and depression scores, both being an important determinant of HRQoL.</p><p>Chronic long-term NIPPV is a costly intervention. In a next study it would be interesting to add a true costs-benefit-analysis, as this may play a role in the further implication of NIPPV in chronic COPD patients. We did not find a difference between groups in overall exacerbation frequency, hospitalization rate for a COPD exacerbation or the number of hospitalization days. However in our cohort exacerbations did not occur frequently and the majority of the exacerbations occurred in a minority of the patients, so that large inter-individual differences occurred and data were not normally distributed.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. We did not use sham-ventilation in our control group, hence patients and investigators were not blinded. Sham-ventilation is difficult to implement at home during the long study period. Secondly, only 72 patients were included while according to the power calculation 40 patients per group were needed to find a 10-point change in CRQ total score. Due to the difficult recruitment and financial constraints we were unable to further extend the inclusion period. This may have influenced our results due to a type-II error for false negative outcomes, such as might have occurred with the CRQ. This does not, however, affect the observed significant improvements in our study. Finally, our study was not powered to find a difference in survival. While survival benefit of noninvasive ventilation has been shown one controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], clear evidence of improved survival is still lacking and should be investigated in larger studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present study is the first RCT to show that, with long-term, 2-year NIPPV in addition to PR as compared to PR alone, positive effects can be maintained in HRQoL and gas exchange, while additional effects can be achieved in functional status (exercise tolerance), mood state, dyspnea scores, and FEV<sub>1 </sub>in severe COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Although larger long-term studies have to confirm our results and give additional evidence on survival benefit and cost-effectiveness, with the present study evidence is provided for a rational use of NIPPV as an additional intervention next to pulmonary rehabilitation in severe COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ventilatory support and the use of sufficiently high inspiratory pressures are probably crucial in obtaining these positive effects. This study shows that interventions that need a long period to reach their maximal effect like NIPPV should be studied over a long time scale, especially in slowly progressive diseases like COPD. Beneficial effects may require much time to develop fully and can therefore easily be underestimated.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AHI: Apnea/Hypopnea Index; BMI: Body Mass Index; CI: Confidence Interval; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; CRQ: Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire; EPAP: Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure; FEV<sub>1</sub>: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second; GARS: Groningen Activity and Restriction Scale; GOLD: Global Initiative of Lung Disease; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>: bicarbonate; HRQoL: Health Related Quality of Life; IPAP: Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure; kPa: kilo pascal; MRC: Medical Research Council; MRF-28: Maugeri Respiratory Failure questionnaire; 6MWD: 6-minute walking distance; NIPPV: Noninvasive Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation; PaO<sub>2</sub>: partial arterial oxygen pressure; PaCO<sub>2</sub>: partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure; P<sub>I</sub>max: maximal inspiratory pressure; PR: Pulmonary Rehabilitation; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; RV: Residual Volume; SRI: Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire; TLC: Total Lung Capacity; VC: Vital Capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr. Duiverman, Dr. Wempe, Ms. Bladder, Dr. Zijlstra, and Dr. Kerstjens have no competing interests.
