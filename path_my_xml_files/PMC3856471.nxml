The adaptive immune response provides the immune system with the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens and to mount a stronger response each time a pathogen is encountered. Adaptive immunity is triggered in humans when a pathogen invades the innate immune system and generates a threshold level of antigen. The adaptive immune response has been exploited by modern medicine through the use of vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. By using live (attenuated) or inactivated pathogens or part of pathogens, vaccines trigger an immune response and development of vaccine-specific antibodies. The measurement of this response is frequently used as a way to measure the immunomodulatory effect of certain drug and dietary interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It is a validated model to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> functional capacity of the human immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Vaccines used in clinical trials to measure antibody response have included tetanus and influenza vaccines.</p><p>Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease that causes painful tightening of the muscles, produced by an exotoxin (protein) secreted by the bacterium <italic>Clostridium tetani</italic>. <italic>C. tetani</italic> produces 2 exotoxins: tetanolysin and tetanospasmin. The latter is a neurotoxin and produces the clinical manifestations of the disease. Tetanus toxoid consists of formaldehyde-treated toxin (protein), which is a single antigen. Tetanus toxoid is a highly effective antigen, and a completed primary series generally induces protective levels of serum antitoxin that persists for 10 or more years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In a trial of 26 adults given a booster dose of tetanus toxoid, 81% of the subjects demonstrated a 2-fold or greater rise in serum antitoxin antibody levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The antigenic response to tetanus toxin is approximately 80% immunoglobulin G (IgG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. A 4-fold increase in IgG levels is expected when comparing postvaccination to prevaccination results for previously unvaccinated individuals. For previously vaccinated individuals receiving a booster inoculation, the rise in IgG levels may be less than 4-fold.</p><p>Influenza is a respiratory tract infection caused by 3 types of RNA viruses: types A, B, and C. Each consists of 8 negative single-strand RNA segments encoding 11 proteins. The major surface glycoproteins of the virus are hemagglutinin (HA) and, to a lesser extent, neuraminidase. The antigenic drift of the HA protein results in the development of novel viral strains and a requirement for annual vaccination to keep up with the changes. The influenza vaccine contains 3 inactivated influenza viruses: one A (H3N2) virus, one regular seasonal A (H1N1) virus (in 2010 when this study took place this was replaced by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus), and one B virus. The vaccine produces antibody responses to both HA and neuraminidase. There is a rapid and robust influenza-specific response by antibody-secreting plasma cells that begins as early as 2 to 6 days after vaccination, peaks after 2 weeks, and then wanes over the next 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Influenza-specific antibodies are predominately IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum and IgA in oral fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p>Arabinogalactans are high-molecular-weight, highly branched, water-soluble polysaccharides that contain units of D-galactose and L-arabinose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Dietary intake of arabinoglactans comes from plant food sources such as carrots, radishes, tomatoes, pears, and wheat. Gum arabic, a commonly used food additive, is composed of highly branched arabinogalactan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The mean estimated intake of arabinogalactan from the diet is approximately 10.474 g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The most common commercial source of arabinogalactans is from the wood of the larch tree (<italic>Larix</italic> spp.). Larch arabinogalactan consists of galactose and arabinose in a 6:1 ratio. It is a long, densely branched nonstarch polysaccharide with a galactan backbone with side chains of galactose and arabinose.</p><p>An <italic>ex vivo</italic> study with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells found that larch arabinogalactan stimulated natural killer cell activity through a possible increase in interferon-gamma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. A study with dogs demonstrated increased numbers of circulating white blood cell counts (primarily neutrophils and eosinophils) following oral administration of larch arabinoglactan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the immunomodulating effects of 4 different preparations of echinacea, a proprietary larch arabinogalactan (1.5 g/day), and a combination of larch arabinogalactan and one of the echinacea preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The study included 48 adult women (22&#x02013;51 years old) who were divided into 6 groups of 8 women. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a statistically significant increase in complement properdin in 2 of the echinacea groups and the group taking the larch arabinoglactan and echinacea combination. There was no significant increase in the group taking the larch arabinogalacton alone.</p><p>The proprietary arabinogalactan extract ResistAid (Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) was previously tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot study to determine immunomodulatory activity following vaccination against <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This 72-day study included 45 healthy adult subjects who had not previously received the vaccine. The primary end points were 7 different pneumococcal IgG antibodies (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F). The secondary objective was to determine whether the ResistAid product (4.5 g/day) would stimulate other arms of the immune system to which there was no direct antigenic stimulus. Secondary endpoints included salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA), white blood cell counts, complement (C3 and C4), and inflammatory cytokine levels. Subjects were randomized using a block design. In response to the vaccine, pneumococcal IgG plasma levels increased. The arabinogalactan group demonstrated a greater IgG antibody (Ab) response than the placebo group in two Ab subtypes (18C and 23F) at both day 51 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, respectively) and day 72 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.041). Ab subtypes 18C and 23F also demonstrated change scores from baseline in favor of the arabinogalactan group at day 51 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.033 and 0.001) and day 72 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.012 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Change scores from baseline and mean values were greater in the arabinogalactan group than placebo for most time points in Ab subtypes 4, 6B, 9V, and 19F, but this was not significant. There was no effect from the vaccine or arabinogalactan on salivary IgA, white blood cell count, inflammatory cytokines, or complement. The proprietary larch arabinogalactan used in this study may have a selective immunomodulatory effect on acquired or adaptive immunity shown as an increase in antibodies without clinically significant changes to total white blood cells, cytokines, or complement. It is possible that rather than acting as a general immunostimulant, arabinogalactan can act in a specific manner.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the mechanism of this specific immunomodulation includes associated activation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue as the long-chain-specific arabinogalactan passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Presentation of polysaccharides to immune effector cells may resemble the capsular antigens of some potentially pathogenic encapsulated bacteria and the chronic low level stimulation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue may prepare the body for similar presence of comparable pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Chronic low-level exposure to arabinogalactan in this manner may induce an immunomodulatory and immunostimlatory priming effect, allowing for faster response time of the immune system when a pathogenic antigen presents.</p><p>The current human clinical study was designed to test the hypothesis that the ingestion of ResistAid, a proprietary arabinogalactan extracted from larch (<italic>Larix laricina</italic>), would selectively enhance the antibody response to the tetanus and influenza vaccines in a dose-related manner compared to placebo. The selected doses were 1.5 and 4.5 g, both of which had demonstrated effects in previous clinical studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Sample</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].

ResistAid is a fine, dry, light brown powder with a neutral taste that dissolves quickly in water or juice. The larch arabinogalactan used in the ResistAid product has been designated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].

The vaccine formulation for the 2009&#x02013;2010 season contains 3 strains of the influenza virus: the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus, the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus, and the B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. The 3 strains for the new influenza vaccine formulation were confirmed by the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in February 2009 and correspond with recommendations made by the World Health Organization, also in February [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Influenza vaccine is formulated each year to match the strains predicted to circulate during the upcoming season. This formulation for the 2009&#x02013;2010 influenza season introduced a new B strain. The two A strains were unchanged from the 2008&#x02013;2009 season formulation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Randomization and Dosing</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups in blocks of 5 with 10 subjects randomized per block.

In the 1.5 g/day group there were 7 reported AEs: URI (3 reports), food poisoning, gastroenteritis, nausea, and headache. In the 4.5 g/day group there was one report of dizziness and no URIs reported. None of the adverse events in any group were attributed to the study product.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s14"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study employed a model antigenic stimulation using a vaccine-specific serum antibody production to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of proprietary larch arabinogalactan product (ResistAid) in a healthy adult population. The IgM antibodies are the acute antibodies that provide short-term response to the antigen (in this case the vaccine). It is expected that they will rise and fall in a relatively short period of time (1 to 4 weeks). It is the IgG antibodies that provide the long-term protection and are a more significant immune marker. These tend to rise more slowly than the IgM antibodies but continue to rise for a longer period of time.</p><p>The study employed 2 different doses of arabinogalactan, 1.5 and 4.5 g/day, with the hypothesis that there would be a dose&#x02013;response effect. We had previously observed an increase in IgG in response to the pneumococcal vaccine with the dose of 4.5 g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. A previous clinical study that measured levels of complement properdin reported that a dose of 1.5 g possibly augmented an effect due to echinacea species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In the present study, the 1.5 g/day dose was found to significantly increase tetanus IgG antibody response at day 60 compared to placebo (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008). This is a confirmation that the ResistAid product confers a benefit in increasing the antibody response to a standard antigenic challenge. The ResistAid 4.5 g/day group showed statistically significant increases from baseline for this same vaccine and continued to show elevations in IgG levels at day 60 even when both the placebo and 1.5 g/day groups had already peaked, but this group did not show a statistically significant difference compared to the placebo group.</p><p>There were no significant differences between either ResistAid dose and placebo in the influenza antibodies. Both IgM and IgG were tested for influenza A and influenza B. Based on these results and on the prior results of the pneumococcal vaccine study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], it appears that the ResistAid product confers a benefit in preparing the body to deal with bacterial antigens but perhaps not with viral antigens. As one considers other purported mechanisms of action in the GI tract for the product, the above may become clearer. The product may stimulate the Peyer's patches in the gut as it traverses the length of the intestines. The polysaccharide may have a structure similar to that of these potentially pathogenic bacteria and therefore provide a low level of stimulation, which keeps an array of antibodies ready in case the actual antigen appears. If the structure of the polysaccharide is similar to that of bacteria, then it may not be similar to the structure of viruses and therefore may not confer the same benefit in that case. Another plausible explanation may be the noted prebiotic activity for larch arabinogalactan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p>Prebiotics are noted to have immunomodulating activity, in part by increasing lactic acid bacteria and increasing production of short-chain fatty acids in the GI tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A combination of short-chain galactooligosaccharides and long-chain fructooligosaccharides was shown to influence immune response to an influenza vaccine in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Supplementation with the prebiotic mix increased vaccine-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response when given prior to the primary vaccination. Supplementation after day 8 did not affect the DTH response. The study found a positive correlation between percentages of cecal lactobacilli at day 9 and DTH responses. A placebo-controlled study also found an effect on regulatory T-cells following influenza vaccine in mice supplemented with a prebiotic combination consisting of short-chain galactooligosaccharides, long-chain fructooligosaccharides, and pectin hydrolysate-derived acidic oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The study found that the prebiotic mixture depleted CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-cells, which resulted in enhanced Th1 vaccine responsiveness.</p><p>However, the results in animal studies have not been duplicated thus far in human studies examining the immunomodulating effect of prebiotics following vaccination. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, healthy elderly adults (&#x02265;70 years old) were randomized to receive 6 g/day of a prebiotic fructooligosaccharide mixture 70% raftilose and 30% raftiline or placebo for 28 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. At week 2 of the study, all subjects were vaccinated with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. Though a slight increase in influenza A antibodies (saliva secretory IgA) was observed, there was no effect on serum influenza A and B and pneumococcal IgG or IgM levels in the prebiotic group compared to placebo.</p><p>Variables that affect the immune response to vaccines include age, gender, race, body mass index, and genetic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. One of the goals of this study was to determine the effect of the intervention on a relatively broad population&#x02014;healthy adults from age 18 to 60 years old. The between-subject variability in response to vaccination is normally quite high and using a larger study population in future studies may clarify the clinical indications we have observed so far. In addition, because gender and age differences may affect immunity, these potentially confounding variables could be examined in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s15"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Daily ResistAid supplementation at a dose of 1.5 g/day for 30 days before the administration of the tetanus vaccine significantly increased the tetanus IgG antibody response compared to placebo. The 4.5 g/day dose of ResistAid also increased the IgG antibody response to the tetanus vaccine and this increase continued to rise by day 60; however, these values did not reach statistical significance. Neither group demonstrated any significant elevations in IgM or IgG antibody response to the influenza vaccine. The results suggest that ResistAid induces an elevated response to bacterial antigens (in the form of vaccine), but not viral antigens.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Twigg</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Humoral immune defense (antibodies): recent advances</article-title><source>Proc Am Thoracic Soc</source><year>2005</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>417</fpage><lpage>421</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albers</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Antoine</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourdet-Sicard</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Calder</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gleeson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lesourd</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Samartin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanderson</surname><given-names>IR</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Loo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vas Dias</surname><given-names>FW</given-names></name><name><surname>Watzl</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Markerstomeasure immunomodulationinhuman nutrition intervention studies</article-title><source>Br J Nutr</source><year>2005</year><volume>94</volume><fpage>452</fpage><lpage>481</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16176618</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cummings</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Antoine</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Azpiroz</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourdet-Sicard</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Brandtzaeg</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Calder</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Guarner</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Isolauri</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Pannemans</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shortt</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuijtelaars</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Watzl</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>PASSCLAIM&#x02014;gut health and immunity</article-title><source>Eur J Clin Nutr</source><year>2004</year><volume>43</volume><issue>suppl 2</issue><fpage>118</fpage><lpage>173</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis: recommendations for vaccine use and other preventive measures.
