For example, the WHO's World Alliance for Patient Safety cites mobilisation and empowerment of patients as one of six action areas that will be taken forward in its &#x02018;Patients for Patient Safety&#x02019; programme.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite international emphasis and repeated calls for greater patient involvement,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Wachter referred to the lack of progress in this area as a &#x02018;troubling gap&#x02019;, when rating the achievements of healthcare in promoting safety.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Perhaps even more troubling is the dearth of research evidence on how best to involve patients and whether such involvement leads to improvements in safety. The evidence that does exist indicates that patients are willing and able to participate in error prevention strategies<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> that have the potential to improve safety.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> However, there can be a reluctance to challenge staff and provide negative feedback that might directly impact on the quality of their care,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and there is a risk of shifting responsibility for safety onto patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Patient involvement comes in a variety of forms, from patient education about risk through to involvement in monitoring the safety practices of healthcare professionals. The potential for such interventions to improve communication and patient experience as well as save money and improve outcomes is great,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and early findings suggest that such outcomes are feasible.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, research in this field is lacking, with systematic reviews concluding that there is limited and poor quality evidence that patient involvement has any benefits for patient safety.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>Previous work<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> has described the development of tools, based on Reason's model of organisational safety,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> that allow patients to provide feedback on the safety of their care environment to inform local and organisational changes. One tool, patient measure of safety (PMOS), asks patients to report on those factors that have been identified in the literature<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and by patients<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as contributing to patient safety. These include communication and teamwork, roles and responsibility, and ward environment. The second tool, patient incident reporting tool (PIRT)<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> asks patients to report on patient safety incidents they have experienced or witnessed as well as any positive experiences. Together, information from these two tools is assimilated and feedback provided to ward teams, who are asked to convene as a multidisciplinary group to consider the feedback and to make and implement action plans based on this information. The feasibility of this intervention known as Patient Reporting and Action for a Safe Environment (PRASE) has been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Here, we evaluate the costs and benefits of the PRASE intervention and its effect on measures of patient safety when implemented on hospital wards. This study represents the first randomised control trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention to improve patient safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This evaluation employed a multicentre, cluster, waitlist, RCT design to assess the efficacy of the PRASE intervention in achieving patient safety improvements over a 12-month period. The published protocol for the trial is available elsewhere.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was conducted in 33 hospital wards, across five hospitals (three National Health Service (NHS) Trusts) in the UK. At the small district hospital, all adult non-intensive wards were recruited (N=9). At the medium-sized teaching hospital Trust, the chief nurse recruited 10 adult wards to the study. Within the large Trust, wards (N=14) were asked to volunteer to take part. An average of 25 patients meeting the following eligibility criteria within each ward were recruited at three different time points: &#x02265;aged 16, able to give informed consent and minimum period of 4&#x02005;hours on the ward before questionnaire administered. Patients were excluded if they were too ill or distressed to take part and had already been in the study within the previous month or were non-English or non-Mirpuri-speaking patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The PRASE intervention uses two theoretically informed and validated tools to collect patient feedback about the safety of care as a means of achieving patient-centred service improvement (see logic model in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>). The first tool, PMOS, is a 44-item questionnaire asking patients to report on a range of upstream factors that contribute to safety, for example, communication and teamwork, physical environment, staff roles and responsibilities.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The second, PIRT, asks patients to report on any safety concerns they have experienced during their inpatient stay and provide detail about what happened, why they felt it happened, what could be done to prevent it happening again, and the severity and preventability of the concern from their (non-clinical) perspective.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005570.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjqs-2016-005570supp001.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>This patient feedback is then collated and presented to each ward as part of a multidisciplinary meeting during which ward staff are supported to agree a set of ward-specific actions to address areas of patient concern. The philosophy of this intervention is that it is an iterative process with a cycle of measurement, feedback and change lasting for a period of 6&#x02005;months. Ward staff engaged in two cycles during the 12-month intervention period. Following the feasibility study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> changes were made to the intervention to support effective implementation. The research team facilitated action planning meetings using an action planning proforma to capture the ward improvement plans. We also launched the project in Trusts at a start-up meeting and hosted a meeting after the first set of action planning meetings had been completed and another at the end of the project. Senior managers were invited to attend these meetings and agreed to support the wards in delivering change.</p><p>Researchers were equally visible on both the control and intervention wards, as data were collected for the purposes of feedback as part of the intervention and outcome measurement. Control wards received their PRASE feedback in a single report at the end of the 12&#x02005;months follow-up period accompanied by a 1-hour training session on how to interpret and use this feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>Assessment of fidelity followed a previously published framework<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and was informed by the intervention's logic model. We conducted a detailed process evaluation to understand how the intervention was received and used by each of the 17 intervention wards (submitted for publication). Adherence was assessed in relation to eight components of the intervention listed below; each was rated independently by three members of the research team and, through discussion, consensus was achieved. These scores were based on data collected by senior researchers (LS, JKO and CM) who (1) observed and recorded attendance at all meetings, (2) obtained copies of all action plans developed by ward teams and (3) conducted a telephone follow-up with the nominated PRASE lead for each ward and recorded the extent to which each action plan was reported to have been implemented. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">Box 1</xref> shows the scoring of the fidelity of implementation of each of the eight intervention components.

Thus, overall fidelity scores ranged from 0 (non-adherence with all components) to 8 (adherence to all eight components) for each ward.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Each hospital attended a start-up meeting at which the study was introduced. Baseline data collection then proceeded on all wards in participating hospitals after which the wards were then randomised to the two groups. Follow-up data collection occurred at 6 and 12&#x02005;months post randomisation on all wards.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Patient safety thermometer</title><p>The patient safety thermometer (PST) is a ward-level routinely collected compulsory measure of patient harm that was introduced in the NHS in 2012 shortly prior to the start of this trial. Information is collected on new and existing cases of four types of possible &#x02018;harm&#x02019; (pressure ulcers, venous thromboembolism, catheter- associated urinary tract infections and falls) from all patients on a ward on a single day each month. The key outcome for analysis was harm-free care (HFC) at the ward level that can range between 0% and 100%; higher scores indicate greater HFC (so are positive). A baseline was calculated using the average of the 3&#x02005;months prior to randomisation; for the 6-month and 12-month time points, the month during the collection of patient feedback and the preceding and following months were averaged. Following experience with the measure during the trial, a summary from the PST focusing on new harms only was added as a key outcome. This excluded historical harms occurring prior to admission of the patient to the specific ward and was therefore deemed a more sensitive measure of the efficacy of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Patient measure of safety</title><p>The 44-item PMOS questionnaire was completed by patients as part of the intervention and was also used as an outcome measure. Patients were given the choice of completing the questionnaire themselves via a tablet computer or providing responses verbally, which the researcher then input. Forty-three items were scored on Likert scales from 1 to 5; one additional item also required a qualitative response. An overall PMOS score was calculated for those responding to at least 80% of items by averaging over item scores; overall scores were means that ranged from 1 to 5, with high scores indicating more positive response.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Three secondary outcome measures were also measured. First, participants were asked three Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) questions, which are measured within the NHS Inpatient Survey<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> (example question: &#x0201c;Were you involved as much as you wanted to be in decisions about your care and treatment?&#x0201d;). Second, participants were asked to complete the &#x02018;NHS Friends and Family Test&#x02019; question:<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> &#x0201c;How likely are you to recommend this ward to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?&#x0201d;. Both of these measures are routinely collected within the NHS as patient-reported indicators of quality of care. Third, we measured staff perceptions of safety culture using the four outcome questions from the Hospital Survey of Patient Safety.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> For further details of secondary outcome measures collected, see the published protocol.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcome data collection</title><p>PMOS data were collected by research nurses during three periods over 12&#x02005;months (at baseline, and 6 and 12&#x02005;months post randomisation). Informed consent was taken prior to data collection. Research nurses visited each ward on a daily basis until a minimum of 20 patients were recruited. Routinely available PST data were extracted via the Health and Social Care Information Centre website.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Data for the purposes of the assessment of fidelity (see above) were collected by LS, CM and JKO and were coded by LS, GA and RL.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study was powered to detect a small-to-medium difference (effect size (ES) =0.3) between the allocated groups with respect to the PMOS score. A small-to-medium ES seemed a reasonable assumption as each ward would be focusing on developing and implementing their own action plans, tailored using their initial feedback. The intervention was therefore specific to individual wards and was not expected to impact on all areas measured by the PMOS. Any improvement on the PMOS overall score, which summates across various domains, was therefore likely to be small. In order to achieve 80% power (with alpha=0.05) with an average cluster size of 25 patients and assumed intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, 32 wards were required. This estimate of ICC seemed reasonable for a trial in secondary care with a patient-reported outcome.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The PST was newly introduced shortly prior to the start of the trial, and the way in which the data would be formatted (eg, individual data, ward level) for public availability was unclear at the time.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Wards were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group on an equal basis by York Trials Unit. Minimisation was used to balance groups with respect to ward type (medical or surgical), age (low, middle or high based on tertiles), male/female/mixed sex wards and ward size (low, middle or high based on tertiles). It was not possible to blind wards to group allocation, but research nurses who collected data were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analysis was conducted in Stata V.13 using the principles of &#x02018;intention-to-treat&#x02019;, meaning that wards (and associated patients) were analysed according to their randomised trial arm regardless of intervention implementation or fidelity. Minimisation factors and clustering were accounted for where required; all ES s are Cohen's d.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Statistical significance was assessed at the two-sided 5% level. Analyses for PST and Hospital Survey of Patient Safety were conducted at the ward level; all other outcomes were available and analysed at the patient level.</p><p>The primary analysis on the PST outcome used a ward-level linear regression model with weighting to assess differences between the allocated groups in the percentage of HFC at 12&#x02005;months. Adjustment was made for baseline HFC and minimisation factors. Two sensitivity analyses were preplanned, an unadjusted analysis and the primary model adjusted for ward-level characteristics. Two further post hoc sensitivity analyses were carried out, one repeated the analysis including one ward with partially missing baseline data and the second analysed the data using a repeated measures logistic regression model with random effects for ward. The primary analysis was repeated considering new HFC as was the repeated measures model. A linear mixed model with random effects to account for clustering at the ward level and fixed effects for baseline ward average and minimisation factors were used for analysis of the 12-month PMOS data. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal reliability (alpha &#x0003e;0.7) of the PMOS. Complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis was applied to account for non-adherence.</p><p>Secondary analyses repeated the primary models at 6&#x02005;months. Similar regression models were used to analyse the CQUIN and Hospital Survey of Patient Safety outcomes at the patient and ward level, respectively.</p><p>For the cost-consequences analysis, we estimated resource use related to (1) collection of patient data; (2) action planning meetings; (3) management of the PRASE intervention via start-up, midpoint and closing meetings with senior managers and all teams in a hospital; and (4) actions. Resource use was estimated in terms of the mean value per ward.

However, while patients were willing and able to provide feedback about safety, many ward teams found it difficult to meet to develop action plans and implement change.</p><p>The analyses reveal that there was no evidence of a difference in total HFC or the overall PMOS score between the allocated groups at 6 or 12&#x02005;months. There was also no evidence of a difference in the new HFC score (those harms attributable to participating wards) between the allocated groups at 12&#x02005;months. The difference between the two groups was 1.60% with an ES of 0.51 for this outcome. ESs were higher for differences in harm reduction between the intervention wards that complied with the intervention and matched controls. This suggests the possibility that for those wards that implement the intervention effectively, reductions in patient harm are feasible. It should be noted that the study was not powered for these analyses.</p><p>The main costs associated with the intervention arose from staff time (1) involved in the design and implementation of actions and (2) associated with patient data collection. Future models for the PRASE intervention might use volunteers to collect patient data that would reduce substantially the overall cost of the intervention. Indeed, this is an approach currently being piloted in three acute Trusts in the UK.</p><p>Possible explanations for the trial findings&#x02014;measurement and fidelity&#x02014;are discussed below.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Measurement issues</title><p>Patient safety is universally acknowledged to be difficult to measure,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> particularly when the intervention is upstream with the potential to impact on a wide range of safety and quality outcomes. Our original primary outcome, the PMOS score, was also part of the intervention; therefore, we expected action plans would be focused on improving aspects of this and so we would be most likely to see an effect using this measure. The other primary outcome was the incidence of four patient safety harms on participating wards that was added to assess the impact on patient safety more generally. There were, however, some issues with this measure as high levels of HFC were routinely reported at baseline with a mean score of &#x0003e;90% and for new harms of &#x0003e;95%, meaning that achieving a substantial improvement within the trial was challenging. As with all routine NHS performance metrics, there is also the possibility of reporting bias; however, there was no reason that this would differ systematically between the control and intervention wards.</p><p>The intervention provides staff with feedback on the safety of the care environment, to which they are asked to respond by implementing local changes and making senior management aware of broader issues. This makes it difficult to predict in advance what changes a ward will choose to make and therefore what outcomes it might be appropriate to measure. One ward might focus on noise at night; another might focus on staff roles and responsibilities. It may not be possible to pick up improvement in these areas via the measurement of typical patient safety outcomes, for example, pressure ulcers, falls and venous thromboembolisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Fidelity of intervention delivery</title><p>We collected information on the delivery of the intervention, following published guidance.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The majority of wards met to consider feedback and many action planning groups included different types of staff. However, only three action planning teams included doctors and nine meetings were attended by only two people.</p><p>For each of the outcomes, and particularly new harms, the CACE analysis demonstrated larger differences between the allocated groups as adherence to the intervention improved. This suggests that when adherence is high and the ward is able to produce good quality action plans that are then implemented, safety improvements are more likely to follow. Unfortunately, within the current cohort of 17 intervention wards, only 4 were able to comply at this level, which illustrates the challenge of implementing changes to practice and clinical routines.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>What this study adds to the existing evidence base</title><p>A recent systematic review<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> identified recommendations for which patient safety interventions were strongly encouraged for adoption based on current evidence. Interventions involving patient feedback or other patient involvement strategies did not appear on the list because there are too few rigorous studies of patient involvement in safety to provide a reliable evidence base. In recent years, a number of studies have investigated direct patient engagement in patient safety, for example, patient encouragement of hand hygiene practices.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Systematic reviews of patient engagement strategies have concluded that there is currently &#x0201c;insufficient high-quality evidence informing real-world implementation&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, there is currently no evidence available that addresses the specific question of whether patient feedback on patient safety has an impact on patient safety; therefore, direct comparison of our own work with other similar studies is not possible. However, current and previous studies on the feedback of patient-reported outcomes<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> suggest that patients are willing and able to provide such feedback. What may be more difficult to address is the engagement of staff with this feedback and the use of this feedback by healthcare teams to improve services. We found that staff needed additional support to respond to patient feedback. This finding echoes that of a study of patient experience feedback<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in which feedback of patient experience to staff had little impact unless supported by ward meetings that were facilitated by research staff. In fact, in our trial, staff struggled to implement what seemed like relatively easy changes if they involved the need for support from other departments in the organisation, such as pharmacy or estates. These findings resonate strongly with recommendations of a recent report that evaluated the Health Foundation's Safer Clinical Systems initiative.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study represents the first RCT of the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention to improve patient safety and was conducted across different wards from a range of hospitals. One of the key limitations of this trial was that we did not collect information about the impact of completing a questionnaire about safety on the patients themselves. It is possible that completing such a measure might lead to improvements in patients' knowledge and understanding of safety that could, in turn, lead to a more active role in monitoring safety but could also have the negative effect of inducing anxiety among patients who were previously unaware of the potential for things to go wrong. Our model for change focused on the feedback to staff and changes in their behaviour rather than patient-mediated change. Furthermore, it was not possible for the purpose of the trial to include patients who were unable to speak English or Mirpuri (a language spoken by the local Pakistani population). Thus, other patients were unable to take part. This limitation could be addressed by the translation of the materials into common languages spoken by the hospital population. However, for the purposes of the research this was not possible because we did not have the resources to employ multilingual research staff who would then be able to take consent from patients in the many different languages spoken across our hospital sites.</p><p>Also important to consider are the potential difficulties in the choice of outcome measures for interventions where flexibility in the changes implemented is actually encouraged. In other words, this was not an intervention that targeted falls and so where falls would be the obvious outcome measure. Ward teams involved in PRASE might choose to deliver one or more of a potentially finite number of changes, targeting many different patient safety issues, for example, speeding up the availability of medicines, reducing noise at night, removing clutter from corridors and making information about ward team roles available to patients. Measuring the impact of such changes without knowing in advance what they might be was not possible here. Agreement on how best to capture the impact of such upstream safety interventions is an important aim for researchers in this field.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is insufficient evidence from this cluster RCT to recommend the funding of the PRASE intervention. However, the trial demonstrates that patient reporting and feedback is feasible and acceptable to patients and that, where compliance with the intervention is high, there is potential for it to be effective in reducing patient harm.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Jane O'Hara at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/janekohara">@janekohara</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RL, JKW, IW and GA conceived the project and led the programme of work.
